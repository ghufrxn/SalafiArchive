<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book of Gifts (Kitab Al-Hibat) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Hiba is defined as the transfer of the possession of  property, movable and immovable, from one person to the other willingly and without any  reward. The one who makes this transfer is known as donor (Wahib), and the thing  transferred is known as Mauhubah, and the one who is donated is known as Mauhub lahu  (donee). The other words used in the language of the Shar&#8217;i&#8217;ah are Nihla or &#8216;Atiyya. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The act of Hiba is not complete unless the donor surrenders  the possession of the thing donated. Moreover, the declaration of donation should be in  clear terms without any ambiguity (around them). This act of donation is based on the  following hadith of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him):&#8221; Give presents to one  another for this would increase your mutual love.&#8221; This not only implies the legality  of gifts, but the exhortation to give these to one another. There is perfect agreement  amongst all the jurists that Hiba is valid in Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The act of donation can be made verbally or in writing by  any person capable of making a contract. A gift by a person involved in debt is invalid,  and gift in death illness cannot take effect beyond one-third of the assets of the  deceased after defraying all necessary expenses. The donation can be made to a living  person and not to one who is dead. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Shari&#8217;ah imposes certain restrictions on the property  which is to be donated. In the first place, the property must be in existence at the time  when the gift is given; hence the gift of oil in the sesame or of butter in the milk would  not be valid. The property once given as a gift cannot be revoked except in some  extraordinary circumstances. The father is entitled to get back the donation given by him  from his children if be finds it contrary to the laws and spirit of the Shari&#8217;ah. The  right to revoke a gift is called Raj&#8217;. This act of revocation can be done with the decree  of a competent court. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar b. Khattab (Allah be pleased with him) reported: I    donated a pedigree horse in the path of Allah. Its possesser made it languish. I thought    that he would sell it at a cheap price. I asked Allah&#8217;s Menengsr (may peace be upon him)    about it, whereupon he said: Don&#8217;t buy it and do not get back your charity, for one who    gets back the charity is like a dog who swallows its vomit. This hadith has been narrated    on the authority of Malik b. Anas with the same chain of transmitters but with this    addition:&#8221; Don&#8217;t buy that even if he gives you for one dirham.&#8221;</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Zaid b. Aslam reported on the authority of his father that    &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with him) donated a horse in the path of Allah. He found that it    had languished in the hand of its possessor, and he was a man of meagre resources He    (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) intended to buy it. He came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)    and made a mention of that to him, whereupon he said: Don&#8217;t buy that even if you get it    for a dirham for he who gets back the charity is like a dog which swallows its vomit.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Imran b. Husain reported that the tribe of Thaqif was the ally of Banu &#8216;Uqail. Thaqif took two persons from amongst the Companiobs of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as prisoners. The Campanions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) took one person at Banu Uqail as prisoner, and captured al-&#8216;Adbi (the she-camel of the Holy Prophet) along with him. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to him and he was tied with ropes. He said: Muhammad. He came near him and said: What is the matter with you? Thereupon he (the prisoner) said: Why have you taken me as prisoner and why have you caught hold of one proceeding the pilgrims (the she-camel as she carried the Holy Prophet on her back and walked ahead of the multitude)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: (Yours is a great fault). I (my men) have caught hold of you for the crime of your allies, Banu Thaqif. He (the Holy Prophet) then turned away. He again called him and said: Muhammad, Muhammad, and since Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was very compassionate, and tenderhearted, he returned to him, and said: What is the matter with you? He said: I am a Muslim, whereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Had you said this when you had been the master of yourself, you would have gained every success. He then turned away. He (the prisoner) called him again saying: Muhammad, Muhammad. He came to him and said: What is the matter with you? He said: I am hungry, feed me, and I am thirsty, so provide me with drink. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That is (to satisfy) your want. He was then ransomed for two persons (who had been taken prisoner by Thaqif). He (the narrator) said: A woman of the Ansar had been taken prisoner and also al-Adbi&#8217; was caught. The woman had been tied with ropes. The people were giving rest to their animals before their houses. She escaped one night from the bondage and came to the camels. As she drew near the camels, they fretted and fumed and so she left them until she came to al-, Adbi&#8217;. It did not fret and fume; it was docile She rode upon its back and drove it away and she went off. When they (the enemies of Islam) were warned of this, they went in search of it, but it (the she-camel) exhausted them. She (the woman) took vow for Allah, that in case He would save her through it, she would offer that as a sacrifice. As she reached Medina, the people saw her and they said: Here is al-Adbi, the she-camel of Allah&#8217;s Messanger (may peace be upon him). She (the woman) said that she had taken a vow that if Allah would save her on its back, she would sacrifice it. They (the Prophet&#8217;s Companions) came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and made a mention of that to him, whereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, how ill she rewarded it that she took vow to Allah that if He saves her on its back, she would sacrifice it! There is no fulfilment of the vow in an act of disobedience, nor in an act over which a person has no control. In the version of Ibn Hujr (the words are):&#8221; There is no vow in disobedience to Allah.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 10: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book of Transactions (Kitab  Al-Buyu`) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Honesty in commercial dealings is more strictly enjoined by  Islam than by any other religion. It is because Islam is a religion which regulates and  directs life in all its departments. It is not to be regarded, like the modern man&#8217;s  religion. as a personal, private affair, which has nothing to do with his economic and  political life. It is not merely a body of dogmas or a bundle of rites and rituals; it is  a practical code which governs life in all its spheres. Its laws are as effectively  operative in our commerce and politics as in our domestic life and social relations. Islam  censures political chicanery and economic exploitation as strongly as social excesses and  individual dishonesty. Indeed, a true Islamic society is based upon honesty, justice and  fraternity, and is absolutely intolerant of dishonesty in all its various forms. That is  the reason why perfect honesty in business and truthfulness in trade are much emphasised  by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). It will not be an exaggeration to say that  absolute honesty in business and commerce is really an Islamic concept. The Hindus and  Jews were (and still, are) worshippers of the Mammon. Both of them have been mercenary  nations, notorious for their greed. The pre-Islamic Christians. too, did not possess any  high standard of business morality. It was Prophet Muhammad (may peace be upon him) who,  on the one hand, urged his followers to adopt trade as their profession, and, on the other  band, exhorted them to observe truthfulness and honesty in their business transactions. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam lays the greatest emphasis on Qat Haldl (food earned  through lawful means). The pious among us believe that just as nasty food spolis our  physical health, similarly. food earned through unlawful means spoils our spiritual and  moral health. A man who liver on income derived through illicit means and fraudulent  practices cannot be morally advanced and spiritually elevated. If we try to comprehend the  exact, implications of the term Haram (unlawful) we can form an idea of the high standard  of morality on which Islam wants us to conduct our business. And, if business is conducted  strictly in accordance with the Islamic principles of commerce, there can be absolutely no  scope for any kind of commercial dishonesty varying from the simplest and most glaring  type of business fraud to the most cunning and subtle type of profiteering which is often  masked under a semblance of honesty. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam is most vehement in its condemnation of commercial  dishonesty. It denounced, in the strongest possible terms, all sorts of deceitful dealings  and illegal profits. It has disallowed all transactions not based upon justice and  fairplay The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him), while reprimanding the dishonest  dealer, said:&#8221; Laisa minna man gashshdna&#8221; (Whosoever deceives us is not one of  us). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Imam Ghazali, a Muslim who makes up his mind  to adopt trade as a profession or to set up his own business should first acquire a  thorough understanding of the rules of business transactions codified in the Islamic  Shari&#8217;ah. Without such understanding he will go astray and fail into serious lapses making  his earning unlawful. No people in the world have ever attached so much importance to  lawful trading as did the early Muslims, nor has any other nation evinced such a dread of  unlawful trading as they did. That is why al-Ghazali said stress on a clear understanding  of the rules and laws governing business transactions as a necessary prerequisite to  adopting trade or business as a profession. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Holy Qur&#8217;an has stressed the importance of fairness in  business:&#8221; And, O my people, give full measure and weight justly, and defraud not men  of their things, and act not corruptly in the land making mischief. What remains with  Allah is better for you, if you are believers&#8221; (xi. 85-86). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In these words addressed by Hadrat Shu&#8217;aib to his people,  the Holy Qur&#8217;an enunciates the fundamental principles of commerce as follows </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To give just measure and weight. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Not to withhold from the people the things that are their  due. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Not to commit evil on the earth with the intent of doing  mischief. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To be contented with the profit that is left with us by God  after we have paid other people their due. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We are told in these verses that commerce can flourish  under conditions of peace and security. The people are, therefore, warned not to disturb  the peace of the land so that there is a free and untrammelled trade between different  parts of the world. In commercial relations we are expected to be absolutely just and  honest, liberally giving other people their due. We are not to be guilty of selfish greed  and not to indulge in profiteering; and we are told that the lawful profit which has God&#8217;s  blessings is the one that we are able to make through perfectly honest dealings with  others. The injunctions contained in these Qur&#8217;anic verses and found elsewhere in the Holy  Book close the door of all dishonest and unjust transactions. We should not forget that  justice is a master virtue. If we give others just measure and just weight that  tantamounts to saying that we should be fair and just in our dealings. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A careful study of&#8221; Kitab al-Buyu`&#8221; (the book  pertaining to business transactions) will reveal the fact that the Holy Prophet (may peace  be upon him) based business dealings strictly on truth and justice. He has strongly  disapproved all transactions which involve any kind of injustice or hardship to the buyer  or the seller. He wanted that both, the buyer and the seller, should be truly sympathetic  and considerate towards each other. One should not take undue advantage of the simplicity  or ignorance of the other. The seller should not think that he has unrestricted liberty to  extort as much as possible from the buyer. He has to be just; he should take his own due  and give the buyer what is his. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam, which condemns every kind of injustice and  exploitation in human relations, wants its followers to conduct business in a sublime  spirit of justice tempered with human kindness. The conduct of the seller in a transaction  should be characterised not only by Insaf (justice), but also by Ihsan  (magnanimity).&#8221; God will forgive the sins of a Muslim who absolves a fellow-Muslim  from a sale-contract not liked by the latter,&#8221; says the Holy Prophet (may peace be  upon him). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>All transactions should be based on the fundamental  principle of&#8221; Ta&#8217;auanu ala birri wa&#8217;t-taqwa&#8221; (mutual co-operation for the cause  of goodness or piety). A transaction not based upon this sound principle is not lawful.  Unlawful transactions are motivated by lust for money and an ignoble desire to build up  prestige. Islam strikes at the root of the passion for money and suggests a different  yardstick to measure the prestige of a person. The Holy Qur&#8217;an, on the one hand, condemns  hoarding and the excessive love for wealth, and, on the other, declares virtue and piety  to be the criterion for determining a person&#8217;s worth.&#8221; Inna akramakum `ind-Allahi  atqakum&#8221; (The noblest in the eyes of God is the most pious among you). Thus does  Islam minimise in every possible way the temptation to illegal trade and traffic. Let us  now take note of the forms of business transactions which have been prohibited in Islam.  The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has not only disapproved of certain forms of  business transactions, but has also laid down some basic conditions that should be  fulfilled in every transaction if it is to be lawful. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The following are some of these basic conditions: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Things sold and money offered as their price to be lawfully  acquired. The things sold and the money to be offered as their price should both be  lawfully acquired and clearly specified. This condition demands that the goods sold should  have been lawfully obtained. One has no business to sell goods which one has stolen or  which one has acquired in a fraudulent manner. nor should one purchase anything with the  money which one has accepted as illegal gratification or has aceuired in some other  deceitful way. This condition holds the buyer and the seller responsible for lawful  possession of the goods on the partof one and of the money on the part of other. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Goods not to be sold before obtaining their possession. The  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has warned the Muslims against indulging in forward  transactions which means selling goods before obtaining their possession.&#8221; Whoever  buys cereals shall not tell them until he has obtained their possession,&#8221; says the  Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). According to Ibn &#8216;Abbas, what applies to cereals  also applies to other categories of goods. On another occasion the Holy Prophet (may peace  be upon him) has said:&#8221; Bargain not about that which is not with you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Goods to be bought in the open market. Goods and  commodities for sale should go into the open market, and the seller or his agents must be  aware of the state of the market before proposals are made for the purchase by the buyers.  The seller should not be taken unawares lest the buyers should take undue advantage of his  ignorance of the conditions and prices prevailing in the market. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>No trade and traffic in things, the use of which is  prohibited by Islam. A Muslim can trade in those goods and commodities only the use of  which has been declared to be Halal (lawful). There can be no trade and traffic in things  the use of which is proliibited by Islam. For example, there can be no trade in wine,  swine, dead bodies of animals and idols. A devout Muslim merchant would not even traffic  in thin and transparent stuff for ladies because the use of such stuff by ladies is  unlawful. One cannot sell the carcass of an animal. He can, however, flay its skin which  can be used for making shoes and which can therefore, be sold, but not the flesh of the  dead animal. What is true of the usable skin of animals is also true of the tusks of an  elephant. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Prohibited forms of Business </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Monopoly business. As monopoly means concentration of  supply in one hand, it leads to exploitation of the consumers and the workers, it has,  therefore, been declared unlawful by the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). Gigantic  trusts. cartels and monopolies should not exist in the Islamic society. The  monopoly-dominated economic order betrays lack of harmony between private and social good  and is, thus, a negation of the principle of maximum social advantage which the Islamic  society sets out to achieve. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Speculative business basd on selfish interest. Speculation  means buying something cheap in bulk at a time and selling it dear at another and, thus,  controlling the whole market to achieve personal gains. A close observation will reveal  that speculators are primarily interested in private gains regardless of the larger  interest of the society. These speculators try to create artificial scarcity of goods and  commodities and thereby create an inflationary pressure on the economy. As the poor masses  have to pay for this. Islam has condemned such speculative business. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Interest transactions. All transactions involving interest  are forbidden in Islam. Some people find it hard to submit to the injunction prohibiting  interest, because they think interest and profit earned in trade are similar. Capital  invested in trade brings an excess called profit; invested in banking it brings interest.  Why should one excess be considered lawful and the other unlawful? They fail to take note  of the basic difference between the two. Trade involves risk of loss. Also in its case, it  is not only the capital invested that brings profit which is equally the result of  initiative, enterprise and efficiency of the entrepreneur. Hence its rate cannot be  predetermined and fixed. Moreover, trade is productive. A person reaps a benefit after  undergoing labour and hardship. It creates conditions of full employment and economic  growth. It will also be noted that trade acts as one of the dominant factors in the  process of building up civilisation through co-operation and mutual exchange of ideas. The  spread of Islam and Islamic civilisation In the Far East has been mostly due to the  efforts of Muslim traders. Interest has no redeeming feature at all. The fixed rate of  profit which a person gets from a financial investment without any risk of loss and  without augmenting it with human labour creates in man the undesirable weakness of  miserliness and Shylockian selfishness and lack of sympathy. In the economic sphere it  initiates and aggravates crisis. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Rightly, therefore, has Islam strictly prohibited all  transactions based on it or involving it in some form or other. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Advancing money on interest, keeping deposits in a bank for  the sake of earning interest, or getting concessions in rates of goods or commodities  against advance payments of price, mortgaging and utilising an income-yielding property  against a certain sum, to be returned in full when the property is redeemed and investing  money in a trade against a predetermined and fixed rate of profit-are all unlawfnl  business transactions because they involve Riba (interest) in some form or the other. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Transactions similar (in nature) to gambling. The Arabic  equivalent to gambling is Maisir which literarily means&#8221; getting something too  easily&#8221;,&#8221; getting a profit without working for it&#8221;. The literal meaning of  the term explains the principle on account of which gambling is prohibited in Islam. Any  monetary gain which cornes too easily, so much so that one does not have to work for it,  is unlawful. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The most familiar form of gambling amang the Arabs in the  days of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) was gambling by casting of lots by means  of arrows drawn from a bag. Some were blank and those who drew them got nothing. Others  indicated prizes-big or small ones. Whether one got anything or nothing depended on pure  luck. unless there was fraud on the part of someone concerned. The principle on which  objection to gambling is based is that you gain what you have not earned, or lose on a  mere chance. Dice, lottery, prize bonds and betting on horse races are to be held within  the definition of gambling. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Munabadha and Mulamasa. Islam recognises barter trade  subject to the injunctions of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. In fact, Islam has closed all  doors of dishonesty and deceit in business dealings. It has prohibited all forms of  transactions which admit of fraud in the least degree. It has impressed on the traders  that defective and worthless goods should not be given in exchange for good ones, and if  there is a defect in the goods sold it must be pointed out and made manifest to the  purchaser. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; The buyer and the  seller have the option of cancelling the contract as long as they have not separated;  then. if they both speak the truth and make manifest, their transaction shall be blessed,  and it they conceal and tell lies, the blessing of their transaction shall be  obliterated&#8221;. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Besides issuing the instructions which govern all forms of  trade, particularly barter trade, Islam has banned two forms of sale contract that were  prevalent before Islam. These were Munabadha and Mulamasa. In neither of these was the  purchaser offered an opportunity to examine the thing purchased. Munabadha means that the  seller should throw the cloth to the buyer before he has carefully examined it. The very  act of throwing the cloth will mean that the bargain has been struck. Mulamasa means  touching the cloth without examining it, ie. the buyer was just supposed to touch the  cloth to strike the bargain. Both these forms of transaction were prohibited because in  either case the purchaser got no opportunity to examine the things sold to him, and the  bargain was likely to prove unduly disadvantageous to one side. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In fact, Islam demanlds that goods and commodities for we  should go to the open market and the seller or his agents must be aware of the state of  the market before proposals are made for the purchase of goods or communities in bulk. He  should not be taken unawares lest advantage be taken of his ignorance of the state of the  market, and the prevailing prices. All this is ver clearly laid down by the Prophet (may  peace he upon him). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>As mentioned above, Islam tries to be fair to both parties  to a transaction. Any step on the part of one, that is advantageous to him and  disadvantageous to the other, is not permissible. The seller is expected to make the  defects (if any) in the goods manifest to the buyer, nor is the buyer expected to take  undue advantage of the ignorance of the seller. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mozabana. It is the exchange of fresh fruits for dry ones  in a way that the quantity of the dry fruit is actually measured and fixed, but the  quantity of the fresh fruit to be given in exchange is guessed while it is still on the  trees (Mishkat, 2710). The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has forbidden this  exchange because the quantity of the fruit on the trees cannot be definitely Determined  and the transaction is just a leap into the dark. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mu&#8217;awama. It consists in selling the fruit on the trees for  a period of one, two or three years even before it has made its appearance. It is  prohibited because like Muzabana it is also a leap into the dark. Such transactions may  result in bitterness and frustration. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-Gharar. It is to sell a thing which one doesn&#8217;t  have in one&#8217;s possession, nor expects to bring it under one&#8217;s control, e g. fish in the  river, or birds in the air. Possession is one of the basic conditions of a sale. One  cannot sell a thing which is not in one&#8217;s possession. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-&#8216;Uryan. It is getting a thing against a nominal  advance on the condition that if the bargain is struck, the advance will be adjusted and  if the bargain is cancelled, the seller will riot return the advance. The advance being  nominal, the buyer has practically no liability. He will abide by the contract if he finds  it advantageous to him and will withdraw himself from it otherwise. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-Mudtar. It is to buy a thing forcibly or to  purchase a thing when its owner is compelled under stress of want to dispose it of.  Instead of purchasing the thing, and taking undue advantage of the seller&#8217;s helplessness,  one should help him. Bai&#8217; alal-Bai&#8217; (sale over and above the sale of another). When one  person has sold goods to another, a third Person should not upset the bargain trying to  sell his own goods to the latter, offering them at lower rates or pointing out the defect  in the goods already sold to him by the former.&#8221; A Muslim should not purchase in  opposition to his brother, nor should he send a marriage proposal over and above the  proposal of another.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Bai&#8217; al-Hast (i. e. sale by means of pebbles). The  purchaser will tell the seller that when he will throw a pebble on his goods, the sale  contract will be confirmed or the seller tell the purchaser that on whatever thing a  pebble thrown by him falls will be sold to him. Sale contract is a serious matter and it  should not be accomplished by such hit-and-miss methods like throwing the pebbles on the  goods. A sale completed in this way may lead to injustice and hardship to one side and is  consequently prohibited. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sale of unripe fruit and unripe corn. The Holy Prophet (may  peace be upon him), according to Hadrat Anas (Allah be pleased with him), has prohibited  the sale of grapes before they become dark and that of the corn before it ripens.  Similarly, he has forbidden the sale of raw dates. The fruit of the date palms should not  be sold until it becomes red or yellow. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Here is a brief account of the sale transactions prohibited  by Islam. If one ponders over these forms of transaction described above and described in  greater detail in&#8221; Kitab al-Buyu,&#8221; one can arrive at the following conclusions: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam insists upon absolute justice and fairplay in  business dealings. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Islam, a person who sacrifices his faith, and  loses the good pleasure of his Lord to make a monetary gain has not made a good bargain. A  Muslim will not go in for such a bad bargain. A Muslim merchant is not a worshipper of the  Mammon with an inordinate love for money. He prizes faith, piety and righteousness above  all. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam does not believe in the view that all is fair in  business and that every kind of cleverness and deceit is justifiable in business  transactions. Islam regards business or commerce as an economic activity to be carried on  in a spirit of humanity. tarianism and justice. It does not approve of the cut-throat  competition. Indeed, the very concept is un-Islamic. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam expects the buyer and the seller to look upon each  other as Muslim brethren or fellow human beings, each trying to go all his way to help and  serve the other. It the seller happens to overcharge the buyer, he, instead of feeling  proud of his cleverness in doing so, should somehow compensate him for the excessive  payment received. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>All bargains that are clenched without giving the purchaser  a fair chance of examining the things are prohibited because this amounts to denying him a  right that was his due. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Forcible transactions or transactions in which the buyer  takes undue. advantage of the helplessness or misery of the seller are also discouraged. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam has prohibited traffic in wine, swine, dead bodies of  animals and other goods the use of which has been declared to be Haram (unlawful). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It has also forbidden trading in things that have a  debasing or vitiating influence on the Muslim society. </font></p>

Exception is made in case of &#8216;araya. Ata&#8217; said: Jabir explained (these    terms) for us. As for Mukhabara it is this that a wasteland is given by a person to    another and he makes an investment in it and then gets a share in the produce. According    to him (Jabir), Muzabana is the sell of fresh dates on the tree for dry dates with a    measure, and Muhaqala in agriculture implies that one should sell the standing crop for    grains with a measure.</font></p>

And Muhaqala implies that    crops in the field are bought for grains according to a customary measure. Muzabana    implies that date-palm should be sold for dry dates by measuring them with wisqs, and    al-Mukhabara is (a share), maybe one-third or one-fourth (in produce) or something like    it.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Rafi b. Khadij (Allah be pleased with him) reported: We    used to give on rent land during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon    him). We rented it on the share of one-third or one-fourth of the (produce) along with a    definite quantity of corn. One day a person from among my uncles came to us and said:    Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forbade us this act which was a source of    benefit to us, but the obedience to Allah and to His Messenger (may peace be upon him) is    more beneficial to us. He forbade us that we should rent land with one-third or one-fourth    of (the produce) and the corn of a measure, and he commanded the owner of land that he    should cultivate it or let it be cultivated by other (persons) but he showed disapproval    of renting it or anything besides it.</font></p>

He brought fine quality of dates, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon    him) said: Are all the dates of Khaibar like this)? He said: No. We got one sa&#8217; (of fine    dates) for two sa&#8217;s (of inferior dates), and (similarly) two sa&#8217;s for three sa&#8217;s.

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to him: From    where (you have brought them)? Bilal said: We had inferior quality of dates and I    exchanged two sa&#8217;s (of inferior quality) with one sa (of fine quality) as food for Allah&#8217;s    Apostle (may peace be upon him), whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:    Woe! it is in fact usury; therefore, don&#8217;t do that. But when you intend to buy dates (of    superior quality), sell (the inferior quality) in a separate bargain and then buy (the    superior quality).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Nadra reported: I asked Ibn Umar and Ibn Abbas (Allah    be pleased with them) about the conversion of gold with gold but they did not find any    harm in that. I was sitting in the company of Abd Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri (Allah be pleased with    him) and asked him about this exchange, and he said: Whatever is addition is an&#8217; interest.    I refused to accept it on account of their statement (statement of Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Ibn    &#8216;Umar). He said: I am not narrating to you except what I heard from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him). There came to him the owner of a date-palm with one sa&#8217; of fine dates,    and the dates of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) were of that colour. Allah&#8217;s    Apostle (may peace be upon him) said to him: Where did you get these dates? I went with    two sa&#8217;s of (inferior dates) and bought one sa&#8217; of (these fine dates), for that is the    prevailing price (of inferior dates) in the market and that is the price (of the fine    quality of dates in the market), whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said:    Woe be upon you! You have dealt in interest, when you decide to do it (i. e. exchange    superior quality of dates for inferior quality) ; so you should sell your dates for    another commodity (or currency) and then with the help of that commodity buy the dates you    like. Abu Sa&#8217;ad said: When dates are exchanged for dates (with different qualities) there    is the possibility (of the element of) interest (creeping into that) or when gold is    exchanged for gold having different qualities. I subsequently came to Ibn &#8216;Umar and he    forbade me (to do it), but I did not come to Ibn &#8216;Abbas; (Allah be pleased with them). He    (the narrator) said: Abu as-Sahba&#8217; narrated to me: He asked Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased    with them) in Mecca, and he too disapproved of it.</font></p>

He (the Holy    Prophet) stepped behind and drove it and prayed for it, and then it always moved ahead of    other camels. He (then) said: How do you find your camel? I said: It is, by the grace of    your prayer, all right. He said: Would you sell this (camel) to me? I felt shy (to say    him,&#8221; No&#8221; ) as we had no other camel for carrying water, but (later on) I said:    Yes, and to I sold it to him on the condition that (I would be permitted) to ride it until    I reached Madina. I said to him: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I am newly married, so I asked his    permission (to go ahead of the caravan). He permitted me, and I reached Medina well in    advance of other people, until I reached my destination. There my maternal uncle met me    and asked me about the camel, and I told him what I had done with regard to it. He    reproved me in this connection. He (Jabir) said: When I asked his permission (to go ahead    of the caravan) Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) inquired of me whether I had    married a virgin or a non-virgin. I said to him: I have married a non-virgin. He said: Why    did you not marry a virgin who would have played with you and you would have played with    her? I said to him: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, my father died (or he fell as a martyr), and I have    small sisters to (look after), so I did not like the idea that I should marry a woman who    is like them and thus be not able to teach them manners and look after them properly. So I    have married a non-virgin so that she should be able to look after them and teach them    manners, When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Medina, I went to him in    the morning with the camel.

He buried him, and then came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). They were Huwayyisa b. Mas&#8217;ud and &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. Sahl, and he (the latter one) was the youngest of the people (those three who had come to seek an interview with the Holy Prophet) began to talk before his Companions (had spoken). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: The eldest one (eldest in regard to age should speak). So he kept quiet, and his companions (Muhayyisa and Huwayyisa) began to speak, and he (&#8216;Abd al Rahman) spoke along with them and they narrated to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) the murder of &#8216;Abdullah b. Sahl. Thereupon he said to them: Are you prepared to take fifty oaths so that you may be entitled (to blood-wit) of your companion (or your man who has murdered)? They said: How can we take an oath on a matter which we have not witnessed? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then the Jews will exonerate themselves by fifty oaths. They said: How can we accept the oaths of people who are unbelievers? When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw that, he himself paid his blood-wit.</p>

Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Show regard for the greatness of the old, or he said: Let the eldest begin speaking. Then they (Huwayyisa and Muhayyisa) spoke about the matter of their companion (murder of their cousin, &#8216;Abdullah b. Sahl). Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Let fifty (persons) among you take oath for levelling the charge (of murder) against a person amongst them, and he would be surrendered to you. They said: We have not witnessed this matter ourselves. How can we then take oath? He (the Holy Prophet) said: The Jews will exonerate themselves by the oaths of fifty of them. They said: Messenger of Allah, they are non-believing people. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) paid the blood wit for him. Sahl said: As one day I entered the fold a she-camel amongst those camels hit me with its leg.</p>

Then Muhayyisa went to speak, and it was he who had accompanied (&#8216;Abdullah) to Khaibar, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to Muhayyisa: Observe greatness of the great (he meant the seniority of age). Then Huwayyisa spoke and then Muhayyisa also spoke. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: They should either pay blood-wit for your companion, or be prepared for war. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) wrote about it to them (to the Jews). They wrote: Verily, by Allah, we have not killed him. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said to Huwayyisa and Muhayyisa and Abd al-Rahman: Are you prepared to take oath in order to entitle yourselves for the blood-wit of your companion? They said: No. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Then the Jews will take oath (of their innocence). They said: They are not Muslims. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), however, himself paid the blood-wit to them and sent to them one hundred camels until they entered into their houses, Sahl said: One red she-camel among them kicked me.</p>

The year is constituted of twelve months, of which four are sacred; three of them consecutive, viz. Dhu&#8217;l-Qa&#8217;da, Dhu&#8217;l- Hijja and Muharram, and also Rajab the month of Mudar which comes between Jumada and Sha&#8217;ban. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: which month is this? We said Allah and His Messenger know best. He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet) remained silent for some time until we thought that he would give it a name other than that (by which it was known). He said: Is it not Dha&#8217;l-Hijja? We said: Yes. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Which city is this? We said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He (the Holy Prophety remained silent until we thought that he would give it another name. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Is it not the Balda (the city of Mecca)? We said: Yes. He said: What day is this? We said: Allah and His Messenger know best. He (the Holy Prophet) remained silent until we thought that he would give it another name. He said: Is it not the Day of Sacrifice? We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. yes. Thereupon he said: Your blood, your property (Muhammad, one of the narrators, said: I think, he also said this) and your honour are sacred to you like the sacredness of this day of yours, in this city of yours, and in this month of yours. You will soon meet your Lord and He will ask you about your deeds. So do not turn after me unbelievers (or misguided), some of you striking the necks of the others. Behold I let him who is present convey to him who is absent, for many a one whom a message is conveyed has a more retentive memory than one who hears. He again said: Behold! have I not delivered (the message) to you? This hadith has been narrated through another chain of transmitters, but with a slight variation of words.</p>

He said: I do not possess any property but this robe of mine and this axe of mine. He (the Holy, Prophet) said: Do you think your people will pay ransom for you? He said: I am more insignificant among my people than this (that I would not be able to get this benefit from my tribe).

I (the narrator) said: I    think he (&#8216;Umar) also said: You may wear it on Friday (also). Thereupon, Allah&#8217;s Messenger    (may peace he upon him) said: He who wears silk in this world has no share in the    Hereafter. Later on when these silk garments were presented to Allah&#8217;s Massenger (may    peace be upon him) he presented one silk garment to &#8216;Umar and presented one also to Usama    b. Zaid and gave one to &#8216;Ali b. Abu &#8216;Talib. saying: Tear them and make head coverings for    your ladies. &#8216;Umar came carrying his garment and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you have sent it    to me, whereas you had said yesterday about the (silk) garment of Utarid what you had to    say. He (the Holy Prophet) said: I have not sent it to you that you wear it, but I have    sent It to you so that you may derive benefit out of it; and Usama (donned) the garment    (presented to him) and appeared to be brisk, whereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon    him) looked at him with a look by which he perceived that the Messenger of Allah (may    peace be upon him) did not like what he had done. He said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. why is it    that you look at me like this. whereas you yourself presented it to me? He said: I never    sent it to you to wear it, but I sent It to you so that you may tear it and make out head    covering for your ladies.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Maimuna reported that one morning Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may    peace be upon him) was silent with grief. Maimuna said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I find a change    in your mood today. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Gabriel had promised    me that he would meet me tonight, but he did not meet me. By Allah, he never broke his    promises, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) spent the day in this sad (mood).    Then it occurred to him that there had been a puppy under their cot. He commanded and it    was turned out. He then took some water in his hand and sprinkled it at that place. When    it was evening Gabriel met him and he said to him: you promised me that you would meet me    the previous night. He said: Yes, but we do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a    picture. Then on that very morning he commanded the killing of the dogs until he announced    that the dog kept for the orchards should also be killed, but he spared the dog meant for    the protection of extensive fields (or big gardens).</font></p>

She said: No (I did not hear this myself),    but I narrate to you what I saw him doing. I bear testimony to the fact that he (the Holy    Prophet) set out for an expedition. I took a carpet and screened the door with it. When he    (the Holy Prophet) came back he saw that carpet and I perceived signs of disapproval on    his face. He pulled it until it was torn or it was cut (into pieces) and he said: God has    not commanded us to clothe stones and clay. We cut it (the curtain) and prepared two    pillowa out of it by stuffing them with the fibre of date-palms and he (the Holy Prophet)    did not find fault with it.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 19: </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><span><em>The Book of Jihad and Expedition (Kitab Al-Jihad wa&#8217;l-Siyar) </em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The word Jihad is derived from the verb jahada which means:&#8221; he exerted himself&#8221;. Thus literally, Jihad means exertion, striving; but in juridico-religious sense, it signifies the exertion of one&#8217;s power to the utmost of one&#8217;s capacity in the cause of Allah. This is why the word Jihad has been used as the antonym to the word Qu, ud (sitting) in the Holy Qur&#8217;an (iv. 95). Thus Jihad in Islam is not an act of violence directed indiscriminately against the non-Muslims; it is the name given to an all-round struggle which a Muslim should launch against evil in whatever form or shape it appears. Qital fi sabilillah (fighting in the way of Allah) is only one aspect of Jihad. Even this qital in Islam is not an act of mad brutality. It has its material and moral functions, i. e. self-preservation and the preservation of the moral order in the world. The verdict of all religious and ethical philosophies-ancient and modern-justify war on moral grounds. When one nation is assailted by the ambitions and cupidity of another, the doctrine of non-resistance is anti-social, as it involves non-assertion, not only of one&#8217;s own rights, but of those of others who need protection against the forces of tyranny and oppression. A Muslim is saddled with the responsibilities to protect himself and all those who seek his protection. He cannot afford to abandon the defenceless people, old man, women and children to privation, suffering and moral peril. Fighting in Islam, therefore, represents in Islamic Law what is known among Western jurists as&#8221; just war&#8221;. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The very first revelation in which the permission to wage war against the forces of evil sums up the aims and objects of qital in Islam: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Permitted&#8217;are those who are fought against, because they have been oppressed. and verily God is more Powerful for their aid. Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they said: &#8216;Our Lord is Allah, &#8216; for had it not been for &#8216;Allah&#8217;s repelling someone by means of others, cloisters and churches and mosques, wherein the name of Allah is oft-mentioned, would assuredly have been pulled down. Verily Allah helps one who helps Him. Lo! Allah is Strong. Almighty&#8221; (xxii. 39. 41). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>These verses eloquently speak of &#8216;the fact that it is neither for the acquisition of territory nor for the love of power and distinction that the Muslims have been permitted to raise arms against the enemy. They were allowed to do so because their very existence had been made difficult by the high-handedness of the Meccans. The Holy Qur&#8217;an has elucidated this point in the following verse: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; And what reason have you not to fight in the way of Allah and for the oppressed among men and women and children who say: Our Lord! take us forth from the town whereof the people are oppressors and grant us from Thee a friend and grant us from Thee a helper&#8221; (iv. 75). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The war in Islam is waged with a view to securing liberty and freedom for those who are groaning under the oppression of heartless tyrants. It is the bounden duty of the Muslims to alleviate their sufferings and create for them an atmosphere of peace and security. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Then in the succeeding verse a distinction is also drawn between two types of war: one which is fought for the sake of Allah and the other which is waged for evil ends: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Those who believe fight in the way of Allah and those who disbelieve fight in the way of devil. So fight against the friends of Satan; verily weak indeed is the strategy of the devil&#8221; (iv. 76). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been made clear that those people who fight for self-glorification or for the exploitation of the weak are in fact friends of the devil; wheres those who raise arms to curb tyranny and aggression, to eradicate evil from the human society, fight in the way of Allah. Mere fighting is not, therefore, Jihad in Islam; it is the noble objective alone which makes it a sacred pursuit like devotion and prayer. It is narrated on the authority of Abu Musa Ash&#8217;ari that once a man went to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and said: One man fights for the sake of spoils of war, the second one fights for fame and glory and the third to display his courage and skill; which among them is the fighter for the cause of Allah? Upon this the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) replied: He who fights with the sole objective that the word of Allah should become supreme is a Mujahid in the cause of the Lord. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A Mujahid is thus a noble person who offers his life for the achievement of lofty ends. He is actuated by human considerations lifts arms not under the impulse of fury and revenge, but with will, fore-thought, tenacity and fellow-feeling, and his conduct bears the imprint of human intellect, human sympathy and sense of justice. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Holy Qur&#8217;an has explained this point in Sura Anfal in these words: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; O you who believe, when you meet an enemy, be firm, and remember Allah much, that you may be successful. And obey Allah and His Apostle. And fall with no disputes, lest ye falter and your strength fail; but be steadfast! For Allah is with those who patiently persevere. Be not as those who came forth from their dwellings boastfully. And to be seen of men and debar (men) from the way of Allah. And Allah encompasses what they do&#8221; (viii. 45-46). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Here the Muslims have been exhorted to observe five principles of war: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Be steadfast in the face of the enemy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Have full reliance on the help of Allah and remember Him much. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Have the unity of purpose and solidarity of corporate life always before your eyes. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Be fully aware of the lofty purpose before you in fighting. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Don&#8217;t be proud and boastful in your attitude and behaviour. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Islam has purified even war of all its cruelty and horrors and has made it a&#8221; reformative process&#8221; to deal with evil. The Holy Qur&#8217;an bserves: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; And fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you and transgress not the limits. Verily Allah loves not the transgressors&#8221; (ii. 190). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) has given clear instructions about the behaviour of the Muslim army. He observed: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Set out for Jihad in the name of Allah and for the sake of Allah. Do not lay hands on the old verging on death, on women, children and babes. Do not steal anything from the booty and collect together all that falls to your lot in the battlefield and do good, for Allah loves the virtuous and the pious.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>So great is the respect for humanly feelings in Islam that even the wanton destruction of enemy&#8217;s crops or property is strictly forbidden. The righteous Caliphs followed closely the teachings of Allah and those of His Apostle in letter and spirit the celebrated address which the first Caliph Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) gave to his army while sending her on the expedition to the Syrian borders is permeated with the noble spirit with which the war in Islam is permitted. He said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman. nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not ary of the enemy&#8217;s flock. save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monast ic services; leave them alone&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is said that once at the time of conquest, a singing girl was brought to al-Muhajir b. Abu Umayya who had been publicly singing satirical poems about Hadrat Abu Bakr. Muhajir got her hand amputated. When the Caliph heard this news, he was shocked and wrote a letter to Muhajir in the following words: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; I have learnt that you laid hands on a woman who had hurled abuses on me, and, therefore, got her hand amputated. God has not sought vengeance even in the case of polytheism, which is a great crime. He has not permitted mutilation even with regard to manifest infidelity. Try to be considerate and sympathetic in your attitude towards others in future. Never mutilate, because it is a grave offence. God purified Islam and the Muslims from rashness and excessive wrath. You are well aware of the fact that those enemies fell into the hands of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) who had been recklessly abusing him; who had turned him out of his home; and who fought against him, but he never permitted their mutilation.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Another letter written by hadrat &#8216;Umar the Second Caliph, which is addressed to sa&#8217;d b. Abu Waqqas, speaks eloquently of the noble spirit with which the Muslims have bear exhorted to take up arms: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8221; Always search your minds and hearts and stress upon your men the need of perfect integrity and sincerity in the cause of Allah. There should be no material end before them in laying down their lives. but they abould deem it a means whereby they can please their Lord and entitle them. selves to His favour: such a spirit of selflessness should be inculcated in the minds of those who unfortunately lack it. Be firm in the thick of the battle as Allah helps man according to the perseverance that he shows in the cause of His faith and he would be rewarded in accordance with the spirit of sacrifice which he displays for the sake of the Lord. Be careful that those who have been entrusted to your care receive no harm at your hands and are never deprived of any of their legitimate rights. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Such in fact is the humane and noble attitude which Islam exhorts its followers to adopt on the battlefield where passions are generally let loose. It is an attitude the like of which is not to be found in the history of any other nation. Has the world any code of military ethics more noble and compassionate than this?&#8221; The moral tone adopted by the Caliph Abu Bakr in his instructions to the Syrian army was,&#8221; says a Christian historian,&#8221; so unlike the principles of the Roman government that it must have commanded profound attention from the subject people-such a proclamation announced to Jews and Christians sentiments of justice and principles of toleration which neither Roman emperors nor orthodox bishops had ever adopted as the rule of conduct.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Western scholars have indulged in a good deal of mud-slinging on the question of the use of the sword in Islam. But if one were to reflect calmly on this point one would be convinced that the sword has not been used recklessly by the Muslims; it has been wielded purely with humane feelings in the wider interest of humanity. Utmost regard was always shown to human life, honour and property even on the battlefield. That is why in all the eighty-two encounters between the Muslims and the non-Muslims during the life of the Holy Prophet (may peace he upon him), only 1018 persons lost their lives on both sides. Out of this 259 were Muslims, whereas the remaining 759 belonged to the opposite camp. One wonders at the audacity of these writers only when one compares the religious wars of Charles the Great, in which 4300 pagan Saxons were killed in cold blood, when one recalls the&#8221; famous answer by which the Papal Legate, in the Albigensian war, quieted the scruples of a too conscientious general, &#8216;Kill all, God will know His own&#8217;&#8230;. When we recall the Spanish Inquisition, the conquest of Mexico and Peru, the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and the sack of Magdeburg by Tilly.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is indeed strange that the criticism on the use of sword by Muslims emanates from those whose hands are soiled in the blood of countless innocent human beings, by those who exult in the techniques of homicide, who have depersonalised warfare to such an extent that millions of innocent men and women are put to death and numberless are thrown into concentration camps and flogged with steel rods and ox-hide whips, and all this is done without any qualm of conscience. As human beings. we hang our heads down in shame when we think of the horrifying atrocities which have been perpetrated by the modern civilised men. It is estimated that. in the First World War, ten million soldiers were killed and an equal number of civilians lost their lives, and twenty million died on account of widespread epidemics and famines throughout the world as an aftermath of this war. Economic costs are estimated at $ 338,000,000,000 of which $ 186,000,000,000 were direct costs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The losses in the Second World War were staggeringly greater as compared to those in the first one. Twenty-two million persons were killed and thirty-four million were wounded. The estimated cost of the war was $ 1, 348. 000,000,000 of which $ 1, 167,000,000,000 consisted of direct military costs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is significant that in the Korean War, the first instance in which an international organisation for establishing peace utilised military force to suppress aggression, more than one million persons were killed which added to the civilian deaths in Korea and totalled about five millions. </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been reported from Sulaiman b. Buraid through his father that when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) appointed anyone as leader of an army or detachment he would especially exhort him to fear Allah and to be good to the Muslims who were with him. He would say: Fight in the name of Allah and in the way of Allah. Fight against those who disbelieve in Allah. Make a holy war, do not embezzle the spoils; do not break your pledge; and do not mutilate (the dead) bodies; do not kill the children. When you meet your enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and withold yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them. Then invite them to migrate from their lands to the land of Muhairs and inform them that, if they do so, they shall have all the privileges and obligations of the Muhajirs. If they refuse to migrate, tell them that they will have the status of Bedouin Muilims and will be subjected to the Commands of Allah like other Muslims, but they will not get any share from the spoils of war or Fai&#8217; except when they actually fight with the Muslims (against the disbelievers). If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizya. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold off your hands. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah&#8217;s help and fight them. When you lay siege to a fort and the besieged appeal to you for protection in the name of Allah and His Prophet, do not accord to them the guarantee of Allah and His Prophet, but accord to them your own guarantee and the guarantee of your companions for it is a lesser sin that the security given by you or your companions be disregarded than that the security granted in the name of Allah and His Prophet be violated When you besiege a fort and the besieged want you to let them out in accordance with Allah&#8217;s Command, do not let them come out in accordance with His Command, but do so at your (own) command, for you do not know whether or not you will be able to carry out Allah&#8217;s behest with regard to them.</span></p>

I turned round and attacked him from behind giving a blow between his neck and shoulder. He turned towards me and grappled with me in such a way that I began to see death staring me in the face. Then death overtook him and left me alone. I joined &#8216;Umar b. al-Khattab who was saying: What has happened to the people (that they are retreating)? I said: It is the Decree of Allah.

Now the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What has happened to you, O Abu Qatada? Then I related the (whole) story, to him. At this, one of the people said: He has told the truth. Messenger of Allah 1 The belongings of the enemy killed by him are with me. Persuade him to forgo his right (in my favour). (Objecting to this proposal) Abu Bakr said: BY Allah, this will not happen. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) will not like to deprive one of the lions from among the lions of Allah who fight in the cause of Allah and His Messenger and give thee his share of the booty. So the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) said: He (Abu Bakr) has told the truth, and so give the belongings to him (Abu Qatada). So he gave them to me. I sold the armour (which was a part of my share of the booty) and bought with the sale proceeds a garden in the street of Banu Salama.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been reported by Salama b. al-Akwa&#8217;: We fought the Battle of Hawazin along with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). (One day) when we were having our breakfast with the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him), a man came riding a red camel. He made it kneel down, extracted a strip of leather from its girth and tethered the camel with it. Then he began to take food with the people and look (curiously around). We were in a poor condition as some of us were on foot (being without any riding animals). All of a sudden, he left us hurriedy, came to his camel, untethered it, made it kneel down, mounted it and urged the beast which ran off with him. A man on a brown rhe-camel chased him (taking him for a spy). Salama (the narrator) said: I followed on foot. I ran on until I was near the thigh of the she-camel. I advanced further until I was near the haunches of the camel. I advanced still further until I caught hold of the nosestring of the camel. I made it kneel down. As soon as it placed its knee on the ground, I drew my sword and struck at the head, of the rider who fell down. I brought the camel driving it along with the man&#8217;s baggage and weapons. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came forward to meet me and the people were with him. He asked: Who has killed the man? The people said: Ibn Akwa&#8217;. He said: Everything of the man is for him (Ibn Akwa&#8217;).</span></p>

He had been appointed by the Messenger oi Allah (may peace be upon him). When we were onlv at an hour&#8217;s distance from the water of the enemy, Abu Bakr ordered us to attack. We made a halt during the last part of the night tor rest and then we attacked from all sides and reached their watering-place where a battle was fought. Some of the enemies were killed and some were taken prisoners. I saw a group of persons that consisted of women and children. I was afraid lest they should reach the mountain before me, so I shot an arrow between them and the mountain. When they saw the arrow, they stopped. So I brought them, driving them along. Among them was a woman from Banu Fazara. She was wearing a leather coat. With her was her daughter who was one of the prettiest girls in Arabia. I drove them along until I brought them to Abu Bakr who bestowed that girl upon me as a prize. So we arrived in Medina. I had not yet disrobed her when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) met me in the street and said: Give me that girl, O Salama. I said: Messenger of Allah, she has fascinated me. I had not yet disrobed her. When on the next day. the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ag;tin met me in the street, he said: O Salama, give me that girl, may God bless your father. I said: She is for you. Messenger of Allah! By Allah. I have not yet disrobed her. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent her to the people of Mecca, and surrendered her as ransom for a number of Muslims who had been kept as prisoners at Mecca.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is reported by Zuhri that this tradition was narrated to him by Malik b. Aus who said: Umar b. al-Khattab sent for me and I came to him when the day had advanced. I found him in his house sitting on his bare bed-stead, reclining on a leather pillow. He said (to me): Malik, some people of your tribe have hastened to me (with a request for help). I have ordered a little money for them. Take it and distribute it among them. I said: I wish you had ordered somebody else to do this job. He said: Malik, take it (and do what you have been told). At this moment (his man-servant) Yarfa&#8217; came in and said: Commander of the Faithful, what do you say about Uthman, Abd al-Rabman b. &#8216;Auf, Zubair and Sa&#8217;d (who have come to seek an audience with you)? He said: Yes, and permitted them. so they entered. Then he (Yarfa&#8217;) came again and said: What do you say about &#8216;Ali and Abbas (who are present at the door)? He said: Yes, and permitted them to enter. Abbas said: Commander of the Faithful, decide (the dispute) between me and this sinful, treacherous, dishonest liar. The people (who were present) also said: Yes. Commander of the Faithful, do decide (the dispute) and have mercy on them. Malik b. Aus said: I could well imagine that they had sent them in advance for this purpose (by &#8216;Ali and Abbas). &#8216;Umar said: Wait and be patient. I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heavens and the earth are sustained, don&#8217;t you know that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity&#8221;? They said: Yes. Then he turned to Abbas and &#8216;Ali and said: I adjure you both by Allah by Whose order the heavens and earth are sustained, don&#8217;t you know that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity&#8221;? They (too) said: Yes. (Then) Umar said: Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, had done to His Messenger (may peace be upon him) a special favour that He has not done to anyone else except him. He quoted the Qur&#8217;anic verse:&#8221; What Allah has bestowed upon His Apostle from (the properties) of the people of township is for Allah and His Messenger&#8221;. The narrator said: I do not know whether he also recited the previous verse or not. Umar continued: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) distrbuted among you the properties abandoned by Banu Nadir. By Allah, he never preferred himself over you and never appropriated anything to your exclusion. (After a fair distribution in this way) this property was left over.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) would meet from its income his annual expenditure, and what remained would be deposited in the Bait-ul-Mal. (Continuing further) he said: I adjure you by Allah by Whose order the heavens and the earth are sustained. Do you know this? They said: Yes. Then he adjured Abbas and &#8216;All as he had adjured the other persons and asked: Do you both know this? They said: Yes. He said: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) passed away, Abu Bakr said:&#8221; I am the successor of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).&#8221; Both of you came to demand your shares from the property (left behind by the Messenger of Allah). (Referring to Hadrat &#8216;Abbas), he said: You demanded your share from the property of your nephew, and he (referring to &#8216;Ali) demanded a share on behalf of his wife from the property of her father. Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had said:&#8221; We do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity.&#8221; So both of you thought him to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that he was true, virtuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. When Abu Bakr passed away and (I have become) the successor of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and Abu Bakr (Allah be pleased with him), you thought me to be a liar, sinful, treacherous and dishonest. And Allah knows that I am true, virtuous, well-guided and a follower of truth. I became the guardian of this property. Then you as well as he came to me. Both of you have come and your purpose is identical. You said: Entrust the property to us. I said: If you wish that I should entrust it to you, it will be on the condition that both of you will undertake to abide by a pledge made with Allah that you will use it in the same way as the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used it. So both of you got it. He said: Wasn&#8217;t it like this? They said: Yes. He said: Then you have (again) come to me with the request that I should adjudge between you. No, by Allah. I will not give any other judgment except this until the arrival of the Doomsday. If you are unable to hold the property on this condition, return it to me.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It is narrated on the authority of Urwa b. Zubair who narrated from A&#8217;isha that she informed him that Fatima, daughter of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), sent someone to Abu Bakr to demand from him her share of the legacy left by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) from what Allah had bestowed upon him at Medina and Fadak and what was left from one-filth of the income (annually received) from Khaibar. Abu Bakr said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; We (prophets) do not have any heirs; what we leave behind is (to be given in) charity.&#8221; The household of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) will live on the income from these properties, but, by Allah, I will not change the charity of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) from the condition in which it was in his own time. I will do the same with it as the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upun him) himself used to do. So Abu Bakr refused to hand over anything from it to Fatima who got angry with Abu Bakr for this reason. She forsook him and did not talk to him until the end of her life. She lived for six months after the death of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). When she died, her husband. &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib, buried her at night. He did not inform Abu Bakr about her death and offered the funeral prayer over her himself. During the lifetime of Fatima, &#8216;All received (special) regard from the people. After she had died, he felt estrangement in the faces of the people towards him. So he sought to make peace with Abu Bakr and offer his allegiance to him. He had not yet owed allegiance to him as Caliph during these months. He sent a person to Abu Bakr requesting him to visit him unaccompanied by anyone (disapproving the presence of Umar). &#8216;Umar said to Abu Bakr: BY Allah, you will not visit them alone. Abu Bakr said: What will they do to me? By Allah, I will visit them. And he did pay them a visit alone. &#8216;All recited Tashahhud (as it is done in the beginning of a religious sermon) ; then said: We recognise your moral excellence and what Allah has bestowed upon you. We do not envy the favour (i. e. the Catiphate) which Allah nas conferred upon you; but you have done it (assumed the position of Caliph) alone (without consulting us), and we thought we had a right (to be consulted) on account of our kinship with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He continued to talk to Abu Bakr (in this vein) until the latter&#8217;s eyes welled up with tears. Then Abd Bakr spoke and said: By Allah, in Whose Hand is my life, the kinship of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) is dearer to me than the kinship of my own people. As regards the dispute that has arisen between you and me about these properties, I have not deviated from the right course and I have not given up doing about them what the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used to do. So &#8216;Ali said to Abu Bakr: This aftetnoon is (fixed) for (swearing) allegiance (to you). So when Abu Bakr had finished his Zuhr prayer, he ascended the pulpit and recited Tashahhud, and described the status of &#8216;Ali, his delay in swearing allegiance and the excuse which lie had offered to him (for this delay). (After this) he asked for God&#8217;s forgiveness. Then &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib recited the Tashahhud. extolled the merits of Abu Bakr and (said that) his action was nott prompted by any jealousy of Abu Bakr on his part or his refusal to accept the high position which Allah had conferred upon him, (adding: ) But we were of the opinion that we should have a share in the government, but the matter had been decided without taking us into confidence, and this displeased us. (Hence the delay in offering allegiance. The Muslims were pleased with this (explanation) and they said: You have done the right thing. The Muslims were (again) favourably inclined to &#8216;Ali since he adopted the proper course of action.</span></p>

I am afraid that it I go against his instructions in any matter I shall deviate from the right course. So far as the charitable endowments at Medina were concerned, &#8216;Umar handed them over to &#8216;All and Abbas, but &#8216;Ali got the better of him (and kept the property under his exclusive possession). And as far as Khaibar and Fadak were concerned &#8216;Umar kept them with him, and said: These are the endowments of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) (to the Umma). Their income was spent on the discharge of the responsibilities that devolved upon him on the emergencies he had to meet.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of &#8216;Umar b. al-Khattab who said: When it was the day on which the Battle of Badr was fought, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) cast a glance at the infidels, and they were one thousand while his own Companions were three hundred and nineteen. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) turned (his face) towards the Qibla Then he stretched his hands and began his supplication to his Lord:&#8221; O Allah, accomplish for me what Thou hast promised to me. O Allah, bring about what Thou hast promised to me. O Allah, if this small band of Muslims is destroyed. Thou will not be worshipped on this earth.&#8221; He continued his supplication to his Lord, stretching his hands, facing the Qibla, until his mantle slipped down from his shoulders. So Abu Bakr came to him, picked up his mantle and put it on his shoulders. Then he embraced him from behind and said:. Prophet of Allah, this prayer of yours to your Lord will suffice you, and He will fulfil for you what He has promised you. So Allah, the Glorious and Exalted, revealed (the Qur&#8217;anic verse):&#8221; When ye appealed to your Lord for help, He responded to your call (saying): I will help you with one thousand angels coming in succession.&#8221; So Allah helped him with angels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Zumail said that the badith was narrated to him by Ibn &#8216;Abbas who said: While on that day a Muslim was chasing a disbeliever who was going ahead of him, he heard over him&#8217; the swishing of the whip and the voice of the rider saying: Go ahead, Haizi&#8217;m! He glanced at the polytheist who had (now) fallen down on his back. When he looked at him (carefully he found that) there was a scar on his nose and his face was torn as if it had been lashed with a whip, and had turned green with its poison. An Ansari came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and related this (event) to him. He said: You have told the truth. This was the help from the third heaven. The Muslims that day (i. e. the day of the Battle of Badr) killed seventy persons and captured seventy. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with them): What is your opinion about these captives? Abu Bakr said: They are our kith and kin. I think you should release them after getting from them a ransom. This will be a source of strength to us against the infidels. It is quite possible that Allah may guide them to Islam. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What is your opinion. Ibn Khattab? He said: Messenger of Allah. I do not hold the same opinion as Abu Bakr. I am of the opinion that you should hand them over to us so that we may cut off their heads. Hand over &#8216;Aqil to &#8216;Ali that he may cut off his head, and hand over such and such relative to me that I may but off his head. They are leaders of the disbelievers and veterans among them. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) approved the opinion of Abu Bakr and did not approve what I said The next day when I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), I found that both he and Abu Bakr were sitting shedding tears. I said: Messenger of Allah, why are you and your Companion shedding tears? Tell me the reason. For I will weep ate, if not, I will at least pretend to weep in sympathy with you. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: I weep for what has happened to your companions for taking ransom (from the prisoners). I was shown the torture to which they were subjected. It was brought to me as close as this tree. (He pointed to a tree close to him.) Then God revealed the verse:&#8221; It is not befitting for a prophet that he should take prisoners until the force of the disbelievers has been crushed&#8230;&#8221; to the end of the verse:&#8221; so eat ye the spoils of war, (it is) lawful and pure. So Allah made booty lawful for them.&#8221;</span></p>

He was from the tribe of Banu Hanifa and was called Thumama b. Uthal. He was the chief of the people of Yamama. People bound him with one of the pillars of the mosque. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came out to (see) him. He said: O Thumama, what do you think? He replied: Muhammad, I have good opinion of you. If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If you do me a favour, you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you want wealth, ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be pon him) lefthim (in this condition) for two days, (and came to him again) and said: What do you think, O Thumama? He replied: What I have already told you. If you do a favour, you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If you want wealth, ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) left him until the next day when he (came to him again) and said: What do you think, O Thumama? He replied: What I have already told you. If you do me a favour, you will do a favour to a grateful person. If you kill me, you will kill a person who has spilt blood. If you want wealth ask and you will get what you will demand. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Set Thumama free. He went to a palm-grove near the mosque and took a bath. Then he entered the mosque and said: I bear testimony (to the truth) that there is no god but Allah and I testify that Muhammad is His bondman and His messenger. O Muhammad, by Allah, there was no face on the earth more hateful to me than your face, but (now) your face has become to me the dearest of all faces. By Allah, there was no religion more hateful to me than your religion, but (now) your religion has become the dearest of all religions to me. By Allah, there was no city more hateful to me than your city, but (now) your city has become the dearest of all cities to me. Your horsemen captured me when I intended going for Umra. Now what is your opinion (in the matter)? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) announced good tidings to him and told him to go on &#8216;Umra. When he reached Mecca, somebody said to him: Have you changed your religion? He said: No! I have rather embraced Islam with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). By Allah, you will not get a single grain of wheat from Yamama until it is permitted by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).</span></p>

<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="019.4380"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Abbas who learnt the tradition personally from Abu Safyan. The latter said: I went out (on a mercantile venture) during the period (of truce) between me and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). While I was in Syria, the letter of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was handed over to Hiraql (Ceasar), the Emperor of Rome (who was on a visit to Jerusalem at that time). The letter was brought by Dihya Kalbi who delivered it to the governor of Busra The governor passed it on to Hiraql, (On receiving the letter), he said: Is there anyone from the people of this man who thinks that he is a prophet. People said: Yes. So, I was called along with a few others from the Quraish. We were admitted to Hiraql and he seated usbefore him. He asked: Which of you has closer kinship with the man who thinks that he is a prophet? Abu Sufyan said: I. So they seated me in front of him and stated my companions behind me. Then, he called his interpreter and said to him: Tell them that I am going to ask this fellow (i. e. Abu Sufyan) about the man who thinks that he is a prophet. It he tells me a lie, then refute him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Sufyan told (the narrator): By God, if there was not the fear that falsehood would be imputed to me I would have lied. (Then) Hiraqi said to his interpreter: Inquire from him about his ancestry, I said: He is of good ancestry among us. He asked: Has there been a king among his ancestors? I said: No. He asked: Did you accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed his prophethood? I said: No. He asked: Who are his follower people of high status or low status? I said: (They are) of low status. He asked: Are they increasing in number or decreasing? I said. No. they are rather increasing. He asked: Does anyone give up his religion, being dissatisfied with it, after having embraced it? I said: No. He asked: Have you been at war with him? I said: Yes. He asked: How did you fare in that war? I said: The war between us and him has been wavering like a bucket, up at one turn and down at the other (i. e. the victory has been shared between us and him by turns). Sometimes he suffered loss at our hands and sometimes we suffered loss at his (hand). He asked: Has he (ever) violated his covenant? I said: No. but we have recently concluded a peace treaty with him for a petiod and we do not know what he is going to do about it. (Abu Sufyin said on oath that he could not interpolate in this dialogue anything from himself more than these words ) He asked: Did anyone make the proclamation (Of prophethood) before him? I said: No. He (now) said to his interpreter: Tell him, I asked him about his ancestry and he had replied that he had the best ancestry. This is the case with Prophets; they are the descendants of the noblest among their people (Addressing Abu Sufyan), he continued: I asked you if there had been a king among his ancestors. You said that there had been none. If there had been a king among his ancestors, I would have said that he was a man demanding his ancestral kingdom. I asked you about his followers whether they were people of high or low status, and you said that they were of rather low status. Such are the followers of the Prophets. I asked you whether you used to accuse him of falsehood before he proclaimed his prophethood, and you said that you did not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>So I have understood that when he did not allow himself to tell a lie about the poeple, he would never go to the length of forging a falsehood about Allah. I asked you whether anyone renounced his religion being dissatisfied with it after he had embraced it, and you replied in the negative. Faith is like this when it enters the depth of the heart (it perpetuates them). I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You said they were increasing. Faith is like this until it reaches its consummation. I asked you whether you had been at war with him, and you replied that you had been and that the victory between you and him had been shared by turns, sometimes he suffering loss at your hand and sometimes you suffering lost at his. This is how the Prophets are tried before the final victory its theirs. I asked you whether he (ever) violated his covenant, and you said that he did not. This is how the Prophets behave. They never violate (their covenants). I asked you whether anyone before him had proclaimed the same thing, and you replied in the negative. I said: If anyone had made the same proclamation before, I would have thought that he was a man following what had been proclaimed before. (Then) he asked: What does he enjoin upon you? I said: He exhorts us to offer Salat, to pay Zakat, to show due regard to kinship and to practise chastity. He said: It what you have told about him is true, he is certainly a Prophet. I knew that he was to appear but I did not think that he would be from among you. If I knew that I would be able to reach him. I would love to meet him; and it I had been with him. I would have washed his feet (out of reverence). His dominion would certainly extend to this place which is under my feet. Then he called for the letter of the Messenger of Allah (may pface be upon him) and read it. The letter ran as follows:&#8221; In the name of Allah, Most Gracious and Most Merciful. From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah, to Hiraql, the Emperor of the Romans. Peace be upon him who follows the guidance. After this, I extend to you the invitation to accept Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be safe. Accept Islam, God will give you double the reward. And if you turn away, upon you will be the sin of your subjects.&#8221; O People of the Book, come to the word that is common between us that we should worship none other than Allah, should not ascribe any partner to Him and some of us should not take their fellows as Lords other than Allah. If they turn away, you should say that we testify to our being Muslims [iii. 64].&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When he hid finished the reading of the letter, noise and confused clamour was raise around him, and he ordered us to leave. Accordingly, we left. (Addressing my companions) while we were coming out (of the place). I said: Ibn Abu Kabsha (referring sarcastically to the Holy Prophet) has come to wield a great power. Lo! (even) the king of the Romans is afraid of him. I continued to believe that the authority of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) would triumph until God imbued me with (the spirit of) Islam.</span></p>

I and Abd Sufyan b. Harith b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib stuck to the Messenaer of Allah (may peace be upon him) and we did not separate from him. And the Messenger of Allah (may place be upon him) was riding on his white mule which had been presented to him by Farwa b. Nufitha al-Judhami. When the Muslims had an encounter with the disbelievers, the Muslims fled, falling back, but the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) began to spur his mule towards the disbelievers. I was holding the bridle of the mule of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) checking it from going very fast, and Abu Sufyan was holding the stirrup of the (mule of the) Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), who said: Abbas, call out to the people of al-Samura. Abbas (who was a man with a loud voice) called out at the top of the voice: Where are the people of Samura? (Abbas said: ) And by God, when they heard my voice, they came back (to us) as cows come back to their calves, and said: We are present, we are present! &#8216;Abbas said: They began to fight the infidels. Then there was a call to The Ansar. Those (who called out to them) shouted: O ye party of the Ansar! O party of the Ansar! Banu al-Harith b. al-Khazraj were the last to be called. Those (who called out to them) shouted: O Banu Al-Harith b. al-Khazraj! O BanU Harith b. al-Khazraj! And the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) who was riding on his mule looked at their fight with his neck stretched forward and he said: This is the time when the fight is raging hot. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) took (some) pebbles and threw them in the face of the infidels. Then he said: By the Lord of Muhammad, the infidels are defeated. &#8216;Abbas said: I went round and saw that the battle was in the same condition in which I had seen it. By Allah, it remained in the same condition until he threw the pebbles. I continued to watch until I found that their force had been spent out and they began to retreat.</span></p>

(Soon) the water-carriers of the Quraish arrived. Among them was a black slave belonging to Banu al-Hajjaj. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) caught him and interrogated him about Abu Sufyan and his companions. He said: I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl, Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him. Then he said: All right, I will tell you about Abu Sufyan. They would stop beating him and then ask him (again) about Abu Sufyan. He would again say&#8217;, I know nothing about Abu Sufyan, but Abu Jahl. &#8216;Utba, Shaiba and Umayya b. Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him likewise. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was standing in prayer. When he saw this he finished his prayer and said: By Allah in Whose control is my life, you beat him when he is telling you the truth, and you let him go when he tells you a lie. The narrator said: Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: This is the place where so and so would be killed. He placed his hand on the earth (saying) here and here; (and) none of them fell away from the place which the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had indicated by placing his hand on the earth.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated by &#8216;Abdullah b. Rabah from Abu Huraira, who said: Many deputations came to Mu&#8217;awiya. This was in the month of Ramadan. We would prepare food for one another. Abu Huraira was one of those who frequently invited us to his house. I said: Should I not prepare food and invite them to my place? So I ordered meals to be prepared Then I met Abu Huraira in the evening and said: (You will have) your meals with me tonight. He said: You have forestalled me. I said: Yes, and invited them. (When they had finished with the meals) Abu Huraira said: Should I not tell yon a tradition from your traditions, O ye assembly of the Ansar? He then gave an account of the Conquest of Mecca and said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) advanced until he reached Mecca. He deputed Zubair on his right flank and Khalid on the left, and he despatched Abu Ubaida with the force that had no armour. They advanced to the interior of the valley. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was in the midst of a large contingent of fighters. He saw me and said: Abu Huraira. I said: I am here at your call, Messenger of Allah I He said: Let no one come to me except the Ansar, so call to me the Ansar (only). Abu Huraira continued: So they gathered round him. The Quraish also gathered their ruffians and their (lowly) followers, and said: We send these forward. If they get anything, we shall be with them (to share it), and if misfortune befalls them, we shall pay (as compensation) whatever we are asked for. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said (to the Ansar): You see the ruffians and the (lowly) followers of the Quraish. And he indicated by (striking) one of his hands over the other that they should be killed and said: Meet me at as-Safa. Then we went on (and) if any one of us wanted that a certain person should be killed, he was killed, and none could offer any resistance. Abu Huraira continued: Then came Abu Sufyan and said: Messenger of Allah, the blood of the Quraish has become very cheap. There will be no Quraish from this day on.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Then he (the Holy Prophet) said: Who enters the house of Abu Sufyan, he will be safe. Some of the Ansar whispered among themselves: (After all), love for his city and tenderness towards his relations have overpowered him. Abu Huraira said: (At this moment) revelation came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) and when he was going to receive the Revelation, we understood it, and when he was (actually) receiving it, none of us would dare raise his eyes to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) until the revelation came to an end. When the revelation came to an end, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: O ye Assembly of the Ansar! They said: Here we are at your disposal, Messenger of Allah. He said: You were saying that love for his city and tenderness towards his people have overpowered this man. They said: So it was. He said: No, never. I am a bondman of God and His Messenger. I migrated towards God and towards you. I will live with you and will die with you. So, they (the Ansar) turned towards him in tears and they were saying: By Allah, we said what we said because of our tenacious attachment to Allah and His Messenger. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Surely, Allah and His Messenger testify to your assertions and accept your apology. The narrator continued: People turned to the house of Abu Sufyan and people locked their doors. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) proceeded until he approached the (Black) Stone. He kissed it and circumambulated the Ka&#8217;ba. He reached near an idol by the side of the Ka&#8217;ba which was worshipped by the people. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had a bow in his hand, and he was holding it from a corner. When he came near the idol, he began to pierce its eyes with the bow and (while doing so) was saying: Truth has been established and falsehood has perished. When he had finished the circumambulation, he came to Safa&#8217;, ascended it to a height from where he could see the Ka&#8217;ba, raised his hands (in prayer) and began to praise Allah and prayed what he wanted to pray.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The tradition has been narrated by a different chain of transmitters with the following additions: (i) Then be (the Messenger of Allah) said with his hands one upon the other: Kill them (who stand in your way)&#8230;. (ii) They (the Ansar) replied: We said so, Messenger of Allah! He said: What is my name? I am but Allah&#8217;s bondman and His Messenger.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Abdullah b. Rabah who said: We came to Mu&#8217;awiya b. Abu Sufyan as a deputation and Abu Huraira was among us. Each of us would prepare food for his companions turn by turn for a day. (Accordingly) when it was my turn I said: Abu Huraira, it is my turn today. So they came to my place. The food was not yet ready, so I said to Abu Huraira: I wish you could narrate to us a tradition from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) until the food was ready. (Complying with my request) Abu Huraira said: We were with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the day of the Conquest of Mecca. He appointed Khalid b. Walid as commander of the right flank, Zubair as commander of the left flank, and Abu &#8216;Ubaida as commander of the foot-soldiers (who were to advance) to the interior of the valley. He (then) said: Abu Huraira, call the Ansar to me. So I called out to them and they came hurriedly. He said: O ye Assembly of the Ansaar, do you see the ruffians of the Quraish? They said: Yes. He said: See, when you meet them tomorrow, wipe them out. He hinted at this with his hand, placing his right hand on his left and said: You will meet us at as-Safa&#8217;. (Abu Huraira continued): Whoever was seen by them that day was put to death. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ascended the mount of as-Safa&#8217;. The Ansar also came there and surrounded the mount. Then came Abu Sufyan and said: Messenger ot Allah, the Quraish have perished. No member of the Quraish tribe will survive this day. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who enters the house of Abu Safyin will be safe, who lays down arms will be safe, who locks his door will be safe. (some of) the Ansar said: (After all) the man has been swayed by tenderness towards his family and love for his city. At this, Divine inspiration descended upon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: You were saying that the man has been swayed by tenderness towards his family and love for his city. Do you know what my name is? I am Muhammad, the bondman of God and His Messenger. (He repeated this thrice.) I left my native place for the take of Allah and joined you. So I will live with you and die with you. Now the Ansar said: By God, we said (that) only out of our greed for Allah and His Messenger. He said: Allah and His Apostle testify to you and accept your apology.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been reported on the authority of Hudbaifa b. al-Yaman who said: Nothing prevented me from being present at! he Battle of Badr except this incident. I came out with my father Husail (to participate in the Battle), but we were caught by the disbelievers of Quraish. They said: (Do) you intend to go to Muhammad? We said: We do not intend to go to him, but we wish to go (back) to Medina. So they took from us a covenant in the name of God that we would turn back to Medina and would not fight on the side of Muhammad (may peace be upon him). So, we came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and related the incident to him. He said: Both, of you proceed (to Medina) ; we will fulfil the covenant made with them and seek God&#8217;s help against them.</span></p>

A man said: If I were in the time of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), I would have fought by his side and would have striven hard for his causes. Hudhaifa said: You might have done that, (but you should not make a flourish of your enthusiasm). I was with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on the night of the Battle of Abzib and we were gripped by a violent wind and severe cold. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be him) said: Hark, the man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgment by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted). We all kept quiet and none of us responed to him. (Again) he said: Hark, a man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgment by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted). We kept quiet and none of us responded to him. He again said: Hark, a man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgtuent by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted) Then he said: Get up Hudhaifa, bring me the news of the enemy. When he called me by name I had no alternative but to get up. He said: Go and bring me information about the enemy, and do nothing that may provoke them against me. When I left him, I felt warm as if I were walking in a heated bath untill I reached them. I saw Abu Sufyan warming his back against fire I put an arrow in the middle of the bow. intending to shoot at him, when I recalled the words of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)&#8221; Do not provoke them against me.&#8221; Had I shot at him, I would have hit him. But I returned and (felt warm as if) I were walking in a heated bath (hammam). Presenting myself before him, I gave him information about the enemy. When I had done so, I began to feel cold, so the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) wrapped me in a blanket that he had in excess to his own requirement and with which he used to cover himself while saying his prayers. So I continued to sleep until it was morning. When it was morning he said: Get up, O heavy sleeper.</span></p>

The one most accursed among the people got up, brought the foetus and, when the Prophet (may peace be upon him) went down in prostration, placed it between his shoulders. Then they laughed at him and some of them leaned upon the others with laughter. And I stood looking. If I had the power, I would have thrown it away from the back of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). The Prophet (may peace be upon him) had bent down his head in prostration and did not raise it, until a man went (to his house) and informed (his daughter) Fatima, who was a young girl (at that time) (about this ugly incident). She came and removed (the filthy thing) from him. Then she turned towards them rebuking them (the mischief-mongers). When the Prophet (may peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, he invoked God&#8217;s imprecations upon them in a loud voice. When he prayed, he prayed thrice, and when he asked for God&#8217;s blessings, he asked thrice. Then he said thrice: O Allah, it is for Thee to deal with the Quraish. When they heard his voice, laughter vanished from them and they feared his malediction. Then he said: O God, it is for Thee to deal with Abu Jahl b. Hisham, &#8216;Utba b. Rabi&#8217;a, Shaiba b.

Ubayy covered his nose with his mantle and said: Do not scatter the dust over us (Not minding this remark), the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) greeted them, stopped, got down from his animal, invited them to Allah, and recited to them the Qur&#8217;an. &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy said: O man, if what you say is the truth, the best thing for you would be not to bother us with it in our assemblies. Get back to your place. Whoso comes to you from us, tell him (all) this. Abdullah b. Rawaha said: Come to us in our gatherings, for we love (to hear) it. The narrator says: (At this), the Muslims, the polytheists and the Jews began to rebuke one another until they were determined to come to blows. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) continued to pacify them. (When they were pacified), he rode his animal and came to Sa&#8217;d b. &#8216;Ubida. He said: Sa&#8217;d, haven&#8217;t you heard what Abu Hubab (meaning &#8216;Abdullah b. Ubayy) has said? He has said so and so. Sa&#8217;d said: Messenger of Allah, forgive and pardon. God has granted you a sublime position, (but so far as he is concerned) the people of this settlement had-decided to make him their king by making him wear a crown and a turban (in token thereof), but God has circumvented this by the truth He has granted you. This has made him jealous and his jealousy (must have) prompted the behaviour that you have witnessed. So, the Holy Prophet (may peace upon him) forgave him.</span></p>

He said: What will you mortgage? He said: What do you want? He said: Pledge me your women. He said: You are the most handsome of the Arabs; should we pledge our women to you?

Then Muhammad b. Maslama promised that he would come to him with Harith, Abu &#8216;Abs b. Jabr and Abbad b. Bishr. So they came and called upon him at night. He came down to them.

Muhammad said to his companions: As he comes down, I will extend my hands towards his head and when I hold him fast, you should do your job. So when he came down and he was holding his cloak under his arm, they said to him: We sense from you a very fine smell. He said: Yes, I have with me a mistress who is the most scented of the women of Arabia. He said: Allow me to smell (the scent on your head). He said: Yes, you may smell. So he caught it and smelt.

We journeyed during the night. One of the people said to (my brother) &#8216;Amir b. al-Akwa&#8217;: Won&#8217;t you recite to us some of your verses? Amir was a poet. So he began to chant his verses to urge the camels, reciting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>O God, if Thou hadst not guided us</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>We would have neither been guided rightly nor practised charity,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Nor offered prayers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>We wish to lay down our lives for Thee; so forgive Thou our lapses,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And keep us steadfast when we encounter (our enemies).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Bestow upon us peace and tranquillity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Behold, when with a cry they called upon us to help.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who is this driver (of the camels)? They said: It is &#8216;Amir. He said: God will show mercy to him. A man said: Martyrdom is reserved for him. Messenger of Allah, would that you had allowed us to benefit ourselves from his life. (The narrator says): We reached Khaibar and besieged them, and (we continued the siege) until extreme hunger afflicted us. Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Behold, God has conquered it for you. When it was evening of the day on which the city was conquered. the Muslims lit many fires. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: What are these fires? And what are they cooking? They said: They are cooking meat. He asked. Which meat? They said: That of domestic asses. He said: Let them throw it away and break the pots (in which it is being cooked). A man said: Or should they throw it away and wash the pots? He said: They may do that. When the people drew themselves up in battle array &#8216;Amir caught hold of his sword that was rather short He drove a Jew before him to strike him with it. (As he struck him), his sword recoiled and struck his own knee, and &#8216;Amir died of the wound. When the people returned (after the conquest of Kliaibar) and he (Salama) had caught hold of my hand, and said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw that I was silent (and dejected) ; he said: What&#8217;s the matter with thee? I said to him: My father and my mother be thy ransom, people presume that &#8216;Amir&#8217;s sacrifice has been in vain. He asked: Who has said that? I said: So and so and Usaid b. Hudair al-Ansari. He said: Who has said that has lied. For him (for &#8216;Amir) there is a double reward. (He indicated this by putting two of his fingers together.) He was a devotee of God and a warrior fighting for His cause. There will be hardly any Arab who can fight as bravely as he did. Qutaiba has differed in a few words.</span></p>

The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon hill) talked about his death and doubted (whether it was martyrdom). (They said): (He is) a man killed by his own weapon, and expressed doubt about his affair. Salama said: When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) returned from Khaibar, I said: Messenger of Allah, permit me that I may recite to you some rajaz verses. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) permitted him. &#8216;Umar b. Khattab said: I know what you will recite. I recited:</span></p>

I said: By God, some people are reluctant to invoke God&#8217;s mercy on him (because) they say he is a man who died by his own sword. (Hearing this) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He died as God&#8217;s devotee and warrior. Ibn Shihab has said: I asked one of the sons of Salama (b.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid b. Abu &#8216;Ubaid who said that he heard Salama b. al-Akwa&#8217; say: I went out before the Adhan for the morning prayer had been delivered. The milch she-camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) were grazing at Dhu Qarad. &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b. Auf&#8217;s slave met me and said: The milch she-camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had been taken away. I said: Who has taken them away? He said: (the people belonging to the tribe of) Ghatafan. I cried thrice: Help! I made the whole city between the two lavas hear my cry. Then I ran straight in their pursuit until I overtook them at Dhu Qarad where they were just going to water their animals. I, being an archer, began to shoot them with my arrows and was saying: I am the son of al-Akwa&#8217;. And today is the day when the cowards will meet their doom. I continued to chant until I rescued the milch she-camels from them, and snatched from them thirty mantles. Now, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and some other people came along. I said: Prophet of Allah, I have prevented them from water while they were thirsty. So you should send a force (to punish them). He (the Holy Prophet) said: Ibn al-Akwa&#8217;, you have taken (what, you have taken). Now let them go. Then we returned and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) made me mount behind him on his she-camel until we entered Medina.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Salama. He heard the tradition from his father who said: We arrived at Hudaibiya with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and we were fourteen hundred in number. There were fifty goats for them which could not be watered (by the small quantity of water in the local well). So, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sat on the brink of the well. Either he prayed or spat into the well The water welled up. We drank and watered (the beasts as well). Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) called us to take the vow of allegiance, as he was sitting at the base of a tree. I was the first man to take the vow. Then other people took the vow. When half the number of people had done so, he said to me: You take the vow, Salama. I said: I was one of those who took the vow in the first instance. He said: (You may do) again. Then the Messenger. of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw that I was without weapons. He gave me a big or a small shield. Then he continued to administer vows to the people until it was the last batch of them. He said (to me): Won&#8217;t you swear allegiance, Salama? I said: Messenger of Allah, I took the oath with the first batch of the people and then again when you were in the middle of the people. He said: (Doesn&#8217;t matter), you may (do so) again. So I took the oath of allegiance thrice. Then he said to me: Salama, where is the shield which I gave to thee? I said: Messenger of Allah, my uncle &#8216;Amir met me and he was without any weapons. So I gave the shield to him. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) laughed and said: You are like a person of the days gone by who said: O God. I seek a friend who is dearer to me than myself. (When all Companions had sworn allegiance to the Holy Prophet), the polytheists sent messages of peace, until people could move from our camp to that of the Meccans and vice versa. Finally, the peace treaty was concluded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I was a dependant of Talha b. Ubaidullah. I watered his horse, rubbed its back. I served Talha (doing odd jobs for him) and partook from his food. I had left my family and my property as an emigrant in the cause of Allah and His Messenger (may peace be uron him). When we and the people of Mecca had concluded a peace treaty and the people of one side began to mix with those of the other, I came to a tree, swept away its thorns and lay down (for rest) at its base; (while I lay there), four of the polytheists from the Meccans came to me and began to talk ill of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I got enraged with them and moved to another tree. They hung their weapons (to the branches of the tree) and lay down (for rest). (While they lay there), somebody from the lower part of the valley cried out: Run up, O Muhajirs! Ibn Zunaim has been murdered. I drew my sword and attacked these four while they were asleep. I seized their arms and collected them up in my hand, and said: By the Being Who has conferred honour upon Muhammad, none of you shall raise his head, else I will smite his face. (Then) I came driving them along to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him). (At the same time). my uncle Amir came (to him) with a man from&#8221; Abalat called Mikraz. Amir was dragging him on a horse with a thick covering on its back along with seventy polytheists. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) cast a glance at them and said: Let them go (so that) they may prove guilty of breach of trust more than once (before we take action against them). So the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) forgave them. On this occasion. God revealed the Qur&#8217;anic verse:&#8221; It is He Who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He had granted you a victory over them&#8221; (xlviii. 24). Then we moved returning to Medina, and halted at a place where there was a mountain between us and Banu Lihyan who were polytheists. The Messenaer of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked God&#8217;s forgiveness for one who ascended the mountain at night to act as a scout for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and his Compinions. I ascended (that mountain) twice or thrice that night. (At last) we reached Medina. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent his camels with his slave, Rabah, and I was with him. I (also) went to the pasture with the horse of Talha along with the camels.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When the day dawned, Abd al-Rahman al-Fazari made a raid and drove away all the camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and killed the man who looked after them. I said: Rabah, ride this horse, take it to Talha b. &#8216;Ubaidullah and Inform the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) that the polytheists have made away with his camels. Then I stood upon a hillock and turning my face to Medina, shouted thrice: Come to our help I Then I set out in pursuit of the raiders, shooting at them with arrows and chanting a (self-eulogatory) verse in the Iambic metre:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I am the son of al-Akwa&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And today is the day of defeat for the mean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I would overtake a man from them, shoot at him an arrow which, piercing through the saddle, would reach his shoulder. and I would say: Take it, chanting at the same time the verse</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And I am the son of al-Akwa&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And tody is the day of defeat for the mean.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>By God, I continued shooting at them and hamstringing their animals. Whenever a horseman turned upon me, I would come to a tree and (hid myself) sitting at its base. Then I would shoot at him and hamstring his horse. (At last) they entered a narrow mountain gorge. I ascended that mountain and held them at bay throwing stones at them. I continued to chase them in this way until I got all the camels of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) released and no camel was left with them. They left me; then I followed them shooting at them (continually) until they dropped more than thirty mantles and thirty lances. lightening their burden. On everything they dropped, I put a mark with the help of (a piece of) stone so that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and his Companions might recognise them (that it was booty left by the enemy). (They went on) until They came to a narrow valley when so and so, son of Badr al-Fazari joined them. They (now) sat down to take their breakfast and I sat on the top of a tapering rock. Al-Fazari said: Who is that fellow I am seeing? They said: This fellow has harassed us. By God, he has not left us since dusk and has been (continually) shooting at us until he has snatched everything from our hands. He said: Four of you should make a dash at him (and kill him). (Accordingly), four of them ascended the mountain coming towards me. When it became possible for me to talk to them, I said: Do you recognise me? They said: No. Who are thou? I said: I am Salama, son of al-Akwa&#8217;. By the Being Who has honoured the countenance of Muhammad (may peace be upon him) I can kill any of you I like but none of you will be able to kill me. One of them said: I think (he is right). So they returned. I did not move from my place until I saw the horsemen of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), who came riding through the trees. Lo! the foremost among them was Akhram al-Asadi.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Behind him was Abu Qatada al-Ansari and behind him was al-Miqdad b. al-Aswad al-Kindi. I caught hold of the rein of Akhram&#8217;s horse (Seeing this). they (the raiders) fled. I said (to Akhram): Akhram, guard yourself against them until Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and his Companions join you. He said: ) Salama, if you believe In Allah and the Day of Judgment and (if) you kaow that Paradise is a reality and Hell is a reality, you should not stand between me and martyrdom. so I let him go. Akhram and Abd al-Rahman (Fazari) met in combat. Akhram hamstrung Abd al-Rahman&#8217;s horse and the latter struck him with his lance and killed him. Abd al-Rabman turned about riding Akhram&#8217;s horse. Abu Qatada, a horse-man of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), met &#8216;Abd al-Rahman (in combat), smote him with his lance and killed him. By the Being Who honoured the countenance of Muhammad (may peace oe upon him), I followed them running on my feet (so fast) that I couldn&#8217;t see behind me the Companions of Muhammad (may peace be upon him), nor any dust raised by their horses. (I followed them) until before sunset they reached a valley which had a spring of water, which was called Dhu Qarad, so that they could have a drink, for they were thirsty. They saw me running towards them. I turned them out of the valley before they could drink a drop of its water. They left the valley and ran down a slope. I ran (behind them), overtook a man from them, shot him with an arrow through the shoulder blade and said: Take this. I am the son of al-Akwa&#8217;; and today is the day of annihilation for the people who are mean. The fellow (who was wounded) said: May his mother weep over him! Are you the Akwa&#8217; who has been chasing us since morning? I said: Yes, O enemy of thyself, the same Akwa&#8217;. They left two horses dead tired on the hillock and I came dragging them along to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I met &#8216;Amir who had with him a container having milk diluted with water and a container having water. I performed ablution with the water and drank the milk. Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) while he was at (the spring of) water from which I had driven them away. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had captured those camels and everything else I had captured and all the lances and mantles I had snatched from the polytheists and Bilal had slaughtered a she-camel from the camels I had seized from the people, and was roasting its liver and hump for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I said: Messenger of Allah, let me select from our people one hundred men and I will follow the marauders and I will finish them all so that nobody is left to convey the news (of their destruction to their people). (At these words of mine), the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) laughed so much that his molar teeth could be seen in the light of the fire, and he said: Salama, do you think you can do this? I said: Yes, by the Being Who has honoured you. He said: Now they have reached the land of Ghatafan where they are being feted. (At this time) a man from the Ghatafan came along and said: So and so slaughtered a camel for them. When they were exposing its skin, they saw dust (being raised far off). They said: They (Akwa&#8217; and his companions) have come. So. they went away fleeing.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When it was morning, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Our best horseman today is Abu Qatada and our best footman today is Salama. Then he gave me two shares of the booty-the share meant for the horseman and the share meant for the footman, and combined both of them for me. Intending to return to Medina, he made me mount behind him on his she-camel named al-Adba&#8217;. While we were travelling, a man from the Ansar who could not be beaten in a race said: Is there anyone who could compete (with me) in race to Medina? Is there any competitor? He continued repeating this. When I heard his talk, I said: Don&#8217;t you show consideration to a dignified person and don&#8217;t you have awe for a noble man? He said: No, unless he be the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). I said: Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be thy ransom, let me get down so that I may beat this man (in the race). He said: It you wish, (you may). I said (to the man): I am coming to thee, I then turned my feet. sprang up and tan and gasped (for a while) when one or two elevated places were left and again followed his heel and again gasped (for a while) when one or two elevated places were left and again dashed until I joined him and gave a blow between his shoulders. I said: You have been overtaken, by God. He said: I think so. Thus, I reached Medina ahead of him. By God, we had stayed there only three nights when we set out to Khaibar with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). (On the way) my uncle, Amir, began to recite the following rajaz verses for the people:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>By God, if Thou hadst not guided us aright,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>We would have neither practised charity nor offered prayers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>(O God! ) We cannot do without Thy favours;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Keep us steadfast when we encounter the enemy,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>And descend tranquillity upon us.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who is this? &#8216;Amir said: it is &#8216;Amir. He said: May thy God forgive thee! The narrator said: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked forgiveness for a particular person, he was sure to embrace martyrdom. Umar b. Khattab who was riding on his camel called out: Prophet of Allah, I wish you had allowed us to benefit from Amir. Salama continued: When we reached Khaibar, its king named Marhab advanced brandishing his sword and chanting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Khaibar knows that I am Marhab (who behaves like)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A fully armed, and well-tried warrior.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When the war comes spreading its flames.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>My uncle, Amir, came out to combat with him, saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Khaibar certainly knows that I am &#8216;Amir,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A fully armed veteran who plunges into battles.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>They exchanged blows. Marbab&#8217;s sword struck the shield of &#8216;Amir who bent forward to attack his opponent from below, but his sword recoiled upon him and cut the main artery: in his forearm which caused his death. Salama said: I came out and beard some people among the Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) as saying: Amir&#8217;s deed has gone waste; he has killed himself. So I came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) weeping and I said: Messenger of Allah. Amir&#8217;s deed has gone waste. The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Who passed this remark? I said: Some of your Companions. He said: He who has passed that remark has told a lie, for &#8216;Amir there is a double reward. Then he sent me to &#8216;Ali who had tore eyes, and said: I will give the banner to a man who loves Allah and His Messenger or whom Allah and His Messenger love. So I went to &#8216;Ali, brought him beading him along and he had sore eyes, and I took him to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), who applied his saliva to his eyes and he got well. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) gave him the banner (and &#8216;Ali went to meet Marhab in a single combat). The latter advanced chanting:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Khaibar knows certainly that I am Marhab,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>A fully armed and well-tried valorous warrior (hero)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>When war comes spreading its flames.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>&#8216;Ali chanted in reply:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>I am the one whose mother named him Haidar, (And am) like a lion of the forest with a terror-striking countenance. I give my opponents the measure of sandara in exchange for sa&#8217; (i. e. return thir attack with one that is much more fierce).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The narrator said: &#8216;Ali struck at the head of Mirhab and killed him, so the victory (capture of Khaibar) was due to him. This long tradition has also been handed down Through a different chain of transmitters.</span></p>

Ibn Abbas said: If I had not the fear of committing (sin) for concealing the knowledge I would not have written to him. Najda wrote to him saying (after praising the Almighty and invoking blessings on the Prophet): Tell me whether the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) took women to participate with him in Jihad; (if he did), whether he allotted them a regular share from the booty; whether he killed the children of (the enemy in the war how long an orphan would be entitled to consideration as such and for whom the Kbums (fifth part of the booty) was booty. Ibn Abbas wrote to him: You have written asking me whether the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) took women with him to participate in Jihad. He did take them to the battle and sometimes he fought along with them. They would treat the wounded and were given a reward from the booty, but he did not assign any regular share for them. And the of Allah (may peace be upon him) did not kill the children of the enemy, so thou shouldst not kill the children. Also you have written to me asking me when the orphanhood of an orphan comes to an end. By my life, if a man has become bearded but is still incapable of getting his due from others as well u meeting his obligation towards them, (he is yet an orphan to be treated you such), but when he can look after his interests like grown-up people, he is no longer an orphan. And you have written to me inquiring about Khums as to whom it is meant for. (In this connection) we (the kinsmen of the Messenger of Allah) used to say: It is for us, but those people (i. e.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid b. Hurmuz who said: Najda b. &#8216;Amir al-Haruri wrote to Ibn Abbas asking him about the slave and the woman as to whether they would get a share from the booty (it they participated in Jihad) ; about the killing of (enemy) children (in war) ; about the orphan as to when his orphanhood comes to an end; about kinsmen (of the Holy Prophet) as to who they are. He said to Yazid: Write to him. (If he were not likely to fall into folly, I would not have written to him.) Write: You have written asking about the woman and the slave whether they would get a share of the booty if they participated in Jihad. (You should know that) there is nothing of the sort for them except that they will be given a prize. And you have written asking me about the killing of the enemy children in war. (You should understand that) the Messenger of Allah (may peare be upon him) did not kill them. and thou shouldst not kill them unless thou knew what the companion of Moses (i. e. Khadir) knew about the boy he had killed. And you have written asking me about the orphan as to when the period of his orphanhood comes to an end, so that the sobriquet of&#8221; orphan&#8221; is dropped from him. (In this regard, you should know that) the sobriquet&#8221; orphan&#8221; will not be dropped from him until he attains maturity of body and mind. And you have written asking me about the close relatives (of the Holy Prophet) as to who they are. We think that it is we, but our people have denied us this (position and its concomitant privileges).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It has been narrated on the anthority of Yazid b. Hurmuz who said: Najda wrote to Ibn Abbas. I was sitting in the company of Ibn &#8216;Abbas when he read his letter and wrote its reply. Ibn Abbas said: Were it not for preventing him from falling into wickedness. I would not have replied to his letter, may he never be joyful. He wrote in reply to him referring to the share of the close relatives (of the Holy Prophet) (from the booty) whom God has mentioned. (I have to tell you that) we thought we were the close relatives of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), but our people have refused to recognise us as such. You have asked about the orphan as to when his orphanhood comes to an end. (I have to say that) when he reaches the age of marriage, attains maturity of mind, and his property is returned to him, then he is no longer an orphan. You have inquired whether the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upo him) used to kill anyone from the children of the polytheists in the war. (You should know that) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) used not to kill any one of their children, and you (too) should not kill any one of them, except when you knew about them what Khadir had known about the boy whom he killed. And you have inquired whether there is a fixed share of the booty for women and slaves when they participate in a battle. (I have to tell you that) there is no fixed share for them except that they will be given some reward from the spoils of war.</span></p>

I said: Even if them (the trained dogs) kill that (the game)? He (the Holy    Prophet) said: Even if these kill, but (on the condition) that no other dog, which you did    not set off (along with your dogs), participates (in catching the game). I said to him: I    throw Mi&#8217;rad, a heavy featherless blunt arrow, for hunting and killing (the game).    Thereupon he said: When you throw Mi&#8217;rad, and it pierces, then eat, but if it falls flatly    (and beats the game to death), then do not eat that.</font></p>

Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: When you set of your trained dogs    having recited the name of Allah, then eat what these (hounds) have caught for you, oven    if it (the game) is killed, provided (the hunting dog) has not eaten (any part of the    game). If it has eaten (the game), then you don&#8217;t eat it as I fear that it might have    caught for its own self. And do not eat in case other dogs have joined your trained dogs.</font></p>

He    said: If it strikes (the game) with its point, then eat, but if it strikes flatly and it    dies, that is Waqidh (beaten into death), do not eat that. I asked the Messenger of Allah    (may peace be upon him) about (hunting with the help of) dogs, whereupon he said. When you    send your dog (for hunting) reciting the name of Allah, then eat (the game), but if some    part of it is eaten (by the dogs, then do not eat that, for it (your dog) has caught that    (the-game) for itself. I (again) said: If I find along with my dog another dog, and do not    know which of (the dogs) has caught (the game). then (what should I do)? Thereupon he    (&#8216;Allah&#8217;s Messenger) said: Then don&#8217;t eat that, for you recited the name of Allah on your    dog and not on the other one.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jabir reported: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace he upon him)    sent us (on an expedition) and appointed Abu &#8216;Ubaida our chief that we might intercept a    caravan of the Quraish and provided us with a bag of dates. And he found for us nothing    besides it. Abu Ubaida gave each of us one date (everyday). I (Abu Zubair, one of the    narrators) said: What did you do with that? He said: We sucked that just as a baby sucks    and then drank water over that, and it sufficed us for the day until night. We beat off    leaves with the help of our staffs, then drenched them with water and ate them. We then    went to the coast of the sea, and there rose before us on the coast of the sea something    like a big mound. We came near that and we found that it was a beast, called al-&#8216;Anbar    (spermaceti whale). Abu &#8216;Ubaida said. It is dead. He then said: No (but it does not    matter), we have been sent by the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the path    of Allah and you are hard pressed (on account of the scarcity of food), so you eat that.    We three hundred in number stayed there for a month, until we grew bulky. He (Jabir) said:    I saw how we extracted pitcher after pitcher full of fat from the cavity of its eye, and    sliced from it compact piece of meat equal to a bull or like a bull. Abu &#8216;Ubaida called    forth thirteen men from us and he made them sit in the cavity of its eye, and he took hold    of one of the ribs of its chest and made it stand and then saddled the biggest of the    camels we had with us and it passed under it (the arched rib), and we provided ourselves    with pieces of boiled meat (especially for use in our journey). When we came back to    Medina, we went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and made a mention of that to    him, whereupon he said: That was a provision which Allah had brought forth for you. Is    there any piece of meat (left) with you, so tnat you give to us that? He (Jabir) said: We    sent to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) tome of that (a piece of meat) and he    ate it.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jabir b. &#8216;Abdullah reported: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace    he upon him) sent us (on an expedition). We were three hundred riders and our chief    (leader) was &#8216;Ubaida b. al-Jarrah. We were on the look out for a caravan of the Quraish.    So we stayed on the coast for half a month, and were so much afflicted by extreme hunger    that we (were obliged) to eat leaves. That is why it was called the Detachment of the    Leaves. The ocean cast out for us an animal which was called al-&#8216;Anbar (whale). We ate of    that for half of the month and rubbed its fat on our (bodies) until our bodies became    stout. Abu &#8216;Ubaida caught hold of one of its ribs and fixed that up. He then cast a glance    at the tallest man of the army and the highest of the camels. and then made him ride over    that, and that-tnan passed beneath it (the rib), and many a man could sit in its    eye-socket, and we extracted many pitchers of fat from the cavity of its eye. We had small    bags containing dates with us (before finding the whale). &#8216;Ubaida gave every person    amongst us a handful of dates (and when the provision ran short), he then gave each one of    us one date. And when that (stock) was exhausted, we felt its loss.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 22: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book of Sacrifices (Kitab Al-Adahi)  </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Religion, at its highest and best, is the devotion of the  total self, through service and adoration, to the Almighty Who controls the universe. In  this sense all the manifold rites, consecrations, and purifications, offerings and sacred  feasts, all the working of asceticism and morality are only the indirect expression of the  inner experience of religion-the experience of trust, surrender, yearning and enthusiasm.  Sacrifice, whether that of wealth or desires, is the practical proof of man&#8217;s devotion to  his Creator. It is in fact religion in action. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Holy Qur&#8217;an expresses this attitude of mind and heart  in the following words:&#8221; Say: Truly, my prayer and my service of sacrifice, and my  living and my dying are for God (alone), the Sustainer of all the worlds, in Whose  Divinity none has a share. Thus I have been bidden-and I am foremost among those who  surrender themselves unto Him&#8221; (vi. 162-163). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The &#8216;Id al-Adha is commemorative of that unparalleled act  of devotion of that noble soul. Abraham (peace be upon him), who, in obedience to the  Command of his Lord, readily offered the life of his son Isma&#8217;il. The Holy Qur&#8217;an narrates  this soul- stirring event in these words:&#8221; And when he (Isma&#8217;il) attained the age to  assist him in his (Abrahm&#8217;s) work, he (Abraham) said: O my son! I see in vision that I  offer thee in sacrifice. Now see what is thy view. The son said: O my father, do as thou  art commanded. Thou wilt find me, if God so wills, patient. So when they both had  surrendered themselves to (Allah), and he laid him down prostrate on his forehead (for  sacrifice), We called out to him: O Abraham, thou hast indeed fulfilled the vision. Thus  do We reward the doers of good. Surely this is a manifest trial. And We ransom- ed him  with a great sacrifice. And We left (this blessing) for him among the later generations.  Peace be upon Abraham I Thus indeed do We reward those who do good; for he was one of Our  believing servants&#8221; (xxxvii. 102-111) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the above-quoted verses &#8216;axim (great), the adjective  qualifying&#8221; Sacrifice.&#8221; may be understood both in literal and figurative sense.  In literal sense it implies that a big ram was substituted. The figurative sense is even  more important. It was indeed a great and momentous occasion, when two men with  concentrated will ranged themselves in ranks of those to whom self-sacrifice in the  service of God was the supreme thing in life. Similarly, the words&#8221; thou hast indeed  fulfilled the vision&#8221; show that it was not in fact the act of slaughtering which was  needed for the fulfilment of the vision, but it was the attitude of submission and  surrender, an attitude of preparedness to sacrifice one&#8217;s all in the path of Allah. that  was demanded of Abraham and his illustrious son, and they eminently stood this test. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Readiness to Sacrifice One&#8217;s Life. In Islam the act of  sacrifice is the symbol of a Muslim&#8217;s readiness to lay down his life, and to sacrifice all  his interests and desires in the cause of truth. The purpose of sacrifice is not fulfilled  only by shedding the blood of an animal, but it is really fulfilled when a man submits  himself completely to the command of Allah. This has been clearly laid down in Sura Hajj,  verse 37;&#8221; Not their flesh, nor their blood reaches Allah, but it is the piety from  you that reaches Him.&#8221; This verse eloquently speaks of the fact that sacrifice in  Islam is nothing else than a natural expression of homage and gratitude to the Creator. It  is the spirit of willing devotion and cheerful obedience underlying sacrifices that is  accepted by Allah Who is the Fountainhead of all morality. It is only piety of heart.  nobility of soul and righteousness of conduct, that is acceptable to Him. It is  essentially symbolic, an external symbol of dedication, devotion to Allah. Tafsir Ibn  Kathir stresses this point:&#8221; The man who offers sacrifice should keep this fact  uppermost in his mind that the most important motive behind this is the willing submission  to Allah&#8221; &#8216; (Vol. VI, p. 183). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Such truths, so self-evident to the Muslim readers, needed  a clear and emphatic enunciation in view of the horrible misconceptions which had crowded  round the act of sacrifice before Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; Throughout the Semitic field,&#8221; observes  Robertson Smith, in his well known book. The Religion of the Semitics, the fundamental  idea of sacrifice was that of communion between the God and his worshipper by joint  participation in the living flesh and blood of a sacred victim&#8221; (p. 49). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; The Greeks also looked upon sacrifice as a  &#8216;Communion feast&#8217; with the Divinity, in which the God and his people became of one flesh  by partaking together of the flesh of the victim; the animal was regarded, as in some  degree, divine, as having the divine spirit incarnate in it. Among the Babylonians the  gods feast in heaven, they eat the offerings, they scent the savour, like flies do they  gather themselves together with the offerers&#8221; (Hastings, Encyclopedia of Rdigion  &amp; Ethics, Article&#8221; Sacrifice&#8221; ). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Holy Qur&#8217;an strikes at the very root of such wrong  concepts of sacrifice and asserts that&#8221; it is neither the flesh nor the blood of  (animals) that reaches Allah, but it is your piety that reaches Him,&#8221; for God does  not stand In need of food or blood. What He, in fact, desires is the devotion and piety of  our hearts. and, as a symbol of such offer, the visible institution of sacrifice has been  instituted. The Holy Qur&#8217;an has further elucidated the main parpose of the institution of  sacrifice.&#8221; For every people did We appoint rites (of sacrifice) that they might  celebrate the name of God over the sustenance He gave them from animals (fit for food).  But your God is One God. Sub- mit then your wills to him (in Islam)&#8230;. The sacrificial  camels We have made for you as among the symbols from God. In them is (much) good for you  So mention the name of Allah on them standing in a row. Then when they fall down on their  sides, eat of them, feed the contented one and the beggar. Thus have We made them  subservient to you that you may be grateful&#8221; (xxii. 34-38). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Qur&#8217;an testifies to the historical fact that whatever  may be the outward symbols of sacrifice, it has been accepted in one form or another by  all the nations of the world. It had been a fundamental element of both Jewish and Gentile  religions, and Christianity. It had been corrupted by many wrong practices and been  overlaid by many wrong notions before the advent of Islam. Islam purifies it from all  wrong notions and practices connected with it, and makes it explicitly clear that the act  of sacrifice is an outward symbol of man&#8217;s readiness to lay down his life, if required,  and to surrender all his interests in the cause of truth and righteousness. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The words&#8221; We have made them (subservient) to  you&#8221; have a very wide significance. A Muslim has been awakened to the realisation of  the fact that if they offer as a sacrifice an animal over which they hold control, it is  their bounden duty to lay down their lives in the way of Allah, Who is not only their  Master, but also their Creator and Sustainer and Who. therefore, exercises a far greater  authority over them than they do over the animals. This should be the true motive of  sacrifice, and it is with this spirit that this act should be performed. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Qur&#8217;anic words&#8221; To Him is acceptable observance of  duty on your part&#8221; make it abundantly clear that the prevalent idea of atonement  that&#8221; it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul&#8221; (Leviticus; 17: 11)  has no foundation in Islam. The expiation of sin in Islam rests entirely on the good deeds  of men, repentance of the Winners and the Forgiving and Merciful nature of God &#8216;This fact  cuts the ground from under the feet of any theory of an atoning sacrifice. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The opening verse&#8221; For every people did We appoint  rites (of sacrifice) that they might celebrate the name of God over the beast cattle  wherewith He bath provided them,&#8221; speaks of the fact that the very idea of human  sacrifice is repugnant to the true religion and Allah has never given it sanction. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>This practice of human sacrifice was not uncommon before  Islam.&#8221; Both on the mainland of Greece and in the Greek colonies human sacrifice was  practised, usually as a means towards expulsion of evil&#8221; (Encydopaedia Britannica,  Article&#8217;on&#8221; Sacrifice&#8221; ). it occupied a prominent place in the ritual of the  mother goddesses of ancient times. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; The ordinary form of sacrifice,&#8221; says E. O.  James, in his famous book, The origins of Sacrifice,&#8221; consisted in stripping the  victim of his ornaments, stretching him over the convex sacrificial stones and while fare  priests held his arms, legs, head, the high priests or sacrificer cut open his breast with  a flint or obsidian knife, and tore out the heart. This was held up to the sun to provide  it with nourishment, before it was cast into a basin of Copal placed in a position to  enable the blood and incense to ascend to the gods. The body was hurled down the steps of  the temple to the court where it was seized by the priest or by the warrior who captured  the victim. Some times a solemn feast was then held on the flesh, the skin having first  been removed to be worn ceremonially by men who seem to have acquired thereby the  fertilising nd health-giving qualities of the victim. Some of the blood was carried to  certain temples and smeared on the hips of the images of gods&#8221; (pp. 84-6). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam has not only exterminated the very idea of human  sacrifice, but has completely ended all such inhuman practices which were very common with  the people before Islam. The Holy Qur&#8217;an makes a pointed reference to the fact that this  sacrifice of animals is commemorative of Abraham&#8217;s offer of his son&#8217;s life at the Command  of Allah, who was substituted by a ram, and it has been perpetuated by Islam. It is  narrated that once the Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) asked him  about the sacrifice. He replied:&#8221; This is commemorative Sunnah of your father  Abraham&#8221; (vide Ibn Kathir, Vol. III, p. 221). That this practice of sacrifice was  already prevalent amongst the people before Islam can be well borne out by the fact that  we find clear references to it in the poetry of pre-Islamic Arabia. The well. known poet  Umayya observes: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abraham was one who would fulfil the pledges and offer  sacrifices for Allah&#8217;s sake. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Thus he offered the life of his only son whose separation  and whose risk of life, he could not bear. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He said,&#8221; O my son I have pledged you to Allah. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>May I sacrifice my life for you! </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Be steadfast and firm.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He had hardly taken off the shirt of his son, when Allah  substituted Isma&#8217;il by a stout ram. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Not only this practice of sacrifice has been preserved in  Islam, but even the way of Abraham&#8217;s has been declared to he one of righteousness and  truthfulness: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; Say: Behold, my Lord has guided me to a way that is  straight-a religion of Right Path-the Path (trodden) by Abraham, who was wholly devoted to  God, and was not of those who ascribe divinity to any beside him&#8221; (vi. 161). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Even the Millat has been assigned a name after the name of  Abraham: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; He hath selected you and hath not placed upon you  any hardship in religion-the religion of your father, Abraham. He named you Muslims before  this, and in this, that the Messenger may be a witness to you and you may he witnesses to  mankind&#8221; (xxii. 78). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Historical Continuity, The constant reference to the  earlier Prophets and the Qur&#8217;anic testimony to their righteousness and the preservation of  some of their religious practices have been done to awaken the people to the realisation  of a fundamental fact, i. e. the fact of the historical continuity of religious  experience. The Muslims have been asked to believe in that which has been revealed unto  Prophet Muhammad (may peace be upon him) as well as in that which was revealed before him.  Life-so the Qur&#8217;an teaches us-is not a series of disconnected parts but a continuous,  organic process: and this law applies also to the law of the mind, of which man&#8217;s  religious experience (in its cumulative sense) is a part. To make religious experience  more living, to set Allah the Ever-living with loving vividness before the eyes of living  men, to make them feel Him as actually and eternally present in their lives, man needs a  path, clear-cut path, lightened with glories of the Messengers of Allah-a path on which  one should not feel lonely but the strength of comradeship of those noble souls upon whom  Allah has bestowed His choicest blessings. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A few words may be said about the way how an animal should  be slaughtered according to the teachings of Islam. Three are the aims which should be  kept before the mind while slaughtering the animal: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It should be slaughtered by reciting the name of Allah and  glorifying Him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It should be slaughtered with a sharp knife so that its  jugular vein may be cut with the minimum possible pain and its skin should not be removed  and limbs should not be cut so long as there is any sign of life in it. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The head should not be removed from the body abruptly but  only the jugular vein should be cut so that even the last drop of blood flows out of its  body. If the animal is beheaded with a stroke, the blood congeals in its veins which makes  the flesh distasteful and pernicious to health. </font></p>

Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet)    said: One who slaughtered his sacrificial animal before his prayer or our prayer (&#8216;Id), he    should slaughter another one in its stead, and he who did not slaughter, he should    slaughter by reciting the name of Allah.</font></p>

Then eat, but not the tooth or nail. And I am    going to tell you why it is not permissible to slaughter the animal with the help of tooth    and bone; and as for the nail. it is a bone, and the bone is the knife of Abyssinians. He    (the narrator) said: There fell to our lot as spoils of war camels and goats, and one of    the camels among them became wild.

Thereupon he (liadrat &#8216;All) was    enraged and said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) did not tell me anything in    secret that he hid from people, except that he told me four things. He said: Com- mader of    Faithful, what are these? He said: Allah cursed him who cursed his father; Allah cursed    him who sacrificed for anyone besides Allah; and Allah cursed him who accommodates an    innovator (in religion) ; and Allah cursed him who changed the minarets (the boundary    lines) of the land.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 20: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book on Government (Kitab Al-Imara)  </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam is a social religion, not in the sense that it is  through society alone that religion breathes its sacred spirit in the individuals, but in  the sense that it aims at inculcating God-consciousness both in individual and society.  Jesus said: The Kingdom of Heaven is within you. Islam fully subscribes to this view,  since no just kingdom can be founded on earth by unjust men, who have not first created  the Kingdom of Heaven in their hearts, but Islam goes a step forward and says that the  creation of the Kingdom of Heaven within heart is not enough; this Kingdom of Heaven  within must be externalised into a Kingdom of Heaven on earth, so that the organised life  of man may be built up on the basis of love, fraternity and justice. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It thus becomes clear that the Islamic State is not an end  in itself, but a means to an end, the end being the development of a community of people  who stand up for equity and justice, for right against wrong or, to phrase it differently,  for the creation of such conditions as would enable the greatest possible number of human  beings to live spiritually, morally and physically in accordance with the teachings of  Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Thus the founding of an Islamic State is not a sort  of&#8221; worldly activity,&#8221; something undesirable, as some people wrongly suppose,  but the sine qua non of social justice, as demanded by Islam.&#8221; The state,&#8221; says  Dr lqbal,&#8221; from the Islamic standpoint, is an endeavour to transform these ideal  principles into space-time forces, an aspiration to realize them in a definite human  organization. It is in this sense alone that state in Islam is a theocracy, not in the  sense that it is headed by a representative of God on earth who can always screen his  despotic will behind his supposed infallibility. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>As this State is meant to enforce the law of the Shari&#8217;ah  within its territorial jurisdiction, it is duty bound to make itself an efficient organ  for transforming the high ideals of Islam into reality. The Qur&#8217;an, while enumerating the  main functions of the Islamic State, says:&#8221; Those who, if We establish them in the  land, observe worship, and pay the poor-due and enjoin good and forbid evil&#8221; (xxii.  41). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>This shows that the function of an Islamic State is not  only to defend its citizens from external attack and internal disorder, but also to enable  individual man and woman to realise the tenets of Islam and their beliefs. in the  socioeconomic concerts of their practical life. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So far as the nature of the Islamic State is concerned, it  is theocracy with regard to God in the sense that the de jure sovereignty belongs to Allah  Whose de facto sovereignty is inherent and manifest in the working of the entire universe  and Who enjoys exclusively the sovereign prerogative over all the creation. The Holy  Qur&#8217;an has stressed this point in so many verses: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; The Command is for none but for Allah: He has  commanded that ye obey </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>none but Him: that is the right path&#8221; (xii. 40). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; Follow the revelation sent unto you from your Lord,  and do not follow the (so-called) guardians other than Him&#8221; (vii. 3). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8221; And those who do not make their decisions in  accordance with that revealed by Allah are (in fact) the deniers of Truth&#8221; (v. 44).  It thus becomes quite clear that a State established on the basis of God&#8217;s sovereignty  cannot enforce any law in contravention of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah even if all the  citizens make a demand for it. An Islamic State is, therefore, theocratic in one aspect as  it is run according to God-given laws, but it is altogether a differmt theocracy of which  Europe has had the bitter experience and in which, a priestly clan is sharply marked off  from the rest of the population and exercises an unchecked domination and enforces laws of  its own making in the name of God, and thus imposes its own godhood upon the common  people. The priest puts himself as a mediator between the masses and the unseen God. Such  a system is quite un-Islamic. The theocracy built by Islam is not ruled by a particular  religious class, but by the whole community of Muslims including the rank and file. as  Allah has not appointed a particular individual, group, race or class as the  representative of the Real Sovereign upon the earth, but the whole community. The Qur&#8217;an  says:&#8221; Allah has promised to those among you who believe and do righteous deeds that  He will assuredly make them to succeed (the present) rulers and grant them vicegerency in  the land just as He made those before them to succeed (others)&#8221; (ixiv. 55). This  verse makes it clear that all believers have been conferred upon the Caliphate and not a  special class or dynasty. Moreover, the Caliphate granted by Allah to the faithful is the  popular vicegerency and not a limited one and thus it is run with the consent of the  people. The concepts of the Divine Right of Kingship and the infallibility of clergy are  alien to the spirit of Islam. Every Muslim stands on equal level with the other Muslim as  the vicegerent of the Lord upon the earth. None of them, therefore, enjoys any preference  to the other by virtue of high birth or belonging to a special religious group. History is  teplete with instances of Caliphs being brought to the court and publicly criticised by  ordinary men and women. Even a lowliest villager could dare tell the Commander of the  Faithful that he would set him straight like a spindle if he deviates an inch from the  poth of righteousness. This shows that the rulers and the officials in the Islamic State  are answerable both to God and man for their actions, and the people have every right to  criticise. not only their public behaviour, but even their private activities. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the context of such heavy responsibilities the heading  of the Islamic State or assumption of any other important portfolio in its set-up is a  very difficult job so much so that that Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) compared it  to the slaughtering of one with a blunt knife. No person, therefore. who is conscious of  the responsibilities of the job, covets to assume that; he rather shirks it and accepts it  only when he is compelled to do so. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) declared that  person to be quite unfit for office in an Islamic State who is covetous of it, as he is  either ignorant of its grave responsibilities or desires to take undue advantage of his  official power. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We enumerate below some of the important rights and duties  of an Islamic State. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>As for the rights, the Islamic State can claim full loyalty  from all its citizen wholehearted cooperation in all sectors of life and complete  obedience to the law of the land and the commands of the rulers so long as they are in  comformity with the Laws of the Shari&#8217;ah. But where the rulers transgress the limits of  the citizens have the right, not only to withdraw co-operation, but also to check the  rulers from acting against the Commands of Aliah and His Apostle (may peace be upon him). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The citizens are also required to pay taxes due to the  State quite willingly and not to misappropriate its funds, and to participate in Jihad in  any capacity for which they are deemed fit by the authorities of the Islamic State. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So far as the duties of the Islamic State are concerned,  the first and foremost duty is to protect the life, property and honour of every citizen,  irrespective of his caste, creed, colour, religion or social status. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Moreover, it is also the duty of the Islamic State to  protect the freedom and individual liberty of every citizen so long as there is no valid  reason to curtail it. It cannot be done as an arbitrary act. The State is authorised to  lay hands upon it through due process of law. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Again, freedom of expression is one of the fundamental  rights of the citizen which an Islamic State must respect. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then, it is also the duty of the Islamic State to see that  no citizen remains unprovided for in respect of the basic necessities of life, viz, food,  othing, shelter, medical aid and education, for the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him)  said:&#8221; The government is the guardian of those who have no guardian.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Moreover, the State is bound to create such conditions in  which the good reigns supreme in the society and evil is suppressed and exterminated, and  its citizens learn to live as good Muslims. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>

To look after the people is more serious and grave. (The dying Caliph) was moved at my    words.

I said: By God Who sent thee on    thy mission with truth, they did not disclose to me what they had in their minds, and I    did not know that they would ask for a position. The narrator says (while recalling this    hadith): I visualise as if I were looking at the miswak of the Holy Prophet (may peace be    upon him) between his lips. He (the Holy Prophet) said: We shall not or shall never    appoint to the public offices (in our State) those who with to have them, but you may go,    Abu Musa (or Abdullah b. Qais) (to take up your assignment). He sent him to Yemen as    governor. then he sent Mu&#8217;adh b. jabal in his wake (to help him in the discharge of    duties). When Mu&#8217;adh reached the camp of Abu Musa, the latter (received him and) said:    Please get yourself down; and he spread for him a mattress, while there was a man bound    hand and foot as a prisoner. Mu&#8217;adh said: Who is this? Abu Musa said: He was a Jew. He    embraced Islam. Then he reverted to his false religion and became a Jew. Mu&#8217;adh said: I    won&#8217;t sit until he is killed according to the decree of Allah and His Apostle (may peace    be upon him) (in this case). Abu Musa said: Be seated. It will be done. He said: I won&#8217;t    sit unless he is killed in accordance with the decree of Allah and His Apostle (may peace    be upon him). He repeated these words thrice. Then Abu Musa ordered him (to be killed) and    he was kilied. Then the two talked of standing in prayer at night. One of them, i. e.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It has been narrated on the authority of Abu &#8216;Abd al-Rahman    from &#8216;Ali that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent a force (on a mission)    and appointed over them a man. He kindled a fire and said: Enter it. Some people made up    their minds to enter it (the fire), (carrying out the order of their commander), but the    others said: We fled from the fire (that&#8217;s why we have come into the fold of Islam). The    matter was reported to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said to those    who Contemplated entering (the fire at the order of their commander): If you had entered    it, you would have remained there until the Day of Judgment. He commanded the act of the    latter group and said: There is no submission in matters involving God&#8217;s disobedience or    displeasure. Submission is obligatory only in what is good (and reasonable).</font></p>

(While making the appointment), he ordered that his work    should be listened to and obeyed. They made him angry in a matter. He said: Collect for me    dry wood. They collected it for him. Then he said: Kindle a fire. They kindled (the fire).    Then he said: Didn&#8217;t the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) order you to listen to    me and obey (my orders)? They said: Yes. He said: Enter the fire. The narrator says: (At    this), they began to look at one another and said: We fled from the fire to (find refuge    with) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) (and now you order us to enter it).    They stood quiet until his anger cooled down and the fire went out. When they returned,    they related the incident to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: If    they had entered it, they would not have come out. Obedience (to the commander) is    obligatory only in what is good.</font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It has been narrated on the authority of &#8216;Abd al-Rahman b.    Abd Rabb al-Ka&#8217;ba who said: I entered the mosque when &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr b. al-&#8216;As was    sitting in the shade of the Ka&#8217;ba and the people had gathered around him. I betook myself    to them and sat near him. (Now) Abdullah said: I accompanied the Messenger of Allah (may    peace be upon him) on a journey. We halted at a place. Some of us began to set right their    tents, others began to compete with one another in shooting, and others began to graze    their beasts, when an announcer of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)    announced that the people should gather together for prayer, so we gathered around the    Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: It was the duty of every Prophet that    has gone before me to guide his followers to what he knew was good for them and warn them    against what he knew was bad for them; but this Umma of yours has its days of peace and    (security) in the beginning of its career, and in the last phase of its existence it will    be afflicted with trials and with things disagreeable to you. (In this phase of the Umma),    there will be tremendous trials one after the other, each making the previous one dwindle    into insignificance. When they would be afflicted with a trial, the believer would say:    This is going to bring about my destruction. When at (the trial) is over, they would be    afflicted with another trial, and the believer would say: This surely is going to be my    end. Whoever wishes to be delivered from the fire and enter the garden should die with    faith in Allah and the Last Day and should treat the people as he wishes to be treated by    them. He who swears allegiance to a Caliph should give him the piedge of his hand and the    sincerity of his heart (i. e. submit to him both outwardly as well as inwardly). He should    obey him to the best of his capacity. It another man comes forward (as a claimant to    Caliphate), disputing his authority, they (the Muslims) should behead the latter. The    narrator says: I came close to him (&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr b. al-&#8216;As) and said to him: Can you    say on oath that you heard it from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? He    pointed with his hands to his ears and his heart and said: My ears heard it and my mind    retained it. I said to him: This cousin of yours, Mu&#8217;awiya, orders us to unjustly consume    our wealth among ourselves and to kill one another, while Allah says:&#8221; O ye who    believe, do not consume your wealth among yourselves unjustly, unless it be trade based on    mutual agreement, and do not kill yourselves. Verily, God is Merciful to you&#8221; (iv.    29). The narrator says that (hearing this) Abdullah b. &#8216;Amr b. al-As kept quiet for a    while and then said: Obey him in so far as he is obedient to God; and diqobey him in    matters involving disobedience to God.</font></p>

He is committed to His care that Re will either admit him to Paradise or    bring him back to his home from where he set out with a reward or (his share of) booty. By    the Being in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad. If a person gets wounded in the way of    Allah, he will come on the Day of Judgment with his wound in the same condition as it was    when it was first inflicted; its colour being the colour of blood but its smell will be    the smell of musk. By, the Being in Whose Hand is Muhammad&#8217;s life, if it were not to be    too hard upon the Muslime. I would not lag behind any expedition which is going to fight    in the cause of Allah. But I do not have abundant means to provide them (the Mujahids)    with riding beasts, nor have they (i. e. all of them) abundant means (to provide    themselves with all the means of Jihad) so that they could he left behind. By the Being in    Whose Hand is Mubammgls lac, I love to fight in the way of Allah and be killed, to fight    and again be killed and to fight again and be killed.</font></p>

(Next to him) is a man who lives with his sheep at a    hill-top or in a valley, says his prayers regularly, gives Zakat and worships his Lord    until death comes to him. There is no better person among men except these two.</font></p>

One of them said to her companion: It is with    your child that it (the wolf) has run away The other one said: It has run away with your    child. They brought the matter to (Hadrat) Dawud (David) for decision and he made a    decision in favour of the elder one. They then went to Sulaiman b. Dawud (may there be    peace upon both of them) and told them (the story). He said: Bring me a knife so that I    may cut him (the child) (into two parts) for you. The younger one said: No, it can&#8217;t be,    may Allah have mercy upon you, he (the child) belongs to her (the elder). So he gave a    decision in favour of the younger one. abu Huraira said: If ever I heard of the word    as-sikin at all, it was that day. We called it by no other name but al-Mudya.</font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 8: </span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span><em>The Book of Marriage (Kitab Al-Nikah) </em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Marriage is a social institution as old as the human race itself. It may be defined as a relation between a man and a woman which is recognised by custom or law and involves certain rights and duties, both in the case of the parties entering the Union, and in case of the children born of it. Marriage has thus two main functions to perform: it is the means adopted by human society for regulating relations between the sexes; and it furnishes the mechanism by means of which the relations of a child to the community is determined. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The rites and ceremonies of marriage have been different with different peoples and in different ages. but these two functions mentioned above are common even where in marriage. It always implies the right of sexual intercourse as allowed and recognised by society and the duties of the parents in bringing up children. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Islam recognises this institution and accepts it as the basis of human society after purging it of all those evils which had penetrated it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Firstly, Islam does not regard it as a union only for the gratification of sexual lost, but a social contract with wide and varied responsibilities and duties. The reason behind it is that, according to the Divine Faith, a woman is not a plaything in the hand of man. but a spiritual and moral being who is entrusted to him on the sacred pledge to which Allah is made a witness. The wife is, therefore, not meant. to provide sensuous pleasure only to the male, but to fully co-operate with him in making the life of the family and ultimately of the whole humanity significantly meaningful. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Holy Qur&#8217;an has in so many verses pointed out the different purposes of marriage. It states:&#8221; And of His signs is that He has created wives for you from yourselves that you might find quiet of wind in them, and He put between you love and affection&#8221; (xxx. 21). In this verse it has been said that the female is not inferior to the male in the sense that the former is created out of a superior stuff while the latter comes of a base origin. Both man and woman are the progeny of Adam and thus both have the same soul. The purpose of marriage, according to the Holy Qur&#8217;an, is therefore, the union of the two souls which are one in essence. Their separate existence is an unnatural state of their being which changes Into the natural state when they are united by marriage and thus are brought close to each other physically, mentally and emotionally. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Both man and woman are the joint heirs of the grace of life, and unless there is a very close and intimate form of companionship in them, they cannot enjoy the true grace of life.&#8221; He it is Who created you from a single soul, and of the same did He make his spouse, that he might find comfort in her&#8221; (vii. 189).&#8221; Comfort&#8221; implies much more than a mere sexual gratification. It is not too much to say that the whole conception of the marriage relation in Islam is charged with spiritual and moral ideas, and must of necessity elevate the status of matrimonial alliance in the individual and social life. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>In Islam the union of the sexes has been purified and the joy of the married relation secured by the absolute prohibition of every kind of extra-matzimonial connection. The Holy Qur&#8217;an stresses upon the people to marry as it is the most effective means whereby one can lead a virtuous life free from immorality and emotional inhibition. The Holy Qur&#8217;an says:&#8221; They (your wives) are as a garment to you, and you are as a garment to them&#8221; (ii. 187). The mutual relation of husband and wife is here described in words which could not be surpassed in beauty. Herein is the correct description of the relationship between the two. The husband and the wife are for mutual support, mutual comfort and mutual protection, fitting into each other as garments fit into each other. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Then the Holy Qur&#8217;an also makes it clear that this union is not a temporary relationship between two individuals of opposite sexes: It is a permanent and enduring relationship in the sense that both the parties should put in their earnest endeavours to lead their lives in perfect harmony and acquitting themselves creditably of the responsibilities saddled upon them by entering into this sacred contract. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The Holy Qur&#8217;an farther points out that sexual gratification in the married life is not meant only for the satisfaction of the physical lust, but it mustbe directed to some higher ends.&#8221; Your women are tilth for you, so go into your tilth as ye like, and provide beforehand for your souls, and fear Allah and know that you are going to meet Him&#8221; (iii. 223). Here the wives are likened to the cultivable land which are ploughed for sowing and reaping the produce (in the form of offspring) and not merely for carnal indulgence. The concluding part of the verse refers to still higher and sublimer ends which tell that even in the height of carnal pleasures the moral and spiritual responsibilities should not in any way be lost sight of; rather one should be more conscious to them when one is enjoying physical pleasures as these are the moments when the fear of the Lord and the accountability in the Hereafter is likely to be blurred or effaced from one&#8217;s mind. </span></p>

(Then) &#8216;Uthman said to him: Abu Abd al-Rahman, should we not marry you to a virgin girl that your past may be recalled to your mind? &#8216;Abdullah said: If you say so, the rest of the hadith is the same as narrated above.</span></p>

We have nothing which we should give you. There is a possibility that we may send you to an (expedition) where you may get (booty). So he sent that man (in the expedition) which was despatched to Banu &#8216;Abs.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Sahl b. Sa&#8217;d al-Sa&#8217;idi (Allah be pleased with him) reported: A woman came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger. (may peace be upon him) and said: Messerbger of Allah, I have come to you to entrust myself to you (you may contract my marriage with anyone at your discretion). Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) saw her and cast a glance at her from head to foot. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then lowered his head. When the woman saw that he had made no decision in regard to her, she sat down. There stood up a person from amongst his companions and said: Messenger of Allah, marry her to me if you have no need of her. He (the Holy Prophet) said: is there anything with you (which you con give as a dower)? He said: No, Messenger of Allah, by Allah I have nothing. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Go to your people (family) and see if you can find something. He returned and said: I have found nothing. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: See even if it is an Iron ring. He went and returned and said: No, by God, not even an iron ring, but only this lower garment of mine (Sahl said that he had no upper garment), half of which (I am prepared to part with) for her. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: How can your lower garment serve your purpose, for it you wear it, she would not be able to make any use of it and if she wears it there would not be anything on you? The man sat down and as the sitting prolonged he stood up (in disappointment) and as he was going back Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded (him) to be called back, and as he came, he said to him: Do you know any part of the Qur&#8217;an? He said: I know such and such surahs (and he counted them). whereupon he said: Can you recite them from heart (from your memory)? He said: Yes, whereupon he (Allah&#8217;s Messenger) said: Go, I have given her to you in marriage for the part of the Qur&#8217;an which you know.</span></p>

The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) then mounted and so did Abu Talha ride, and I was seating myself behind Abu Talha. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) moved in the narrow street of Khaibar (and we rode so close to each other in the street) that my knee touched the leg of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). (A part of the) lower garment of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) slipped from his leg and I could see the whiteness of the leg of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him). As he entered the habitation he called: Allah-o-Akbar (Allah is the Greatest). Khaibar is ruined. And when we get down in the valley of a people evil is the morning of the warned ones. He repeated it thrice. In the meanwhile the people went out for their work, and said: By Allah, Muhammad (has come). Abd al-&#8216;Aziz or some of our com- panions said: Muhammad and the army (have come). He said: We took it (the territory of Khaibar) by force, and there were gathered the prisoners of war. There came Dihya and he said: Messenger of Allah, bestow upon me a girl ont of the prisones. He said: Go and get any girl. He made a choice for Safiyya daughter of Huyayy (b. Akhtab). There came a person to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and said: Apostle of Allah, you have bestowed Safiyya bint Huyayy, the chief of Quraiza and al-Nadir, upon Dihya and she is worthy of you only. He said: Call him along with her. So he came along with her. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) saw her he said: Take any other woman from among the prisoners. He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet) then granted her emancipation and married her. Thabit said to him: Abu Hamza, how much dower did he (the Holy Prophet) give to her? He said: He granted her freedom and then married her. On the way Umm Sulaim embellished her and then sent her to him (the Holy Prophet) at night. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) appeared as a bridegroom in the morning. He (the Holy Prophet) said: He who has anything (to eat) should bring that. Then the cloth was spread. A person came with cheese, another came with dates, and still another came with refined butter, and they prepared hais and that was the wedding feast of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him)</span></p>

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Khaibar is ruined. Verily when we get down in the valley of a people, evil is the morning of the warned ones (al-Qur&#8217;an, xxxvii. 177). Allah, the Majestic and the Glorious, defeated them (the inhabitants of Khaibar), and there fell to the lot of Dihya a beautiful girl, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) got her in exchange of seven heads, and then entrusted her to Umm Sulaim so that she might embellish her and prepare her (for marriage) with him. He (the narrator) said: He had been under the impression that he had said that so that she might spend her period of &#8216;Iddah in her (Umm Sulaim&#8217;s) house. (The woman) was Safiyya daughter of Huyayy. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) arranged the wedding feast consisting of dates, cheese, and refined butter, and pits were dug and tiers were set in them dining cloths, and there was brought cheese and refined butter, and these were placed there. And the people ate to their fill, and they said: We do not know whether he (the Holy Prophet) had married her (as a free woman), or as a slave woman. They said: If he (the Holy Prophet) would make her wear the veil, then she would be a (free married) woman, and if he would not make her wear the veil, then she should be a slave woman. When he intended to ride, he made her wear the veil and she sat on the hind part of the camel; so they came to know that he had married her. As they approached Medina, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) drove (his ride) quickly and so we did. &#8216;Adba&#8217; (the name of Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;s camel) stumbled and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) fell down and she (Radrat Safiyya: also fell down. He (the Holy Prophet) stood up and covered her. woman looked towards her and said: May Allah keep away the Jewess! He (the narrator) said: I said: Aba Hamza, did Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) really fall down? He said: Yes, by Allah, he in fact fell down. Anas said: I also saw the wedding feast of Zainab, and he (the Holy Prophet) served bread and meat to the people, and made them eat to their heart&#8217;s content, and he (the Holy Prophet) sent me to call people, and as he was free (from the ceremony) he stood up and I followed him. Two persons were left and they were busy in talking and did not get out (of the apartment). He (the Holy Prophet) then proceeded towards (the apartments of) his wives. He greeted with as-Salamu &#8216;alaikum to every one of them and said: Members of the household, how are you? They said: Messenger of Allah, we are in good state &#8216;How do you find your family? He would say: In good state. When he was free from (this work of exchanging greetings) he came back, and I also came back along with him. And as he reached the door, (he found) that the two men were still busy in talking. And when they saw him having returned, they stood up and went out; and by Allah! I do not know whether I had informed him, or there was a revelation to him (to the affect) that they had gone. He (the Holy Prophet) then came back and I also returned along with him, and as he put his step on the threshold of his door he hung a curtain between me and him, and (it was on this occasion) that Allah revealed this verse: (&#8221; O you who believe), do not enter the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to &#8216;you&#8221; (xxxiii. 53).</span></p>

He sent (a messenger) to Dihya and he gave him whatever he demanded. He then sent her to my mother and asked her to embellish her.

When it was morning Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: He who has surplus of provision with him should bring that to us. Some persons would bring the surplus of dates, and the other surplus of mush of barley until there became a heap of bals. They began to eat the hais and began to drink out of the pond which had the water of rainfall in it and which was situated by their side.

They then sat there and entered into conversation. He (the Holy Prophet) made a stir as if he was preparing to stand up, but (the persons busy in talking) did not stand up. When he (the Holy Prophet) saw it, he stood up and when he did so, some other persons stood up. &#8216;Asim and Abd al-A&#8217;la in their narrations made this addition: Three (persons) sat there, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) came there to enter (the apartment) but he found the people sitting there. Then they stood up and went away. He said: Then I came and informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) that they had gone away. He (the Holy Prophet) then came there until he entered (the apartment). I also went and was about to enter, when he hung a curtain between me and him (and it was on this occasion that) Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, revealed this verse:&#8221; O you who believe, enter not the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its cooking being finished to the (words)&#8221; Surely this is serious in the sight of Allah&#8221; (xxxiii. 53).</span></p>

He invited people to the wedding feast after the day had well risen. There sat Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and there kept sitting along with him some persons after the people had stood up (for departure) ; then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up and walked on and I also walked along with him until he reached the door of the apartment of &#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her).

He again returned and I also returned and they had (by that time) stood up, and he hung a curtain between me and him (at the door of the apartment of Hadrat Zainab, where he had to stay), and Allah revealed the verse pertaining to veil.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Anas b. Malik (Allah be pleased with him) reported: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) contracted marriage and he went to his wife. My mother Umm Sulaim prepared hais and placed it in an earthen vessel and said: Anas, take it to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and say: My mother has sent that to you and she offers greetings to you, and says that it is a humble gift for you on our behalf, Messenger of Allah. So I went along with it to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said: My mother offers you salutations, and says that it is a humble gift for you on our behalf. He said: Place it here, and then said: Go and invite on my behalf so and so and anyone whom you meet, and he even named some persons. He (Anas) said: I invited whom he had named and whom I met. I (one of the narrators) said: I said to Anas: How many (persons) were there? He (Anas) said: They were about three hundred persons. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) (said to me): Anas, bring that earthen vessel. They (the guests) then began to enter until the courtyard and the apartment were fully packed. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Make a circle of ten (guests), and every person should eat from that nearest to him. They began to eat, until they ate to their fill. A group went out (after eating the food), and another group came in until all of them had eaten. He (the Holy Prophet) said to me: Anas, lift it (the earthen vessel), so I lifted it, but I could not assess whether it had more (food) when I placed it (before Allah&#8217;s Messenger) or when I lifted it (after the people had been served out of it). A group among them (the guests) began to talk in the house of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was sitting and his wife had been sitting with her face turned towards the wall. It was troublesome for Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), so Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) went out and greeted his wives. He then returned. When they (the guests) saw that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had returned they thought that it (their overstay) was something troublesome for him. He (the narrator) said: They hastened towards the door and all of them went out. And there came Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and he hung a curtain and went in, and I was sitting in his apartment and he did not stay but for a short while. He then came to me and these verses were revealed. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came out and recited them to the people:&#8221; O you who believe, enter not the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its cooking being finished-but when you are invited, enter, and when you have taken food, disperse not seeking to listen to talk. Surely this gives the Prophet trouble&#8221;, to the end of verse (xxxiii. 53). (Al-Ja&#8217;d said that Anas [b. Malik] stated: I am the first amongst the people to hear these verses), and henceforth the wives of the Apostle (may peace be upon him) began to observe seclusion (al-hijab).</span></p>

They ate to their fill and went out, but a group among them remained there and was engaged in lengthy discussion. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) felt shy of saying them anything. So he went out and left them in his house and Allah the Great and Majestic revealed this verse:&#8221; 0 you who believe, enter not the houses of the Prophet unless permission is given to you for a meal, not waiting for its cooking being finished.&#8221; Qatada (instead of using the word Ghaira Nazirina) used the word Ghaira Mutahayyinina (i. e. not waiting for the time of the food). But when you are invited, enter&#8230;&#8221; up to this verse. This is purer for your hearts and their hearts.</span></p>

I wished I could be exactly like her who was passionate. As she became old, she had made over her day (which she had to spend) with Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) to &#8216;A&#8217;isha. She said: I have made over my day with you to &#8216;A&#8217;isha. So Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) allotted two days to &#8216;A&#8217;isha, her own day (when it was her turn) and that of Sauda.</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 13:</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book of Bequests (Kitab Al-Wasiyya) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bequest (WasIyya) or will is defined as a transfer to come into operation after the testator&#8217;s death. The testator is called Musi, and the legatee or devisee is called Musa lahu, and the executor is called Wasi. It is a spiritual testament of a man enabling him to make up his shortcomings in the worldly life and securing rewards in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the Shar&#8217;iah, one is entitled to make a will for one-third of one&#8217;s property and not beyond that so that the rights of the legal heirs are not adversely affected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; Again, the principle on which the legality of a testamentary disposition is based being in defeance pro tanto of the rights of heirs generally the law requires that such disposition should be for the benefit of non-heirs alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; A further reason why a bequest in favour of an heir is not allowed is that it would amount to giving preference to some heirs over others, thus defeating the spirit of the law which has fixed the portion of each in the inheritance and causing disputes among persons related to one another. If the other heirs consent to a bequest to one of them or to a bequest of more than one-third of the estate, the above reasons no longer hold good and the bequest as made will be valid&#8221; (Abdur Rahim, The Principles of Muhammadan jurisprudence, pp. 311-2).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is, however, preferable and most advisable not to will away the property if the legal heirs are poor, because it manifests benevolence to the heirs who have superior claim to it from the relations in which they stand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another principle which is observed in case of bequest is that the proprietary right of a legatee in a bequest is establislied if he accepts it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Amir b. Sa&#8217;d reported on the authority of his father (Sa&#8217;d b. Abi Waqqas): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) visited me in my illness which brought me near death in the year of Hajjat-ul-Wada&#8217; (Farewell Pilgrimage). I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, you can well see the pain with which I am afflicted and I am a man possessing wealth, and there is none to inherit me except only one daughter. Should I give two-thirds of my property as Sadaqa? He said: No. I said: Should I give half (of my property) as Sadaqa? He said: No. He (further) said: Give one-third (in charity) and that is quite enough. To leave your heirs rich is better than to leave them poor, begging from people; that you would never incur an expense seeking therewith the pleasure of Allah, but you would be rewarded therefor, even for a morsel of food that you put in the mouth of your wife. I said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger. would I survive my companions? He (the Holy Prophet) said: If you survive them, then do such a deed by means of which you seek the pleasure of Allah, but you would increase in your status (in religion) and prestige; you may survive so that people would benefit from you, and others would be harmed by you. (The Holy Prophet) further said: Allah, complete for my Companions their migration, and not cause them to turn back upon their heels. Sa&#8217;d b. Khaula is, however, unfortunate. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) felt grief for him as he had died in Mecca.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Humaid b. &#8216;Abd al-Rahman al-Himyari reported from three of the sons of Sa&#8217;d all of whom reported from their father that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) visited Sa&#8217;d as he was ill in Mecca. He (Sa&#8217;d) wept. He (the Holy Prophet) said: What makes you weep? He said: I am afraid I may die in the land from where I migrated as Sa&#8217;d b. Khaula had died. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) said: O Allah, grant health to Sa&#8217;d. O Allah, grant health to Sad. He repeated it three times. He (Sa&#8217;d) said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, I own a large property and I have only one daughter as my inheritor. Should I not will away the whole of my property? He (the Holy Prophet) said: No. He said: (Should I not will away, ) two-thirds of the property? he (the Holy Prophet) said: No. He (Sa&#8217;d) (again) said: (Should I not will away) half (of my property)? He said: No. He (Sa&#8217;d) said: Then one-third? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Yes), one-third, and one-third is quite substanial. And what you spend as charity from your property is Sadaqa and flour spending on your family is also Sadaqa, and what your wife eats from your property is also Sadaqa, and that you leave your heirs well off (or he said: prospreous) is better than to leave them (poor and) begging from people. He (the Holy Prophet) pointed this with his hands.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 11: </font></p>
<p>    </p>
<h3 align="center"><font><em>The Book Pertaining to the Rules of  Inheritance (Kitab Al-Farai`d) </em></font>    </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><br></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Inheritance is the entry of living persons into possession  of dead persons&#8217; property and exists in some form wherever the institution of private  property is recognised as the basis of the social and economic system. The actual forms of  inheritance and the laws governing it, however, differ according to the ideals of  different societies. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The law of inheritance in Islam is based upon five main  considerations: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To break up the concentration of wealth in individuals and  spread it out in society. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To respect the property right of ownership of an individual  earned through honest means. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To hammer in the consciousness of man the fact that man is  not the absolute master of wealth he produces but he is its trustee and is not, therefore,  authorised to pass it on to others as he likes. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To consolidate the family system which is the social unit  of an Islamic society. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>To give incentive to work and encourage economic activity  as sanctioned by Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the pre-Islamic world and even in modern societies the  law of inheritance has so many evils in it, which may be summed up in the following  points: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Women had been completely denied the share of inheritance.  They were rather regarded as part of the property of the deceased and, therefore, their  right to property by inheritance was out of question. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In pre-Islamic Arabia and other countries where there had  been tribal societies not only women were deprived of the right of inheritance but even  weak and sick persons and minor children were given no share in it, as the common  principle of inheritance was that he alone is entitled to inherit who wields the sword. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then in certain societies there had been existing the law  of primogeniture and it exists even today in some of the so-called civilised parts of the  world which entitles only the eldest son to inherit the whole of the father&#8217;s property or  to get the lion&#8217;s share. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Islam introduced so many reforms in the laws of inheritance  which can be succinctly summed up as follows. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It defined and determined in clear-cut terms the share of  each inheritor and imposed limits on the right of the property-owner to dispose of his  property according to his whim and caprice. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It made the female, who had been prevously thought a  chattel, the co-sharer with the male and thus not only restored her dignity, but  safeguarded her social and economic rights. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It laid the rules for the break-up of the concentrated  wealth in the society and helped in its proper and equitable distribution amongst a large  number of persons. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It gave a death-blow to the law of primogeniture and thus  provided the democratic basis for the division of the property of the deceased. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The above are some of the distinguishing features of the  Islamic law of inheritance. While laying down the rules for the distribution of the estate  of the deceased, the first principle to be observed is that the property both movable and  immovable can be distributed after meeting the following obligations: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>funeral expenses; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>clearing off the debts incurred by the deceased; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>payment of bequest, if any, to the extent of one-third of  the total assets. It may be remembered that the Mahr of the wife, if it had not been paid,  is included in the debt. Moreover, it is not lawful to make a bequest in favour of a  person who is entitled to a share in the inheritance. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Four persons cannot get inheritance: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(a) a fugitive slave who has fled away from his master, </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(b) one who has murdered one&#8217;s predecessor intentionally or  unintentionaly </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(c) one who professes a religion other than Islam, </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(d) one living in Dar-ul-Harb cannot inherit the property  of one living in Dar-ul-Islam and vice versa. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Islam, the heirs have been divided into three  classes. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(A) Dhaw-u&#8217;l-Fara&#8217;id are those persons who have a right to  definite shares in assets left by the deceased. These sharers are twelve in number; four  males: father, grandfather, uterine brothers and husband; and eight females: wife, single  daughter, son&#8217;s daughter, mother, grandmother, full sister, consanguine sister, uterine  sister. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Father&#8217;s share is one-sixth when the deceased leaves a son  or a son&#8217;s son, but if the deceased is not survived by a son or grandson his father will,  in addition to this share (one-sixth), also get a share of being &#8216;Asaba. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The grandfather&#8217;s share is like that of father&#8217;s share but  in three conditions: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>According to Imam Bukhiri and Imam Muslim, the presence of  father deprives even the brothers of their share in the inheritance. but this is not the  case with the grandfather. Imam Abu Hanifa is of the opinion that the presence of  grandfather deprives the brother of his share in the inheritance. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>If the father of the deceased is alive, then the share of  the mother is of what is left from the share of the wife of the deceased. The presence of  grandfather does not reduce the share of the mother of the deceased. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The grandmother of the deceased has no share in the  presence of the father of the deceased but she has a share in the presence of the  grandfather. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The third set of sharers are uterine brothers and sisters.  They are entitled to one-sixth if their number is one, and one-third if they are more than  one. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The husband&#8217;s share is one-half of the property of the  deceased wife if she has no children, but in case of children it is one-fourth. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The wife is entitled to one-fourth if the husband dies  childless; otherwise it is one-eighth. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Real daughter: one-half when alone, and two-thirds if more  than one. If the deceased is survived by a male child also. the daughters are then treated  as Asaba and the male child would get double of what falls to the lot of daughters. The  granddaughters stand on the same level as daughters. But in case the deceased is survived  by one real daughter and one or more than one granddaughter they would get one-sixth. The  granddaughter is not entitled to any share if the deceased is survived by a son, but if he  is survived by grandsons and granddaughters, they would be treated as &#8216;Asaba and the male  grandchild would get double of what goes to the female grandchild. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Full sister gets one-half if she is alone, and two-thirds  if they are more than one. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Consanguine sister is entitled to one-half if one, and two  thirds if more. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Mother is entitled to one-sixth when she has a child or  grandchild, and in case of being childless she gets one-third of the share. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>If the deceased is survived either by paternal grandmother  or maternal grand- mother or even by both, they are entitled to one-sixth. The grandmother  (maternal) is deprived of her share if the mother of the deceased is alive; and if father  is alive the paternal grandmother is deprived of this share. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(B) When the heirs of the first group have received the  respective shares, the residue of the assets falls to the share of those relatives who are  called Asaba which, according to the Shari&#8217;ah, implies those relatives in whose line of  relationship no female enters. This is the second group of inheritors. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There is no fixed share of the &#8216;Asabat. If the deceased is  not survived by any Dhaw-u&#8217;l-Fara&#8217;id, the whole of the property falls to their share; and  If Dhaw-u&#8217;I. Fara&#8217;id are there to get their due share, the residue will be taken by the  Asabat. The following are the &#8216;Asabat: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Son: He is the first to get the residue in order of  succession. The daughters are entitled to half of the share as given to the son. The  grandsons are not entitled to any share in the presence of the son. If the son is not  living, then the grandson is entitled to a share in the inheritance. If there are more  than one son, the inheritance will be distributed equally amongst them. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The father, grandfather and the great-grandfather are  included in the category of Dhaw-u&#8217;l-Fara&#8217;id. If, however, the deceased is not survived by  category of a son, grandson of great-grandson, then the father will fall under the  category of &#8216;Asaba, and, in the absence of the father, the grandfather assumes that  position. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>If the deceased is not survived by son, or grandson or  father or grandfather, i. e. none amongst the &#8216;Asabat, then the brother, and in the  absence of brother his son, and in the absence of son, his grandson will be entitled to  share in the inheritance as &#8216;Asaba and the female would also join them in share claiming  half of the share as compared with male. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>If unfortunately the deceased is survived by none of the  above-mentioned relatives amongst the &#8216;Asabat, then consanguine brother will be entitled  to share in the inheritance and he will be preferred to full brother&#8217;s son. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then comes the turn of full paternal uncle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(C) The last category of inheritors are known ad Dhaw-u&#8217;l  Arham, i. e. relations connected through females, but it is in extremely rare cases that  they get any share in the inheritance. The following relatives come under this category. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The son of the daughter and daughter of the daughter. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The son of the daughter of the son, and daughter of the  daughter of the son and their children. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Maternal grandfather, maternal grandfather of the father,  the grandfather of the mother, maternal grandfather of the mother, the grandmother of the  mother, the children of the sisters, the sisters of the father and those of the mother,  etc. </font></p>

He (the Holy Prophet) then ordered to give us three white humped camels, We started and said (or some of us said to the others): Allah will not bless us. We came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) begging him to provide us with riding camels. He swore that he could not provide us with a mount, but later on he provided us with that. They (some of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions) came and informed him about this (rankling of theirs), whereupon he said: It was not I who provided you with a mount, but Allah has provided you with that. So far as I am concerned, by Allah, if He so wills, I would not swear, but if, later on, I would see better than it, I (would break the vow) and expiate it and do that which is better.</p>

He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with anything to ride. And it so happened that he was at that time much perturbed. I little knew of it, so I came back with a heavy heart on account of the refusal of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), and the fear that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) might have some feelings against me. I returned to my friends and informed them about what Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had said. I had hardly stayed for a little that I heard Bilal calling: &#8216;Abdullah b. Qais. I responded to his call. He said: Hasten to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him), he is calling you, When I came to the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) he said: Take this pair, this pair, and this pair (i. e. six camels which he had bought from Sa&#8217;d), and take them to y, our friends and say: Verily Allah (or he said: Verily Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has provided you with these animals. So ride upon them. Abu Musa said: I went along with them to my friends and said: Verily Allah&#8217;s messenger (may peace be upon him) has provided you with these animals for riding; but by Allah, I shall not leave you until some of you go along with me to him who had heard the talk of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) then I asked him for you, and his refusal for the first time, and then his granting them to me subsequently; so you should not think that I narrated to you something which he did not say. They said to me: By Allah, in our opinion you are certainly truthful, and we would do as you like. So Abu Musa went along withsome of the menfrom them until they came to those who had heard the words of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may, peace be upon him) and his refusal to (provide) them with (animals) ; and subsequently his granting (the animals) to them; and they narrated to them exactly as Abu Masa had narrated to them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ayyub said: We were sitting in the company of Abu Musa that he called for food and it consisted of flesh of fowl. It was then that a person from Banu Tamim visited him. His complexion was red having the resemblance of a slave. He said to him: Come and (join me in food). He showed reluctance. He (Abu Masa) said: Come on, for I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) eating it (fowl&#8217;s meat), whereupon that person said: I saw it eating something (of filth and rubbish) and I found it repugnant and took an oath that I would never eat that. He (Abu Muds) said: Come, so that I would narrate to you about that (the incident pertaining to vow). (And he narrated thus): I came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) along with a group of people belonging to the tribe of Ash&#8217;ari, asking him to provide us with riding camels. He (the Holy Prophet) said: By Allah, I cannot provide you with riding animals. And there is nothing with me with which I can provide you a mount. We stayed (for some time) there as Allah willed, and there was brought to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) booty of camels. He called us and commanded that we should be given five white humped camels. As we were about to go back, some of us said to the other: As we made Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) forget oath, there would be no blessing for us (in his gift). We went back to him and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, we came to you to provide us with riding animals and you took an oath that you would never equip us with mounts and then you have provided us with the riding beasts Allali&#8217;s Messenger, have you forgotten? Thereupon he said: I swear by Allah that if Allah so wills, I shall not swear an oath, and then consider something else to be better than it without making atonement for my oath and doing the thing that is better. So you go; Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has given you riding animals.</p>

Khattab asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as he was at ji&#8217;rana (a town near Mecca) on his way back from Ta&#8217;if: Messenger of Allah, I had taken a vow during the days of Ignorance that I would observe I&#8217;tikaf for one day in the Sacred Mosque. So what is your opinion? He said: Go and observe I&#8217;tikaf for a day. And Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) gave him a slave girl out of the one-fifth (of the spoils of war meant for the Holy Prophet). And when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (inay peace be upon him) set the war prisoners free. &#8216;Umar b. Khattab heard their voice as they were saying: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has set as free. He (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) said: What is this? They said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) has set free the prisoners of war (which had fallen to the lot of people). Thereupon he (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) said: Abdullah, go to that slave-girl and set her free.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book Pertaining to Punishments Prescribed by Islam (Kitab Al-Hudud) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The penal laws of Islam are called Hudud in the Hadith and Fiqh. This word is the plural of Hadd, which means prevention, hindrance, restraint, prohibition, and hence a restrictive ordinance or statute of God, respecting things lawful and unlawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Punishments are divided into two classes, one of which is called Hadd and the other Ta&#8217;zir. The Hadd is a measure of punishment defined by the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. In Ta&#8217;zir, the court, is allowed to use its discretion in regard to the form and measure in which such punishment is to be inflicted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Punishments by way of Hadd are of the following forms: death by stoning, amputation of a limb or limbs, flogging by one hundred or eighty strokes. They are prescribed respectively for the following offences: adultery committed by married persons, theft, highway robbery, drunkenness and slander imputing unchastity to women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The punishments described above are the maximum punishments for the above mentioned crimes. These can be reduced keeping in view the circumstances in which the crimes were committed, the nature of the evidence, and the motive of the criminal with which he committed the crime.</p>

The colour of the face of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) changed, and he said: Do you intercede in one of the prescribed punishments of Allah? He (Usama) said: &#8216;Messenger of Allah, seek forgiveness for me. When it was dusk. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) stood up and gave an address. He (first) glorified Allah as He deserves, and then said: Now to our topic. This (injustice) destroyed those before you that when any one of (high) rank committed theft among them, they spared him, and when any weak one among them committed theft, they inflicted the prescribed punishment upon him. By Him in Whose Hand is my life, even if Fatima daughter of Muhammad were to commit theft, I would have cut off her hand. He (the Holy Prophet) then commanded about that woman who had committed theft, and her hand was cut off. &#8216;A&#8217;isha (further) said: Hers was a good respentance, and she later on married and used to come to me after that, and I conveyed her needs (and problems) to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him).</p>

We recited it, retained it in our memory and understood it. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) awarded the punishment of stoning to death (to the married adulterer and adulteress) and, after him, we also awarded the punishment of stoning, I am afraid that with the lapse of time, the people (may forget it) and may say: We do not find the punishment of stoning in the Book of Allah, and thus go astray by abandoning this duty prescribed by Allah. Stoning is a duty laid down in Allah&#8217;s Book for married men and women who commit adultery when proof is established, or it there is pregnancy, or a confession.</p>

He then got him stoned (to death), and then delivered the address: Behold, as we set out for Jihad in the cause of Allah, one of you lagged behind and shrieked like the bleating of a male goat, and gave a small quantity of milk.

He (Ma&#8217;iz) came for the third time, and he (the Holy Prophet) sent him as he had done before. He asked about him and they informed him that there was nothing wrong with him or with his mind.

He said: Well, if you insist upon it, then go away until you give birth to (the child). When she was delivered she came with the child (wrapped) in a rag and said: Here is the child whom I have given birth to. He said: Go away and suckle him until you wean him. When she had weaned him, she came to him (the Holy Prophet) with the child who was holding a piece of bread in his hand. She said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle, here is he as I have weaned him and he eats food. He (the Holy Prophet) entrusted the child to one of the Muslims and then pronounced punishment. And she was put in a ditch up to her chest and he commanded people and they stoned her. Khalid b Walid came forward with a stone which he flung at her head and there spurted blood on the face of Khalid and so he abused her. Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) heard his (Khalid&#8217;s) curse that he had huried upon her. Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Khalid, be gentle. By Him in Whose Hand is my life, she has made such a repentance that even if a wrongful tax-collector were to repent, he would have been forgiven. Then giving command regarding her, he prayed over her and she was buried.</p>

He said: No. Had you not asked me in the name of Allah, I would not have given you this information. We find stoning to death (as punishment prescribed in the Torah). But this (crime) became quite common amongst our aristocratic class. So when we caught hold of any rich person (indulging in this offence) we spared him, but when we caught hold of a helpless person we imposed the prescribed punishment upon him. We then said: Let us argree (on a punishment) which we can inflict both upon the rich and the poor. So We decided to blacken the face with coal and flog as a substitute punishment for stoning.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira reported that he heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When the slave-woman of any of you commits adultery and this (offence of hers) becomes clear, she should be flogged (as the presribed) punishment, but hurl no reproach at her. If she commits adultery again, she should (again be punished) by flogging, but hurl no reproach upon her. It she commits fornication for the third time. and it becomes clear, then he should sell her, even if only for a rope of hair.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 5: </span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span><em>The Book of Zakat (Kitab Al-Zakat) </em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Of the five fundamentals of Islam, Zakat occupies the second positioin, the first being prayer (salat). This word is derived from Zakd, which means it (a plant) grew. The second derivative of this word carries the sense of purificatin, e. g. Qad aflaha man zakkaha (he is indeed successful who purified himself). The other word used for zakat both in the Qur&#8217;an and the Hadith is sadaqa which is derived from sidq (the truth). Both these words are highly meaningful. The spending of wealth for the sake of Allah purifies the heart of man of the love of material wealth. The man who spends it offers that as a humble gift before the Lord and thus affirms the truth that nothing is dearer to him in life than the love of Allah and that he is full prepared to sacrifice everything for His sake. Secondly, zakat is the most effective measure to improve the economic condition of the have-nots. It is not, however, a mere tax, but a form of worship whereby a man comes close to his Lord. The Muslims have, therefore, been enjoined to pay zakat with the same sense of earnestness and devotion in which the seeker of the Lord observes the prayer. The primary motive of zakat is religious and spiritual, while the social and economic aspects are subservient to it. Its social significance is that it awakens in man the sense of brotherhood with less fortunate members of society, and stirs his moral conscience to make sacrifice for their sake. From the economic point of view it discourages hoarding and concentration of wealth and helps its steady and constant flow from the rich to the poor. It is in fact a good means of providing purchasing power to the poor, for ameliorating their hard lot and enabling them to stand on their own legs. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It should also be remembered that zakat or sadaqa in Islam is not a voluntary act of charity which a rich man gives to the poor out of his own sweet will, but it is an obligatory act which every Muslim is enjoined upon to perform if he is sincere in his belief in God and the Hereafter. Thus there is no burden of obligation on one who receives zakat, but a sense of thankfulness and gratitude on the part of the giver, since he has been enabled by the recipient to discharge his obligation that he owes to God and society. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>(O Prophet), take sadaqa (zakat) out of their property-thou wouldst cleanse them and purify them thereby (Qur&#8217;an, ix. 103). And away from it (the Hell) shall be kept the most faithful to duty who gives his wealth, purifying himself (xcii. 17-18). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>So much is the importance of zakat in Islam that it has been mentioned at eightytwo places in the Qur&#8217;an in close connection with prayer. The Companions of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) knew its basic importance in Islam. It is a known fact that after the death of the Apostle of Allah (may peace he upon him) when some of the tribes, who believed in the oneness of God and observed prayer, refused to pay zakat, the first Caliph Abu Bakr Siddiq (Allah be pleased with him), in an answer to the advice of Hadrat &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with him) to show tolerance towards such people. said in explicit terms, By Allah, I would definitely wage war against them who dissociate prayer from Zakat. Zakat is paid on the surplus of wealth which is left over after the passage of a year. It is thus a payment on the accumulated wealth. Leaving aside animals and agricultural yield, zakat is paid at almost a uniform rate of two and a half %. The minimum standard of surplus wealth over which zakat is charged is known as Nisab. It differs with different kinds of property, the most important being 200 dirhams or 521 tolas (nearly 21 oz.) In case of silver, and 20 mithqals or 71 tolas (nearly 3 oz.) in case of gold. The nisab of cash is the same as that of gold and silver. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>As regards the persons to whom zakat is to be paid, they have been clearly described in the Holy Qur&#8217;an: Alms are only for the poor, the needy, the officials charged with the duty of collection, those whose hearts are inclined to truth, the ransoming of captives, those in debt, in the way of Allah, and the wayfarer (ix 60). </span></p>

Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Ibn Jamil is taking revenge but for this that he was destitute and Allah made him rich. As regards Khalid, you are unjust to Khalid, for be reserved his armours and weapons for the sake of Allah, and as for &#8216;Abbas, I shall be responsible for it and an equal amount along with it.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (way peace be upon him) as saying: If any owner of gold or silver does not pay what is due on him, when the Day of Resurrection would come, plates of fire would be beaten out for him; these would then be heated in the fire of Hell and his sides, his forehead and his back would be cauterized with them. Whenever these cool down, (the process is) repeated during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced among servants, and he sees whether his path is to take him to Paradise or to Hell. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the camel? He (the Holy Prophet) said: If any owner of the camel does not pay what is due on him, and of his due in that (camel) is (also) to milk it on the day when it comes down to water. When the Day of Resurrection comes a soft sandy plain would be set for him, as extensive as possible, (he will find) that not a single young one is missing, and they will trample him with their hoofs and bite him with their mouths. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them would be made to return during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced among servants and he sees whether his path is to take him to Paradise or to Hell. It was (again) said: Messenger of Allah, what about cows (cattle) and sheep? He said: It any owner of the cattle and sheep does not pay what is due on them, when the Day of Resurrection comes a soft sandy plain would be spread for them, he will find none of them missing, with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him the last of them would be made to return to him during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years, until judgment would be pronounced among the servants. And he would be shown his path-path leading him to Paradise or to Hell. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the horse? Upon this he said: The horses are of three types. To one than (these are) a burden, and to another man (these are) a covering, and still to another man (these are) a source of reward. The one for whom these are a burden is the person who rears them in order to show off, for vainglory and for opposing the Muslims; so they are a burden for him. The one for whom these are a covering is the person who rears them for the sake of Allah but does not forget the right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks, and so they are a covering for him. As for those which bring reward (these refer to) the person who rears them for the sake of Allah to be used for Muslims and he puts them in meadow and field. And whatever thing do these eat from that meadow and field would be recorded on his behalf as good deeds, as would also the amount of their dung and urine. And these would not break their halter and prance a course or two without having got recorded the amount of their hoof marks and their dung as a good deed on his behalf (on behalf of their owner). And their master does not bring them past a river from which they drink, though he did not intend to quench their thirst, but Allah would record for him the amount of what they drink on his behalf as deeds. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the asses?, Upon this he said: Nothing has been revealed to me in regard to the asses (in particular) except this one verse of a comprehensive nature:&#8221; He who does an atom&#8217;s weight of good will see it, and he who does an atom&#8217;s weight of evil will see it&#8221; (xcix. 7)</span></p>

He would then see his path, leading either to Paradise or to Hell. And no owner of the camels who does not pay Zakat (would be spared) but a soft sandy plain would be set for him and they (the camels) would be made to pass over him till the last of them would be made to return till Allah would pronounce judgment among His servants during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years. He would then see his path leading him to Paradise or leading him to Hell. And no owner of the (cattle and) goats who does not pay Zakat (would be spared) but a soft sandy plain would be set for him, he would find none of them missing, with twisted horns, without horns, or with broken horns, and they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their hoofs and they would be made to pass over him till the last of them would be made to return till Allah would pronounce judgment among His servants, during a day the extent of which would be fdty thousand years, and he would see the paths leading to Paradise or to Hell. Suhail said: I do not know whether he made mention of the cows. They said: Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), what about the horses? He said: The horses have goodness in their foreheads (or he said) or goodness is ingrained in the foreheads of the horses (Suhail said: I am in doubt as to what was actually said) up till the Day of judgement. The horses are of three kinds. They are a source of reward to a person, they are a covering to a person, and they are a burden to a person. As for those which bring reward is that a person would get reward who rears them for the sake of Allah and trains them for Him, and nothing disappears in their stomachs but Allah would record for him a good deed. And if they were to graze in the meadow, they would eat nothing but Allah would record for him a reward. And if they were to drink water from the canal, with every drop that, would disappear in their stomachs there would be reward (for the owner). He went on describing till a reward was mentioned for their urine and dung. And if they pranced a course or two, there would be recorded a reward for every pace that they covered. As for one for whom they are a covering, he is the man who rears them for honour and dignity but does not forget the right of their backs and their stomachs, in plenty and adversity, As regards one for whom they are a burden, he is that who rears them for vainglory and showing off to the people; for him they are, the burden. They said: Messenger of Allah, what about asses? He said: Allah has not revealed to me anything in regards to it except this one comprehensive verse:&#8221; He who does an atom&#8217;s weight of good will see it, and he who does an atom&#8217;s weight of evil will see it&#8221; (xcix. 7).</span></p>

And when he would find no other way out he would thrust his hand in its mouth and it would gnaw it like a male camel.</span></p>

Mas&#8217;ud ), reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: 0 women, give sadaqa even though it be some of your jewellery. She returned to &#8216;Abdullah and said: You are a person with empty hands, whereas the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) has commanded us to give sadaqa, so better go to him and ask and if this will suffice for me; otherwise I shall give it to someone else. &#8216;Abdullah said to me (his wife): You better go yourself. So I went and there was another woman of the Ansar at the door of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) having the same porpose as I had. Now Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was invested with awe (so we did not like to knock). Then Bilal came out and we said to him: Go to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and inform him that there are two women at the door asking him whether it will serve them to give sadaqa to their spouses and to orphans who are under their charge, but do not inform him who we are. Bilal went to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and asked him (what these women had instructed him to ask). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked him who these women were. He (Bilal) said: They are women from Ansar and Zainab. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Which of the Zainabs? He said: The wife of &#8216;Abdullah. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: There are two rewards for them, the reward of kinship and the reward of Sadaqa.</span></p>

Most of them, nay, all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar. The colour of the face of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) underwent a change when he saw them in poverty. He then entered (his house) and came out and commanded Bilal (to pronounce Adhan). He pronounced Adhan and Iqima, and he (the Holy Prophet) observed prayer (along with his Companion) and then addressed (them reciting verses of the Holy Qur&#8217;an): &#8216;&#8221; 0 people, fear your Lord, Who created you from a single being&#8221; to the end of the verse,&#8221; Allah is ever a Watcher over you&#8221; (iv. 1). (He then recited) a verse of Sura Hashr:&#8221; Fear Allah. and let every soul consider that which it sends forth for the morrow and fear Allah&#8221; (lix. 18). (Then the audience began to vie with one another in giving charity.) Some donated a dinar, others a dirham, still others clothes, some donated a sa&#8217; of wheat, some a sa&#8217; of dates; till he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Bring) even if it is half a date. Then a person from among the Ansar came there with a money bag which his hands could scarcely lift; in fact, they could not (lift). Then the people followed continuously, till I saw two heaps of eatables and clothes, and I saw the face of the Messenger (may peace be upon him) glistening, like gold (on account of joy). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He who sets a good precedent in Islam, there is a reward for him for this (act of goodness) and reward of that also who acted according to it subsequently, without any deduction from their rewards; and he who sets in Islam an evil precedent, there is upon him the burden of that, and the burden of him also who acted upon it subsequently, without any deduction from their burden.</span></p>

They came to him and they were three hundred in number. They recited the Qur&#8217;an and he said: You are the best among the inhabitants of Basra, for you are the reciters among them. So continue to recite it. (But bear in mind) that your reciting for a long time may not harden your hearts as were hardened the hearts of those before you. We used to recite a surah which resembled in length and severity to (Surah) Bara&#8217;at. I have, however, forgotten it with the exception of this which I remember out of it:&#8221; If there were two valleys full of riches, for the son of Adam, he would long for a third valley, and nothing would fill the stomach of the son of Adam but dust.&#8221; And we used so recite a slirah which resembled one of the surahs of Musabbihat, and I have forgotten it, but remember (this much) out of it:&#8221; Oh people who believe, why do you say that which you do not practise&#8221; (lxi 2.) and&#8221; that is recorded in your necks as a witness (against you) and you would be asked about it on the Day of Resurrection&#8221; (xvii. 13).</span></p>

Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: The son of the sister of the people is included among the tribe, and (farther) said: The Quraish have recently abandoned Jahillyya and have just been delivered from distress; I, therefore, intend to help them and conciliate them. Don&#8217;t you feel happy that the people should return with worldly riches and you return with the Messenger of Allah to your houses? (So far as my love for you is concerned I should say) if the people were to tread a valley and the Ansar tread a narraw path (in a mountain) I would tread the narrow path of the Ansar.</span></p>

Upon this the Ansar said: It is strange that our swords are dripping with their blood, whereas our spoils have been given to them (to the Quraish). This (remark) reached the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and so he gathered them and said: What is this that has been conveyed to me about you? They said: (Yes) it is that very thing that, has reached you-and they were not (the people) to speak lie.

The polytheists suffered defeat. and the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) acquired a large quantity of spoils, and he distributed them among the refugees and the people recently delivered (of Mecca) but did not give anything to the Ansar. The Ansar said: In the hour of distress it is we who are called (for help). but the spoils are given to other people besides us. This (remark) reached him (the Holy Prophet). and he gathered them In a tent. and said: What is this news that has reached me on your behalf? They kept silence. Upon this he said: 0 people of Ansar, don&#8217;t you like that people should go away with worldly (riches), and you go away with Muhammad taking him to your houses? They said: Yes, happy we are.

The polytheists came, forming themselves into the best rows that I have seen. They first formed the rows of cavalry, then those of infantry, and then those of women behind them. Then there were formed the rows of sheep and goats and then of other animals. We were also people large in number, and our (number) had reached six thousand. And on one side Khalid b. Walid was in charge of the cavalry. And our horses at once turned back from our rear. And we could hardly hold our own when our horses were exposed, and the bedouins and the peoplewhom we knew took to their heels. (Seeing this) the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) called thus: 0 refugees,0 refugees. He then. said: 0 Ansar,0 Ansar. (Anas said: This hadith is transmitted by a group of eminent persons.) We said: At thy beck and call are we, Messenger of Allah. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then advanced and he (Anas) said: By Allah, we had not yet reached them when Allah defeated them. and we took possession of the wealth and we then marched towards Ta&#8217;if, and we besieged them for forty nights. and then came back to Mecca and encamped (at a place), and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) began to bestow a hundred camels upon each individual.

It was conveyed to him (the Holy Prophet) that the Ansar cherished a desire that they should be given (that very portion) which the people (of Quraish) had got. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood up and, after having praised Allah and lauded Him, addressed them thus: 0 people of Ansar, did I not find you erring and Allah guided you aright through me, and (in the state of) being destitute and Allah made you free from want through me, and in a state of disunity and Allah united you through me, and they (the Ansar) said: Allah and His Messenger are most benevolent. He (again) said: Why do you not answer me? They said: Allah and His Messenger are the most benevolent. He said, If you wish you should say so and so, and the event (should take) such and such course (and in this connection he made a mention) of so many things. &#8216;Amr is under the impressionthat he has not been able to remember them. He (the Holy Prophet) further said: Don&#8217;t you feel happy (over this state of affairs) that the people should go away with goats and camels, and you go to your places along with the Messenger of Allah? The Ansar are inner garments (more close to me) and (other) people are outer garments. Had there not been migration, I would have been a man from among the Ansar. If the people were to tread a valley or a narrow path, I would tread the valley (chosen) by the Ansar or narrow path (trodden) by them. And you would soon find after me preferences (over you in getting material benefits). So you should show patience till you meet me at the Haud (Kauthar).</span></p>

He would look at its Iron head, but would not find anything ticking) there. He would then see at the lowest end, but would not find anything sticking there. He would then see at its grip but would not find anything sticking to it. He would then see at its feathers and he would find nothing sticking to them (as the arrow would pass so quickly that nothing would stick to it) neither excre- ment nor blood. They would be recognised by the presence of a black man among them whose upper arms would be like a woman&#8217;s breast, or like a piece of meat as it quivers, and they would come forth at the time when there is dissension among the people. Abu Sai&#8217;d said: I testify to the fact that I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and I testify to the fact that &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib fought against them and I was with him. He gave orders about that man who was sought for, and when he was brought in, and when I looked at him, he was exactly as the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had described him.</span></p>

When I talk to you of anything which is between me and you (there might creep some error in it) for battle is an outwitting. I heard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: There would arise at the end of the age a people who would be young in age and immature in thought, but they would talk (in such a manner) as if their words are the best among the creatures. They would recite the Qur&#8217;an, but it would not go beyond their throats, and they would pass through the religion as an arrow goes through the prey. So when you meet them, kill them, for in their killing you would get a reward with Allah on the Day of judgmelat.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Zaid b. Wahb Jahani reported and he was among the squadron which wall under the command of Ali (Allah be pleased with him) and which set out (to curb the activities) of the Khwarij. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) said: 0 people, I heard the Messeinger of Allah (may peace be upon him) say: There would arise from my Ummah a people who would recite the Qur&#8217;an, and your recital would seem insignificant as compared with their recital, your prayer as compared with their prayer, arid your fast, as compared with their fast. They would recite the Qur&#8217;an thinking that it sup- ports them, whereas it is an evidence against them. Their prayer does not get beyond their collar bone; they would swerve through Islam just as the arrow passes through the prey. If the squadron which is to encounter them were to know (what great boon) has been assured to them by their Apostle (may peace be upon him) they would completely rely upon this deed (alone and cease to do other good deeds), and their (that of the Khwarij) distinctive mark is that there would be (among them) a person whose wrist would be without the arm, and the end of his wrist would be fleshy like the nipple of the breast on which there would be white hair. You would be marching towards Muawiya and the people of Syria and you would leave them behind among your children and your property (to do harm). By Allah, I believe that these are the people (against whom you have been commanded to fight and get reward) for they have shed forbidden blood, and raided the animals of the people. So go forth in the name of Allah (to fight against them). Salama b. Kuhail mentioned that Zaid b. Wahb made me alight at every stage, till we crossed a bridge. &#8216;Abdullah b. Wahb al-Rasibi was at the head of the Khwarij when we encountered them. He (&#8216;Abdullah) said to his army: Throw the spears and draw out your swords from their sheaths, for I fear that they would attack you as they attacked you on the day of Harura. They went back and threw their spears and drew out their swords, and people fought against them with spears and they were killed one after another. Only two persons were killed among the people (among the army led by Hadrat &#8216;Ali) on that day. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) said: Find out from among them (the dead bodies of the Khwarij) (the maimed). They searched but did not find him. &#8216;Ali (Allah be pleased with him) then himself stood up and (walked) till he came to the people who had been killed one after another. He (&#8216;Ali) said: Search them to the last, and then (&#8216;Ali&#8217;s companions) found him (the dead body of the maimed) near the earth. He (Hadrat &#8216;Ali) then pronounced Allah-O-Akbar (Allah is the Greatest) and then said, Allah told the Truth and His Messenger (may peace be upon him) conveyed it. Then there stood before him &#8216;Abida Salmani who said: Commander of the Believers, by Allah, besides Whom there is no god but He, (tell me) whether you heard this hadith from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He said: Yes, by Allah, besides Whom there is no god but He. He asked him to take an oath thrice and he took the oath.</span></p>

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him described their characteristics and I found these characteristics in them. They state the truth with their tongue, but it does not go beyond this part of their bodies (and the narrator pointed towards his throat). The most hateful among the creation of Allah us one black man among them (Khwarij). One of his hand is like the teat of a goat or the nipple of the breast. When &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib (Allah be pleased with him) killed them, he said: Search (for his dead body). They searched for him, but they did not find it (his dead body). Upon this he said: Go (and search for him). By Allah, neither I have spoken a lie nor has the lie been spoken to me. &#8216;Ali said this twice and thrice. They then found him (the dead body) in a rain. They brought (his dead) body till they placed it before him (Hadrat &#8216;Ali). &#8216;Ubaidullah said: And, I was present at (that place) when this happened and when &#8216;Ali said about them.

Abd al-Muttalib gathered together and said: By Allah, if we had sent these two young boys (i. e. I and Fadl b. &#8216;Abbas) to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and they had spoken to him, he would have appointed them (as the collectors) of these sadaqat; and they would (collect them) and pay (to the Holy Prophet) as other people (collectors) paid and would get a share as other people got it. As they were talking about it there came &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib and stood before them, and they made a mention of it to him. &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib said: Don&#8217;t do that; by Allah he (the Holy Prophet) would not do that (would not accept your request). Rabi&#8217;a b. Harith turned to him and said: By Allah, you are not doing so but out of jealousy that you nurse against us By Allah, you became the son-in-law of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) but we felt no jealousy against you (for this great privilege of yours). &#8216;Ali then said: Send them (if you like). They set out and &#8216;Ali lay on the bed. When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) offered the noon prayer. we went ahead of him to his apartment and stood near it till he came out. He took hold of our ears (out of love and affection) and then said: Give out what you have kept in your hearts. He then entered (the apartment) and we also went in and he (the Holy Prophet) was on that day (in the house of) Zainab b. jahsh. We urged each (of us) to speak. Then one of us thus spoke: Messenger of Allah, you are the best of humanity and the best to cement the ties of blood-relations. We have reached the-marriageable age. We have come (to you) so that you may appoint us (as collectors) of these sadaqat. and we would pay you just as thin people (other collectors) pay you, and get our share as others get it. He (the Holy Prophet) kept silence for a long time till we wished that we should speak with him (again), and Zainab pointied to us from behind the curtain not to talk (any more). He (the Holy Prophet) said; It does not become the family of Muhammad (to accept) sadaqat for they are the impurities of people. You call to me Mahmiya (and he was in charge of khums, i. e, of the one-fifth part that goes to the treasury out of the spoils of war), and Naufal b. Harith b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib. They both came to him, and he (the Holy Prophet) said to Mahmiya: Marry your daughter to this young man (i. e. Fadl b. &#8216;Abbas), and he married her to him And he said to Naufal b. Harith: Marry your daughter to this young man (i e. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib b. Rabi&#8217;a, the narrator of this hadith) and he married her to me, and he said to Mahmiya: Pay so much mahr on behalf of both of them from this khums Zuhri, however. said: He did not determine (the amount of mahr).</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 6: </span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span><em>The Book of Fasting (Kitab Al-Sawm) </em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>After prayer the second obligatory duty which every Muslim is required toper- form is that of fasting during the month of Ramadan. The word sawm which has been used in the Holy Qur&#8217;an and the Hadith for fasting means&#8221; to abstain&#8221; ; thus a horse that abstains from moving about or from eating the fodder is said to be sa&#8217;im. In the technical language sawm signifies fasting or abstaining from food and drink and sexual intercourse from the dim beginning of dawn till sunset. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Fasting as an institution for the purification of the soul is common to all Divine religions. The writer of the article on&#8221; Fasting&#8221; in the Encyclopadia Britannica states that&#8221; it would be difficult to name any religious system of any description in which it is wholly unrecognized.&#8221; This institution was well established among the Jews and the Christians. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The records of the Hadith bear ample testimony to the fact that fasting was a common religious practice among the pre-Islamic Arabs too, and they used to observe fast on the tenth of Muharram because it was on this very day that Allah saved Moses and his companions from the clutches of the Pharaoh who was drowned in the sea along with his army. The Arabs and other people too were familiar with fasting as an act of penitence or of propitiation or a preparatory rite before some act of sacramental eating or an initiation or a mourning ceremony. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>In Islam fasting is primarily an institution for a spiritual discipline and selfcontrol. It is in fact an exercise in religious devotion in the form of cheerful and willing renunciation, for a definite period, of all the appetites of flesh lawful in themselves (the unlawful ones being ruled out of course). The Qur&#8217;an says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>0 ye who believe! prescribed unto you is fasting even as it was prescribed unto those before you. that haply you may become God-conscious (ii. 183). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Of all the creation of God only man deviates from His path. We will find that two things are mainly responsible for this: the love for material possessions and the tempta- tions of the flesh. Islam has, through the institutions of Zakat and Sadaqat, purged the hearts of its followers from the love of wealth, and has inculcated in him the habit to part with it readily for the sake of God. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Fasting has been ordained as a religious duty for the Muslims for subduing their lust and keeping their appetites well within reasonable bounds so that man may not become their slave and lose control over himself. The Qur&#8217;an clearly states that a man cannot attain salvation unless he learns to restrain his self from low desires.&#8221; And as for him who fears to stand before his Lord and restrains himself from low desires, Paradise is surely the abode&#8221; (lxxix. 40-41). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The exercise of abstaining from things otherwise lawful in the ordinary course of life, at the behest of Allah, strengthens man&#8217;s morality and self-control and deepens in him the consciousness of the Lord. This is what distinguishes fasting in Islam from fasting in other religions. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>It should also be borne in mind that fasting does not aim at inflicting punishment upon people or sadding upon them unbearable burdens. The underlying idea behind it is to teach moderation and spiritual discipline so that human temptations may not become so wild and uncontrollable as to flout the commands of the Great Master. To be a true servant of Allah, it is essential that man should be able to conform his behaviour to the moral and spiritual discipline embodied in the Shari&#8217;ah of Islam. One cannot achieve this end if one finds oneself helpless before untamed and turbulent desires. Fasting is indispensable for this moral and spiritual training. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Another distinguishing feature of Islamic fasting is that it does not train a person for complete renunication but for perfect and cheerful obedience to the Lord All those things from which man is commanded to abstain during fast, e. g. eating, drinking and sexual intercourse, become permissible for him at the end of the fast. This shows that Islam does not look down upon the appetite of flesh as something ignoble and thus fit to be exterminated root and branch from the human soul. According to Islam, there is nothing profane or ignoble in human personality: both soul and body are sacred and worthy of respect. No aspect is to be ignored and no urge is to be completely curbed. What is required is to keep all these urges well within their proper limits so that none of them transgresses natural bounds and becomes the source of trouble. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>That fasting is an institution for moral elevation can be judged from the fact that Allah does not impose check only upon eating, drinking and sexual intercourse from dawn to sunset, but also exhorts His servants to refrain from other foul acts, for ex- ample, backbiting, indulging in foul speech, telling lies, etc. Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: If one does not abandon falsehood and other actions like it, God has no need that one should abandon one&#8217;s food and drink (Sahih Bukhari). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>The social aspect of fasting in Ramadan is that the whole atmosphere is permeated with religious piety and devotion to Allah. There is one extra congregational prayer, Tarawih, during the night, in which the Qur&#8217;an is recited and the Muslim is reminded of the fact that it was in the month of Ramadan that the revelation of the Qur&#8217;an commenced. The sadaqqt are also given with greater zeal and fervour in this month. Thus the whole Muslim society is inspired by the love of God. Abu Huraira reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: When Ramadan begins, the gates of Heaven are opened, the gates of Hell are locked, and the devils are chained (Bukhari and Muslim). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Muhammad Asad, while elucidating the spiritual and moral significance of fast says:&#8221; Twofold I learned, is the purpose of this month of fasting. One has to abstain from food and drink in order to feel in one&#8217;s body what the poor and hungry feel: thus social responsibility is being hammered into human consciousness as a religious postulate. The other purpose of fasting during Ramadan is self-discipline, an aspect of individual morality strongly accentuated in all Islamic teachings (as, for instance, in the total prohibition of all intoxicants, which Islam regards as too easy an avenue of escape from consciousness and responsibility). In these two elements-brotherhood of man and Individual self-discipline -I began to discern nhe outline of Islam&#8217;s ethical out look&#8221; (Road to Mecca, London, 1954, p. 188). </span></p>

One of the Muslims said: Messenger of Allah, you yourself observe Saum Wisal. whereupon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Who among you is like me? I spend night (in a state) that my Allah feeds me and provides me drink. When they (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) did not agree in abandoning the uninterrupted fast, then the Holy Prophet (may peace. be upon him) also observed this fast with them for a day, and then for a day. They then saw the new moon and he (the Holy Prophet) said: If the appearance of the new moon were delayed. I would have observed more (fasts) with you (and he did it) by way of warning to them as they had not agreed to refrain (from observing Saum Wisal)</span></p>

Then another man came and he stood likewise till we became a group. When the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) perceived that we were behind him, he lightened the prayer. He then went to his abode and observed such (a long) prayer (the like of which) he never observed with us. When it was morning we said to him: Did you perceive us during the night? Upon this he said: Yes, it was this (realisation) that induced me to do that which I did.

The Companions said; We henceforth observed fast on it (on the day of &#8216;Ashura) and, God willing, made our children observe that. We went to the mosque and made toys out of wool for them and when anyone felt hungry and wept for food we gave them these toys till it was the time to break the fast.</span></p>

She said: He used to observe fast (at times so continuously) that we said: He has fasted (never to break), and he did not observe fast till we said: He has given up perhaps never to fast, and I never saw him observing (voluntary fasts) more in any other month than that of Sha&#8217;ban. (lt appeared as if) he observed fast throughout the whole of Sha&#8217;ban except a few (days).</span></p>

I said: Messenger of Allah. I am capable of doing more than this. Thereupon he said: Fast one day and do not fast for the next two days. I said: Messenger of Allah, I have the strength to do more than that. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him), said: Fast one day and break on the other day.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span>Yahya reported: I and &#8216;Abdullah b. Yazid set out till we came to Abu Salama. We sent a messenger to him (in his house in order to inform him about our arrival) and he came to us. There was a mosque near the door of his house, and we were in that mosque, till he came out to us. He said: If you like you may enter (the house) and, if you like, you may sit here (in the mosque). We said: We would rather sit here and (you) relate to us. He (Yahya) then narrated that &#8216;Abdullah b Amr b. al-&#8216;As (Allah be pleased with them) told him: I used to observe fast uninterruptedly and recited the (whole of the) Qur&#8217;an every night. It (the uninterrupted fasting and recital of the Qur&#8217;in every night) was mentioned to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) or he sent for me, and I went to him and he said to me: I have been informed that you fast continuously and recite (the whole of the Qur&#8217;An) every night. I said: Apostle of Allah, it is right, but I covet thereby nothing but good, whereupon he said: It suffices for you that you should observe fast for three days during every mouth. I said: Apostle of Allah, I am capable of doing more than this. He said: Your wife has a right upon you, your visitor has a right upon you, your body has a right upon you; so observe the fast of David, the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him), for he was the best worshipper of Allah. I said: Apostle of Allah, what is the fast of David? He said: He used to fast one day and did not fast the other day. He (also) said: Recite the Qur&#8217;an during every month. I said: Apostle of Allah, I am capable of doing more than this, whereupon he said: Recite it in twenty days; recite it in ten days. I said: I am capable of doing more than this, whereupon he said: Recite it every week, and do not exceed beyond this, for your wife has a right upon you, your visitor has a right upon you, your body has a right upon you. He (&#8216;Amr b. &#8216;As) said: I was hard to myself and thus I was put to hardship. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) had told me: &#8216;You do not know you may live long (thus and bear the hardships for a long time), and I accepted that which the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) had told me. When I grew old I wished I had availed myself of the conces- sion (granted by) the Apostle of Allah (may-peace be upon him). This hadith has been narrated by Yahya b. Abu Kathir with the same chain of transmitters and he made this addition after these words: During every month, (fasting) for three days, there is for you ten times for every good and that is perpetual fasting (for three days would bring a reward for full thirty days). I said: What is the fast of the Apostle of Allah, David? He said: Half of the age (observing fast on alternate days for the whole life). And in the hadith no mention has been made of the recital of the Qur&#8217;an, and he did not say: Your visitor has a right upon you, but (instead) he said: Your son has a right upon you.</span></p>

I said: Apostle of Allah, I find myself more powerful than this. He said: Then observe the fast of David (peace be upon him). He (&#8216;Amr) said: Apostle of Allah, how did David observe fast? He (the Holy Prophet) said: He used to fast one day and break it on the other day, and he did not run (from the battlefield) as he encountered (the enemy). He said: Apostle of Allah, who can guarantee this for me (will I also encounter the enemy dauntlessly)? &#8216;Ata&#8217;, the narrator of the hadith, said: I do not know how there (crept in) the matter of perpetual fast. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), however, said: He who observed perpetual fast did not fast at all; he who observed perpetual fast did not fast at all, he who observed perpetual fast did not fast at all. This hadith has been narrated by Ibn Juraij with the same chain of transmitters. Imam Muslim has narrated this hadith on the authority of Abu &#8216;Abbas al-Sa&#8217;ib b.

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) felt annoyed. 1560 When &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with him) noticed his annoyance, he said: We are well pleased with Allah as our Lord, with Islam as our Code of Life, and with Muhammad as our Prophet. We seek refuge with Allah from the anger of Allah and that of His Messenger. &#8216;Umar kept on repeating these words till his (the Prophet&#8217;s) anger calmed down. Then Umar said: Messenger of Allah. what is the position of one who perpetually observes fasts? Thereupon he said: He neither fasted nor broke it, or he said: He did not fast and he did not break it. He said: What about him who observes fast for two days and breaks one day. There- upon he said: Is anyone capable of doing it? He (&#8216;Umar) said: What is the position of him who observes fast for a day and breaks on the other day? Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: That is the fast of David (peace be upon him). He (&#8216;Umar) said: What about him who observes fast one day and breaks it for two days. Thereupon he (the Messenger of Allah) said: I wish, I were given strength to observe that. Thereafter he said: The observance of three days&#8217; fast every Month and that of Ramadan every year is a perpetual fasting. I seek from Allah that fasting on the day of &#8216;Arafa may atone for the sins of the preceding and the coming years. and I seek from Allah that fasting on the day of Ashura may atone for the sins of the preceding year.</span></p>

Then he addressed the people on the night he came back (to his residence) and commanded them as Allah desired (him to command) and then said: I used to devote myself (observe i&#8217;tikaf) during these ten (nights).

Abu Sa&#8217;id al-Khudri said: It rained on the twenty-first night and the water dripped (from the roof) of the mosque at the place where the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed prayer. I looked at him and as he completed the dawn prayer, (I found) his face was wet with mud and water.</span></p>

He then put his head out and talked with people and they came near him, and he (the Holy Prophet) said: I observed i&#8217;tikaf in the first ten (nights and days) in order to seek that night (Lailat-ul-Qadr). I then observed i&#8217;tikaf in the middle ten days. Then (an angel) was sent to me and I was told that this (night) is among the last ten (nights).

He said: Yes, (and added) we were observing i&#8217;tikaf with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) in the middle ten days of Ramadan, and came out on the morning of the twentieth and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) addressed us and said: I was shown Lailat-ul-Qadr, but I forgot (the exact night) or I was caused to forget it, so seek it in the last ten odd (nights), and I was shown that I was prostrating in water and clay.

Then the cloud gathered and there was (so heavy) a downpour that the roof of the mosque which was made of the branches of date-palms began to drip. Then there was prayer and I saw the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) prostrating in water and clay till I saw the traces of clay on his forehead.</span></p>

When (these nights) were over, he commanded to strike the tent. Then it was made manifest to him that (Lailat-ul-Qadr) was in the last ten nights (of Ramadan), and commanded to pitch the tent (again). He then came to the people and said: O people, Lailat-ul-Qadr was made manifest to me and I came out to inform you about it that two persons came contend- ing with each other and there was a devil along with them and I forgot it. So seek it in the last ten nights of Ramadan. Seek it on the ninth, on the seventh and on the fifth. I (one of the narrators) said: Abu Sa&#8217;id, you know more than us about numbers. He said: Yes, indeed we have better right than you. I said: What is this ninth, seventh, and fifth? He said: When twenty-one (nights are over) and the twenty-second begins, it is the ninth, and when twenty-three (nights) are over, that which follows (the last night) is the seventh, and when twenty-five nights are over, what follows it is fifth. Ibn Khallad said: Instead of the word Yahliqan (contending), he said Yakhtasiman, (they are disputing).</span></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 4:</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book of Prayers (Kitab Al-Salat) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prayer is the soul of religion. Where there is no prayer, there can be no purification of the soul. The non-praying man is rightly considered to be a soulless man. Take prayer out of the world, and it is all over with religion because it is with prayer that man has the consciousness of God and selfless love for humanity and inner sense of piety. Prayer is, therefore, the first, the highest, and the most solemn phenomenon and manifestation of religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The way in which prayer is offered and the words which are recited in it explain the true nature of religion of which it is the expression of man&#8217;s contact with the Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prayer in Islam gives in a nutshell the teachings of Islam. The very first thing which comes into prominence in Islamic prayer is that it is accompanied by bodily movements. It implies that Islam lifts not only the soul to the spiritual height, but also illuminates the body of man with the light of God-consciousness. It aims at purifying both body and soul, for it finds no cleavage between them. Islam does not regard body and soul as two different entities opposed to each other, or body as the prison of the soul from which It yearns to secure freedom in order to soar to heavenly heights.&#8221; The soul is an organ of the body which exploits it for physiological purposes, or body is an instrument of the soul&#8221; (Iqbal, Reconstruction of Religious Thought in Islam, p 105), and thus both need spiritual enlightenment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, Islamic prayer does not aim at such a spiritual contact with God in which the world and self are absolutely denied, in which human personality is dissolved, disappears and is absorbed in the Infinite Lord. Islam does not favour such a meditation and absorption in which man ceases to be conscious of his own self and feels himself to be perfectly identified with the Infinite, and claims in a mood of ecstasy: My&#8221; I&#8221; has become God, or rather he is God. Islam wants to inculcate the consciousness of the indwelling of the light of God in body and soul but does allow him to transport himself in the realm of lnfinity. It impresses upon his mind that he is the humble servant of the Great and Glorious Lord and his spiritual development and religious piety lies in sincere and willing obedience to Allah. The very first step towards the achievement of this objective is that man should have a clear consciousness of his own finiteness and Infiniteness of the Lord, and clearly visualise and feel that he is created as a human being by the Creator and Master of the universe, and he cannot, therefore, become demi-god or god. His success lies in proving himself by his outlook and behaviour that he is the true and loyal servant of his Great Master. Islamic prayer is, therefore, the symbol of humble reverence before the Majesty of the Glorious Lord.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar reported: When the Muslims came to Medina, they gathered and sought to know the time of prayer but no one summoned them. One day they discussed the matter, and some of them said: Use something like the bell of the Christians and some of them said: Use horn like that of the Jews. Umar said: Why may not a be appointed who should call (people) to prayer? The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: O Bilal, get up and summon (the people) to prayer.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas reported: Bilal was commanded (by the Apostle of Allah) to repeat (the phrases of) Adhan twice and once in Iqama. The narrator said: I made a men- tion of it before Ayyub who said: Except for saying: Qamat-is-Salat [the time for prayer has come].</p>

Then hearing him say: I testify that there is no god but Allah. there is no god but Allah, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: You have come out of the Fire (of Hell).

In the badith transmitted by Jarir on the authority of Sulaiman, Qatida&#8217;s further words are: When (the Qur&#8217;in) is recited (in prayer), you should observe silence, and (the following words are) not found in the hadith narrated by anyone except by Abu Kamil who heard it from Abu &#8216;Awina (and the words are): Verily Allah vouchsafed through the tongue of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) this: Allah listens to him who praises Him. Abu Ishaq (a student of Imam Muslim) said: Abu Bakr the son of Abu Nadr&#8217;s sister has (critically) discussed this hadith. Imam Muslim said: Whom can you find a more authentic transmitter of badith than Sulaiman? Abu Bakr said to him (Imam Muslim): What about the hadith narrated by Abd Huraira, i. e. the hadith that when the Qur&#8217;in is recited (in pray er) observe silence? He (Abu Bakr again) said: Then, why. have you not included it (in your compilation)? He (Imam Muslim) said: I have not included in this every hadith which I deem authentic; I have recorded only such ahadith on which there is an agreement (amongst the Muhaddithin apart from their being authentic).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ubaidullah b. Abdullah reported: I visited &#8216;A&#8217;isha and asked her to tell about the illness of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). She agreed and said: The Apostle (may peace be upon him) was seriously ill and he asked whether the people had prayed. We said: No, they are waiting for you, Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Put some water in the tub for me. We did accordingly and he (the Holy Prophet) took a bath;and, when he was about to move with difficulty, he fainted. When he came round, he again said: Have the people said prayer? We said: No, they are waiting for you, Messenger of Allah. He (the Holy Prophet) again said: Put some water for me in the tub. We did accordingly and he took a bag, but when he was about to move with difficultyhe fainted. When he came round, he asked whether the people had prayed. We said: No, they are waiting for you, Messenger of Allah. He said: Put some water for me in the tub. We did accordingly and he took a bath and he was about to move with difficulty when he fainted. When he came roundhe said: Have the people saidprayer? We said: No, they are waiting for you, Messenger of Allah. She (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said: The people were staying in the mosque and waiting for the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) to lead the last (night) prayer. She (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sent (instructions) to Abu Bakr to lead the people in prayer. When the messenger came, he told him (Abd Bakr): The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) has ordered you to lead the people in prayer. Abu Bakr who was a man of very tenderly feelings asked Umar to lead the prayer. &#8216;Umar said: You are more entitled to that. Abu Bakr led the prayers during those days. Afterwards the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) felt some relief and he went out supported by two men, one of them was al-&#8216;Abbas, to the noon prayer. Abu Bakr was leading the people in prayer. When Abu Bakr saw him. he began to withdraw, but the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) told him not to withdraw. He told his two (companions) to seat him down beside him (Abu Bakr). They seated him by the side of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr said the prayer standing while following the prayer of the Apostle (way peace be upon him) and the people Bald prayer (standing) while following the prayer of Abu Bakr. The Apostle (may peace be upon him) was seated. Ubaidullah said: I visited &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Abbas, and said: Should I submit to you what &#8216;A&#8217;isha had told about the illness of the Apostle (may peace be upon him)? He said: Go ahead. I submitted to him what had been transmitted by her (&#8216;A&#8217;isha). He objected to none of it, only asking whether she had named to him the man who accompanied al-&#8216;Abbas. I said: No. He said: It was &#8216;Ali.</p>

I, therefore, desired that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) should leave Abu Bakr aside in this matter.</p>

By Allah, there is nothing disturbing in it for me but the idea that the people may not takeevil omen with regard to one who is the first to occupy the place of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him).

Abu Bakr said: It does not become the son of Abu Quhafa to lead prayer before the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said (to the people) around him: What is it that I saw you clapping so vigorously? (Behold) when anything happens in prayer, say: Subha Allah, for when you would utter it, it would attract the attention, while clapping of hands is meant for women.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Uthman b. Abu&#8217;l-&#8216;As at-Thaqafi reported: The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to him: Lead your people in prayer. I said: Messenger of Allah. I perceive something (disturbing) in my soul. He (the Holy Prophet) asked me to draw near him and making me sit down in front of him he placed his hand on my breast between my nipples. and then, telling me to turn round, he placed it on my back between my shoulders. He then said: Act as an Imam for your people. He who acts as Imam of the people, he must be brief, for among them are the aged, among them are the sick, among them are the weak, and among them are the people who have business to attend. But when any of you prays alone, he may pray as he likes.</p>

There are men who take omens. That is something which they find in their breasts, but let it not turn their way (from freedom of action). I said: Among us there are men who draw lines. He said: There was a prophet who drew lines, so if they do it as they did, that is allowable. I had a maid-servant who tended goats by the side of Uhud and Jawwaniya. One day I happened to pass that way and found that a wolf had carried a goat from her flock. I am after all a man from the posterity of Adam. I felt sorry as they (human beings) feel sorry.

When he finished the prayer, we said: Messenger of Allah, we heard you say something during the prayer which we have not heard you say before, and we saw you stretch out your hand. He replied: Allah&#8217;s enemy Iblis came with a flame of fire to put it in my face, so I said three times:&#8221; I Seek refuge in Allah from thee.&#8221; Then I said three times:&#8221; I curse thee with Allah&#8217;s full curse.&#8221; But he did not retreat (on any one of these) three occasions.

And if they do this (blame me) they are the enemies of Allah, and are non-believers and have gone astray. And I leave not after me anything which to my mind seems more important than Kalala. And I never turned towards the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) (for guidance) more often than this Kalala, and he (the Holy Prophet) was not annoyed with me on any other (issue) than this: (And he was so perturbed) that he struck his fingers on my chest and said: Does this verse. that is at the end of Surat al-Nisa&#8217;. which was revealed in the hot season not suffice you? And if I live longer I would decide this (problem so clearly) that one who reads the Qur&#8217;an, or one who does not read it, would be able to take (correct), decisions (under its light). He (&#8216;Umar) further said: Allah! I call You witness on these governors of lands, that I sent them to (the peoples of these lands) so that they should administer justice amongst them, teach them their religion and the Sunnah of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him), and distribute amongst them the spoils of war and refer to me that which they find difficult to perform. O people. you eat &#8216;these two plants and these are onions and garlic. and I find them nothing but repugnant for I saw that when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) sensed the odour of these two from a person in a mosque, he was made to go to al-Baqi&#8217;.

When there is a downpour there is then a current (of water) in the valley that stands between me and them and I find it impossible to go to their mosque and lead them in prayer. Messenger of Allah, I earnestly beg of you that you should come and observe prayer at a place of worship (in my house) so that I should then use it as a place of worship. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Well, it God so wills. I would soon do so. &#8216;Itban said: On the following day when the day dawned, the Messenger of Allah (may peace he upon him) came along with Abu Bakr at-Siddiq, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked permission (to get into the house). I gave him the permission, and be did not sit after entering the house, when he said: At what place in your house you desire me to say prayer? I (&#8216;Itban b. Malik) said: I pointed to a corner in the house, The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood (at that place for prayer) and pronounced Allah-o-Akbar (Allah is the Greatest) (as an expression for the commencement of prayer). We too stood behind him, and he said two rak&#8217;ahs and then pronounced salutation (marking the end of the prayer). We detained him (the Holy Prophet) for the meat curry we had prepared for, him. The people of the neighbouring houses came and thus there was a good gathering in (our house). One of them said: Where is Malik b. Dukhshun? Upon this one of them remarked: He is a hypocrite; he does not love Allah and His Messenger. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do not say so about him.

He said: Listen I by Allah, I do not like my house to be situated by the side of Muhammad (may peace be upon him). I took (these words of his) ill and came to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and informed him about (these words). He (the Holy Prophet) called him and he said exactly like that (which he had mentioned to Ubbay b. Ka&#8217;b), but made a mention of this (also) that he wanted a reward for his steps. Upon this the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: In fact for you is the reward which you expect.</p>

He told Bilal to remain on guard during the night and he (Bilal) prayed as much as he could, while the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and his Companions slept. When the time for dawn approached Bilal leaned against his camel facing the direction from which the dawn would appear but he was overcome by sleep while he was leaning against his camel, and neither the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) nor Bilal, nor anyone else among his Companions got up, till the sun shone on them. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was the first of them to awake and, being startled, he called to Bilal who said: Messenger of Allah I may my father and mother be offered as ransom for thee, the same thing overpowered me which overpowered you. He (the Holy Prophet, then) said: Lead the beasts on: so they led their camels to some distance. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then performed ablution and gave orders to Bilal who pronounced the Iqama and then led them in the morning prayer. When he finished the prayer he said: When anyone forgets the prayer, he should observe it when he remembers it, for Allah has said:&#8221; And observe the prayer for remembrance of Me&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an. xx. 14).

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Qatida reported: The Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) addressed us and said: You would travel In the evening and the might till (God willing) you would come in the morning to a place of water. So the people travelled (self absorbed) without paying any heed to one another, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) also travelled till It was midnight. I was by his side. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) began to doze and leaned (to one side) of his camel. I came to him and I lent him support without awaking him till he sat poised on his ride. He went on travelling till a major part of the night was over and (he again) leaned (to one side) of his camel. I supported him without awaking him till he sat&#8221; bed on his ride. and then travelled till it was near dawn. He (again) leaned which was far more inclined than the two earlier leanings and he was about to fall down. So I came to him and supported him and he lifted his head and said; Who is this? I said: it is Abu Qatida. He (the Holy Prophet again) said: Since how long have you been travelling along with me like this? I said: I have been travelling in this very state since the night. He said: May Allah protect you, as you have protected His Apostle (from falling down), and again said: Do you see that we are hidden from the people? &#8211; and again said: Do you see anyone? I said: Here is a rider. I again said: Here Is another rider till we gathered together and we were seven riders. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stepped aside of the highway and placed his head (for sleep and said): Guard for us our prayers. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was the first to wake up and the rays of the sun were falling on his back. We got up startled He (the Holy Prophet) said: Ride on So we rode on till the sun had (sufficiently) risen. He then came down from his camel and called for a jug of water which I had with me. There was a little water in that. He performed ablution with that which was less thorough as compared with his usual ablutions and some water of that had been left. He (the Holy Prophet) said to Abu Qatida: Keep a watch over your jug of water; it would have (a miraculous) condition about it. Then Bilal summoned (people) to prayer and then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed two rak&#8217;ahs and then said the morning prayer as he said every day. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) (then) rode on and we rode along with him and some of us whispered to the others saying: How would there be compensation for omission in our prayers? Upon this he (the Apostle of Allah) said: Is there not in me (my life) a model for you? There is no omission in sleeping. The (cognizable) emission is that one should not say prayer (intentionally) till the time of the other prayer comes. So he who did like it (omitted prayer in sleep or due to other unavoidable circumstances) should say prayer when he becomes aware of it and on the next day he should observe it at its prescribed time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (the Holy Prophet) said: What do you think the people would have done (at this hour)? They would have in the morning found their Apostle missing from amongst them and then Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar would have told them that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) must be behind you, he cannot leave you behind (him), but the people said: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) is ahead of you. So if you had obeyed Abu Bakr and Umar, you would have gone on the right path. So we proceeded on till we came up to the people (from whom we had lagged behind) and the day had considerably risen and everything became hot, and they (the Companions of the Holy Prophet) said: Messenger of Allah, we are dying of thirst. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) remarked: There is no destruction for you. And again said: Bring that small cup of mine and he then asked for the jug of water to be brought to him. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) began to pour water (in that small cup) and Abu Qatida gave them to drink. And when the people saw that there was (a little) water in the jug, they fell upon it. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Behave well; the water (is enough) to satiate all of you. Then they (the Companions) began to receive (their share of) water with calmness (without showing any anxiety) and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) began to fill (the cap), and I began to serve them till no one was left except me and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). He then filled (the cup) with water and said to me: Drink it. I said: Messenger of Allah, I would not drink till you drink. Upon this he said: The server of the people Is the last among them to drink. So I drank and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) also drank and the people came to the place of water quite happy and satiated. &#8216;Abdullah b. Rabah said: I am going to narrate this hadith in the great mosque, when &#8216;Imran b. Husain said: See, O young man, how will you narrate for I was also one of the riders on that night? I said: So you must be knowing this hadith well. He said: Who are you? I said: I am one of the Ansar. Upon this he said: You narrate, for you know your hadith better. I, therefore, narrated it to the people. &#8216;Imran said: I was also present that night, but I know not anyone else who learnt it so well as you have learnt.</p>

Abu Bakr was the first to awake amongst us. and we did not awake the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) from his sleep allowing him to wake up (of his own accord). It was &#8216;Umar who then woke up. He stood by the side of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and recited takbir in a loud voice till the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) woke up. When he lifted his head, he saw that the sun had arisen; he then said: Proceed on. He travelled along with us till the sun shone brightly. He came down (from his camel) and led us in the morning prayer. A person, however, remained away from the people and did not say, prayer along with us. After having completed the prayer, the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to him: O, so and so, what prevented you from observing prayer with us? He said: Apostle of Allah! I was not in a state of purity. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) ordered him arid lie performed Tayammum with dust and said prayer. He then urged me to go ahead immediately along with other riders to find out water, for we felt very thirsty. We were traveling when we came across a woman who was sitting (on a camel) with her feet hanging over two leathern water bags. We said to her: How far is water available? She, said: Far, very far, very far. You cannot get water. We (again) said: How much distance is there between (the residence of) your family and water? She said: It is a day and night journey. We said to her: You go to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). She said: Who is the Messenger of Allah? We somehow or the other managed to bring her to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he asked about her, and she informed him as she had informed us that she was a widow having orphan children. He ordered that her camel should be made to kneal down and he gargled in the opening (of her leathern water-bag). The camel was then raised up and we forty thirsty men drank water till we were completely satiated, and we filled up all leathern water-bags and water-skins that we had with us and we washed our companions, but we did not make any camel drink, and (the leathern water-bags) were about to burst (on account of excess of water). He then said: Bring whatever you have with you. So we collected the bits (of estable things) and dates and packed them up in a bundle, and said to her: Take it away. This is meant for your children, and know that we have not its any way done any loss to your water. W hen she came to her family she said: I have met the greatest magician amongst human beings, or he is an apostle, as he claims to be, and she then narrated what had happened and Allah guided aright those people through that woman. She affirmed her faith in Islam and so did the people embrace Islam.</p>

Naufal reported: I had been asking about, as I was desirous to find one among people who should inform me, whether the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed the forenoon prayer, but I found none to narrate that to me except Umm Hani, daughter of Abu Talib (the real sister of Hadrat &#8216;Ali), who told me that on the day of the Conquest the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came (to our house) after the dawn had (sufficiently) arisen. A cloth was brought and privacy was provided for him (the Holy Prophet). He took a bath and then stood up and observed eight rak&#8217;ahs. I do not know whether his Qiyam (standing posture) was longer, or bending or prostration or all of them were of equal duration. She (Umm Hani) further said: I never saw him saying this Nafl prayer prior to it or subsequently. (Al-Muradi narrated on the authority of Yunus that he made no mention of the words:&#8221; He informed me.&#8221; )</p>

I gave him salutation and he said: Who is she? I said: It is Umm Hani, daughter of Abu Talib. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Greeting for Umm Hani. When he had completed the bath, he stood up and observed eight rak&#8217;ahs wrapped up in one cloth. When he turned back (after the prayer), I said to him: Messenger of Allah, the son of my mother &#8216;Ali b. Abu Talib is going to kill a person, Fulan b. Hubaira whom I have given protection. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) said: We too have given protection whom you have given protection, O Umm Hani. Umm Hani said: It was the forenoon (prayer).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;d b. Hisham b. &#8216;Amir decided to participate in the expedition for the sake of Allah, so he came to Medina and he decided to dispose of his property there and buy arms and horses instead and fight against the Romans to the end of his life. When he came to Medina, he met the people of Medina. They dissuaded him to do such a thing, and informed him that a group of six men had decided to do so during the lifetime of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) forbade them to do it, and said: Is there not for you a model pattern in me? And when they narrated this to him (Sa&#8217;d b. Hisham), he returned to his wife, though he had divorced her and made (people) witness to his reconciliation. He then came to Ibn &#8216;Abbas and asked him about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: Should I not lead you to one who knows best amongst the people of the world about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? He said: Who is it? He (Ibn &#8216;Abbas) said: It is &#8216;A&#8217;isha. So go to her and ask her (about Witr) and then come to me and inform me about her answer that she would give you. So I came to Hakim b. Aflah and requested him to take me to her. He said: I would not go to her, for I forbade her to speak anything (about the conflict) between the two groupS, but she refused (to accept my advice) and went (to participate in that corflict). I (requested) him (Hakim) with an oath to lead me to her. So we went to &#8216;A&#8217;isha and we begged permission to meet her. She granted us permission and we went in. She said: Are you Hakim? (She recognised him.) He replied: Yes. She said: Who is there with you? He said: He is Sa&#8217;d b. Hisham. She said: Which Hisham? He said: He is Hisham b. &#8216;Amir. She blessed him (&#8216;Amir) with mercy from Allah and spoke good of him (Qatada said that he died as a martyr in Uhud). I said: Mother of the Faithful, tell me about the character of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). She said: Don&#8217;t you read the Qur&#8217;an? I said: Yes. Upon this she said: The character of the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) was the Qur&#8217;an. He said: I felt inclined to get up and not ask anything (further) till death. But then I changed my mind and said: Inform me about the observance (of the night prayer) of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). She said: Did you not recite:&#8221; O thou wrapped up&#8221;? He said: Yes. She said: Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious, made the observance of the night prayer at the beginning of this Surah obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him and his Companions around him observed this (night prayer) for one year. Allah held back the concluding portion of this Surah for twelve months in the Heaven till (at the end of this period) Allah revealed the concluding verses of this Surah which lightened (the burden of this prayer), and the night prayer became a supererogatory prayer after being an obligatory one. I said: Mother of the Faithful, inform me about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). She said: I used to prepare tooth stick for him and water for his ablution, and Allah would rouse him to the extent He wished during the night. He would use the tooth stick, and perform ablution, and would offer nine rak&#8217;ahs, and would not sit but in the eighth one and would remember Allah, and praise Him and supplicate Him, then he would get up without uttering the salutation and pray the ninth rak&#8217;ah. He would then sit, remember, praise Him and supplicate Him and then utter a salutation loud enough for us to hear. He would then pray two rak&#8217;ahs sitting after uttering the salutation, and that made eleven rak&#8217;ahs. O my son, but when the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) grew old and put on flesh, he observed Witr of seven, doing in the two rak&#8217;ahs as he had done formerly, and that made nine. O my son, and when the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) observed prayer, he liked to keep on observing it, and when sleep or pain overpowered him and made it impossible (for him) to observe prayer in the night, he prayed twelve rak&#8217;ahs daring the day. I am not aware of Allah&#8217;s Prophet (may peace be upon him) having recited the whole Qur&#8217;an during one single night, or praying through the night till morning, or fasting a complete month, except Ramadan. He (the narrator) said: I then went to Ibn &#8216;Abbas and narrated to him the hadith (transmitted from her), and he said: She says the truth If I went to her and got into her presence, I would have listened to it orally from her. He said: If I were to know that you do not go to her. I would not have transmitted this hadith to you narrated by her.</p>

And when he recited the verses which referred to the Glory of Allah, he glorified (by saying Subhan Allah-Glory to my Lord the Great), and when he recited the verses which tell (how the Lord) is to be begged, he (the Holy Prophet) would then beg (from Him), and when he recited the verses dealing with protection from the Lord, he sought (His) protection and would then bow and say: Glory be to my Mighty Lord; his bowing lasted about the same length of time as his standing (and then on returning to the standing posture after ruku&#8217;) he would say: Allah listened to him who praised Him, and he would then stand about the same length of time as he had spent in bowing. He would then prostrate himself and say: Glory be to my Lord most High, and his prostration lasted nearly the same length of time as his standing. In the hadith transmitted by Jarir the words are:&#8221; He (the Holy Prophet) would say:&#8221; Allah listened to him who praised Him, our Lord, to Thee i the praise.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas reported Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Gabriel taught me to recite in one style. I replied to him and kept asking him to give more (styles), till he reached seven modes (of recitation). Ibn Shibab said: It has reached me that these seven styles are essentially one, not differing about what is permitted and what is forbidden.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b reported: I was in the mosque when a man entered and prayed and recited (the Qur&#8217;in) in a style to which I objected. Then another man entered (the mosque) and recited in a style different from that of his companion. When we had finished the prayer, we all went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and said to him: This man recited in a style to which I objected, and the other entered and recited in a style different from that of his companion. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) asked them to recite and so they recited, and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) expressed approval of their affairs (their modes of recitation). and there occurred In my mind a sort of denial which did not occur even during the Days of Ignorance. When the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) saw how I was affected (by a wrong idea), he struck my chest, whereupon I broke into sweating and felt as though I were looking at Allah with fear. He (the Holy Prophet) said to me: Ubayy. a message was sent to me to recite the Qur&#8217;an in one dialect, and I replied: Make (things) easy for my people. It was conveyed to me for the second time that it should be recited in two dialects. I again replied to him: Make affairs easy for my people. It was again conveyed to me for the third time to recite in seven dialects And (I was further told): You have got a seeking for every reply that I sent you, which you should seek from Me. I said: O Allah! forgive my people, forgive my people, and I have deferred the third one for the day on which the entire creation will turn to me, including even Ibrahim (peace be upon him) (for intercession).</p>

Upon this &#8216;Abdullah said: (You must have been reciting It) hastily like the recitation of poetry. Verily. there are people who recite the Qur&#8217;an, but it does not go down beyond their collar bones. It is (a fact with the Qur&#8217;an) that it is beneficial only when it settles in the heart and is rooted deeply in it. The best of (the acts) in prayer are bowing and prostration. I am quite aware of the occasions when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) combined together two surahs in every rak&#8217;ah. &#8216;Abdullah then stood up and went out with &#8216;Alqama following in his footstep.

We said: There was nothing (behind it) but we entertained the idea that some inmate of the house might be sleeping. He said: Do you presume any idleness on the part of the family of Ibn Umm &#8216;Abd (the mother of Abdullah b. Mas&#8217;ud)?

One among the people said: I recited all the mufassal surahs during the night. &#8216;Abdullah said: (You must have recited them) like the (recitation) of poetry. I heard (the Holy Prophet) combining (the sarahs) and I remember the combinations which the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) made In the recitation (of surahs). These were constituted of eighteen mufassal surahs and two surahs (commencing with) Ha-Mim.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Amr b. &#8216;Abasa Sulami reported: I in the state of the Ignorance (before embracing Islam) used to think that the people were in error and they were not on anything (which may be called the right path) and worshipped the idols. In the meanwhile I heard of a man in Mecca who was giving news (on the basis of his prophetic knowledge) ; so I sat on my ride and went to him. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was at that time hiding as his people had made life hard for him. I adopted a friendly attitude (towards the Meccans and thus managed) to enter Mecca and go to him (the Holy Prophet) and I said to him: Who are you? He said: I am a Prophet (of Allah). I again said: Who is a Prophet? He said: (I am a Prophet in the sense that) I have been sent by Allah. I said: What is that which you have been sent with? He said: I have been sent to join ties of relationship (with kindness and affection), to break the Idols, and to proclaim the oneness of Allah (in a manner that) nothing is to be associated with Him. I said: Who is with you in this (in these beliefs and practices)? He said: A free man and a slave. He (the narrator) said: Abu Bakr and Bilal were there with him among those who had embraced Islam by that time. I said: I intend to follow you. He said: During these days you would not be able to do so. Don&#8217;t you see the (hard) condition under which I and (my) people are living? You better go back to your people and when you hear that I have been granted victory, you come to me. So I went to my family. I was in my home when the Messengerof Allah (may peace be upon him) came to Medina. I was among my people and used to seek news and ask people when he arrived in Medina. Then a group of people belonging to Yathrib (Medina) came. I said (to them): How is that person getting on who has come to Medina? They said: The people are hastening to him, while his people (the polytheists of Mecca) planned to kill him, but they could not do so. I (on hearing It) came to Medina and went to him and said: Messenger of Allah, do you recognise me? He said: Yes, you are the same man who met me at Mecca. I said: It is so. I again said: Prophet of Allah, tell me that which Allah has taught you and which I do not know, tell me about the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Observe the dawn prayer, then stop praying when the sun is rising till it Is fully up, for when it rises it comes up between the horns of Satan, and the unbelievers prostrate themselves to it at that time. Then pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended (by angels) till the shadow becomes about the length of a lance; then cease prayer, for at that time Hell is heated up. Then when the shadow moves forward, pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended by angels, till you pray the afternoon prayer, then cease prayer till the sun sets, for it sets between the horns of devil, and at that time the unbelievers prostrate themselves before it. I said: Apostle of Allah, tell me about ablution also. He said: None of you who uses water for ablution and rinses his mouth, snuffs up water and blows it, but the sins of his face, and his mouth and his nostrils fall out. When he washes his face, as Allah has commanded him, the sins of his face fall out from the end of his beard with water. Then (when) he washes his forearms up to the elbows, the sins of his arms fall out along with water from his finger-tips. And when he wipes his head, the sins of his head fall out from the points of his hair along with water. And (when) he washes his feet up to the ankles, the sins of his feet fall out from his toes along with water. And if he stands to pray and praises Allah, lauds Him and glorifies Him with what becomes Him and shows wholehearted devotion to Allah, his sins would depart leaving him (as innocent) as he was on the day his mother bore him. &#8216;Amr b. &#8216;Abasa narrated this hadith to Abu Umama, a Companion of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), and Abu Umama said to him: &#8216;Amr b. &#8216;Abasa, think what you are saying that such (a great reward) is given to a man at one place (only in the act of ablution and prayer). Upon this &#8216;Amr said: Abu Umama, I have grown old and my bones have become weak and I am at the door of death; what impetus is there for me to attribute a lie to Allah and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him)? Had I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) once, twice, or three times (even seven times), I would have never narrated it, but I have heard it from him on occasions more than these.</p>

Umm Salama said: I beard the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) prohibiting them, and then afterwards I saw him observing them. And when he observed them (two rak&#8217;ahs) he had already observed the &#8216;Asr prayer. Then he (the Holy Prophet) came, while there were with me ladies of Banu Haram, a tribe of the Ansar and he (the Holy Prophet) observed them (the two rak&#8217;ahs). I sent a slave-girl to him asking her to stand by his side and say to him that Umm Salama says: Messenger of Allah, I heard you prohibiting these two rak&#8217;ahs, whereas I saw you observing them; and if he (the Holy Prophet) points with his hand (to wait), then do wait. The slave-girl did like that. He (the Holy Prophet) pointed out with his hand and she got aside and waited, and when he had finished (the prayer) he said: Daughter of Abu Umayya. you have asked about the two rak&#8217;ahs after the &#8216;Asr prayer. Some people of &#8216;Abu al-Qais came to me for embracing Islam and hindered me from observing the two rak&#8217;ahs which come after the noon prayer. So those are the two I have been praying.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We have already explained that Islam exhorts its followers to make their social life a visible expression of God-consciousness. Prayer is the most effective means of fostering this virtue in man That is the reason why it has been made essential for the Muslims to observe obligatory prayers in congregation. Jumu&#8217;a is a step forward in this respect. The purpose behind it is to provide opportunities to the greater number of Muslims to attend larger congregations in the mosques in an atmosphere of religions piety. Apart from prayer, sermon has also been made an integral part of the Jumu&#8217;a prayer. The Imam delivers the sermon and instructs people in religion. He explains to them the day-to-day problems in the light of Islam.</p>

He then walked on till he came to the women and preached to them and admonished them, and asked them to give alms, for most of them are the fuel for Hell. A woman having a dark spot on the cheek stood up and said: Why is it so, Messenger of Allah? He said: For you grumble often and show ingratitude to your spouse. And then they began to give alms out of their ornaments such as their earrings and rings which they threw on to the cloth of Bilal.</p>

And if he intended to send out an army he made mention of it to the people, and if he intended any other thing besides it, he commanded them (to do that). He used to say (to the people): Give alms, give alms, give alms, and the majority that gave alms was of women. He then returned and this (practice) remained (in vogue) till Marwan b. al- Hakam (came into power). I went out hand in hand with Marwan till we came to the place of worship and there Kathir b.

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) raised his hands and then said: (O Allah, send down rain upon us; O Allah, send dowp rain upon us; O Allah, send down rain upon us. Anas said: By Allah, we did not see any cloud or any patch of it, and there was neither any house or building standing between us and the (hillock) Sal&#8217;a. There appeared a cloud in the shape of a shield from behind it, and as it (came high) in the sky it spread and then there was a downpour of rain. By Allah, we did not see the sun throughout the week. Then (that very man) came on the coming Friday through the same door when the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was standing and delivering the sermon. He stood in front of him and said: Messenger of Allah, our animals died and the passages blocked. Supplicate Allah to stop the rain for us. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) again raised his hands and said: O Allah, let it (rain) fall in our suburbs and not on us, O Allah (send it down) on the hillocks and small mountains and the river-beds and at places where trees grow. The rain stopped, and as we stepped out we were walking in sun- shine. He (the narrator) said to Sharik: I asked Anas b. Malik if he was the same man. He said: I do not know.</p>

He then stood up and did like this and thus he observed four ruku&#8217;s and four prostrations (in two rak&#8217;ahs) and then said: All these things were brought to me in which you will be made to enter. Paradise was brought to me till (I was so close to it) that if I (had intended) to pluck a bunch (of grapes) out of it. I would have got it, or he (the Holy Prophet) said: I intended to get a bunch (out of that) but my hand could not reach it. Hell was also brought to me and I saw in it a woman belonging to the tribe of Israel who was tormented for a cat whom she had tied, but did not give it food nor set it free to eat the creatures of the earth; and I saw Abu Thumama &#8216;Amr b. Malik who was dragging his intestines in Hell. They (the Arabs) used to say that the sun and the moon do not eclipse but on the death of some great person; but (in reality) both these (the sun and the moon) are among the signs of Allah which are shown to you; so when there is an eclipse, observe prayer till it (the sun or the moon) brightens. This hadith has been narrated by Hisham with the same chain of transmitters except this&#8221; I saw a dark woman with a tail stature and loud voice,&#8221; but he made no mention of&#8221; from among Bani Israel&#8221;.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir reported that the sun eclipsed during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) on that very day when Ibrahim (the Prophet&#8217;s son) died. The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood up and led people in (two rak&#8217;ahs of) prayer with six ruku&#8217;s and four prostrations. He commenced (the prayer) with takbir (Allah-o-Akbar) and then recited and prolonged his recital. He then bowed nearly the (length of time) that he stood up. He then raised his head from the ruku&#8217; and recited but less than the first recital. He then bowed (to the length of time) that he stood up. He then raised his head from the ruku&#8217; and again recited but less than the second recital. He then bowed (to the length of time) that he stood up. He then lifted his head from the ruku&#8217;. He then fell in prostration and observed two prostrations. He stood up and then bowed, observing six ruku&#8217;s like it, without (completing) the rak&#8217;ah in them, except (this difference) that the first (qiyam of ruku&#8217;) was longer than the later one, and the ruku&#8217; was nearly (of the same length) as prostration. He then moved backward and the rows behind him also moved backward till we reached the extreme (Abu Bakr said: till he reached near the women) He then moved forward and the people also moved forward along with him till he stood at his (original) place (of worship). He then completed the prayer as it was required to complete and the sun brightened and he said: O people! verily the sun and the moon are among the signs of Allah and they do not eclipse at the death of anyone among people (Abu Bakr said: On the death of any human being). So when you see anything like it (of the nature of eclipse), pray till it is bright. There is nothing which you have been promised (in the next world) but I have seen it in this prayer of mine. Hell was brought to me as you saw me moving back on account of fear lest its heat might affect me; and I saw the owner of the curved staff who dragged his intestines in the fire, and he used to steal (the belongings) of the pilgrims with his curved staff. If he (the owner of the staff) became aware, he would say: It got (accidentally) entangled in my curved staff, but if he was unaware of that, he would take that away. I also saw in it (in Hell) the owner of a cat whom she had tied and did not feed her nor set her free so that she could eat the creatures of the earth, till the cat died of starvation. Paradise was brought to me, and it was on that occasion that you saw me moving forward till I stood at my place (of worship). I stretched my hand as I wanted to catch hold of its fruits so that you may see them. Then I thought of not doing it. Nothing which you have been promised was there that I did not see in this prayer of mine.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas reported: There was an eclipse of the sun during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him). The Messenger of Allah, (may peace be upon him) prayed accompanied by the people. He stood for a long time, about as long as it would take to recite Surah al-Baqara; then he bowed for a long time; then he raised his head and stood for a long time, but it was less than the first qiyam. He then bowed for a long time but for a shorter while than the first. He then prostrated and then stood for a long time, but it was less than the first qiyam.

He (the Holy Prophet) then said: The sun and moon are two signs from the signs of Allah. These two do not eclipse on account of the death of anyone or on account of the birth of anyone. So when you see that, remember Allah. They (his Companions) said: Messenger of Allah, we saw you reach out to something, while you were standing here, then we saw you restrain yourself. He said: I saw Paradise and reached out to a bunch of its grapes; and had I taken it you would have eaten of it as long as the world endured. I saw Hell also. No such (abominable) sight have I ever seen as that which I saw today; and I observed that most of its inhabitants were women. They said: Messenger of Allah, on what account is it so? He said: For their ingratitude or disbelief (bi-kufraihinna). It was said: Do they disbelieve in Allah? He said: (Not for their disbelief in God) but for their ingratitude to their husbands and ingratitude to kindness. If you were to treat one of them kindly for ever, but if she later saw anything (displeasing) in you, she would say: i have never seen any good in you.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">KITAB-UL-JANA&#8217;IZ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">BOOK RELATING TO THE DEAD</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Divine Service is held over the dead body of every Muslim, young or old, even of infants who have lived only for a few minutes. A Muslim opens his eyes in the world with the words of Adhan in his ears in which he is told that he is a moral being having moral and spiritual responsibilities far more important than the physical needs. He should live in the world with a firm belief in the Creator of the Universe as his only Deity. Then he should spend his life as a sincere and devoted follower of Muhammad (may peace be upon him), for it is through him that he has received full information about the Will of God and the Divine Code of life. It Is also imprinted upon his fresh and clear mind that prayer elevates the soul of man and herein lies his success in this world and the world to come. With this sacred message he is made to start his life. Both the paths are shown to him, the path of righteousness and religious piety and the path of evil and irreligiousness, and then it is left to his discretion to choose the path he likes. After spending the allotted length of time he is called back to his Master.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the soul leaves the body, preparations are made for bidding him the last farewell. He is washed and perfumed and is wrapped in white sheets. Then the funeral prayer is observed keeping his dead body in front of the Imam in which God to requested in congregation to grant him pardon for his minor and major sins, for all his failings and to wrap him in His Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Muslim is received in this world with Adhan and lqama and he is given a send- off with prayer and supplication to Allah for treating him kindly in his heavenly home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is neither Adhan nor Iqama in the funeral prayer which has very deep significance. It implies that the Adhan and lqama for the funeral prayer had been pronounced at the time of his birth. He is thus awakened to the realisation of the fact that he should spend the whole span of his life with such single-minded devotion as is found in a worshipper waiting for the commencement of prayer after the Adhan and Iqama are pronounced.</p>

Then &#8216;Abdullah made it general and &#8216;Umar told it of certain occasions. So I (&#8216;Abdullah b. Abu Mulaika) stood up and went to &#8216;A&#8217;isha and told her what Ibn &#8216;Umar had said. Upon this she said: I swear by Allah that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) never said that dead would be punished because of his family&#8217;s lamenting (for him). What he said was that Allah would increase the punishment of the unbeliever because of his family&#8217;s lamenting for him. Verily it is Allah Who has caused laughter and weeping. No bearer of a burden will bear another&#8217;s burden. Ibn Abu Mulaika said that al-Qasim b. Muhammad said that when the words of &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Umar were conveyed to &#8216;A&#8217;Isha, she said: You have narrated it to me from those who are neither liar nor those suspected of lying but (sometimes) hearing misleads.</p>

Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbas were also present there, and I was sitting between them.

Ibn &#8216;Abbas then said that Umar used to say someting of that nature, and then narrated saying: I proceeded from Mecca along with &#8216;Umar till we reached al-Baida&#8217; and there was a party of riders under the shade of a tree. He said (to me): Go and find out who this party is. I cast a glance and there was Suhaib (in that party). So I informed him (&#8216;Umar) about it. He said: Call him to me. So I went back to Suhaib and said: Go and meet the Commander of the believers. When &#8216;Umar was wounded, Suhaib came walling: Alas, for the brother! alas for the companion! &#8216;Umar said: O Suhaib, do you wail for me, whereas the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said:&#8221; The dead would be punished on account of the lamentation of the (members of his family)&#8221;? Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: When &#8216;Umar died I made a mention of it to &#8216;A&#8217;isha. She said: May Allah have mercy upon &#8216;Umar! I swear by Allah that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) never said that Allah would punish the believer because of the weeping (of any one of the members of his family), but he said that Allah would increase the punishment of the unbeliever because of the weeping of his family over him. &#8216;A&#8217;isha said: The Qur&#8217;an is enough for you (when it states):&#8221; No bearer of burden will bear another&#8217;s burden&#8221; (vi. 164).

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had (in fact) said: He (the dead) is punished for his faults or for his sins, and the members of his family are wailing for him now. (This misunderstanding of Ibn &#8216;Umar is similar to his saying: ) The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stood by the well in which were lying the dead bodies of those polytheists who had been killed on the Day of Badr, and he said to them what he had to say, i. e.: They hear what I say. But he (Ibn &#8216;Umar) misunderstood. The Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) had only said: They (the dead) understand that what I used to say to them was truth. She then recited:&#8221; Certainly, thou canst not make the dead hear the call&#8221; (xxvii. 80), nor can you make those hear who are in the graves, nor can you inform them when they have taken their seats in Hell.</p>

Thus our reward was assured with Allah. And amongst us were those who spent life (in such a state of piety and austerity) that nothing consumed their reward. Mus&#8217;ab b. &#8216;Umair was one of them. He was killed on the Day of Uhud, and nothing but a woollen cloak was found to shroud him. When we covered his head with it, his feet became uncovered, and when we covered his feet, his head was uncovered. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Place it (this cloak) on the side of his head and cover his feet with grass. And there is one amongst us for whom the fruit is ripened and he enjoys it.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Muslim, Book 7:</p>
<h3 align="center"><em>The Book of Pilgrimage (Kitab Al-Hajj) </em></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Hajj means, literally, repairing to a place for the sake of visit (al-qasd li-ziyarah), and in the terminology of the Islamic Shari&#8217;ah, it implies the repairing to Bait-Allah (the house of Allah) to observe the necessary devotion (iqamat-an-li-nusuk) Bait-Allah is one of the names by which the Ka&#8217;ba is called.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajj is not a new institution which Islam has introduced in its Shari&#8217;ah. This institution is as old as the Ka&#8217;ba itself which is called in the Holy Qur&#8217;an to be&#8221; the first House of Divine Worship appointed for men&#8221; (iii. 95). This verse of the Holy Qur&#8217;an corroborates the hadith which tells us that the Ka&#8217;ba was first built by Adam, the first man upon the earth. It was later on rebuilt by Hadrat Ibrahim and his illustrious son Hadrat Isma&#8217;il (peace be upon both of them). And when Ibrahim and Isma&#8217;al raised the foundations of the house, they said:&#8221; Our Lord! accept from us&#8221; (ii. 127). An earlier revelation makes it clear that the Ka&#8217;ba was already there when Hadrat Ibrahim left Hadrat Isma&#8217;il in the wilderness of Arabia:&#8221; Our Lord! I have settled a part of my offspring in a valley unproductive of fruit near Thy sacred House&#8221; (xiv. 37).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The whole ceremony of Hajj is commemorative of Hadrat Ibrahim and his family&#8217;s acts of devotion to God Almighty. This shows that the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) did not innovate this institution but purged it of all evil practices and made it an obligatory act of piety by which one can develop God-consciousness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is rightly said that it is the perfection of faith since it combines in itself all the distinctive qualities of other obligatory acts. It represents the quality of salat since a pilgrim offers prayers in the Ka&#8217;ba, the House of the Lord. It encourages the spending of material wealth for the sake of the Lord, the chief characteristic of Zakat. When a pilgrim sets out for Hajj, he dissociates himself from his hearth and home, from his dear and near ones to please the Lord. He suffers privation and undertakes the hardship of journey-the lessons we learn from fasting and i&#8217;tikaf. In Hajj one is trained to be completely forgetful of the material comforts and show of worldly thing. One has to sleep on stony ground, circumambulate the Ka&#8217;ba, run between Safa and Marwa and spend his night and day wearing, only two pieces of unsewn cloth. He is required to avoid the use of oil or scent or any other perfume. He is not even allowed to get his hair cut or trim his beard. In short, he is commanded to abandon everything for the sake of Allah and submit himself before his Lord, the ultimate aim of the life of a Muslim. In fact, physical pilgrimage is a prelude to spiritual pilgrimage to God, when man would bid goodbye to everything of the world and present himself before Him as His humble servant saying:&#8221; Here I am before Thee, my Lord, as a slave of Thine.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Down through the ages.&#8221; says Professor Hitti, &#8220;this institution has continued to serve as the major unifying influence in Islam and the most effective common bond among the diverse believers. It rendered almost every capable Moslem perforce a traveller for once in his lifetime. The socializing influence of such a gathering of the brotherhood of believers from the far quarters of the earth is hard to overestimate. It afforded opportunity for negroes, Berbers, Chinese, Persians, Syrians, Turks-rich and poor, high and low-to fraternize and meet together on the common ground of faith&#8221; (History of the Arabs, p. 136).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar (Allah be pleased with them) reported that a person asked the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) what a Muhrim should put on as dress. Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: Do not put on a shirt or a turban, or trousers or a cap, or leather stockings except one who does not find shoes; he may put on stockings but he should trim them below the ankles. And do not wear clothes to which saffron or wars is applied.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Salim reported on the authority of his father (&#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Umar) that the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) was asked what a Muhrim should wear, whereupon he said: A Muhrim should not wear a shirt, or a turban, or a cap, or trousers, or a cloth touched with wars or with saffron, nor (should he wear) stock- ings, but in case he does not find shoes, but (before wearing stockings) be should trim them (in such a way) that these should become lower than the ankles.</p>

(It was at this juncture) that the revelation came to the Apostle of Allah (way peace be upon him) and he was covered with a cloth, and Ya&#8217;la said: Would that I see revelation coming to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him). He (Hadrat &#8216;Umar) said: Would it please you to see the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) receiving the revelations &#8216;Umar lifted a corner of the cloth and I looked at him and he was emitting a sound of snorting. He (the narrator) said: I thought it was the sound of a camel. When he was relieved of this he said: Where is he who asked about Umra? When the person came, the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: Wash out the trace of yellowness, or he said: the trace of perfume and put off the cloak and do in your &#8216;Umra what you do in your Hajj.</p>

The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said to him: What would you do in your Hajj? He said: I would take off the clothes and would wash from me this perfume.

(Once) when the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) was in Ji&#8217;rana and there was a cloth which provided shade over him, and there were his Companions with him. &#8216;Umar being one of them, there came a person with a cloak of wool on him daubed with perfume and he said: Messenger of Allah, what about the person who, entered upon the state of Ihram with a cloak after daub- ing it with perfume? The Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) looked at him for a short while, and then became quiet, and revelation began descending upon him, and &#8216;Umar gestured (with his hand) to Ya&#8217;la b Umayya to come. Ya&#8217;la came and he enter- ed his head (beneath the cloth and saw) the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) with his face red, and breathing with a snore. Then he felt relieved (of that burden) and he said: Where is the man who was just asking me about Umra? The man was searched for and he was brought, and the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: So far as the perfume is concerned, wash it three times, and remove the cloak too (as it was sewn) and do in &#8216;Umra as you do in Hajj.</p>

Makhrama at a place (called) Abwa&#8217;. Abdullah b. &#8216;Abbas contended that a Muhrim (is permitted) to wash his head, whereas Miswar contended that a Muhrim is not (permit- fed) to wash his head. So Ibn Abbas sent me (the father of Ibrabim) to Abu Ayyub al- Ansirl to ask him about it. (So I went to him) and found him taking bath behind two poles covered by a cloth. I gave him salutation, whereupon be asked: Who is this? I said: I am &#8216;Abdullah b. Hunain. &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Abbas has sent me to you to find out how the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) washed his head in the state of Ihram. Abu Ayyub (Allah be pleased with him) placed his hand on the cloth and lowered it (a little) till his head became visible to me; and he said to the man who was pouring water upon him to pour water. He poured water on his head. He then moved his head with the help of his hands and moved them (the hands) forward and backward and then said: This is how I saw him (the Messenger of Allah) doing.</p>

He said: He who intended among you to put on Ihram for Hajj and Umra should do so. And he who intended to put on Ihram for Hajj may do so. and he who intended to put on Ihram for &#8216;Umra only may do so. A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her) said: The Messenger of Allah (way peace be upon him) put on Ihram for Hajj and some people did that along with him.

The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) said: He who amongst you intends to put on Ihram for Umra may do so; bad I not brought sacrificial animal along with me, I would have put on Ihram for Umra. She (further said). There were some persons who put on Ihram for Umrs, and some persons who put on Ibrim for gajj, and 1 was one of those who put on Ihram for Umra. We went on till we reached Mecca, and on the day of &#8216;Arafa I found myself In a state of menses, but I did not put off the Ihram for Umra. I told about (this state of mine) to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him). whereupon he said: Abandon your &#8216;Umra, and undo the hair of your head and comb (them), and put on Ihram for Hajj &#8216;she (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) said: I did accordingly. When it was the night at Hasba and Allah enabled us to complete our Hajj, he (the Holy Prophet) sent with me Abd al-Rahman b. Abu Bakr, and he mounted me behind him on his camel and took me to Tan&#8217;im and I put on Ihram for &#8216;Umra, and thus Allah enabled us to complete our Hajj and Umra and (we wore required to observe) neither sacrifice nor alms nor fasting.</p>

He (the Holy Prophet) went to his Companiens and said: He who has no sacrificial animal with him, in his case I wish that he should perform Umra (with this Ihram), and he who has the sacrificial animal with him should not do it. So some of thtm performed Hajj whereas others who had no sacrificial animals with them did not do (Hajj, but per- formed only &#8216;Umra). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) had the sacrificial animal with him and those too who could afford it (performed) Hajj). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came to me (i. e. A&#8217;isha) while I was weeping, and he said: What makes thee weep? I said: I heard your talk with Companions about Umra. He said: What has happened to you? I said: I do not observe prayer (due to the monthly period), whereupon besaid: It would not harm you; you should perform (during this time) the rituals of Hajj (which you can do outside the House). Maybe Allah will compensate you for this. You are one among the daughters of Adam and Allah has ordained for you as He has ordained for them. So I proceeded on (with the rituals of Hajj) till we came to Mina. I washed myself and then circumambuleted the House, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) encamped at Muhassab and called, Abd al-Rahman b. Abua Bakr. and said: Take out your sister from the precincts of the Ka&#8217;ba in order to put on Ihram for Umra and circumambulate the House. and I shall wait for you here. She said: So I went out and put on Ihram and then circu- mambulated the House. and (ran) between al-Safa and al-Marwa, and then we came to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) and he was in his bouse in the middle of the night. He said: Have you completed your (rituals)? I said: Yes. He then announced to his Companions to march on. He came out, and went to the House and circumambulated it before the dawn prayer and then proceeded to Medina.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) said: We, in the state of lhram, came with the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) for Hajj Mufrad (with the aim of Hajj only), and &#8216;A&#8217;isha set out for Umra, and when we reached Sarif, she (Hadrat A&#8217;isha) entered in the state of monthly period; we proceeded on till we reached (Mecca) and circumambulated the Ka&#8217;ba and ran between (al-Safa) and al-Marwa; and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) commanded that one who amongst us had no sacrificial animal with him should put off Ihram. We said: What does this&#8221; Putting off&#8221; imply? He said: Getting out completely from the state of lhram, (so we put off Ihram), and we turned to our wives and applied perfume and put on our clothes. and we were at a four night&#8217;s distance from &#8216;Arafa. And we again put on Ihram on the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu&#8217;l-Hijja). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) came to &#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her) and found her weeping, and said: What is the matter with you? She said: The matter is that I have entered in the monthly period, and the people had put off lhram, but I did not and I did not circumambulate the House, and the people are going for Hajj now (but I can&#8217;t go), whereupon he said: It is the matter which Allah has ordaiucd for the daughters of Adam, so now take a bath and put on Ihram for Hajj. She (&#8216;A&#8217;isha) did accordingly, and stayed at the places of staying till the monthly period was over. She then circu- mambulated the House, and (ran between) al-Safa and al-Marwa. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: Now both your Hajj and &#8216;Umra are complete, whereupon she said: I feel in my mind that I did not circumambulate the House till I performed Hajj (I missed the circumambulation of &#8216;Umra). Thereupon he (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) said: &#8216;Abd al- Rahman, take her to Tan&#8217;im (so as to enable her) to perform Umra (separately), and it was the night at Hasba.</p>

We said: When only five days had been left to reach &#8216;Arafa, he (the Holy Prophet) commanded us to have intercourse with our wives. And we reached &#8216;Arafa in a state as if we had just intercoursed (with tbem). He (&#8216;Ata&#8217;) said: Jabir pointed with his hand and I (perceive) as if I am seeing his hand as it moved.

And if there were not sacrificial animals with me, I would also have put off Ihram as you have put off. And if I were to know this matter of mine what I have come to know later on. I would not have brought sacrificial animals with me. SO they (the Companions) put. olf Ihrim and we also put off and listened to (the Holy Prophet) and obeyed (his command). Jabir said: &#8216;All came with the revenue of the taxes (from Yemen). He (the Holy Prophet) said: For what (purpose) have you entered into the state of Ihram (whether you entered into the state purely for Hajj and, Umra jointly or Hajj and Umra separately)? He said: For the purpose for which the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) had entered. (The Holy Prophet had entered as a Qiran, i. e. Ihram covering both Umra and Hajj simultaneously.) Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Offer a sacrifice of animal, and retain Ihram. And &#8216;All brought a sacrificial animal for him (for the Holy Prophet). Suraqa b.

When it was the day of Tarwiya, then put on Ihram for Hajj and make lhram for Mut&#8217;a (you had put on Ihram i f or Hajj, but take it off af ter perf orming Umra and then again put on Ihram for Hajj). They said: How should we make it Mut&#8217;a although we entered upon lhram in the name of Hajj? He said: Do whatever I command you to do. Had I not brought sacrificial animals with me, I would have done as I have commanded you to do. But it is not permissible for me to put off Ihram till tLe sacrifice is offered.

<p style="text-align:justify;">FAREWELL PILGRIMAGE OF THE APOSTLE OF ALLAH (MAY PEACE BE UPON HIM)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the first revelation in the cave of Hira&#8217; marks the advent of the apostolic mission of Muhammad (May peace be upon him), similarly his Farewell Pilgrimage marks its crowning glory. Opinions differ as to when Hajj became obligatory but the commonly accepted opinion is that it was in the eighth year of Hijra that Allah declared it as one of the five fundamentals of Islam. In the ninth year of Hijra the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) sent Abu Bakr as the leader of the Hajj delegation but he himself did not go. Hadrat Abu Bakr was later on joined by Hadrat Ali in order to make a sure declaration on behalf of the Holy Prophet (may peace be upon him) which concerned the freedom from obligation in regard to those idolatrous tribes who had shown no respect for the treaties which they had entered into with the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him). This declaration is contains in the opening verses of Sura Tauba.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) spent this year in making preparations for the Hajj in the tenth year of Hijra which coincided with the sixty-third year (the last year) of his life. Every attempt was, therefore, made to take full advantage of this great assembly. Messengers were sent to all parts of Arabia inviting people to join him in this great Pilgrimage. It was necessary for them since they should learn by first-hand knowledge the several injunctions and practices of the Pilgrimage-free from all taints of ignorance-an ideal pattern which was to be kept intact in its pristine glory for all times to come. Not only the rites and rituals of the Pilgrimage were to be finally explained by the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) but all those things which had any concern with Islam had been finalized.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) delivered a khutba on the 24th of Dhi-Qa&#8217;da on the occasion of the Friday prayer and gave the Muslims necessary instructions relating to Hajj. Next day, I. e. on the 25th of Dhi-Qa&#8217;da, he set out after Zuhr prayer on a journey for Hajj along with thousands of his devoted Companions. The &#8216;Asr prayer was offered at Dhu&#8217;l-Hulaifa. The caravan spent the night there and it was there after the Zuhr prayer that the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) and his Companions put on Ihram and proceeded towards Mecca. They reached their destination on the 4th of Dhu&#8217;l-Hijja pronouncing Talbiya (Labbaik, Labbaik, Allahumma Labbaik).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the caravan moved on the number of participants swelled till, according to some of the narrators, it reached more than one lakh and thirty thousands. The Farewell Pilgrimage is one of the most important occasions in the sacred life of Muhammad (May peace be upon him). Apart from the rites and rituals, the addresses and speeches of the Holy Prophet (May peace be upon him) succinctly sum up the teachings of Islam.</p>

He placed his hand upon my head and opened my upper button and then the lower one and then placed his palm on my chest (in order to bless me), and I was, during those days, a young boy, and he said: You are welcome, my nephew. Ask whatever you want to ask. And I asked him but as he was blind (he could not respond to me immediately), and the time for prayer came. He stood up covering himself in his mantle. And whenever he placed its ends upon his shoulders they slipped down on account of being short (in size). Another mantle was, however, lying on the clothes rack near by. And he led us in the prayer. I said to him: Tell me about the Hajj of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (May peace be upon him). And he pointed with his hand nine, and then stated: The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) stayed in (Medina) for nine years but did not perform Hajj, then he made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) was about to perform the Hajj. A large number of persons came to Medina and all of them were anxious to follow the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) and do according to his doing. We set out with him till we reached Dhu&#8217;l-Hulaifa. Asma&#8217; daughter of Umais gave birth to Muhammad b. Abu Bakr. She sent message to the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) asking him: What should 1 do? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Take a bath, bandage your private parts and put on Ihram. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) then prayed in the mosque and then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel) and it stood erect with him on its back at al-Baida&#8217;. And I saw as far as I could see in front of me but riders and pedestrians, and also on my right and on my left and behind me like this. And the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) was prominent among us and the (revelation) of the Holy Qur&#8217;an was descending upon him. And it is he who knows (its true) significance. And whatever he did, we also did that. He pronounced the Oneness of Allah (saying):&#8221; Labbaik,0 Allah, Labbaik, Labbaik. Thou hast no partner, praise and grace is Thine and the Sovereignty too; Thou hast no partner.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people also pronounced this Talbiya which they pronounce (today). The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) did not reject anything out of it. But the Messenger of Allah (May peace. be upon him) adhered to his own Talbiya. Jabir (Allah be pleased with him) said: We did not have any other intention but that of Hajj only, being unaware of the Umra (at that season), but when we came with him to the House, he touched the pillar and (made seven circuits) running three of them and walking four. And then going to the Station of Ibrahim, he recited:&#8221; And adopt the Station of Ibrahim as a place of prayer.&#8221; And this Station was between him and the House. My father said (and I do not know whether he had made a mention of it but that was from Allah&#8217;s Apostle [May peace be upon him] that he recited in two rak&#8217;ahs:&#8221; say: He is Allah One,&#8221; and say:&#8221; Say: 0 unbelievers.&#8221; He then returned to the pillar (Hajar Aswad) and kissed it. He then went out of the gate to al-Safa&#8217; and as he reached near it he recited:&#8221; Al-Safa&#8217; and al-Marwa are among the signs appointed by Allah,&#8221; (adding: ) I begin with what Allah (has commanded me) to begin. He first mounted al-Safa&#8217; till he saw the House, and facing Qibla he declared the Oneness of Allah and glorified Him, and said:&#8221; There is no god but Allah, One, there is no partner with Him. His is the Sovereignty. to Him praise is due. and He is Powerful over everything. There is no god but Allah alone, Who fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates alone.&#8221; He then made supplication in the course of that saying such words three times. He then descended and walked towards al-Marwa, and when his feet came down in the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached al-Marwa. There he did as he had done at al-Safa&#8217;. And when it was his last running at al-Marwa he said: If I had known beforehand what I have come to know afterwards, I would not have brought sacrificial animals and would have performed an &#8216;Umra. So, he who among you has not the sacrificial animals with him should put off Ihram and treat it as an Umra. Suraqa b. Malik b. Ju&#8217;sham got up and said: Messenger of Allah, does it apply to the present year, or does it apply forever? Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) intertwined the fingers (of one hand) into another and said twice: The &#8216;Umra has become incorporated in the Hajj (adding):&#8221; No, but for ever and ever.&#8221; &#8216;All came from the Yemen with the sacrificial animals for the Prophet (May peace be upon him) and found Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her) to be one among those who had put off Ihram and had put on dyed clothes and had applied antimony. He (Hadrat&#8217;Ali) showed disapproval to it, whereupon she said: My father has commanded me to do this. He (the narrator) said that &#8216;Ali used to say in Iraq: I went to the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) showing annoyance at Fatimah for what she had done, and asked the (verdict) of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) regarding what she had narrated from him, and told him that I was angry with her, whereupon he said: She has told the truth, she has told the truth. (The Holy Prophet then asked &#8216;Ali): What did you say when you undertook to go for Hajj? I (&#8216;Ali) said: 0 Allah, I am putting on Ihram for the same purpose as Thy Messenger has put it on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: I have with me sacrificial animals, so do not put off the Ihram. He (Jabir) said: The total number of those sacrificial animals brought by &#8216;Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the Apostle (may peace be upon him) was one hundred. Then all the people except the Apostle (may peace be upon him) and those who had with them sacrificial animals, put off Ihram, and got their hair clipped; when it was the day of Tarwiya (8th of Dhu&#8217;l-Hijja) they went to Mina and put on the Ihram for Hajj and the Messenger of Ailah (may peace be upon him) rode and led the noon, afternoon, sunset &#8216;Isha&#8217; and dawn prayers. He then waited a little till the sun rose, and commanded that a tent of hair should be pitched at Namira. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then set out and the Quraish did not doubt that he would halt at al-Mash&#8217;ar al-Haram (the sacred site) as the Quraish used to do in the pre-Islamic period. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him), however, passed on till he came to &#8216;Arafa and he found that the tent had been pitched for him at Namira. There he got down till the sun had passed the meridian; he commanded that al-Qaswa should be brought and saddled for him. Then he came to the bottom of the valley, and addressed the people saying: Verily your blood, your property are as sacred and inviolable as the sacredness of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this town of yours. Behold! Everything pertaining to the Days of Ignorance is under my feet completely abolished. Abolished are also the blood-revenges of the Days of Ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first claim of ours on blood-revenge which I abolish is that of the son of Rabi&#8217;a b. al-Harith, who was nursed among the tribe of Sa&#8217;d and killed by Hudhail. And the usury of she pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the first of our usury I abolish is that of &#8216;Abbas b. &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib, for it is all abolished. Fear Allah concerning women! Verily you have taken them on the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by words of Allah. You too have right over them, and that they should not allow anyone to sit on your bed whom you do not like. But if they do that, you can chastise them but not severely. Their rights upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you the Book of Allah, and if you hold fast to it, you would never go astray. And you would be asked about me (on the Day of Resurrection), (now tell me) what would you say? They (the audience) said: We will bear witness that you have conveyed (the message), discharged (the ministry of Prophethood) and given wise (sincere) counsel. He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet) then raised his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people (said):&#8221; O Allah, be witness. 0 Allah, be witness,&#8221; saying it thrice. (Bilal then) pronounced Adhan and later on Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet) led the noon prayer. He (Bilal) then uttered Iqama and he (the Holy Prophet) led the afternoon prayer and he observed no other prayer in between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then mounted his camel and came to the place of stay, making his she-camel al-Qaswa, turn towards the side where there we are rocks, having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him, and faced the Qibla. He kept standing there till the sun set, and the yellow light had somewhat gone, and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He made Usama sit behind him, and he pulled the nosestring of Qaswa so forcefully that its head touched the saddle (in order to keep her under perfect control), and he pointed out to the people with his right hand to be moderate (in speed), and whenever he happened to pass over an elevated tract of sand, he slightly loosened it (the nose-string of his camel) till she climbed up and this is how he reached al-Muzdalifa. There he led the evening and &#8216;Isha prayers with one Adhan and two Iqamas and did not glorify (Allah) in between them (i. e. he did not observe supererogatory rak&#8217;ahs between Maghrib and &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers). The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) then lay down till dawn and offered the dawn prayer with an Adhan and Iqama when the morning light was clear. He again mounted al-Qaswa, and when he came to al-Mash&#8217;ar al-Haram, he faced towards Qibla, supplicated Him, Glorified Him, and pronounced His Uniqueness (La ilaha illa Allah) and Oneness, and kept standing till the daylight was very clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then went quickly before the sun rose, and seated behind him was al-Fadl b. &#8216;Abbas and he was a man having beautiful hair and fair complexion and handsome face. As the Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) was moving on, there was also going a group of women (side by side with them). Al-Fadl began to look at them. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) placed his hand on the face of Fadl who then turned his face to the other side, and began to see, and the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him) turned his hand to the other side and placed it on the face of al-Fadl. He again turned his face to the other side till he came to the bottom of Muhassir. 1680 He urged her (al-Qaswa) a little, and, following the middle road, which comes out at the greatest jamra, he came to the jamra which is near the tree. At this be threw seven small pebbles, saying Allah-o-Akbar while throwing every one of them in a manner in which the small pebbles are thrown (with the help of fingers) and this he did in the bottom of the valley. He then went to the place of sacrifice, and sacrificed sixty-three (camels) with his own hand. Then he gave the remaining number to &#8216;All who sacrificed them, and he shared him in his sacrifice. He then commanded that a piece of flesh from each animal sacrificed should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked, both of them (the Holy Prophet and Hadrat &#8216;All) took some meat out of it and drank its soup. The Messenger of Allah (May peace be upon him) again rode and came to the House, and offered the Zuhr prayer at Mecca. He came to the tribe of Abd al-Muttalib, who were supplying water at Zamzam, and said: Draw water. O Bani &#8216;Abd al-Muttalib; were it not that people would usurp this right of supplying water from you, I would have drawn it along with you. So they handed him a basket and he drank from it.</p>

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commenced Ihram of Umra and thus pronounced Talbiya for &#8216;Umra. and then (put on Ihram for Hajj) and pronounced Talbiya for Hajj. And the people performed Tamattu&#8217; in the company of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). They put on Ihram for Umra (first) and then for Hajj. Some of them had sacrificial animals which they had brought with them, whereas some of them had none to sacrifice. So when Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Mecca, he said to the people: He who amongst you has brought sacrificial animals along with him must not treat as lawful anything which has become unlawful for him till he has completed the Hajj; and he, who amongst you has not brought the sacrificial animals should circumambulate the House, and run between al-Safa&#8217; and al-Marwa and clip (his hair) and put off the Ihram, and then again put on the Ihram for Hajj and offer sacrifice of animals. But he who does not find the sacrificial animal, he should observe fast for three days during the Hajj and for seven days when he returns to his family. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) circumambulated (the House) when he came to Mecca: he first kissed the corner (of the Ka&#8217;ba containing the Black Stone), then ran in three circuits out of seven and walked in four circuits. And then when he had finished the circumambulation of the House he observed two rak&#8217;ahs of prayer at the Station (of Ibrahim), and then pronounced Salaam (for concluding the rak&#8217;ahs), and departed and came to al-Safa&#8217; and ran seven times between al-Safa&#8217; and al-Marwa. After that he did not treat anything as lawful which had become unlawful till he had completed his Hajj and sacrificed his animal on the day of sacrifice (10th of Dhu&#8217;l-Hijja). and then went back quickly (to Mecca) and performed circumambulation of the House (known as tawaf ifada) after which all that was unlawful for him became lawful; and those who had brought the sacrificial animals along with them did as Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) had done.

And if he says:&#8221; No, it can&#8217;t be put off,&#8221; then tell him that there is a person who makes such an assertion. He (Muhammad b. &#8216;Abd al-Rahman) then said: I asked him ( Urwa b.

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) performed Hajj, and &#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her) has told me that the first thing with which he commenced (the rituals) when he arrived at Mecca was that he performed ablution and then circumambulated the Ka&#8217;ba.

Then I performed Hajj with my father Zubair b. al-&#8216;Awwam, and the first thing with which he commenced (Hajj) was the circumambulation of the House. He then did nothing besides it. I then saw the emigrants (Muhajirin) and the helpers (Ansar) doing like this and nothing besides it. And the last one whom I saw doing like this was Ibn &#8216;Umar. And he did not break it (the Hajj) after performing &#8216;Umra. And Ibn &#8216;Umar is with them. Why don&#8217;t they ask him (to testify it)? And none amongst those who had passed away commenced (the rituals of Hajj) but by circumambulating the Ka&#8217;ba on their (first arrival) and they did not put off Ihram (without completing the Hajj), and I saw my mother and my aunt commencing (their Hajj) with the circumambulation of the House, and they did not put off Ihram. My mother informed me that she came and her sister, and Zubair and so and so for &#8216;Umra, and when they had kissed the corner (the Black Stone, after Sa&#8217;i and circumambulation), they put off Ihram.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) reported that they (the Arabs of pre-Islamic days) looked upon Umra during the months of Hajj as the greatest of sins on the earth. So they intercalated the month of Muharram for Safar and said: When the backs of their camels would become all right and traces (if the pilgrims) would be effaced (from the paths) and the month of Safar would be over, then Umra would be permissible for one who wants to perform it. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) and his Companions came in the state of Ihram for performing Hajj on the fourth (of Dhu&#8217;l-Hijja) he (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) commanded them to change their state of Ihram (from Hajj) to that of &#8216;Umra.

I (Ibn Juraij, one of the narrators) said to &#8216;Ata&#8217;: On what authority does he (Ibn Abbas) say this? He said: On the authority uf Allah&#8217;s words:&#8221; Then their place of sacrifice is the Ancient House&#8221; (al-Qur&#8217;an, xxii. 33). I said: It concerns the time after staying at &#8216;Arafat, whereupon he said: Ibn &#8216;Abbas (Allah be pleased with them) had stated (that the place of sacrifice is the Ancient House) ; it way be after staying at &#8216;Arafat or before (staying there). And he (Ibn Abbas) made this deduction I from the command of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) when he had ordered to put off Ihram on the occasion of the Farewell Pilgrimage.</p>

Thereupon he said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) came to Mecca and the polytheists said that Mubammad and his Companions had emaciated and would, therefore, be unable to circumambulate the House; and they felt jealous of him (the Holy Prophet). (It was due to this) that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) commanded them to walk swiftly in three (circuits) and walk (normally) in four. I said to him: Inform me if it is Sunnah to observe Tawaf between al-Safa and al-Marwa while riding, for your people look upon it as Sunnah.

(fixedl on the bank of the river which were called Isaf and Na&#8217;ila. The people went there, and then circumambulated between al-Safa&#8217; and al-Marwa and then got their heads shaved. With the advent of Islam they (the Muslims) did not like to circumambulate between them as they used to do during the Days of Ignorance. It was on account of this that Allah. the Exalted and Majestic, revealed:&#8221; Verily al-Safe and al-Marwa are among the Signs of Allah&#8221; to the end of the verse. She said: Then people began to observe Sa&#8217;i.</p>

Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) observed Sa&#8217;i and so did the Muslims. So it is a Sunnah (of the Prophet).

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ata&#8217; reported: The House was burnt during the time of Yazid b. Muawiya when the people of Syria had fought (in Mecca). And it happened with it (the Ka&#8217;ba) what was (in store for it). Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) felt it (in the same state) until the people came in the season (of Hajj). (The idea behind was) that he wanted to exhort them or incite them (to war) against the people of Syria. When the people had arrived he said to them: O people, advise me about the Ka&#8217;ba. Should I demolish it and then build it from its very foundation, or should I repair whatever has been damaged of it? Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: An idea has occurred to me according to which I think that you should only repair (the portion which has been) damaged, and leave the House (in that very state in which) people embraced Islam (and leave those very stones in the same state) when people embraced Islam, and over which Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had raised it. Thereupon Ibn Zubair said: It the house of any one of you is burnt, he would not be contented until he had reconstructed it, then what about the House of your Lord (which is far more Important than your house)? I would seek good advice from my Lord thrice and then I would make up (my mind) about this affair. After seeking good advice thrice, he made up his mind to demolish it. The people apprehended that calamity might fall from heaven on those persons who would be first to climb (over the building for the purpose of demolishing it), till one (took up courage, and ascended the roof), and threw down one of its stones. When the people saw no calamity befalling him, they followed him, demolished it until it was razed to the ground. Then Ibn Zubair erected pillars and hung cartains on them (in order to provide facilities to the people for observing the time of its construction). And the walls were raised; and Ibn Zubair said: I heard &#8216;A&#8217;isha (Allah be pleased with her) say that Allah&#8217;s Apostle (may peace be upon him) had observed: If the people had Rot recently (abandoned) unbelief, find I had means enough to reconstruct it, which I had not, I would have definitely excompassed in it five cubits of area from Hijr. And I would also have constructed a door for the people to enter, and a door for their exit. I today have (the means to spend) and I entertain no fearfrom the side of people (that they would protest against this change). So he added five cubits of area from the side of Hatim to it that there appeared (the old) foundation (upon which Hadrat Ibrahim had built the Ka&#8217;ba). and the people saw that and it was upon this foundation that the wall was raised. The length of the Ka&#8217;ba was eighteen cubits. when addition was made to it (which was in its breadth), then naturally the length appears to be) small (as compared with its breadth). Then addition of ten cubits (of area) was made in its length (also). Two doors were also constructed, one of which (was meant) for entrance and the other one for exit. When Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) was killed, Hajjaj wrote to &#8216;Abd al-Malik (b. Marwan) informing him about it, and telling him that Ibn Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) had built (the Ka&#8217;ba) on those very foundations (which were laid by Ibrahim) and which reliable persons among the Meccans had seen. &#8216;Abd al-Malik wrote to him: We are not concerned with the censuring of Ibn Zubair in anything. Keep intact the addition made by him in the side of length, and whatever he has added frem the side of Hijr revert to (its previous) foundation, and wall up the door which he had opened. Thus Hajjaj at the command of Abd al-Malik) demolished it (that portion) and rebuilt it on (its previous) foundations.</p>

When a person intended to get into it, they let him climb (the stairs), and as he was about to enter, they pushed him and he fell down.&#8221; &#8216;Abd al-Malik said to Harith; Did you yourself hear her saying this? He said: Yes. He (Harith) said that he (&#8216;Abd al-Malik) scratched the ground with his staff for some time and then said: I wish I had left his (Ibn Zubair&#8217;s) work there.</p>

A person known as Abu Shah, one of the people of Yemen, stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, (kindly) write it for me.

It was reported to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him). He mounted his camel and delivered this address: Verily Allah, the Exalted and Majestic, held back the Ele- phants from Mecca, and gave its domination to His Messenger and believers. Behold, it was not violable for anyone before me and it will not be violable for anyone after me. Behold, it was made violable for me for an hour of a day; and at this very hour it has again been made inviolable (for me as well as for others). So its thorns are not to be cut, its trees are not to be lopped, and (no one is allowed to) pick up a thing dropped, but the one who makes an announcement of it. And one whose fellow is killed is allowed to opt between two alternatives: either he should receive blood-money or get the life of the (murderer) in return. He (the narrator said): A person from the Yemen, who was called Abu Shah, came to him and said: Messenger of Allah, write it down for me, whereupon he (Allah&#8217;s Messenger) said: Write it down for Abu Shah. One of the persons from among the Quraish also said: Except Idhkhir, for we use it in our houses ant our graves. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: Except Idhkhir.</p>

When he received it he said: O Allah, bless us in our fruits; and bless us in our city; and bless us in our sa&#8217;s and bless us in our mudd. O Allah, Ibrahim was Thy servant, Thy friend, and Thy apostle; and I am Thy servant and Thy apostle. He (Ibrahim) made supplication to Thee for (the showering of blessings upon) Mecca, and I am making supplication to Thee for Medina just as he made supplication to Thee for Mecca, and the like of it in addition. He would then call to him the youngest child and give him these fruits.</p>

Thus no blood is to be shed within its (bounds) and no weapon is to be carried for fighting, and the leaves of the trees there should not be beaten off except for fodder. O Allah, bless us in our city; O Allab, bless us in our sil; O Allah, bless us in our mudd; O Allah, bless us in our sa; O Allah, bless us in our mudd. O Allah, bless us in our city. O Allah, bless with this blessing two more blessings. By Him in Whose Hand is my life, there is no ravine or mountain path of Medina which is not protected by two angels until you reach there. (He then said to the people: ) Proceed, and we, therefore, proceeded and we came to Medina By Him (in Whose name) we take oath and (in Whose name) oath is taken (Hammad is in doubt about it), we had hardly put down our camel saddles on arriving at Medina that we were attacked by the people of the tribe of &#8216;Abdullah b.
