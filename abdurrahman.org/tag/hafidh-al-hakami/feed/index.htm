										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Haafidh Ibn Ahmed ‘Alee Al-Hakamee [d.1377H] rahimahullaah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Birth and Early childhood</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Haafidh Ibn Ahmed ‘Alee Al-Hakamee (rahimahullaah ta’aala) was one of the scholars from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and one of the most famous of those who lived in the 14th century of Hijrah to come from the southern region of the country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Haafidh was born on the 24th of Ramadaan, 1342H (1924) in a coastal village called as-Salaam which lies south of the city of Jaazaan. When he was still just a small boy he moved with his family to the village of Al-Jaadi’, which lies about 6 kilometres east of the city of Saamitah because his father found that farmland and pastures were better there. However, his immediate family continued to commute between the two cities due to extenuating circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The young Haafidh was raised under the good and righteous guardianship of his father who taught him modesty, purity and good character. Before reaching the age of maturity, he worked as a shepherd herding his fathers’ sheep, which were the most important form of wealth to his family as well as the rest of the people in the society in those days. However, Haafidh differed from the other boys in his village because of his intelligence and his ability to memorize and understand quickly. He learned to write while he still a small boy and he memorized the entire Qur’an by the time he was twelve years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Seeking Knowledge and Religious Studies</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the young Haafidh reached the age of seven years, his father put both him and his older brother Muhammad into Qur’an memorization school in Al-Jaadi’. There he read the 30th and 29th parts of the Qur’an to the teacher and afterwards he and his brother finished learning to read the entire Qur’an with the proper rules of recitation in just a few months. Shortly thereafter, he completed memorizing the Qur’an in its entirety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next he concentrated on his writing skills until he perfected them and was able to copy the Qur’an with excellent handwriting. At the same time, he and his brother were busy reading and memorizing books of fiqh, inheritance law, hadeeth, tafseer, and Tawheed under the tutelage of their father since there was no one else suitable or trustworthy enough to teach them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the year 1358H (1940) the renowned reformer and great scholar, Sheikh ‘Abdullah Bin Muhammad Bin Hamd Al-Qar’aawee, traveled all the way from Najd to the city of Tihaamah in the southern part of the Kingdom after he heard about the level of ignorance and the spread of innovation in the region. Sheikh Qar’awee’s journey to the south had been in conjunction with the consultation of the Grand Muftee of Saudi Arabia at that time, Sheikh Muhammad Ibraheem Aala-Sheikh (rahimahullaah ta’aala). Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee vowed to shoulder the responsibility of calling to the true religion (of Islam) and correcting the beliefs in ‘Aqeedah (the Islamic belief) and the superstitions that were stuck in the minds of the ignorant people in the region.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1359H (1941) Haafidh’s older brother Muhammad went to Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee with a letter from the both of them requesting some books on Tawheed and expressing their regret at being unable to come (and study with him) because they were busy serving and seeing to their parents needs. They also requested that the Sheikh visit their village so that they might listen to some of his lessons. Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee accepted their invitation and went to their village where he met the young Haafidh and got to know him very well and saw in him promising signs of excellence and intelligence – which turned out to be a very accurate evaluation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee remained in Al-Jaadi’ (their village) for a number of days teaching, and a group of elders as well as some youth from the local people attended the lectures. Amongst them was the young Haafidh who was the youngest of them in age, yet the fastest of them in memorizing and understanding the information given.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee said about him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘And thus it was that I stayed a number of days in Al-Jaadi’. Haafidh attended the lessons and if he missed anything then he would get it from his classmates. He is like his name Haafidh (which means: one who memorizes), he preserves things (accurately) by heart as well as with his note taking. I used to dictate to all of the students and then explain the lesson and the older students used to ask him if they had trouble understanding something or (if they missed) writing something in their notes.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee was ready to return to the city of Saamitah – which by this time he had already made his dwelling place and the centre for his da’wah activities – he asked the young Haafidh’s parents to permit him to employ someone to herd their sheep on Haafidh’s behalf in exchange for their permission that Haafidh and his older brother return with him to Saamitah so that they might seek knowledge there underneath his tutelage. But Haafidh’s parents refused the Sheikh’s request at first, insisting that their youngest son remain with them because of their great need for him. However, Allah decreed the life of Haafidh’s mother would end during the month of Rajab in the year 1360H (1942), so Haafidh’s father then allowed him and his brother Muhammad to study with the Sheikh two or three days a week and then return to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Haafidh began to study in Saamitah with the Sheikh who would dictate lessons to him after which he would return to his village. Haafidh was an inspired student who understood and memorized everything that he read or heard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sadly his father did not live long after that as he died on his way back from Hajj in the same year 1360H (1942). After that, Haafidh was able to study and gain knowledge (full time) so he went to his Sheikh and stayed with him, always learning and benefitting from him. Haafidh proved to be an exceptionally gifted student who learned very quickly. He was also very good at poetry and prose and he (eventually) authored many books in the major categories of Islamic knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Haafidh was only nineteen years old, Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee asked him to write a book about Tawheed and the ‘Aqeedah of the Salaf-us-Saalih (The Pious Predecessors), that would be easy for students to memorize, and that would also demonstrate just how much he has benefited from his reading and studying. The young Haafidh responded by writing a treatise in didactic prose entitled Sullam-al-Wusool ilaa ‘Ilm-il-Usool fee At-Tawheed (The means of arriving at the knowledge of the fundamentals of Tawheed) which he completed in the year 1362H (1944), and which met with the avid approval of his teacher as well as the other prominent scholars of his time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He followed this work other writings also in didactic prose on Tawheed, hadeeth terminology, fiqh, principles of fiqh, inheritance law, the biography of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم), and others, all o fwhich were originally published with the help of King Sa’ood Ibn ‘Abdul-’Azeez (rahimahullaah ta’aala).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It becomes clear for us through what Sheikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee left behind for us from his writings that he was profoundly affected by reading books that were written by the scholars of the Salaf about tafseer, hadeeth, fiqh, principles of fiqh, Islamic manners, Arabic language and grammar. As for ‘Aqeedah, then he was obviously very influenced by the writings of Sheikh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah and his famous student Ibn-ul-Qayyim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some of His Other Achievements</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Sheikh ‘Abdullah Al-Qar’aawee realized the superiority of his student Haafidh, he appointed him as a teacher for the other students and they benefitted greatly from his lessons.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1363H (1945) Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee selected Haafidh to be the director of the Madrassa-tus-Salafiyyah institute in Saamitah, which was the first and the largest of all the schools that Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee established for the students of knowledge in the southern region of the kingdom. Haafidh was also made regional superintendent for all the schools in the neighboring villages and townships.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Al-Qar’awee went on to enlarge the schools in Tihaamah and ‘Aseer and he eventually established at least one school in every village in the south that taught Islamic studies. He appointed his students as teachers and administrators for these schools. However, when Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee had established literally hundreds of schools in the southern region he took his first student. Haafidh al-Hakamee, as his assistant while traveling and supervising the schools.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Haafidh traveled to many places in order to fulfill his responsibilities with Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee including As-Salaama-tul-’Ulya, the city of Beesh and Umm-ul-Khashab in northern Jaazaan. Afterwards, he returned to Saamitah again as director of the schools, in the region in order to help his Sheikh administer the many schools that he had established so taht the important improvements brought about by thsi da’wah might continue.</p>
<p>Such was the high opinion that Sheikh ‘Abdullah Al-Qar’aawee held of Haafidh, that he is known to have said about him:</p>
<p><strong>‘Indeed, he is one of my students, but he has surpassed me in knowledge with a far-aspiring ambition.’</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of Sheikh Haafidh’s three wives was also the daughter of his noble Sheikh, Sheikh Al-Qar’aawee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of Sheikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee’s time was spent trying to uplift the youth in his area and benefit them with his knowledge as much as he could. Some of his students are now renowned scholars in their own right having taken position as judges, teachers, and preachers everywhere in the southern region of the kingdom and elsewhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1373H (1955) a high school was opened in Jaazaan, the capital city of the southern region, and Sheikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee was chosen to be its first director in the same year. Then in 1374H (1956) a scholastic institute was opened in Saamitah by the General Directorate of Colleges and Institutes and Sheikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee was chosen to be its director as well. Sheikh Haafidh performed his administrative duties extremely well in addition to teaching some classes where he was known to give the students knowledge above and beyond the limited curriculum of the institute either himself or through some of the others in the institute.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Death</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee remained as the director of the scholastic institute in Saamitah until he performed Hajj in the year 1377H (1958). After completing the rights of Hajj, Sheikh Haafidh died in the city of Makkah from a sudden illness on the 18th of Dhul Hijjah, 1377H (1958) while he was still a young man of only 35 years and three months. It is there where he lies buried. May Allah, the Exalted, have mercy upon him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Conditions of <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ </em>‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah’ </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By Hafidh al-Hakami <em>-Rahim</em><em>ah</em><em>ullaah-<br />
</em>Taken from his book ‘Ma’arij al-Qabool’</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first Condition: <em>al-Ilm</em> – Knowledge</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> and its intent are affirmation and negation, so knowledge negates ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Azza wa Jal- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So know that <em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped in truth except Allaah) &gt;&gt; [Muhammad: 19]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; except those who bear witness to the truth &gt;&gt; [Zukhruf: 86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means that they testify to <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> &lt;&lt; while they know&gt;&gt; [Zukhruf: 86] with their hearts and they pronounce its meaning with their tongues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Allaah bears witness that <em>La ilaha ‘illa</em><em> Huwa</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels and those having knowledge (also give this witness); (He is always) maintaining His creation in Justice. <em>La ilaha ‘illa</em><em> Huwa</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&gt;&gt; [Aali-‘Imran: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say: ‘Are those who know equal to those who do not know?’ It is only men of understanding who will remember (i.e. get a lesson from Allaah’s Signs and Verses)&gt;&gt; [Zumar: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah&gt;&gt; [Faatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And these similitudes We put forward for mankind, but none will understand them except those who have knowledge (of Allaah and His Signs, etc.)&gt;&gt; [Ankaboot: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh of Imaam Muslim on the authority of ‘Uthmaan <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said that: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; said: ‘Whoever dies knowing <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> entersParadise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Condition: <em>Al-Yaqeen</em> – Certainty</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second condition is certainty which negates doubt, such that the one who pronounces <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> does it with certainty of what these words indicate, with a decisive certainty. This is since<em>Eemaan</em> cannot do without certain knowledge (<em>Ilm al-Yaqeen</em>), as opposed to suspicious knowledge (<em>Ilm al-Thann</em>), and what would be the case if doubt entered <em>Eemaan</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Azza wa Jal- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Only those are the believers who have believed in Allaah and His Messenger and afterward doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the Cause of Allaah. Those! They are the truthful. &gt;&gt;[Hujuraat: 15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So certainty was a condition for them having truthfulness in their<em>Eemaan</em> in Allaah and His Messenger and also that they did not have uncertainty or doubt <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for uncertainty then that comes from the <em>Munafiqeen</em> (hypocrites) – and we seek refuge with Allaah. They were the ones about whom Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; It is only those who believe not in Allaah and the Last Day and whose hearts are in doubt that ask your leave (to be exempted from<em>Jihaad</em>). So in their doubts they waver &gt;&gt; [Tawbah: 45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh of Imaam Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Huraira –<em>RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211;<em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; said: ‘I testify that none is worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and that I am the Messenger of Allaah. There is no servant of Allaah who meets Allaah with these two testifications, not doubting in them, except that he enters Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: ‘there is no servant of Allaah who meets Allaah with these two testifications, not doubting in them, who is prevented from entering Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the Saheeh of Muslim on the authority of Abu Huraira <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> from the long hadeeth that the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; sent him with his shoes and said: ‘Whoever you meet behind this garden that testifies <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> with certainty in his heart then give him the glad tidings of Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger made the entrance into Paradise of the one who says <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> conditional upon his having certainty of it in his heart, with no doubt in it. So, if the condition is removed then the reward is also then removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third Condition: <em>al-Qabool</em> – Acceptance</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Acceptance of what this statement necessitates is with the heart and the tongue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Azza wa Jal – narrates to us the news of what precededregarding those who were previously saved and regarding the punishment of those who rejected and refused to accept this statement. As Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And similarly, We sent not a warner before you to any town (people) but the luxurious ones among them said: ‘We found our fathers following a certain way and religion and we will indeed follow their footsteps.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The warner) said: ‘Even if I bring you better guidance than that which you found your fathers following?’ They said: ‘Verily, We disbelieve in that with which you have been sent.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So We took revenge of them, then see what was the end of those who denied (Islaamic Monotheism)&gt;&gt; [Zukhruf 23-25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Then (in the end) We save Our Messengers and those who believe! Thus it is incumbent upon Us to save the believers. &gt;&gt; [Yunus: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And indeed We did send Messengers before you to their own peoples. They came to them with clear proofs, then We took vengeance on those who committed crimes (disbelief, setting partners in worship with Allaah, sins, etc.), and (as for) the believers it was incumbent upon Us to help (them). &gt;&gt; [Room 47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He -Subhanahu wa Ta’ala – informed us of what He promised to those who accept <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> of reward and what He has prepared of punishment for the one who rejects <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; (It will be said to the Angels): ‘Assemble those who did wrong, together with their companions (from the devils) and what they used to worship instead of Allaah. And lead them on to the way of flaming Fire (Hell);</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘But stop them, verily they are to be questioned.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘</strong>What is the matter with you? Why do you not help one another (as you used to do in the world)?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nay, but that Day they shall surrender,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they will turn to one another and question one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will say: ‘It was you who used to come to us from the right side [i.e. from the right side of one of us and beautify for us every evil, order polytheism for us, and prevent us from the truth i.e. Islaamic Monotheism and from every good deed].’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will reply: ‘Nay, you yourselves were not believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘</strong>And we had no authority over you. Nay! But you were transgressing people (disobedient, polytheists, and disbelievers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘</strong>So now the Word of our Lord has been justified against us, that we shall certainly (have to) taste (the torment).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘</strong>So we led you astray because we were ourselves astray.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then verily, that Day, they will (all) share in the torment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, that is how We deal with <em>Al­-Mujrimoon </em>(polytheists, sinners, criminals, the disobedient to Allaah, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truly, when it was said to them: <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah), they puffed themselves up with pride (i.e. denied it).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (they) said: ‘Are we going to abandon our (gods) for the sake of a mad poet? &gt;&gt; [Saaffat: 22-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- made the cause of and the reason for their punishment their arrogance towards <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> and their belying of those who came with it. So, they did not negate what Allaah negated and they did not affirm what Allaah affirmed, rather they said rejecting and proudly:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; ‘Has he made the <em>âliha </em>(gods) (all) into One <em>Ilâh </em>(God – Allaah). Verily, this is a curious thing!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the leaders among them went about (saying): ‘Go on, and remain constant to your <em>âliha</em> (gods)! Verily, this is a thing designed (against you)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We have not heard (the like) of this among the people of these later days. This is nothing but an invention! &gt;&gt; [Saad: 5-7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And here they said : &lt;&lt;‘Are we going to abandon our (gods) for the sake of a mad poet? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah -Azza wa Jal – refuted them and turned that back on them via His Messenger &#8211;<em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; and He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Nay! He has come with the truth (i.e. Allaah’s Religion – Islaamic Monotheism and this Qur’aan) and he confirms the Messengers (before him who brought Allaah’s religion – Islaamic Monotheism).&gt;&gt; [Saaffat: 37] to the end of the Aayaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then He said about those before them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Except the chosen slaves of Allaah (faithful, obedient, true believers of Islaamic Monotheism). For them there will be a known provision (in Paradise). Fruits; and they shall be honoured, in the Gardens of delight (Paradise) &gt;&gt; [Saaffat: 40-43] to the end of the<em>Aayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Whoever brings a good deed (i.e. Belief in the Oneness of Allaah along with every deed of righteousness), will have better than its worth, and they will be safe from the terror on that Day. &gt;&gt;[Naml: 89]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the Saheeh on the authority of Abu Musa <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> thatthe Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; said: ‘The like of what Allaah sent me with of guidance and knowledge is like heavy rainfall which poured onto the ground. There was some land which was fertile which absorbed the water and many plants and grass began to grow. There was some land which was arid but it held the water and Allaah made the people benefit by it, so they drank from it, used the water and used it for agriculture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was some other land which was affected by the water but was flat land where nothing would grow. It did not hold the water nor did it allow plants to grow. That is the example of the one who has understanding of the Deen and benefits from what Allaah sent me with, so he learns it and teaches it and the example of he whocannot raise his head due to it and does not accept the guidance of Allaah with which I have been sent.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth Condition</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Al-Inqiyaad</em></strong><strong> – Submission &amp; Obedience</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Submission and obedience to what <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> requires and that it negates disobedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Azza wa Jal – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And turn in repentance and in obedience with true Faith (Islaamic Monotheism) to your Lord and submit to Him (in Islaam) &gt;&gt; [Zumar: 54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allaah and he is a <em>Muhsin </em>(a good-doer). &gt;&gt; [Nisaa’: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And whosoever submits his face (himself) to Allaah, while he is a<em>Muhsin</em> (good­-doer), then he has grasped the most trustworthy hand­hold [<em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah)]. &gt;&gt; [Luqman: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means holding onto <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And to Allaah return all matters for decision. &gt;&gt; [Luqman: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of which is, that he submits his face to Allaah i.e. he obeys Him, and he is a righteous person worshipping Allaah Alone.Whoever does not submit his face to Allaah and is not a righteous person then he has not held onto the most trustworthy handhold that will never break.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is the meaning of the saying of Allaah -Azza wa Jal which follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And whoever disbelieved, let not his disbelief grieve you, to Us is their return and We shall inform them what they have done. Verily, Allaah is the All­-Knower of what is in the hearts (of men).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We let them enjoy for a little while, then in the end We shall oblige them to (enter) a great torment. &gt;&gt; [Luqman: 23-24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth Condition</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Sidq</em></strong><strong> – Truthfulness</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truthfulness to <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> negates lying, falsehood and it is to say <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> truthfully from one’s heart and to make one’s speech in accordance to what is in one’s heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Azza wa Jal – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<em>Alif ­Lâm­ Mîm.</em> Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: ‘We believe’ and will not be tested.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allaah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allaah knows all of that before testing them). &gt;&gt; [Ankaboot: 1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said regarding the <em>Munafiqeen</em> (hypocrites) who said‘<em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em>, speaking falsely:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And of mankind, there are some (hypocrites) who say: ‘We believe in Allaah and the Last Day’ while in fact they believe not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They (think to) deceive Allaah and those who believe while they only deceive themselves and perceive (it) not!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In their hearts is a disease (of doubt and hypocrisy) and Allaah has increased their disease. A painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies. &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 8-11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many times has Allaah -Ta’ala- mentioned them and exposed them, repeatedly exposing their cover and revealing it. He makes their humiliation manifest in more than one place in His Book such as in Soorahs Baqarah, Aali-‘Imran, Nisaa’, Anfaal, Tawbah as well as a whole Soorah dedicated to them (i.e. <em>Al-Munaafiqoon</em>) along withother Soorahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Mu’aadh bin Jabal <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> -:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is none who testifies that <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em> and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger’ truthfully from his heart except that Allaah prohibits him from entering the Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah made being saved from the Fire, for the one who says this statement, conditional by saying it truthfully from his heart. Merely pronouncing <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> does not benefit the one who says it unless there is agreement with the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in Bukhari and Muslim from the hadeeth of Anas bin Malik and Talha bin Ubaydullaah <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhumaa</em>&#8211; in the story of the Bedouin – who was Damaam bin Tha’alabah, a delegate of Bani Sa’ad bin Bakr – when he asked the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; about the rulings of Islaam and was then informed by him.He then asked the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – ‘Do I have to do anything else?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; answered: ‘No, except if you perform it optionally.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Bedouin said: ‘I swear by Allaah I will not increase uponthat nor decrease from it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; said: ‘He will be successful if he is truthful.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in some narrations: ‘Indeed if he is truthful then he will enter into Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger made it a condition for his success and entrance into Paradise that he was truthful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth Condition:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Al-Ikhlaas</em></strong><strong> – Sincerity</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sincerity is purifying actions from all the stains of <em>Shirk</em> with righteous intention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Tabaraka wa Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Surely, the religion (i.e. worship and obedience) is for Allaah only&gt;&gt; [Zumar: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And they were commanded not but that they should worship Allaah and worship none but Him Alone &gt;&gt; [al-Bayyinah: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So worship Allaah (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allaah’s sake only, (not to show-off and not to set up rivals with Him in worship)&gt;&gt; [Zumar: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: ‘Verily, I am commanded to worship Allaah (Alone) by obeying Him and doing religious deeds sincerely for Allaah’s sake only &gt;&gt; [Zumar :11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say ‘Allaah Alone I worship by doing religious deeds sincerely for His sake only, not to show off and not setting up rivals with Him in worship.’&gt;&gt; [Zumar: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them. Except those who repent (from hypocrisy), do righteous good deeds, hold fast to Allaah, purify their religion for Allaah (by worshipping none but Allaah and do good for Allaah’s sake only, not to show-off), then they will be with the believers. &gt;&gt; [Nisaa: 145-146]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are other similar <em>Aayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh of Bukhari on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> : ‘Of those people happiest with my intercession is the one who said ‘<em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> sincerely from his heart or from his self.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in the Saheeh of Bukhari on the authority of ‘Utbaan bin Malik<em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; who said: ‘Indeed Allaah prohibited the Fire for the one who said: <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> desiring by it the Face of Allaah – <em>Azza wa Jal</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Jaami’ of Tirmidhee on the authority of Abu Huraira <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: ‘A slave of Allaah does not ever say <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> sincerely except that the doors to the heavens are opened for him until it reaches the <em>‘Arsh</em>, as long as he keeps away from the major sins.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tirmidhee said the hadeeth via this chain is Hasan Ghareeb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventh Condition:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Al-Muhabbah</em></strong><strong> – Love</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which is having love for this statement, what it necessitates and indicates, loving its people – those who act upon it, adhering to its conditions – and to hate what violates it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Azza wa Jal – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allaah as rivals (to Allaah). They love them as they love Allaah. But those who believe love Allaah more (than anything else). &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah – Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O you who believe! Whoever from among you turns back from his religion (Islaam), Allaah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him; humble towards the believers, stern towards the disbelievers, fighting in the Way of Allaah and never afraid of the blame of th0e blamers.  &gt;&gt; [Maa’idah: 54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Azza wa Jal – informed us that His worshippers, the believers, are more severe in their love for Him. That is because they do not associate anyone else with Him in their love for Him, unlike those from the <em>Mushrikeen </em>who claimed they loved Him but then also took partners with Allaah whom they loved just as they loved Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sign that the slave of Allaah loves his Lord is that he submits to what Allaah loves, even if it opposes his desires and that he also hates what his Lord hates, even if his desires are inclined to it. The slave of Allaah is loyal to whomever Allaah and His Messenger are loyal to and he has enmity towards whomever has enmity towardsAllaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He follows His Messenger, <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; imitates his example and accepts his guidance. All of these are signs of the presence ofthe conditions of love. It is not conceivable to have love without its conditions being present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Tabaraka wa Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Have you seen him who has taken as his <em>ilâh </em>(god) his own desire? Would you then be a <em>Wakeel</em> (a disposer of his affairs or a watcher) over him? &gt;&gt; [Furqaan: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Have you seen him who takes his own lust (vain desires) as his<em>ilâh</em> (god), and Allaah knowing (him as such) left him astray and sealed his hearing and his heart and put a cover on his sight. Who then will guide him after Allaah?&gt;&gt; [Jaathiyah: 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everyone who worships other than Allaah along with Him, then in reality he worships his own desire. Every sin by which Allaah is disobeyed, it is due to the slave of Allaah submitting to his desires rather than to the commands of Allaah – Azza wa Jal – and the avoidance of His prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said regarding loyalty and enmity for the sake of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraheem and those with him, when they said to their people: ‘Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah. We have rejected you and there has begun between us and you hostility and hatred forever, until you believe in Allaah Alone’&gt;&gt; [Mumtahana: 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; You will not find any people who believe in Allaah and the Last Day befriending those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger even though they were their fathers, their sons, their brothers or their kindred (people). For such He has written Faith in their hearts &gt;&gt;[Mujadilah:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as<em>Auliyâ’ </em>(friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), they are but <em>Auliyâ’ </em>to one another.  And if any amongst you takes them as <em>Auliyâ’, </em>then surely he is one of them &gt;&gt; [Maa’idah: 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O you who believe! Take not for <em>Auliyâ’ </em>(supporters and helpers) your fathers and your brothers if they prefer disbelief to Belief. And whoever of you does so, then he is one of the <em>Zâlimûn </em>(wrong-doers, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline and the dwellings in which you delight … are dearer to you than Allaah and His Messenger and striving hard and fighting in His Cause, then wait until Allaah brings about His Decision (torment). And Allaah guides not the people who are the rebellious, disobedient to Allaah. &gt;&gt; [Tawbah: 23-24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies as friends &gt;&gt; [Mumtahana: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">to the end of the Soorah. And there are other Aayaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Following the Messenger </strong><strong><em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em></strong><strong>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah -Ta’ala- said regarding the conditions for following His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins. And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’ Say: ‘Obey Allaah and the Messenger.’ But if they turn away, then Allaah does not like the disbelievers. &gt;&gt; [Aali-‘Imran: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; said: ‘There are three characteristics, whoever has them finds the sweetness of Eemaan: that Allaah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than other than them; that when he loves a person he loves him only for Allaah’s sake and that he hates to return to disbelief after Allaah has saved him from it just as he hates to be thrown into the Hell-Fire’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim from the hadeeth of Anas <em>–Ra</em><em>dhi’</em><em>allaahu anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Bukhari and Muslim narrate on the authority of Anas and of Abu Huraira <em>–Radhi’Allaahu anhu</em>&#8211; who said that: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; said: ‘None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his son, his father and all mankind.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is what the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> – brought, information about Allaah, the commands relating to what Allaah loves and is pleased with and prohibitions of what Allaah dislikes and rejects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the slave of Allaah follows what Allaah commands and keeps away from what Allaah prohibits, even if that opposes his desire, then he is a true believer. So what is the case if he desires nothingother than this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a hadeeth: ‘The strongest part of <em>al-Eemaan</em> is loving and hating for the sake of Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbas <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> said: ‘Whoever loves for the sake of Allaah, hates for the sake of Allaah, is loyal for the sake of Allaah and has enmity for the sake of Allaah then he obtains the alliance of Allaah due to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has become common amongst the people today is a brotherhood based upon the affairs of the <em>Dunya</em>, which does not benefit its people in anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hasan al-Basri and other than him from the Salaf mention that: ‘There were a people who claimed the love of Allaah -Azza wa Jal – so Allaah tried them with this <em>Aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad to mankind): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Qur’aan and the <em>Sunnah</em>), Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins. And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’ Say (O Muhammad): ‘Obey Allaah and the Messenger.’ But if they turn away, then Allaah does not like the disbelievers. &gt;&gt; [Aali-Imraan: 31-32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari <em>-Rahim</em><em>ah</em><em>ullaah-</em> said: Muhammad bin Sinaan narrated to us that Faleeh said that Hilaal bin ‘Alee narrated to us on the authority of ‘Atta bin Yassar on the authority of Abu Huraira <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; said: ‘Everyone from my Ummah will enter Paradise, except the one who refuses to enter.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They asked: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, who would refuse?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Whoever obeys me enters Paradise and whoever disobeys me has refused to enter.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari said Muhammad bin Ubadah informed us that Yazeed narrated to us that Saleem – and he praised him – narrated to us that Sa’eed bin Meena narrated to us – or I heard – Jaabir bin Abdullaah say: ‘Some angels came to the Prophet while he was sleeping. Some of them said: ‘He is sleeping.’ Others said: ‘His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they said: ‘There is an example for this companion of yours.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them said: ‘Then set forth an example for him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them said: ‘He is sleeping.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The others said: ‘His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they said: ‘His example is of a man who built a house then offered a banquet therein and sent an inviter (messenger) to invite the people. So whoever accepted the invitation of the inviter, entered the house and ate of the banquet and whoever did not accept the invitation of the inviter, did not enter the house nor did he eat of the banquet.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Angels said: ‘Interpret this example to him so that he may understand it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them said: ‘He is sleeping.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The others said; ‘His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they said: ‘The house stands for Paradise and the caller is Muhammad; whoever obeys Muhammad, obeys Allah; and whoever disobeys Muhammad, disobeys Allah. Muhammad distinguished between the people (i.e. through his message the good is distinguished from the bad and the believers from the disbelievers).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here it should be known that the testification <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> is not complete except with the testification that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It should also be known that loving Allaah –Azza wa Jal – cannot be complete except by loving what He loves and disliking what He dislikes. There is no way to knowing what Allaah – Ta’ala- loves and is pleased with or what He dislikes and rejects except by following what the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; ordered and keeping away from what he prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So loving Allaah necessitates loving the Messenger of Allaah, believing in him and following him. This is why loving Allaah is connected to loving the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; in many places in the Qur’aan, such as the saying of Allaah -Azza wa Jal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your kindred, the wealth that you have gained, the commerce in which you fear a decline and the dwellings in which you delight … are dearer to you than Allaah and His Messenger and striving hard and fighting in His Cause, then wait until Allaah brings about His Decision (torment). And Allaah guides not the people who are <em>Al-Fâsiqûn </em>(the rebellious, disobedient to Allaah). &gt;&gt; [Tawbah: 24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other <em>Aayaat</em> like this one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who  follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By Hafidh al-Hakami <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Taken from his book ‘Ma’arij al-Qabool’</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words in the testification <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> are words which are the path to the success of entry into Paradise and salvation from the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> said: &lt;&lt; And whoever is removed away from the Fire and admitted to Paradise, he indeed is successful. &gt;&gt; [Al-Imraan:  185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the way and path to happiness in the two worlds which cannot be reached except by these words.  It is with this statement that Allaah sent His Messengers and with it, He revealed His Books. The <em>Dunya</em> and the Hereafter, Paradise and Hell-Fire were created for this statement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Happiness and wretchedness are directly related to this testification. Due to it, the records of deeds will be taken either to the right or the left and the scale will be either heavy or light.  By it is being saved from the Fire after its advent whilst not adhering to <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> is remaining in the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to it, Allaah took the covenant, because of it is recompense and accountability and regarding it, will be the questioning on the Day of Meeting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em> says: &lt;&lt; So, by your Lord, We shall certainly call all of them to account. For all that they used to do. &gt;&gt; [Al-Hijr: 92-93]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em> said : &lt;&lt; Then surely, We shall question those (people) to whom it (the Book) was sent and verily, We shall question the Messengers. &gt;&gt; [A’raaf: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em> questioning those to whom <em>‘La</em><em> ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> was sent, on the Day of Judgement, then from that is Hissaying- &lt;&lt; And (remember) the Day (Allaah) will call to them and say: ‘What answer gave you to the Messengers?’&gt;&gt; [Qasas: 65] along with the preceding, following and other <em>Aayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah questioning the Messengers then from that is the saying of Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em> &lt;&lt; On the Day when Allaah will gather the Messengers together and say to them: ‘What was the response you received (from men to your teaching)? They will say: ‘We have no knowledge, verily, only You are the All-­Knower of all that is hidden (or unseen, etc.).’&gt;&gt; [al-Mai’dah:109] and there are other similar<em>Aayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the greatest of blessings from Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal–</em> that Heblessed His slaves and guided them to <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’.</em>  This is why Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> mentioned it in Soorah an-Nahl, the Soorah of blessings, so He proceeded with it before every other blessing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &lt;&lt;He sends down the angels with inspiration of His Command to whom of His slaves He pleases (saying): Warn mankind that <em>Lâ ilâha illa Ana </em>(none has the right to be worshipped but I), so fear Me (by abstaining from sins and evil deeds). &gt;&gt; [Nahl: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the statement of testification and the key to the land of happiness.  It is the foundation of the <em>Deen</em> and its foundingprinciple, the head of the affair, the trunk of its tree and the pillar of its canopy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rest of the pillars and obligations of the <em>Deen</em> extend and branchout from this testification.  Its completion is restricted to adhering to its meaning and performing what it requires.  It is the strong handhold that will never break regarding which Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em>said: &lt;&lt; Whoever disbelieves in <em>Tâghût </em>(false gods) and believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 256]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa’eed bin Jubayr and Dhihaak said that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It is the contract which Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> mentioned when he said: &lt;&lt;None shall have the power of intercession, but such a one as has received permission (or promise) from the Most Beneficent (Allaah). &gt;&gt; [Maryam: 87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullaah ibn Abbas <em>&#8211;</em><em>radiAllaah </em><em>anhuma-</em> said: ‘It is the testification of <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em>, renouncing any capability or strength for other than Allaah and not hoping except in Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em> is <em>al-Husna</em> (the best – i.e. its meaning as stated byAllaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> when He said: &lt;&lt;As for him who gives (in charity), keeps his duty to Allaah and fears Him, And believes in <em>Al-Husna.</em> We will make smooth for him the path of ease (goodness). &gt;&gt; [Layl: 5-7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also mentioned by Abu AbdurRahman as-Sulamee, Dhihaak and was narrated by ‘Ateeyah on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the statement of truth which Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> mentionedwhen He <em>–Ta’ala</em> said: &lt;&lt; except those who bear witness to the truth (i.e. believed in the Oneness of Allaah, and obeyed His Orders), and they know (the facts about the Oneness of Allaah). &gt;&gt;[Zukhruf :86]  as stated by al-Baghawi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the statement of <em>Taqwaa</em> (piety) as Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em>mentioned when He said: &lt;&lt; and made them stick to the word of piety (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah) and they were well entitled to it and worthy of it. &gt;&gt; [Fath: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was mentioned by Ibn Jareer and Abdullaah bin Ahmad, byTirmidhi with <em>‘asaaneed</em> (chains) up to Ubayy bin Ka’ab <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em>on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the statement which is firmly-fixed as Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em>mentions when He says: &lt;&lt;Allaah will keep firm those who believe with the word that stands firm in this world (i.e. they will keep on worshipping Allaah Alone and none else) and in the Hereafter. &gt;&gt;[Ibraheem: 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of al-Bara bin ‘Aazib <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the good statement (<em>kalimah Tayyibah</em>) which was previously made a solid example as Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em> says: &lt;&lt;Do you not see how Allaah sets forth a parable? – A goodly word as a goodly tree, whose root is firmly fixed and its branches (reach) to the sky (i.e. very high). &gt;&gt; [Ibraheem: 24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what was mentioned by ‘Alee bin Talha on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The foundation of this statement <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em><em>’</em> is firmly fixed in a believer’s heart, its branches are righteous actions which ascend to the sky &#8211; to Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what was mentioned by Dhihaak, Sa’eed bin Jubair, Ikrima’, Mujahid and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the goodness which Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal–</em> mentions when He says: &lt;&lt;Whoever brings a good deed shall have ten times the like thereof &gt;&gt; [An’aam: 160]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>–Ta’ala–</em> said: &lt;&lt;Whoever brings a good deed (i.e. Belief in the Oneness of Allaah along with every deed of righteousness), will have better than its worth and they will be safe from the terror on that Day. &gt;&gt; [Naml: 89]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was mentioned by Zain al-Abideen and Ibraheem an-Nakha’aee and it is ascribed to the Messenger on the authority of Abee Dharr <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> that he said: ‘It is the best of righteous deeds.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement <em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em><em>’</em> wipes out sins and mistakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the highest description which Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> mentions when He says: &lt;&lt; His is the highest description (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but He and there is nothing comparable unto Him) in the heavens and in the earth.&gt;&gt; [Room: 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As was mentioned by Qatadah and Muhammad bin Jareer, also by Malik on the authority of Muhammad bin al-Munkadir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the means for success as is mentioned in Saheeh Muslim thatwhen the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> heard the <em>Mu’adhin</em> (the caller to the prayer) saying: <em>‘Ashhadu all</em><em>a ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em><em>’</em> (I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah’) he <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘You have exited the fire.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ubadah bin Saamitt <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> saying: ‘Whoever testifies that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah then Allaah prohibits the Fire for him.’ [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the hadeeth of intercession: ‘Take out from the Fire whoever said<em>‘</em><em>La ilaha ‘illa Allaah</em><em>’</em> and had in his heart the like of an atom’s worth of <em>Eemaan</em>.’[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> is the means of entering into Paradise as is mentioned in Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of Ubadah bin Saamitt <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> who said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘Whoever says <em>‘Ashhadu all</em><em>a ilaha ‘illa Allaah wahdahu la shareeka lahu wa anna Muhammadan Abduhu wa Rasooluhu</em> (I testify thatthere is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone and He has no partners and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger’) and that Isa is the slave of Allaah and the son of Allaah’s female slave, he was created by a word which was sent to Maryam and he is a command from Him, that Paradise is true and the Fire is true’, then Allaah will enter him into Paradise from whichever of the eight doors of Paradise he chooses.’[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: ‘Allaah enters him into Paradise with what he has of actions.’[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the best thing with which Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> is rememberedand the heaviest thing on the slave of Allaah’s scale on the Day of Judgement as mentioned in ‘Musnad’ on the authority of Abdullaah bin Amr <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> ‘When death was approaching the Prophet of Allaah, Nooh &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> he said to his son: I will narrate to you my bequest; I command you with two things and prohibit you from two things.  I command you with <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> (‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah)<strong><em>,</em></strong> if the seven heavens and the seven earths were placed upon one scale and <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em>was placed on the other, then <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em>  would be heavier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the seven heavens and the seven earths were a closed circle then<em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> would be able to break it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second thing I command you with is <em>Subhana Allaahi wa bihamdihi</em> (Far is Allaah from imperfection and praise is for Him), since it is a supplication for everything and by it, the creation is given its provision.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I prohibit you from <em>Shirk</em> and pride. (The narrator said: I asked or someone asked) : O Messenger of Allaah as for <em>Shirk</em> then we know about it, but what is pride?  Is it that one of us has sandals with two good straps?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger answered: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked again: Is it that one of us has companions and they sit with him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger again answered: No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone asked: O Messenger of Allaah, what is pride?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Ridiculing the truth and belittling and reviling the people.’[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in ‘Musnad’ on the authority of Abdullaah bin Amr <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em>from the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>: ‘Musa <em>–alayhi Sallam-</em> said: ‘O Lord teach me something by which I can remember You and supplicate to You.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: O Musa say <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Musa said: O Lord everyone of Your slaves says this.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: O Musa say <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’ </em>but I want something specific for me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: O Musa if the seven heavens and the seven earths and what is in them other than Me were placed on a scale and <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> was placed on the scale then <em>‘La ilaha ‘illa Allaah’</em> wouldoutweigh them.’[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Tirmidhi, Nisa’ee and in Musnad on the authority of Abdullaah bin Amr bin al-Aas <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> who said I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed Allaah will single out a man from my <em>Ummah</em> in front of all the people on the Day of Judgement.  Ninety-nine scrolls will be unrolled for him; every scroll will stretch as far as the eye can see.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah will say: Do you deny anything of this?  Did the Angelsrecording your deeds oppress you?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the man will say: No, my Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah will say: Do you have an excuse?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man will say: No, my Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah will say: Yes, indeed, We have a good deed for you and indeed, there will be no oppression upon you today.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then a card will be brought forth and in it will be: ‘I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah will say: Bring your bad deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man will say: What is this card compared with these scrolls?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah will say: Indeed, you will not be oppressed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet continued: The scrolls will be put on one side of the scales and the card will be put on the other side, the scrolls will be light and the card will be heavy, there can be nothing more heavythan the name of Allaah.’[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>
