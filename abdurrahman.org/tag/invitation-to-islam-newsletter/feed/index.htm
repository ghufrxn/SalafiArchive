										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[From the &#8216;Invitation to Islam&#8217; Newsletter, Issue 5, October 1998]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bomb goes off in a marketplace in Jerusalem. A suicide bomber launches himself into a bus full of women and children in Tel Aviv. Foreign tourists get massacred at a holiday resort in Luxor, Egypt. Villages upon villages get annihilated in Algeria. The list of events worldwide which have come to symbolise the &#8216;Islamic terror&#8217; are endless. From the times in the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s when Pan Am and TWA aeroplanes would be highjacked, to the mid 80&#8217;s in war torn Lebanon where Americans and Europeans would be held as hostages for years; all such incidents have come to be identified with the religion of Islam. Such incidents from past and present have undoubtedly affected Muslims worldwide and more so in the West. Any Muslim, who wants to practice his/her religion and expresses the pious desire to live under the banner of Islam, is labelled a fundamentalist or extremist. Any Muslim man who walks down a busy street in London or Paris (and Paris moreso) with a beard and a scarf on his head, is looked upon as being a terrorist who&#8217;s probably got an AK47 stashed somewhere on his person. Muslim women who are veiled can&#8217;t go anywhere in the Western world without being taunted as being oppressed or being mad (for covering up). However, are such beliefs and opinions about Islam really justified?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Exploding the myth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the many short comings which has arisen in the West, is judging Islam by the conduct of a minority of its people. By doing this, segments of Western society have deliberately played off the desperate actions of many Muslims, and have given it the name of Islam. Such behaviour is clearly not objective and seeks to distort the reality of Islam. For if such a thing was done Judge a religion by the conduct of its people) then we too could say that all Christianity is about is child molesting and homosexuality [1] whilst Hinduism was all about looting and breaking up mosques [2]. Generalising in such a manner is not seen as being objective, yet we find that the Western world is foremost in propagating this outlook on Islam. So what is the reality of Islam? How does one dispel the myths which have been created and spread so viciously? The only way to examine Islam is to simply examine its belief system. Look at its sources, the Qur&#8217;an and Sunna, and see what they have to say. This is the way to find the truth about what Islam says about terror, terrorism and terrorists. One who is sincerely searching for the truth, will do it no other way. The very name Islam comes from the Arabic root word &#8216;salama&#8217; which means peace. Islam is a religion which is based upon achieving peace through the submission to the will of Allaah. Thus, by this very simple linguistic definition, one can ascertain as to what the nature of this religion is. If such a religion is based on the notion of peace, then how is it that so many acts done by its adherents are contrary to peace? The answer is simple. Such actions, if not sanctioned by the religion, have no place with it. They are not Islamic and should not be thought of as Islamic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Jihad </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word jihad sends shivers down the spines of many Westerners. They readily equate this term with violence and oppression. However, it must be said that the meaning of jihad, as a &#8216;holy war&#8217;, is something which is totally foreign and not from Islam. If anything, such a description belongs more so to Christianity and its adherents. It was terms like this which were used to justify the slaughter and pillage of towns and cities during the crusades by the Christians. By simply looking into the sources of Islam, one is able to know that the true meaning of jihad is to <i>strive/make effort in the way of Allaah. </i>Thus striving in the way of Allaah can be both peaceful and physical. The Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;The best jihad is (by) the one who strives against his own self for Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic&#8221; [3]. </i>In the Qur&#8217;an, Allaah also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>So obey not the disbelievers, but make a great jihad </b>(effort)<b> against them </b>(by preaching)<b> with it</b> (the Qur&#8217;an)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Furqan 25:52).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By controlling and fighting against ones desires, the Muslims can then also physically exert themselves in the path of Allaah. It is this physical or combative jihad which receives so much criticism. Because of the sheer ignorance of this type of jihad Islam is regarded as terror, and Muslims are regarded as terrorists. However, the very purpose of this physical jihad is to raise the word of Allaah uppermost. By doing this, it liberates and emancipates all those who are crying out for freedom all over the world. If the likes of the pacifists of this world had their way, then the world would indeed be full of anarchy and mischief. The combative jihad seeks to correct this as Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And if Allaah did not check one set of people by means of another, the Earth would be full of mischief. But Allaah is full of bounty to the worlds</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:251).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such would be the corruption on this Earth if there had never been a combative jihad that Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>For had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques, wherein the name of Allaah is mentioned much, would surely have been pulled down. Indeed Allaah will help those who help His</b> (cause). <b>Truly Allaah is All strong, All mighty</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Hajj 22:40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This combative jihad being both defensive and offensive, is something which is commanded by Allaah upon the Muslims. Through this command the oppressed and weak are rescued from the tyranny of the world:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And what is the matter with you that you do not fight in the cause of Allaah and for those weak, ill treated and oppressed among men, women and children whose only cry is; &#8216;Our Lord, rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors and raise for us from you one who will protect and raise for us from you one who will help</b>&#8220;&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah An-Nisa 4:75).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who knows the early history of Islam, will know that all those nations and empires which came under the fold of Islam were indeed previously oppressed. When the companions of the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) went out for the offensive jihad against the Egyptians, the Persians and the Romans, we find that the people did not resist against them at all. Rather, they accepted Islam on such a scale, that it is inconceivable that the jihad of Islam could be anything other then a liberation for these people; a liberation from centuries of tyranny. In fact, with the Byzantine Egyptians and the people of Spain, the Muslims were even beckoned to come and liberate these lands from the oppression of their kings. This is the glorious track record of the Muslim jihad Compare this with the brutal track record of warfare in the Western world over the centuries. From the crusades against the Muslims to the days of colonial warfare, the Western world has killed, destroyed and plundered everything which has come in its way. Even today this merciless killing goes on by the Western nations. While claiming to be about world peace and security, Western nations are ready to bomb innocent civilians at the drop of a hat. The classic example of this is the recent bombings of Sudan and Afghanistan. Whilst claiming that Sudan and Afghanistan were havens for Islamic terrorists, the bombings of these two nations could not have come at a better time for the American president Bill Clinton. The destruction of innocent lives which were a result of these bombings clearly seem to have been an attempt by Clinton to avert attention away from his sexual misdemeanours; [4] something which he so often gets caught up in. Without doubt this was the reason for such terror from the American military upon innocent people. This is the same American military which claims to enter the worlds trouble spots under the guise of being peace keepers. But</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>…</b> <b>when it is said to them; &#8216;Make not mischief on the Earth&#8217;, they say; &#8216;We are only peace makers&#8217;. Indeed they are the ones who make mischief, but they perceive it not</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:11-12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The hypocrisy of the West is indeed astounding. </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By looking at the rules and regulations of this combative jihad it will be clear to any sincere person that this is indeed the religion of truth. When fighting an unjust enemy, no matter how unjust they are, it is forbidden by Islam that their retreating forces are mutilated, tortured or slaughtered. The treacherous violation of treaties and carrying out assassinations after a cease fire, are also prohibited. Allaah says in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>And fight in the way of Allaah those who fight you. But do not transgress the limits. Truly Allaah loves not the transgressors</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:190).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not transgressing the limits means not to kill women and children, for the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) <i>&#8220;forbade the killing of women and children</i>&#8221; [5]. Not transgressing the limits means that the elderly, the sick, monks, worshippers and hired labourers are not attacked. Not transgressing the limits means not killing animals wantonly, burning crops and vegetation, polluting waters and destroying homes, monasteries, churches and synagogues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>Allaah does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion, nor drove you out of your homes. Indeed, Allaah loves those who deal with equity</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Mumtahinah 60:8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After reading such passages from the Qur&#8217;an and knowing about what Islam commands and prohibits in jihad, the rules of warfare are given a new meaning; a meaning of justice. How sad it is then, that whilst Islam is condemned for striking terror into the hearts of the people, the likes of the Serbs, the Indian army in Kashmir and the Israeli soldiers in Palestine are left untarnished for the atrocities they have committed in the name of warfare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what about suicide bombing, is this too a part of jihad in Allaah&#8217;s path? From what has already been stated above, it can be deduced that this is not from the religion. However, unfortunately many Muslims have taken suicide bombing as being a virtuous act by which one receives reward. This could not be further from the truth. The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;Those who go to extremes are destroyed&#8221; </i>[6]. Suicide bombing is undoubtedly an extremity which has reached the ranks of the Muslims. In the rules of warfare, we find no sanction for such an act from the behaviour and words of the Prophet Muhammed (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) and his companions. Unfortunately, today (some misguided) Muslims believe that such acts are paving the way for an Islamic revival and a return to the rule of Islam&#8217;s glorious law. However, we fail to bear in mind that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;Do not be delighted by the action of anyone, until you see how he ends up&#8221;</i> [7]. So, for example what is the end of a suicide bomber in Palestine?, a leg here, an arm there. Massive retaliation by the Israeli&#8217;s in the West Bank and Gaza. More Muslims killed and persecuted. How can we be delighted with such an end? What really hammers the final nail in the coffin of this act, is that it is suicide; something which is clearly forbidden in Islam. The Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;He who kills himself with anything, Allaah will torment him with that in the fire of Hell&#8221; </i>[8]. Some are under the misconception that by killing oneself for an Islamic cause, one commits an act which deserves Paradise. Once when a man killed himself, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;He is a dweller of the Fire&#8221;. </i>When the people were surprised at this, the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) said: <i>&#8220;A person performs the deeds which to the people appears to be the deeds befitting the dweller of Paradise, but he is in fact one of the dwellers of the Fire&#8221; </i>[9]. The taking of ones life which Allaah has given as a trust to the human, is a great sin. Likewise the taking of other lives (which is so often the case with suicide bombing) is also forbidden, as human life is indeed precious:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>&#8230;If anyone killed a person not in retaliation for murder or to spread mischief in the land, it would be as if he killed the whole of mankind. And (likewise) if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the whole of mankind</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Maaida 5:32).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, all other types of extremities such as hostage taking, hijacking and planting bombs in public places, are clearly forbidden in Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Media</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By going through the teachings of Islam, it is clear that such a religion has only come to benefit mankind -not to destroy it. So why is there so much hatred for this noble religion in the West? The answer is simple, the media. It is the Jewish influenced media of the West which has portrayed Islam to be something that it is not. During the 70&#8217;s and 80&#8217;s when the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organisation) were carrying out daring highjacks on the worlds airways, the media in the West portrayed it as being Islamic. When the Shi&#8217;ite suicide bombers of the 80&#8217;s were causing so much havoc in the Lebanon and in the Gulf region, the media in the West portrayed it as a part of Islam. However, it is known by the heads of the media that the likes of the PLO were not an Islamic organisation, and that according to Islam, Shi&#8217;ites are outside the fold of Islam [10]. Yet such facts are never portrayed by a media which seeks to cover the truth of this religion. A number of years ago, when the Oklahoma City bomb went off, a headline in one of the newspapers, &#8216;The Today&#8217; [11], summed up this attitude. With a picture of a fire fighter holding a dead child in his arms, the headline read: <b>&#8220;In The Name of Islam&#8221; </b>Time has of course proven that this bigoted assumption was incorrect, as Timothy McVeigh, a right wing radical now faces the death penalty for the crime [12]. Likewise the bombs which went off in the Paris metro in 1995, were also blamed on Muslim fanatics. It has now emerged that the Algerian secret service who having routinely bribed many European journalists and MPs, were actually behind it. The desire to throw a veil over Islam is immense by these people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>They intend to put out the light of Allaah with their mouths, but Allaah will complete His light even though the disbelievers hate</b> (it)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah As-Saff 61:8).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whilst trying to destroy Islam through this instrument of the media, the Jews clearly try to portray an image of themselves as being the oppressed people. Every year, we are reminded as to how many Jews perished under the Nazis in World War II. We are made to feel sorry for these same people who have gone on to commit so many crimes upon the Palestinian people. Some may say that this is a racist and biased viewpoint. But we say; If this media was not run and orchestrated by the Jews and was truly neutral, then why are Menachem Begin and Yitzhak Shamir, two former Israeli prime ministers, not held aloft as being terrorists? Anyone who knows about the history of the Palestinian occupation will tell you that these two men were members of the Stem Gang and Irgun, two notorious Jewish terror groups who killed many innocent people [13]. If this media was truly impartial, then why does it not tell about the extent of the Israeli bombardment and illegal occupation of Southern Lebanon and its people? [14] And if this media really had nothing against the religion of Allaah, then why does it not inform the people that every day hundreds are entering the religion of Islam? Such things will never be highlighted in the Western media, simply because to do so would be against their very interests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With such immense pressure against it, it is indeed a blessing from Allaah that Islam goes from strength to strength. It continues to grow faster then any other religion in the Western world, conquering the hearts and minds of thousands. All this should not even surprise us though, for Allaah has promised us that this religion will prevail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>It is He who has sent His Messenger with the guidance and the religion of truth, so that He may make it victorious over all other religions, even though the disbelievers detest it</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah As-Saff 61:9).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a must that humanity comes towards the religion of Islam. Without it, we will continue to slip down the road of inequity and darkness. With it we can establish a society of justice and peace. Religion of terror? &#8230; no. The way forward? &#8230; yes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<b>There is no compulsion in religion. The right path has indeed become distinct from the wrong. So whoever rejects false worship and believes in Allaah, then he has grasped the most trustworthy handhold that will never break. And Allaah is All Hearing, All Knowing</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Baqarah 2:256)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes</b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>[Article taken from ‘Invitation to Islam’ newsletter, September 1997]</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amidst the hustle and bustle of a teeming metropolis, a solitary figure traverses. She moves steadily in her black garment which shields her against the tyranny of this life. Whilst others around her rush frantically, she move with tranquillity and ease. The peace which she achieves beneath this veil of hers, is immense. It is a liberation beyond measure. Is this a princess of royal blood? No. Is she a head of state? No. So who is this woman of serenity? This is a woman of Hijaab. A woman amongst many women. A Muslim Woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The site of a woman covering from top to bottom, is not so rare anymore in the major cities of the West. For many Westerners it represents the oppression which Islam imposes upon women. For Muslims however, it is the realisation that Islam will eventually reach every corner of this planet. This is not surprising, considering that Islam is the fastest growing religion on Earth. What is surprising, for Westerners, is that 7 out of 10 <b>(70%)</b> people who become Muslim are Women! It is these same women who then go on to <b>willingly</b> observe the Hijab without coercion or force. The women of Hijaab in the cities of London, Paris, New York etc, are not all immigrants who have just stepped off the boat, as many people think. Rather, many of them tend to be women of high intellect and education. Women who have experienced the bitterness of western oppression. Women of diverse nationalities and races, who are brought together as one, under the banner of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>An Islaamic Duty</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ever since the appearance of Hijaab in the west, there has been a constant crusade against this noble act. The hypocrisy[1] of the Western media has been evident for many years now, through its constant attacks on Islam and Hijaab. Despite these attempts, women in Hijaab are still on the increase. Thus, a new crusade had to be launched by the advocates of &#8220;liberation&#8221; and &#8220;freedom&#8221;. For a while now, many Western critics have insisted that the Hijaab has nothing to do with Islaam. They claim that it is a cultural practice and not a religious one. This has been broadcast in the Western media with the aid of its puppets, the modernist Muslims. People such as Dr Zaki Badawi[2], have pushed this erroneous view for a number of years now. This has led to much confusion amongst ignorant Muslims, and many Muslim women are being led into depriving themselves of this great benefit. So what is the reality behind this issue? Is the Hijaab obligatory?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hijab is an Arabic word which literally means a cover, a screen or a partition. Islamically it refers to the dress code of the Muslim woman. In answering the above question, as Muslims we unashamedly say, <b>Yes!</b>, the Hijaab <b>IS OBLIGATORY!!</b> The proofs for this obligation are many, but due to lack of space we will only quote two here. In the Qur’an Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and guard their modesty, and not to display their adornment except that which appears ordinarily thereof, and to draw their veils over their necks and bosoms..&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sura An-Noor 24:31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the words &#8220;..except that which appears ordinarily thereof..&#8221;, then the scholars of Islam have explained that these words refer to the hands and face of a woman. This is supported by the hadith of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) : <i>&#8220;Aisha reported that Asmaa, the daughter of Abu Bakr, entered into the presence of the Messenger of Allaah wearing thin transparent clothing, So the Messenger of Allaah turned away from her saying : ‘O’ Asmaa, when a women reaches the age of menstruation, it is <b>not allowed</b> that any of her should be seen except this’ – and he pointed to his face and two hands.&#8221;</i>[3] The Hijaab is therefore something which <b>MUST</b> cover the entire body of a woman, except her face and hands.[4] It is <b>NOT</b> a simple headscarf which many women wear, because a piece of cloth on the head does not conceal the parts of a woman’s body, which when exposed, are the result of much strife. Besides covering the entire body, the Hijaab also has other conditions, such as not being tight, transparent, too colourful or resembling the clothes of a man. These conditions are also proven from Islaam.[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Benefits of Hijaab</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>-Obedience-</b> Whilst other women are subjected to the pressures and slavery of modern society, the Muslim woman is truly free from this. In the west, women are expected to conform to the liberal fashions which appear daily. These fashions and expectations are often shaped by men. In this way, women become the slaves of society and man. Hijab is the liberator of this slavery. It takes women away from the obedience of man, to the obedience of the Most Perfect, Allaah. This obedience will only bring about good, because we believe that Allaah is the Most Kind and the Most Just. Slavery to the one with such characteristics, is a slavery of reward and contentment. It is not a slavery from which your fellow human (the woman) is exploited and oppressed, just because your desires and lusts run wild.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a command of Allaah, the Hijaab has united the hearts of so many. Hijaab knows no colour, nationality, race, height or weight. Through obedience to Allaah, it truly unites the women of the world. Thus, this unification has surpassed the ranks and shallowness of all female liberation movements. Christian nuns, Jews, Hindus, Sikhs, feminists, lesbians, women boxers and even female gang members, are all known to have become united under Islam and its Hijaab. It is truly a force to be reckoned with. It must be remembered that this obedience to Allaah is a voluntary act from most Muslim women. Many assume that those brought up as Muslims, have always been wearing Hijaab. However, this is not so. Many Muslim women (especially in the UK), who are Muslim by name, often know very little of Islam. When they discover its true meaning, most of them willingly adopt the Hijaab simply to obey their Creator, and not because of any external pressures.<br />
Wearing the Hijaab is no futile action. A woman may go through much trial and tribulation[6] because she has obeyed Allaah. But the fulfilment of this action will never go unnoticed, as Allaah say :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Never will I allow to be lost the actions of any of you; whether male or female&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Surah Al-Imran 3:195).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The result of these obedient actions will be an everlasting reward. A reward which all Muslim women aspire for. A reward called paradise :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whosoever does righteous actions- whether male or female, and is a believer, will enter paradise&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sura An-Nisa 4:124).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>-A Shield-</b> Allaah says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O’ Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their veils over their bodies. That is most convenient that they should be recognised and not be molested&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sura Al-Ahzab 33:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the greatest benefits of Hijaab, is the natural protection it gives to a woman. By wearing Hijaab, a woman shields herself from the rampant desires of man. By his very nature, man is a creature of intense desire. The Hijaab controls this desire and thus not only protects the woman, but also the man. Sexually motivated crimes in the west are on the increase. Rape, molestation and harassment are reaching epidemic levels. Undoubtedly the clothing of a woman has something to do with this. When women walk around with literally nothing on, some men see it as a signal to do as they please. This results in the honour of a woman being scarred for life. The Muslim woman does not have this problem. She knows that when she walks on the streets, the men will not look at her. Why? Because there is nothing for them to look at!! She feels like a princess who is shielded from the savages of her domain. Peace and security is felt beneath the veil. The woman of Hijaab does not have to reveal her body in order to gain respect. She does not have to have her ‘bits’ hanging out so that men can drool over her. If a man desires her, then it has to be for her religion and intellect. The Hijaab gives him no other choice. She is a woman who is truly shielded from the nature of man.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>-Nature-</b> The nature of a woman is fundamentally different from man. Women are more timid, gentle and caring then men. This is the reason why they have been chosen (by Allaah) to be the perfect rearers of children. The Hijaab reinforces this nature of the woman. We praise Allaah that he has ordered this Hijaab, for the world that we live in seeks to change our very nature as human beings. Men try to be women and women try to be men. People are being led into confusion by the political correctness which is so popular in our societies. Many women have jumped onto the bandwagon of feminism and lesbianism, shouting how evil and oppressive men are. But when one looks at these sad creatures, their delusion is clear. While claiming to hate men, their attire suggests otherwise. Short hair, bomber jackets and steel toecapped boots, are the vogue for these women. Their hatred for men is so much, that their very appearance resembles the enemy!! Some of these women have even gone to the extreme of growing masses of facial hair. The hideous site of these bearded ladies, is enough to put anyone off their dinner!!! Such depravity is far from natural. The Hijab on the other hand, enables the woman to stay as a woman. Rather then being a monstrosity, a woman in Hijab is like an oyster with a beautiful pearl inside it. Her femininity has stayed feminine, without being altered into masculinity. There is no doubt about it, this is a <b>TRUE WOMAN</b>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>-Honour-</b> Contrary to the tales of the media, the Hijab provides an honour for the woman like no other garment does. For many women, a dress designed by Versace[8] or Armani is all the honour they need. But the Hijaab carries far more honour then these worthless clothes. Whilst the dresses of the catwalks are designed by mere mortals, the Hijaab comes from the one who is immortal, Allaah. Through it a woman is held with the utmost respect. True Muslim men are obliged to keep their Muslim sisters away from the corruption of this world. Thus a Muslim will not allow for someone to ogle his wife, chat her up or harass her. The honour of a Muslim woman demands that this does not happen. How contrary this is to life in the west. Men in the west feel no obligation to protect women from the harms of society. This is why a man will allow his wife to be a stripper, call-girl and even a prostitute. Honour knows no place in the west. This honour will only be achieved from Islam and its Hijab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The honour of a Muslim woman is so high, that we believe that the state of a society is dependent upon its women. If the women are corrupt and immoral, then the society will be corrupt and immoral. If the women are righteous and god-fearing, then the society will be righteous and god-fearing. Women are the educators of the nation. But if they have no honour and have been corrupted, then society will be void of education and steeped in ignorance. This is the predicament of a society which rejects Hijab. This is the predicament of all Western societies, which stubbornly cling onto their depressing ways of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who seek to reject Hijab after reading this, then their loss will eventually become apparent. But those who seek to please Allaah through this action, can be sure that this good can only bring more good:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Is there any reward for good – other then goodness?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sura Ar-Rahman 55:60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes:-</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The British media is an example of this. Whilst condemning the Hijaab as oppressive, it is well known that newspapers such as The Sun and The News of the World, often display pictures of naked women. This of course, is the liberation which the West claims to give women!<br />
2. Dr Zaki Badawi is a self-styled mufti who is unfortunately seen as a public face of Islam. A number of years ago, Dr. Badawi appeared on Dutch T.V. proclaiming that Hijaab was not obligatory. This announcement caused much confusion and resulted in some women taking their Hijaab off.<br />
3. Authentic – Reported by Al-Bayhaqee.<br />
4. Even though it is not obligatory to cover the face and hands, it is without doubt recommended that the niqaab (the face veil) and/or gloves be worn. Such acts are seen as modesty and piety from the woman, and they can only bring her more reward.<br />
5. The proofs for these conditions can be found in an excellent book entitled &#8220;The Islamic ruling regarding Women’s dress, according to the Qur’an and Sunnah&#8221; by Abu Bilal Mustafa Al-Kanadi.<br />
6. Wearing Hijaab in the West can be a struggle for many women. The hypocrisy of the West is such, that it does not respect this choice which is made willingly, and subjects these women to much psychological pressure. 2 years ago, two Muslim girls were even expelled from a school in France because they wore Hijaab. Freedom has truly been given a new meaning!<br />
7. &#8220;A view through Hijaab&#8221; is an informative account of life in Hijaab. Written by Khaula Nakata, it is the experience of Hijaab as seen through the eyes of a Japanese woman who embraced Islam.<br />
8. There will be no more dresses designed by Gianni Versace!! The evils of Homosexuality ensured that this man (?) reaped the fruits of his unholy labour.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A History of Hajj (Pilgrimage)<br />
</strong>Invitation to Islam Newsletter, Issue 1, May 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajj literally means &#8216;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>to set out for a place</strong></span>&#8216;. Islamically however it refers to the annual pilgrimage that Muslims make to Makkah with the intention of performing certain religious rites in accordance with the method prescribed by the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hajj and its rites were first ordained by Allaah in the time of the Prophet lbraaheem [Abraham] (alayhis-salaam) and he was the one who was entrusted by Allaah to build the Ka&#8217;ba &#8211; the House of Allaah &#8211; along with his son Ismaa&#8217;eel [Ishmael] at Makkah. Allaah described the Ka&#8217;ba and its building as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;And remember when We showed Ibraaheem the site of the [Sacred] House [saying]: Associate not anything [in worship] with Me and purify My House for those who circumambulate it [i.e. perform tawaaf] and those who stand up for prayer and those who bow down and make prostration [in prayer etc.].&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah Al-Hajj 22:26</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>After building the Ka&#8217;ba, Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) would come to Makkah to perform Hajj every year, and after his death, this practice was continued by his son</strong></span>. However, gradually with the passage of time, both the form and the goal of the Hajj rites were changed. As idolatry spread throughout Arabia , the Ka&#8217;ba lost its purity and idols were placed inside it. Its walls became covered with poems and paintings, including one of Jesus and his mother Maryam and eventually over 360 idols came to be placed around the Ka&#8217;ba.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the Hajj period itself, the atmosphere around the sacred precincts of the Ka&#8217;ba was like a circus.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Men and women would go round the Ka&#8217;ba <strong>naked</strong>, arguing that they should present themselves before Allaah in the same condition they were born.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Their prayer became devoid of all sincere remembrance of Allaah and was instead reduced to a series of <strong>hand clapping, whistling and the blowing of horns</strong>.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Even the <strong>talbeeyah [2] was distorted</strong> by them with the following additions: <em>&#8216;No one is Your partner except one who is permitted by you. You are his Master and the Master of what he possesses&#8217;.</em></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sacrifices were also made in the name of God. However, <strong>the blood of the sacrificed animals was poured onto the walls of the Ka&#8217;ba and the flesh was hung from pillars around the Ka&#8217;ba</strong>, in the belief that Allaah demanded the flesh and blood of these animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Singing, drinking, adultery</strong> and other acts of immorality was rife amongst the pilgrims and the poetry competitions, which were held, were a major part of the whole Hajj event. In these competitions, poets would praise the bravery and splendour of their own tribesmen and tell exaggerated tales of the cowardice and miserliness of other tribes. Competitions in generosity were also staged where the chief of each tribe would set up huge cauldrons and feed the pilgrims, only so that they could become well-known for their extreme generosity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus the people had totally abandoned the teachings of their forefather and leader Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam). The House that he had made pure for the worship of Allaah alone, had been totally desecrated by the pagans and the rites which he had established were completely distorted by them. This sad state of affairs continued for nearly two and a half thousand years. But then after this long period, the time came for the supplication of Ibraaheem to be answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Our Lord! Send amongst them a Messenger of their own, who shall recite unto them your aayaat (verses) and instruct them in the book and the Wisdom and sanctify them. Verily you are the &#8216;Azeezul-Hakeem [the All-Mighty, the All-Wise].&#8221; </span>[<em>Surah Al-Baqarah 2:129</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sure enough, a man by the name of Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was born in the very city that Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) had made this supplication centuries earlier. For twenty-three years, the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) spread the message of Tawheed [true monotheism] &#8211; the same message that Ibraaheem and all the other Prophets came with &#8211; and established the law of Allaah upon the land. He expended every effort into making the word of Allaah supreme and his victory over falsehood culminated in the smashing of the idols inside the Ka&#8217;ba which once again became the universal centre for the worshippers of the one True God.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not only did the Prophet rid the Ka&#8217;ba of all its impurities, but he also reinstated all the rites of Hajj which were established by Allaah&#8217;s Permission, in the time of Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam). Specific injunctions in the Qur&#8217;aan were revealed in order to eliminate all the false rites which had become rampant in the pre-Islamic period. All indecent and shameful acts were strictly banned in Allaah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;There is to be no lewdness nor wrangles during Hajj.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Baqarah 2:197</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Competitions among poets in the exaltations of their forefathers and their tribesmen&#8217;s&#8217; achievements were all stopped. Instead, Allaah told them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;And when you have completed your rites [of Hajj] then remember Allah as you remember your forefathers; nay with a more vigorous remembrance.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Baqarah 2:200</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Competitions in generosity were also prohibited. Of course, the feeding of the poor pilgrims was still encouraged as this was done in the time of Ibraaheem (alayhis-salaam) but Allaah commanded that the slaughtering of the animals which was done for this purpose should be done seeking the pleasure of Allaah rather than fame and the praise of the people. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;So mention the name of Allaah over these animals when they are drawn up in lines. Then, when they are drawn on their sides [after the slaughter], eat thereof and feed the beggar who does not ask, and the beggar who asks.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Hajj 22:36</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the deplorable practice of spattering blood of the sacrificed animals on the walls of the Ka&#8217;ba and hanging their flesh on alters, then Allaah clearly informed them that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allaah, but it is Taqwaa (piety) from you that reaches Him.&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Hajj 22:37</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) also put a stop to the practice of circling the Ka&#8217;ba in a state of nudity and the argument that the pagans put forward to justify this ritual was sharply rebutted in Allaah&#8217;s question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;Say: Who has forbidden the adornment [i.e. clothes] given by Allaah which He has produced for His Slaves?&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:32</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another custom which was prohibited through the Qur&#8217;aan was that of setting off for Hajj without taking any provisions for the journey. In the pre-Islamic period, some people who claimed to be <strong>mutawakkiloon</strong> (those having complete trust in Allaah) would travel to perform Hajj begging food the whole journey. They considered this form of behaviour a sign of piety and an indication of how much faith they had in Allaah. However Allaah told mankind that to have sufficient provisions for the journey was one of the preconditions for making Hajj. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;And take a provision [with you] for the journey, but the best provision is at-Taqwaa (piety).&#8221;</span><strong> </strong>[<em>Surah al-Baqarah 2:197</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way, all the pre-Islamic practices, which were based in ignorance, were abolished and Hajj was once more made a model of piety, fear of Allaah, purity, simplicity and austerity. Now, when the pilgrims reached the Ka&#8217;ba, they no longer found the carnivals and the frolic and frivolity that had once occupied the minds of the pilgrims there before. Now, there was the remembrance of Allaah at every step and every action and every sacrifice was devoted to Him alone. It was this kind of Hajj that was worthy of the reward of paradise, as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <em>&#8220;The reward for an accepted Hajj is nothing less than paradise.&#8221; </em>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah grant us all the ability to visit His House and perform the Hajj in the manner of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Aameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>From the &#8216;Invitation to Islam&#8217; Newsletter, Issue 5, October 1998</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars differed as to whether it is permissible to give reward to the dead and whether that reaches them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two views:<br />
1 – That any righteous deed may be given to the dead and that (the reward) reaches them – such as reading Qur&#8217;aan, fasting, praying and other acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – That no righteous deed reaches the dead except those for which there is evidence that it reaches them. This is the more correct view. The evidence for that is the verse in which Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):<br />
&#8220;And that man can have nothing but what he does&#8221; [al-Najm 53:39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;When a man dies all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity (sadaqah jaariyah), beneficial knowledge and a righteous son who will pray for him.&#8221; Narrated by Muslim, 1631, from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The paternal uncle of the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam – Hamzah (may Allaah be pleased with him) – died,<br />
as did his wife Khadeejah and three of his daughters, but it is not narrated that he read Qur&#8217;aan for any of them, or offered a sacrifice or fasted or prayed on their behalf. No such thing has been narrated from any of the Sahaabah either. If it were prescribed, then they would have done it before us. The exceptions for which there is evidence that the reward does reach the deceased are: Hajj, &#8216;Umrah, obligatory fasts, charity and du&#8217;aa&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafiz Ibn Katheer (may Allaah have mercy on him) said: &#8221; &#8216;And that man can have nothing but what he does&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this verse al-Shaafa&#8217;i and those who followed him understood that the reward for reading Qur&#8217;aan does not reach the deceased, because it is not something that they did or earned. Hence the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) did not recommend or encourage his ummah to do that, and he did not tell them to do that through any statement or gesture. Nor is it narrated that any of the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) did that. If it were good they would have done that before us. So the acts of worship are restricted to those mentioned in the texts, and there is no room for analogy or personal opinions. With regard to du&#8217;aa&#8217; and charity, there is scholarly consensus that the reward for them reaches the deceased and that they are mentioned in sharee&#8217;ah. Tafseer Ibn Katheer, 4/258.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we assume that the reward for all righteous deeds reaches the deceased, then the best thing that can benefit the deceased is du&#8217;aa&#8217;. So why should we ignore that which the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)has encouraged us to do, and turn to other things that he did not do and that none of his companions did? All goodness is to be found in the guidance of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and his companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn Baaz</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked about giving the reward for reading Qur&#8217;aan and charity to one&#8217;s mother, whether she is alive or dead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: With regard to reading Qur&#8217;aan, the scholars differed as to whether the reward for that will reach the deceased. There are two scholarly views, the more correct of which is that it does not reach the deceased because there is no evidence to that effect. The Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam did not do that for his deceased Muslim loved ones such as his daughters who died during his lifetime, and the Sahaabah (may Allaah be pleased with them) did not do that or approve of it, as far as we know. It is better for the believer not to do that and not to read Qur&#8217;aan for the dead or the living, or to pray on their behalf, or to observe voluntary fasts on their behalf, because there is no evidence for any of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basic principle concerning acts of worship is that we do not do anything except that which is proven to be prescribed by Allaah or His Messenger sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Charity benefits both the living and the dead, according to Muslim consensus. Similarly du&#8217;aa&#8217; benefits both the living and the dead according to Muslim consensus. Undoubtedly the living benefit from charity given by them and by others, and they benefit from du&#8217;aa&#8217;. If a person makes du&#8217;aa&#8217; for his parents when they are alive, they benefit from his du&#8217;aa&#8217;, as they also benefit from charity given on their behalf when they are still alive, and from Hajj done on their behalf if they are unable to do it themselves because of old age or incurable sickness. So a person may benefit them by doing that. Hence it is narrated that a woman said to the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, Allaah&#8217;s command to perform Hajj has come when my father is an old man and cannot sit firmly in the saddle. Shall I perform Hajj on his behalf?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Perform Hajj on his behalf.&#8221; Another man came to him and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, my father is an old man and cannot perform Hajj or travel; shall I perform Hajj and &#8216;Umrah on his behalf?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Perform Hajj and &#8216;Umrah on behalf of your father.&#8221; This indicates that it is permissible to perform Hajj on behalf of one who has died or on behalf of a living man or woman who is unable to do it because of old age. So giving charity, making du&#8217;aa&#8217; and performing Hajj on behalf of one who has died or one who is unable to do it will benefit him, according to all the scholars. Similarly one may fast on behalf of a deceased person, if he owed an obligatory fast – whether as the result of a vow, as an expiation or to make up for a Ramadaan fast – because of the general meaning of the words of the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam; &#8220;Whoever dies owing a fast, his heir must observe the fast on his behalf.&#8221; Saheeh – agreed upon. And there are other ahaadeeth which say the same thing. But whoever delays Ramadaan fasts for a legitimate reason, such as sickness or travel, then dies before he is able to make them up, there is no need to fast them on his behalf or feed the poor, because he is excused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Majmoo&#8217; Fataawa wa Maqaalaat al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, 4/348.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn &#8216;Uthaymeen</strong> (may Allaah have mercy on him) was asked: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for a man to give money in charity and to share the reward for it with someone else?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: It is permissible for a person to give money in charity and intend for it to be on behalf of his father, his mother or his brother or anyone else he wants among the Muslims, because the reward is great. If charity is given sincerely for the sake of Allaah and from wealth that is acquired in a halaal manner, then the reward will be multiplied greatly, as Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The likeness of those who spend their wealth in the way of Allaah, is as the likeness of a grain (of corn); it grows seven ears, and each ear has a hundred grains. Allaah gives manifold increase to whom He wills. And Allaah is All-Sufficient for His creatures&#8217; needs, All-Knower&#8221; [al-Baqarah 2:261]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam used to slaughter a single sheep on behalf of himself and the members of his household. Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, 18/249</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the above it is clear that what you have mentioned about giving the reward of dhikr to your parents is not correct according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions, whether they are alive or deceased.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather what we advise you to do is to make a great deal of du&#8217;aa&#8217; for them and give charity on their behalf, for all goodness is in following the guidance of the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam and his noble companions. The scholars are agreed that the benefits of du&#8217;aa&#8217;, praying for forgiveness, giving charity and Hajj reach the deceased.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to du&#8217;aa&#8217; and praying for forgiveness, Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And those who came after them say: &#8216;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith'&#8221; [al-Hashr 59:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;Pray for forgiveness for your brother and ask that he be made steadfast, for now he is being questioned.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;When you offer the (funeral) prayer for the deceased, then make du&#8217;aa&#8217; sincerely for him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to charity, it was narrated in al-Saheehayn from &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah that a man said to the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam: &#8220;My mother died suddenly and she did not leave a will, but I think that if she could have spoken she would have given in charity. Will she have a reward if I give in charity on her behalf?&#8221; The Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, no. 1388; Muslim,<br />
no. 1004.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it was narrated by al-Bukhaari from Sa&#8217;d ibn &#8216;Ubaadah that his mother died when he was absent, and he said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, my mother has died when I was absent. Will it benefit her if I give in charity on her behalf?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said: &#8220;I ask you to bear witness that my garden that bears fruit is given in charity on her behalf.&#8221; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2756.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to Hajj, the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said to one who asked him about Hajj: &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that if your mother had a debt, you would pay it off for her?&#8221; She said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said: &#8220;A debt owed to Allaah is more deserving of being paid off.&#8221; Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 6699; Muslim, 1148.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the above you will know that giving charity on behalf of the deceased will benefit him and its reward will reach him. There is a da&#8217;eef (weak) hadeeth about offering prayer on behalf of the dead. Imam Muslim mentioned in his introduction to his Saheeh that &#8216;Abd-Allaah ibn al-Mubaarak regarded this hadeeth as weak, then he said: There is no difference of opinion concerning giving charity (i.e., on behalf of the dead). End quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Nawawi said: &#8220;There is no difference of opinion concerning giving charity (i.e., on behalf of the dead)&#8221; means that this hadeeth is not to be taken as evidence. But whoever wants to honour his parents, let him give charity on their behalf, for (the reward of) charity will reach the deceased and benefit them, and there is no difference of opinion among the Muslims concerning this point. This is the correct view. With regard to the report narrated by the qaadi Abu&#8217;l-Hasan al-Maawardi al-Basri al-Faqeeh al-Shaafa&#8217;i in his book al-Haawi from some of the scholars of al-kalaam, that no reward can reach the deceased after his death, this is a view that is definitely wrong and is clearly contrary to the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah and the consensus of the ummah, so no attention should be paid to it. With regard to praying and fasting on behalf of the dead, the view of al-Shaafa&#8217;i and the majority of the scholars is that the reward for that does not reach the deceased, unless it is a fast that was obligatory for the deceased, so his heir or someone to whom the heir gives permission makes it up on his behalf. Two views concerning this were narrated from al-Shaafa&#8217;i, the better known of which is that it is not valid; the more correct view according to the later Shaafa&#8217;i scholars is that it is valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to reading Qur&#8217;aan, the well-known view of the Shaafa&#8217;i madhhab is that the reward for that does not reach the deceased. Some of his companions said that its reward does reach the deceased. Some of the scholars were of the view that the reward of all acts of worship – prayer, fasting, reading Qur&#8217;aan, etc – reaches the deceased… Then al-Nawawi mentioned that the reward for du&#8217;aa&#8217;, charity and Hajj reaches the deceased, according to scholarly consensus. End quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It says in Tuhfat al-Muhtaaj (7/72): The deceased can benefit from charity given on his behalf, which includes a waqf of a Mus-haf etc, or digging a well, or planting a tree, whether he does that during his lifetime or it is done by someone else on his behalf after his death. With regard to the best ways of benefiting ones deceased loved ones, you should make a lot of du&#8217;aa&#8217; for him. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;and say: &#8216;My Lord! Bestow on them Your Mercy as they did bring me up when I was young'&#8221; [al-Isra&#8217; 17:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;When a person dies, all his good deeds come to an end except three: ongoing charity, or beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who will pray for him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to charity, the best things on which charity may be spent are jihad for the sake of Allaah, building mosques, and helping seekers of knowledge by printing books for them or giving them money that they need. And Allaah knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The religion of Islam is growing faster than any other religion in the world.&#8221; MIKE WALLACE, 60 MINUTES</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Five to 6 million strong, Muslims in America already outnumber Presbyterians, Episcopalians, and Mormons, and they are more numerous than Quakers, Unitarians, Seventh-day Adventists, Mennonites, Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, and Christian Scientists, combined. Many demographers say Islam has overtaken Judaism as the country&#8217;s second-most commonly practiced religion; others say it is in the passing lane.&#8221; JOHAN BLANK, USNEWS (7/20/98)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In fact, religion experts say Islam is the second-largest religion in the United States&#8230; Islam has 5 million to 6 million members, followed by Judaism, with approximately 4.5 million&#8230;.. And Islam is believed to be fastest-growing religion in the country, with half its expansion coming from new immigrants and the other half from conversions.&#8221; By ELSA C. ARNETT Knight-Ridder News Service</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor Keith Moore, one of the world’s prominent scientists of anatomy and embryology. University of Toronto, Canada. &#8220;It has been a great pleasure for me to help clarify statements in the Qur’an about human development. It is clear to me that these statements must have come to Muhammad from God, or &#8216;Allah&#8217;, because almost all of this knowledge was not discovered until many centuries later. This proves to me that Muhammad must have been a messenger of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;But Islam has a still further service to render to the cause of humanity. It stands after all nearer to the real East than Europe does, and it possesses a magnificent tradition of inter-racial understanding and cooperation. No other society has such a record of success uniting in an equality of status, of opportunity, and of endeavours so many and so various races of mankind . . . Islam has still the power to reconcile apparently irreconcilable elements of race and tradition. If ever the opposition of the great societies of East and West is to be replaced by cooperation, the mediation of Islam is an indispensable condition. In its hands lies very largely the solution of the problem with which Europe is faced in its relation with East. If they unite, the hope of a peaceful issue is immeasurably enhanced. But if Europe, by rejecting the cooperation of Islam, throws it into the arms of its rivals, the issue can only be disastrous for both.&#8221; &#8211;H.A.R. Gibb, WHITHER ISLAM, London, 1932, p. 379.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It (Islam) replaced monkishness by manliness. It gives hope to the slave, brotherhood to mankind, and recognition of the fundamental facts of human nature.&#8221; &#8211;Canon Taylor, Paper read before the Church Congress at Walverhamton, Oct. 7, 1887; Quoted by Arnoud in THE PREACHING OF ISLAM, pp. 71-72.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The founder of twenty terrestrial empires and of one spiritual empire, that is Muhammed. As regards all standards by which human greatness may be measured, we may well ask, is there any man greater than he? &#8221; Lamartine, Historie de la Turquie, Paris 1854, Vol. 11 pp. 276-2727</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If a man like Muhammed were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world, he would succeed in solving its problems that would bring it the much needed peace and happiness.&#8221; George Bernard Shaw</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;How, for instance, can any other appeal stand against that of the Moslem who, in approaching the pagan, says to him, however obscure or degraded he may be &#8216;Embrace the faith, and you are at once equal and a brother.&#8217; Islam knows no color line.&#8221; (S. S. Leeder, VEILED MYSTERIES OF EGYPT)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor William W. Hay is one of the best known marine scientists in the United States for satellite photography and emote-sensing techniques. Professor Hay replied: I find it very interesting that this sort of information is in the ancient scripture of the Holy Qur’an, and I have no way of knowing where they would come from, but I think it is extremely interesting that they are there and that this work is going on to discover it, the meaning of some of the passages. Professor Hay: Well, I would think it must be the divine being!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor Yushudi Kusan: Director of the Tokyo Observatory, I can say, I am very mush impressed by finding true astronomical facts in the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor Alfred Kroner who is one of the world’s most famous geologists: &#8220;Thinking about many of these questions and thinking where Muhammad came from, he was after all a bedouin. I think it is almost impossible that he could have known about things like the common origin of the universe, because scientists have only found out within the last few years with very complicated and advanced technological methods that this is the case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr. T.V.N. Persaud is a Professor of Anatomy and Head of the Department of Anatomy, and a professor of Pediatrics and Child Health, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. He is the author or editor of 25 books, and has published over 181 scientific papers. In 1991, he received the most distinguished award presented in the field of anatomy in Canada. &#8220;It seems to me that Muhammad was a very ordinary man. He could not read or write. In fact, he was illiterate. We are talking about 1400 years ago. You have someone who was illiterate making profound pronouncement and statements and are amazingly accurate about scientific nature. I personally cannot see how this could be mere chance. There are too many accuracy’s and, like Dr. Moore, I have no difficulty in my mind in concerning that this is a divine inspiration or revelation which led him to these statements.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Joe Leigh Simpson, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the North Western University in Chicago in the United States of America. Professor Simpson said: It follows, I think, that not only is there no conflict between genetics and religion, but in fact religion can guide science by adding revelation to some traditional scientific approaches. That there exists statements in the Qur’an shown by science to be valid, which supports knowledge in the Qur’an having been derived from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor Palmer a scientist from the U.S.: We need research into the history of early Middle Eastern oral traditions to know whether in fact such historical events have been reported. If there is no such record, it strengthens the belief that Allah transmitted through Muhammad bits of his knowledge that we have only discovered for ourselves in recent times. We look forward to a continuing dialogue on the topic of science in the Qur’an in the context of geology. Thank you very much.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor Tagata Tagasone, formerly Head of the Department of Anatomy and Embryology at the University of Shiang Mai in Thailand. He is now the Dean of the College of the Medicine at the University. From my studies and from what I have learned throughout this conference, I believe that everything that has been recorded in the Qur’aan 1400 years ago must be the truth, that can be proved by the scientific means. Since the Prophet Muhammad could neither read nor write, Muhammad must be a messenger who relayed this truth which was revealed to him as an enlightenment by the One Who is an eligible Creator. This Creator must be Allah, or Allaah. Therefore, I think this is the time to say ‘Laa ilaaha illAllaah’, that there is no Allah to worship except Allah, ‘Muhammad Rasool Allaah’, Muhammad is messenger of Allah&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor Armstrong, Scientist works at NASA, &#8220;I am impressed that how remarkably some of the ancient writings seem to correspond to modern and recent Astronomy. There may well have to be something beyond what we understand as ordinary human experience to account for the writings that we have seen.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Professor Dorja Rao, &#8220;It is difficult to imagine that this type of knowledge was existing at that time, around 1400 years back. May be some of the things they have simple idea about, but do describe those things in great detail is very difficult. So, this is definitely not a simple human knowledge.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;My choice of Muhammad to lead the list of the world&#8217;s most influential persons may surprise some readers and may be questioned by others, but he was the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the religious and secular level.&#8221; &#8211;Michael H. Hart, THE 100: A RANKING OF THE MOST INFLUENTIAL PERSONS IN HISTORY, New York: Hart Publishing Company, Inc., 1978, p. 33.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;No other society has such a record of success in uniting in an equality of status, of opportunity and endeavour so many and so varied races of mankind. The great Muslim communities of Africa, India and Indonesia, perhaps also the small community in Japan, show that Islam has still the power to reconcile apparently irreconcilable elements of race and tradition. If ever the opposition of the great societies of the East and west is to be replaced by cooperation, the mediation of Islam is an indispensable condition.&#8221; (H.A.R. Gibb, WHITHER ISLAM, p. 379)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The nation&#8217;s claim to be a Christian country is about to meet its first challenge: the number of practising Muslims is set to overtake Anglican Christians&#8230;. There has also been a number of high-profile conversions to Islam from Christianity. These include Mike Tyson, the former world champion boxer; Chris Eubank, the British middleweight boxing champion, who has changed his name to Hamdan; and Cat Stevens, the pop musician, who calls himself Yousef Islam&#8230;. Prince Charles courted controversy earlier this year when he reaffirmed his claim that when he succeeds the throne, he does not wish to be the defender of only the Christian faith.&#8221; Rajeev Syal and Christopher Morgan Sunday Times (London, U.K.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I have studied him &#8211; the wonderful man &#8211; and in my opinion far from being an anti-Christ he must be called the saviour of humanity. &#8221; George Bernard Shaw in &#8220;The Genuine Islam&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad, the inspired man who founded Islam, was born about A.D. 570 into an Arabian tribe that worshipped idols. Orphaned at birth, he was always particularly solicitous of the poor and needy, the widow and the orphan, the slave and the downtrodden. At twenty, he was already a successful businessman, and soon became director of camel caravans for a wealthy widow. When he reached twenty-five, his employer, recognizing his merit, proposed marriage. Even though she was fifteen years older, he married her, and as long as she lived, remained a devoted husband. &#8220;Like almost every major prophet before him, Muhammad fought shy of serving as the transmitter of God&#8217;s word, sensing his own inadequacy. But the angel commanded &#8216;Read.&#8217; So far as we know, Muhammad was unable to read or write, but he began to dictate those inspired words which would soon revolutionize a large segment of the earth: &#8216;There is one God.&#8217; &#8220;In all things Muhammad was profoundly practical. When his beloved son Ibrahim died, an eclipse occurred, and rumours of God&#8217;s personal condolence quickly arose. Whereupon Muhammad is said to have announced, &#8216;An eclipse is a phenomenon of nature. It is foolish to attribute such things to the death or birth of a human being. &#8220;At Muhammad&#8217;s own death an attempt was made to deify him, but the man who was to become his administrative successor killed the hysteria with one of the noblest speeches in religious history: &#8216;If there are any among you who worshipped Muhammad, he is dead. But if it is God you worshipped, He lives forever.&#8221; &#8211;James A. Michener, &#8220;Islam: The Misunderstood Religion,&#8221; in READER&#8217;S DIGEST (American edition), May 1955, pp. 68-70.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Everything made so much sense. This is the beauty of the Qur&#8217;an; it asks you to reflect and reason&#8230;.When I read the Qur&#8217;an further, it talked about prayer, kindness and charity. I was not a Muslim yet, but I felt the only answer for me was the Qur&#8217;an and God had sent it to me.&#8221; Cat Stevens (Yusuf Islam), former British pop star.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad was the soul of kindness, and his influence was felt and never forgotten by those around him.&#8221; Diwan Chand Sharma, The Prophets of the East, Calcutta 1935, p. l 22.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;People like Pasteur and Salk are leaders in the first sense. People like Gandhi and Confucius, on one hand, and Alexander, Caesar and Hitler on the other, are leaders in the second and perhaps the third sense. Jesus and Buddha belong in the third category alone. Perhaps the greatest leader of all times was Mohammed, who combined all three functions. To a lesser degree, Moses did the same.&#8221; Professor Jules Masserman</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmed Versi, editor of the weekly Muslim News, said the growth of Islam has been constant: &#8220;The younger generation of Muslims that I have encountered is becoming more aware of its Muslim identity and is therefore practising its faith with vigour.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The extinction of race consciousness as between Muslims is one of the outstanding achievements of Islam and in the contemporary world there is, as it happens, a crying need for the propagation of this Islamic virtue&#8230;&#8221; (A.J. Toynbee, CIVILIZATION ON TRIAL, New York, p. 205)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Sense of justice is one of the most wonderful ideals of Islam, because as I read in the Qur&#8217;an I find those dynamic principles of life, not mystic but practical ethics for the daily conduct of life suited to the whole world.&#8221; &#8211;Lectures on &#8220;The Ideals of Islam;&#8221; see SPEECHES AND WRITINGS OF SAROJINI NAIDU, Madras, 1918, p. 167.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;History makes it clear however, that the legend of fanatical Muslims sweeping through the world and forcing Islam at the point of the sword upon conquered races is one of the most fantastically absurd myths that historians have ever repeated.&#8221; &#8211;De Lacy O&#8217;Leary, ISLAM AT THE CROSSROADS, London, 1923, p. 8.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Muslim community is much more aware of its religion and the use that religion plays within its community.&#8221; Dr Peter Brierley, executive director of the Christian Research Association, a London-based charity</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I have always held the religion of Muhammad in high estimation because of its wonderful vitality. It is the only religion which appears to me to possess that assimilating capacity to the changing phase of existence which can make itself appeal to every age. I have studied him &#8211; the wonderful man and in my opinion for from being an anti-Christ, he must be called the Saviour of Humanity. I believe that if a man like him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world, he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring it the much needed peace and happiness: I have prophesied about the faith of Muhammad that it would be acceptable to the Europe of tomorrow as it is beginning to be acceptable to the Europe of today.&#8221; &#8211;G.B. Shaw, THE GENUINE ISLAM, Vol. 1, No. 81936.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A growing number of Muslims in America, more than 40 percent are African-American,&#8221; Charles Bierbauer, from the Senior Washington Correspondent</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The extinction of race consciousness as between Muslims is one of the outstanding achievements of Islam, and in the contemporary world there is, as it happens, a crying need for the propagation of this Islamic virtue.&#8221; &#8211;A.J. Toynbee, CIVILIZATION ON TRIAL, New York, 1948, p. 205.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The rise of Islam is perhaps the most amazing event in human history. Springing from a land and a people like previously negligible, Islam spread within a century over half the earth, shattering great empires, overthrowing long established religions, remoulding the souls of races, and building up a whole new world&#8221; &#8211; world of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The closer we examine this development the more extraordinary does it appear. The other great religions won their way slowly, by painful struggle and finally triumphed with the aid of powerful monarchs converted to the new faith. Christianity had its Constantine, Buddhism its Asoka, and Zoroastrianism its Cyrus, each lending to his chosen cult the mighty force of secular authority. Not so Islam. Arising in a desert land sparsely inhabited by a nomad race previously undistinguished in human annals, Islam sallied forth on its great adventure with the slenderest human backing and against the heaviest material odds. Yet Islam triumphed with seemingly miraculous ease, and a couple of generations saw the Fiery Crescent borne victorious from the Pyrenees to the Himalayas and from the desert of Central Asia to the deserts of Central Africa.&#8221; &#8211;A.M.L. Stoddard, quoted in ISLAM &#8211; THE RELIGION OF ALL PROPHETS, Begum Bawani Waqf, Karachi, Pakistan, p. 56.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I am not a Muslim in the usual sense, though I hope I am a &#8220;Muslim&#8221; as &#8220;one surrendered to God,&#8221; but I believe that embedded in the Quran and other expressions of the Islamic vision are vast stores of divine truth from which I and other occidentals have still much to learn, and &#8216;Islam is certainly a strong contender for the supplying of the basic framework of the one religion of the future.'&#8221; &#8211;W. Montgomery Watt, ISLAM AND CHRISTIANITY TODAY, London, 1983, p. ix.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I believe in One God and Mohammed the Apostle of God,&#8217; is the simple and invariable profession of Islam. The intellectual image of the Deity has never been degraded by any visible idol; the honours of the prophet have never transgressed the measure of human virtue, and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of reason and religion.&#8221; &#8211;Edward Gibbon and Simon Ocklay, HISTORY OF THE SARACEN EMPIRE, London, 1870, p. 54.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;He was Caesar and Pope in one; but he was Pope without Pope&#8217;s pretensions, Caesar without the legions of Caesar: without a standing army, without a bodyguard, without a palace, without a fixed revenue; if ever any man had the right to say that he ruled by the right divine, it was Mohammed, for he had all the power without its instruments and without its supports.&#8221; &#8211;Bosworth Smith, MOHAMMAD AND MOHAMMADANISM, London, 1874, p. 92.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;His readiness to undergo persecutions for his beliefs, the high moral character of the men who believed in him and looked up to him as leader, and the greatness of his ultimate achievement &#8211; all argue his fundamental integrity. To suppose Muhammad an impostor raises more problems than it solves. Moreover, none of the great figures of history is so poorly appreciated in the West as Muhammad.&#8221; &#8211;W. Montgomery Watt, MOHAMMAD AT MECCA, Oxford, 1953, p. 52.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The doctrine of brotherhood of Islam extends to all human beings, no matter what color, race or creed. Islam is the only religion which has been able to realize this doctrine in practice. Muslims wherever on the world they are will recognize each other as brothers.&#8221; Mr. R. L. Mellema, Holland, Anthropologist, Writer and Scholar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is impossible for anyone who studies the life and character of the great Prophet of Arabia, who knows how he taught and how he lived, to feel anything but reverence for that mighty Prophet, one of the great messengers of the Supreme. And although in what I put to you I shall say many things which may be familiar to many, yet I myself feel whenever I re-read them, a new way of admiration, a new sense of reverence for that mighty Arabian teacher.&#8221; &#8211;Annie Besant, THE LIFE AND TEACHINGS OF MUHAMMAD, Madras, 1932, p. 4.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The essential and definite element of my conversion to Islam was the Qur&#8217;an. I began to study it before my conversion with the critical spirit of a Western intellectual &#8230;. There are certain verses of this book, the Qur&#8217;an, revealed more than thirteen centuries ago, which teach exactly the same notions as the most modern scientific researches do. This definitely converted me.&#8221; Ali Selman Benoist, France, Doctor of Medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I have read the Sacred Scriptures of every religion; nowhere have I found what I encountered in Islam: perfection. The Holy Qur&#8217;an, compared to any other scripture I have read, is like the Sun compared to that of a match. I firmly believe that anybody who reads the Word of Allah with a mind that is not completely closed to Truth, will become a Muslim.&#8221; Saifuddin Dirk Walter Mosig, U.S.A.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The universal brotherhood of Islam, regardless of race, politics, color or country, has been brought home to me most keenly many times in my life &#8212; and this is another feature which drew me towards the Faith.&#8221; Col. Donald S. Rockwell, U.S.A. Poet, Critic and Author.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Medieval Islam was technologically advanced and open to innovation. It achieved far higher literacy rates than in contemporary Europe; it assimilated the legacy of classical Greek civilization to such a degree that many classical books are now known to us only through Arabic copies. It invented windmills ,trigonometry, lateen sails and made major advances in metallurgy, mechanical and chemical engineering and irrigation methods. In the middle-ages the flow of technology was overwhelmingly from Islam to Europe rather from Europe to Islam. Only after the 1500&#8217;s did the net direction of flow begin to reverse.&#8221; (pg 253) Jared Diamond a world renowned UCLA sociologist, and physiologist who won the Pulitzer Prize for his book: &#8220;Guns, Germs, and Steel.&#8221;</p>

<strong>Published: </strong>May 1997 Invitation to Islam Newsletter</span></p>
<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;">With leadership and conquest comes fame but fame did not affect this man whose only aim was to establish the religion of Allah on earth. His position as a Messenger of Allah was not exaggerated. His insistence on being a mere mortal like others was firm. And his desire to single out Allah alone for worship was stressed wholeheartedly.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="justify"><span style="font-family:Arial;"><strong>&#8220;And We have not sent you except as a mercy to mankind&#8221;</strong> (Al-Anbiyah, The Prophets 21:107) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The year is 570 CE, five years after the death of the Roman Emperor Justinian. An army of men, horses and elephants ruthlessly march towards the city of Makkah, intending to wipe it out of existence. This is the army of the Abysinnian warlord Abraha, who after conquering Yemen is now advancing towards the sacred city of Makkah. One of the notables of Makkah, Abdul-Muttalib, has ordered all the women and children to go up into the mountains and take refuge there whilst the men go and fight. However, the men of Makkah are of no match to the deadly Abysinnian lancers who soon crush their resistance on the borders of the city.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Victory seems imminent for Abraha. Yet when the army advances to the fringes of the city, headed by its lead elephant, the creature stops unexpectedly and refuses to go any further towards the direction of Makkah. No amount of budging will make this beast go towards the direction of conquest, yet when the army turn it around, it is more than willing to go back. Suddenly from the distant horizon, a huge flock of birds is seen. Ominously it makes its way to the scene of the battle. In their beaks and claws the birds carry with them stones. Like lightning do they descend upon the confused army of Abraha and pelt them viciously with the stones. The stones start to cut and tear away at the bodies of these aggressors and reduce them to helpless wretches. The army of the tyrant are sent back in humiliation. It is no less than a miracle which has saved this sacred city.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This event was to be remembered by the Arabs as the year of the elephant and was to hold great significance in the balance of power in Arabia. But it was the event which occurred fifty days later in the same year which was not only to be remembered, but would also change the course of history forever. It was on the 12th day of the month of Rabi-al-Awwal[3], that in the house of Abdul-Muttalib a child was born. It was the child of Amina, the wife of Abdullah, the son of Abdul-Muttalib. This was the child who would change the way of life of all those around him. This was the child who would unite all people under one way. This was the child who would bring the great empires of the world to a standstill.</p>
<p>This child was Muhammad, the last and final messenger of Allah to mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name Muhammad was given to the child by his grandfather Abdul-Muttalib. The name was one which was known amongst the Arabs at that time but was not common. The literal meaning of Muhammad is &#8216;the praised one&#8217;, and it is reported that upon being asked why Abdul-Muttalib had named his grandson so, he replied: &#8220;I did so with the desire that my grandson would be praised by Allah in Heaven and by men on earth&#8221;[4]. It seems as if the desire of Abdul-Muttalib came true, for it was the name of Muhammad (peace be upon him) which was to be uttered and praised more times than that of any person in history[5]. In fact it is not only men who praise this remarkable man, but also the Creator of the Heavens and the earth, Allah, and the inhabitants of the heavens, the angels:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily Allaah sends blessings upon the prophet, and his angels ask Allaah to bless him. Oh you who have believed ask Allaah to send blessings upon him and greet him with peace&#8221; (Al-Ahzab, The Confederates 33:56)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The grandson of Abdul-Muttalib was destined to become the greatest man ever to live.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The early life of Muhammad (peace be upon him) before his prophethood, is unknown to most people. His life is highlighted by his sublime character and noble manners. The world of Muhammed, ((peace be upon him) was a world of idolatry, a world in which women and slaves had no rights whatsoever, a world in which men would cheat each other for a few dirhams.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However Muhammad (peace be upon him) was not like those around him. He was not known to swear or talk in a vile manner, nor was he known to drink or gamble. His honesty surpassed that of all others and he was known with the title of &#8216;Al-Ameen&#8217; (The trustworthy). In fact it was this quality of honesty which attracted so many people to his noble message.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The nature of the Arabs at the time of Muhammad (peace be upon him) was very barbaric and they would fight over the smallest of things, such as one tribes camel grazing on the land of another tribe. This would often result in wars which would last for years and take thousands of lives. In the year 605 CE the Kaabah was accidentally burnt down and a massive reconstruction programme had to be initiated. Many people were involved in it&#8217;s rebuilding. However, upon its completion, the issue of replacing the black stone in its original place, the south east corner of the Kaabah, arose. Each of the major tribes and clans wanted the honour of placing the black stone in its proper place. Civil war loomed over the Arabian peninsula. It was then suggested by Abu Ummayah al-Mugheera, one of the elders of Makkah, that the way to settle this dispute was to let the first person to come through the mosque&#8217;s gate the next morning, decide the fate of the matter. Lo and behold the first man to enter the mosque the next morning was indeed Muhammad (peace be upon him). Upon seeing him some of the Arabs exclaimed with joy, &#8220;here is the trustworthy one, we shall agree to his decision &#8211; he is Muhammad&#8221;. Muhammad (peace be upon him) asked for a sheet or a robe to be brought to him and to have the black stone placed in the middle of it. He then asked the elders of each of the major tribes to lift up the sheet from each of the corners. The elders did as they were instructed and took the black stone over to the south east corner. Muhammed (peace be upon him) then took the stone and placed it firmly in its resting place And so it was Muhammad (peace be upon him) who with wisdom and honesty saved the Arabs from self-destruction.[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad&#8217;s (peace be upon him) early life was wrought with unhappiness as he never saw his father Abdullah who died before he was born. At the age of six his mother, Amina passed away and he was entrusted into the care of his beloved grandfather Abdul-Muttalib. However, at the age of twelve, Abdul-Muttalib also passed away and Abu Talib, the uncle of Muhammed (peace be upon him), took charge of him. With such distress and heartache so early on in life, one would imagine that this boy would grow up to be rebellious and troublesome, as is the case in so many of our societies today[9]. But this was obviously not to be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was Abu Talib who then reared and brought him up. Abu Talib was a trader and businessman and he sometimes took his nephew along with him on his trade journeys. It was these trade journeys which eventually formed the alliance between Muhammad and his future wife Khadija. Khadija was a wealthy widow from Makkah who was known for her noble character and morals. Soon Muhammed (peace be upon him) was working for Khadija as a manager for her trade caravans. It was his honesty and efficiency which led to Khadija&#8217;s proposal, and soon after Muhammed (peace be upon him) had returned from a trade journey to Syria, they were married.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was in the year 610 CE that the prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him) received the first revelation. It was the practice of Muhammad (peace be upon him) that he would often go up to the cave of Hira to meditate and pray to Allah alone. One night during the month of Ramadaan[10] while he was meditating, an angel appeared before him. This was the angel Jibraeel (Eng. Gabriel), the very same angel who had brought down revelation to the earlier prophets of Allah such as Jesus and Moses (upon them be peace). ln a thundering voice the angel commanded him &#8220;READ&#8221; . &#8220;I cannot read&#8221;, [11] replied Muhammad honestly. The angel grabbed hold of him and squeezed him so hard that Muhammed thought he would die of suffocation. &#8220;READ&#8221;, the angel commanded again. Muhammad&#8217;s reply was the same. So the angel squeezed him again and again, each time harder than the previous, and Muhammad replied the same, each time thinking that he would die of suffocation. The angel then released him and spoke the words which would be remembered as the first words of the final revelation to mankind:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Read in the name of you Lord, Who Created. Who Created man out of a clot of blood. Read, and your Lord is the Most Bountiful. It is He who has taught man the use of the pen. Taught man that which he did not know.&#8221; (Al-Alaq, The Clot 96:1-5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the start of the revelation from Allah to humanity. It was the final incorruptible message by which mankind would have to live by and worship according to. And it was Muhammed (peace be upon him), the son of Abdullah who was chosen to spread this good news.</p>
<p><strong>His Noble Character</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the character of the prophet Muhammed (peace be upon him) which was one of the main reasons for the spread of his noble message. As mentioned before, he never swore and he never spoke vilely about anyone. But after his appointment as a prophet of Allah, he not only observed these excellent qualities for himself, but also ordered all the Muslims to live their lives according to these noble traits. This is why we find that lying and cheating are totally forbidden in Islam, and about lying the prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<strong>Lying leads to obscenity and obscenity leads to the fire of hell</strong>&#8221; [13]. For the Arabs to stop cheating and lying it would mean that the whole of their lives would have to be turned upside down. Cheating and lying during business transactions was a regular practice for the Arabs, and it was from this behaviour that the racist slogan &#8220;you cheating Arab!&#8221; was derived. Backbiting and slandering one another were totally forbidden and the prophet (peace be upon him) was instructed by Allah to inform the people that backbiting another Muslim was like:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;. . . eating the dead flesh of your brother&#8221; (Al-Hujjarat, The Dwellings 49:12)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammed (peace be upon him) was known to laugh very little, if at all. Rather when he was happy he would express his delight by smiling and he is reported to have said: &#8220;Too much laughter kills the heart&#8221; [15]. Likewise when he was angry, he would not fly off the handle or start a tantrum, but rather the complexion of his face would simply turn red.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The generosity of Muhammed (peace be upon him) was so great that one of his companions, Ibn Abbas described his huge generosity as being like &#8220;. . . the blowing wind&#8221; [16] . To give charity during those days was outdated and those who gave charity were very rare in that troublesome society. But the trends of society were nothing to this man, who simply wished to attain the pleasure of Allah by helping those who were less fortunate then himself. In fact his giving of charity often meant that he had to sacrifice the pleasures of life for himself and his family. His wife Aisha reported that &#8220;&#8230;. three consecutive days would not go by without the family of Muhammed not eating their fill&#8221; [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The relationship between Muhammed (peace be upon him) and women has been subject to vicious attack by many western writers. He has been accused of being sexually immoral and depraved by his enemies. Many a feminist has accused him of depriving women of their rights. Yet the reality of this man is unknown to many of these ignorant people. When Muhammed (peace be upon him) left the cave of Hira, trembling and shaking like a leaf, who was the first person that this alleged male chauvinist turned to? When spreading the message of Islam who was the first person to respond to this so called &#8220;patriarchal&#8221; religion? The answer is Khadija, his wife, a woman. It was Khadija who comforted him during these initial days of anxiety. It was Khadija who reassured him of his role by accepting his message. And it was Khadija who gained so much respect and admiration from this remarkable man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Pre-Islamic Arabia was characterised by the evil crime of burying baby girls alive because they were seen as a shame to the family. Yet it was this man Muhammad who spoke out vehemently against this great social crime. In fact he stated the great blessing and reward of having and rearing female children : &#8220;Whomsoever brings up two girls upon this religion, then me and him shall be like this in paradise [and he joined his forefinger with his middle finger]&#8221;[19]. His conduct with women was not like that of the men today, rather he treated the women as they deserved to be treated. He did not openly parade women about like cattle[20], as was done before the coming of Islam nor did he seek to please them by showing off his masculinity. Rather he as described as being &#8220;&#8230;&#8230;more shy than a virgin behind a veil&#8221;[21]. For a man who achieved so much in his lifetime it would be expected (by corrupt western standards!) that Muhammad would abuse his power with regards to women. Yet we do not find a single instance in his life in which he went out raping and destroying the honour of the women folk who were captured [as occurred is Bosnia and Kosovo, when the Serbian army attempted to rid their country of all Muslim presence -SA]. Rather it was the women of Arabia who came forward in their droves to accept the message of this man, who came to liberate humanity from the oppression of this world[22].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the time of his death in the year 632 CE almost the whole of the Arabian peninsula had been conquered. A million square miles lay at his feet. Yet such was the humble nature of this man that he would mend his own shoes, sew his own clothes and milk his own goats. Such behaviour has become awe inspiring for millions of people and has thus led them to the beauty of this religion. As a leader for his people he was a great example of humility and mercy. When his companions walked past his house they could hear him crying in his prayer, so much so that it was like a &#8220;&#8230; boiling pot&#8221;[23]. He would continuously pray during the nights to such an extent that his feet would swell up. Upon observing this his wife Aisha asked him &#8220;..why do you pray so much, when your Lord has forgiven your past sins and your future sins?&#8221; and the reply from the prophet (peace be upon him) was &#8220;should I therefore not be a grateful servant of my Lord (by praying at night)&#8221;[24].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The famous conquest of Makkah is an event which shall be remembered for the justice and mercy which were shown that day. Even though he had the option to punish those who were guilty of oppressing the Muslims, Muhammed (peace be upon him) issued a general amnesty by which many people were forgiven. It was this behaviour which saw the amazing acceptance of Islam by almost the whole population of Makkah literally overnight.[25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With leadership and conquest comes fame but fame did not affect this man whose only aim was to establish the religion of Allah on earth. His position as a messenger of Allaah was not exaggerated. His insistence on being a mere mortal like others was firm. And his desire to single out Allaah alone for worship was stressed wholeheartedly. It is for this reason that he ordered his followers not to make any pictorial representations or statues of him. Before his death he condemned the &#8220;. . .Jews and Christians for taking the graves of their prophets and pious people as places of worship&#8221;[26]. By implication this made it haram (prohibited) for the Muslims to take the grave of Muhammed (peace be upon him) as a place of worship. For all those who call the Muslims &#8216;Muhammedans'[27], then this is the response which we as worshippers of Allah bring forward. Throughout history leaders of nations, ideologies and empires have often ended up becoming objects of worship. We find statues and pictures of Marx, Lenin, Caesar, Jesus, St Paul, Hitler, Napoleon, Confucius and so many others. Yet despite all the reminders of these people, it is still this man Muhammad (peace be upon him) who has had the most influence upon history, despite the fact that we find no 3-D visual image of him [28]. This is indeed a mercy from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The world of the 7th century was a crumbling place. The empires of Rome and Persia were locked in constant battle. The Chinese and Indian civilisations were in moral decline. Christianity, Zoroastrianism and Judaism were all religions which were fast losing momentum. The case of the Arabs was clear to everyone and they were regarded as being at the bottom of this decaying pit. It was among this decadence that Allah sent Muhammad (peace be upon him). He was like the light to this world of ignorance. Like a lamp did he shine in this abyss of darkness. From the confines of Arabia it was his light that would reach the farthest regions of the earth and release the people from their burdens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8216;O prophet. Verily We have sent you as a witness and a bearer of glad tidings and a warner, and as one who invites to Allah by His Permission, and as a lamp spreading light&#8221; (Al-Ahzab, The Confederates, 33:45-46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Be thankful for small mercies&#8221; goes the saying of old. But the mercy which we have been given is far from small. Rather the greatness of this mercy will enable us to live and die upon a way of success and contentment. This mercy is the Sunnah (way) of the prophet Muhammad and through it we -by the will of Allaah- will enjoy an everlasting life to come. Indeed in the messenger of Allaah you have the most beautiful pattern of conduct for him who hopes in Allaah and the last day, and remembers Allaah much&#8221; (Al-Ahzab, The Confederates, 33:21)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the criticisms leveled at Islam by demented animal rights activists, is that it encourages the wide scale slaughter of animals. Every year after the annual Hajj (pilgrimage) Muslims worldwide sacrifice an animal for the pleasure of Allaah. Not only is this a religious duty benefiting the doer, but it also helps many starving people around the world, to whom the meat is sent to. This however, is blurred from the minds of the insane.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Animal Tragic” &#8211; Islam And The Treatment Of Animals</strong></span><br />
Source: Invitation To Islam Newsletter, vol.1 issue.6, July 1999</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Chained up bears in Russian circuses. A terrified fox running from the blood hounds. The Spanish bull being tormented in the arena with darts and knives. Elephant graveyards littered across India and Africa, courtesy of ivory hunters. Thousands of rare animals vanishing due to the deforestation of Central and Southern America. All these are examples of the tragic state of the creatures which live alongside us on this planet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, to be an animal in today’s world is not an easy life. Injustice against animals occurs in all of today’s societies. Living in the West, we hear many tales of cruelty towards animals in the ‘third’ world. The cruel cock fighting of South East Asia, the ‘barbaric’ animal delicacies of the Orient and the international smuggling of rare animals, are just some of the tales we hear. However, people in the West seem to forget that cruelty also goes on under their own noses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every year the cosmetics industry kills millions of animals for testing, just to appease the vain desires of people. Cattle and livestock are transported between the ‘civilised’ nations of Europe in the most horrendous conditions. And animals are brought to the verge of extinction just so that people can revel in the latest trends of jewellery and fashion. Indeed, to be an animal in today’s world is not as easy life!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is the solution to this cruelty? Do we all join the RSPCA and WWF? 1 Do we jump onto the bandwagon with the crazy animal rights groups and start bombing campaigns? No, clearly not, as such measures have eased the cruelty animals very little. So what do we do? The answer is simple, and has been available to the people of the world for the past 1400 years. It is none other than Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam and Animals – The Americans send a monkey into space and the Russians a dog. TV programmes about injured animals are aired daily. Cruelty to pets results in massive fines and imprisonment. Such actions by the non- Muslims are seen as liberating forces which have only come into existence this century. However, unknown to many, Islam endorsed this kindness to animals 1400 years earlier. It is Islam which first taught the world about compassion and Mercy to animals. The Qur’an and the Sunnah (way) of the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), give us guidance in all affairs. By worshiping Allaah through these sources, the treatment of animals is exemplified more than any other way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam teaches us that the creatures of the earth are from the signs of Allaah, by which we can recognize His Greatness. They are all here for a specific purpose which Allaah has ordained for them. From the tiniest ant to the largest Blue Whale, each animal on this earth provides a service by which life carries on uninterrupted. As Muslims, we see these creatures as an opportunity to reflect and ponder about the perfect artistry of Allaah. An example are the birds in the sky as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do they not observe the birds above them, spreading out their wings and folding them in? None upholds them except the Most Merciful. Indeed He is the All-Seer of everything.” [Surah al-Mulk (67):19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These creatures offer us so much by way of their services. They are our food, our clothing, our livelihoods and our transportation across the land. All this they do for us at no cost or charge. As Muslims we have to therefore be grateful to Allaah for this magnificent blessing, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Thus We have made them (animals) subject to you that you may be grateful.” [Surah Al-Hajj (22):36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The gratitude to Allaah comes in the form of kindness towards these animals. Such is the mercy of Islam, that it produces this kindness through the expectation of Allaah’s reward, as the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: “….there is a reward for kindness to every living thing” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way Muslims see kind treatment of animals as a religious deed to please Allaah. To mistreat animals is thus disobedience to Allaah – something which we will be held accountable for, as the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) demonstrated when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A woman (from the previous nations) was tormented because of a cat which she had confined and staved till it died. She did not allow it to eat or drink while it was confined, nor did she set it free so that it may eat the insects of the earth. As a result of her wickedness she was condemned to Hell.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People abuse and torture animals because they think that no one will hold them accountable. Once people accept that Allaah will hold us all to account, can such cruelty stop. By studying the beliefs and practising the injunctions of Islam, cruelty to animals can truly stop. Looking at the example of the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) we can see exactly how animals should be treated. Thus, from the actions and saying of this amazing man, can so much be learned in this oppressive and unjust world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The way of Muhammad (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) – Once, during the early part of the day, the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) passed by a withered camel kneeling down near the gate of the mosque. At the end of the day he passed by the mosque again only to see the camel in the same state as before. When the owner of the camel was looked for but could not be found, he (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said to the people:<br />
“Fear Allaah regarding these dumb animals and ride them with care and feed them with care.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last Messenger to humanity also said:<br />
“Ride these animals peacefully, and when you are not in need of them keep them peacefully, and do not take them as chairs.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lot of the animal in light of these sayings is exonerated beyond anything that the liberation movements of the West have produced. This is because the sayings of this man are not from is own desire, rather:<br />
“….it is (only) the revelation with which he is inspired”[Surah An-Najm 53:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Beware of taking the backs of your animals as pulpits, for indeed Allaah, the Most High, has subjugated them for you to carry you to a land with great difficulty….” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at the wisdom of these words O’ reader. Is this not an appreciation of the creatures which inhabit our planet? Whilst the rest of the world was steeped in savagery, here was this amazing man, 1400 years ago, improving the situation for every being on earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once, while entering an enclosure, the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) saw a camel. When the camel saw the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) it began to cry. So the Prophet went to it, wiped its back around its hump and rubbed it until it calmed down. Then addressing the owner of the camel, he (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said: “Will you not fear Allaah in regards to these animals which Allaah has placed under your control? For indeed it (the camel) has complained to me that you keep it hungry and fatigued.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The leader of a nation and a man to be followed by millions, is seen here comforting a creature which cannot even talk. Such behaviour has made the Prophet Muhammad (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) the most influential man ever to exist. One does not hear of Confucious, Caeser, Napoleon, Hitler or any other famous leader ever expressing such mercy and compassion towards the creation. Even today, when leaders broadcast their own virtues to gain support, we find that they cannot even stop the cruelty which goes on in their countries. The widespread abuse of riding beasts (camels, elephants, horses, mules etc.) in circuses is one such example. The case of Mary Chipperfield, a circus trainer who was caught on camera beating elephants – only for her to be given them back – shows us how much the people truly need Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The killing of animals for the sake of sport and fun is something totally outlawed by the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) and Islam. He (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Do not take any living thing as a target.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, such is the severity of this, that Ibn Umar (a companion of the Prophet) said:<br />
“Indeed the Messenger of Allaah cursed the one who made a living thing a target.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, big game safaris, bull fighting and fox hunting are all acts which were condemned by Islam even before they were invented by the Europeans. If pain has to be inflicted, such as for identifying purposes, then the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam)<br />
“….Prohibited striking animals in their faces or branding them on their faces.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The international smuggling of rare tropical birds and the theft of their eggs is something well highlighted. The motive to make profit from the suffering of some of the most beautiful creatures on earth, is a good reason for many. With Islam however, such a reason is not valid. Once the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) was on a journey with his companions. Some of his companions saw a nest with a bird and its two chicks. They took the chicks from the nest which made the bird swivel around in anxiety. When the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) saw this he said:<br />
“Who has caused distress to her regarding her children? Return her children to her”. [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kindness is even extended to those animals which Islam normally bars participation with, such as dogs. [12] The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) informed us about a man from the previous nations who had seen a thirsty dog panting and eating mud. The man climbed into a well, filled his shoe with water and gave it to the dog. Because of this “….Allaah thanked and forgave him.” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) also said:<br />
“Allaah forgave a prostitute (from the Israelites) who tied her shoe to her scarf and drew out some water (from a well) for a dog which she saw dying of thirst…..” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The kind treatment of animals is topped up by the practical help which Islam advises with. The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Any Muslim who plants a tree gains the reward of giving in charity. What is eaten from it is charity, what is stolen from it, what the animals eat and what the birds eat is all charity….” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not only do these words encourage us to preserve the environment, but they also help us to provide a welcome sustenance to the animals around us. Developing from this, the Muslim will increase obedience to Allaah by leaving out bread and biscuits for the birds that visit the garden, or nuts for the squirrels who rummage around. Having heard these narrations about the last Messenger, only the unjust would say that Islam does not truly emancipate animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Extremes – Cruelty to animals is one extreme regarding the beasts of the earth. On the other side of the spectrum we find that the lot of the animal is increased so much, that it has even superseded that of humanity. In today’s world people love and honour animals so much that they literally worship them! What could be more typical of this then the religion of Hinduism. Cows, monkeys, snakes, elephants and rats are among the many animals worshipped by Hindus. By going to this extreme of worshipping and loving animals, the lives of humans are usually forgotten and put in danger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A perfect example is the huge outbreak of plague in Calcutta, India, a few years ago. According to Hindu mythology, Ganesh the elephant headed deity, who is called upon to remove obstacles, used to ride upon a rat! Because of this the rat is considered sacred and thus the city could not be sectioned off. Such insane polytheistic behaviour resulted in this plague spreading and killing many people. Such is the deification of the rat in Hinduism, that in India special temples are dedicated for rats. In these temples Hindus live and eat with rats. Once the rats finish drinking milk provided for them, that which is left over is drunk by Hindus who consider the milk to have been blessed!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other religions such as Jainism 16 have gone to such extremes, that we find that their religious monks and nuns constantly wear mouth veils lest they should swallow even a fly by accident!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The worship of animals is not just confined to organised religion. In the West, many pet owners are also guilty of this. The extent to which people love their pets has escalated beyond control. Every year millions are spent on pampering pets. If all the money from the beauty pageants for cats and dogs was sent to the starving millions around the world, so much human life could be saved. But no… the eccentric vices of the West deem that animal life is far precious then human life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With Islam, humans undoubtedly come first. The destruction of human life for the sake of animals is epitomised by the animal rights groups who are so fervent in the West. Activities of groups such as the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) clearly show how human life is so undervalued. By vandalising and destroying laboratories, such groups believe that they are liberating the poor animals who are tested therein. [17] However the human cost of such actions is ignored. By testing animals for medical research, remedies for cancer, Alzheimer’s, and many other degenerative illnesses are being developed. Such testing is very beneficial for humanity and has brought relief to many through the new drugs developed. Thus, in destroying incubators, computers and other valuable equipment, more people are kept in pain then animals. Letter bombs, car bombs, assassinations and throwing acid at scientists, are just some of the horrors which these terrorists have unleashed upon society. Every year innocent people get killed because of the love which these lunatics have for animals. Such people have clearly gone to extremes with the creatures of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Slaughter</strong></span> – One of the criticisms levelled at Islam by demented animal rights activists, is that it encourages the wide scale slaughter of animals. Every year after the annual Hajj (pilgrimage) Muslims worldwide sacrifice an animal for the pleasure of Allaah. Not only is this a religious duty benefiting the doer, but it also helps many starving people around the world, to whom the meat is sent to. This however, is blurred from the minds of the insane. In countries such as Britain and France, protests against this are vigorous. In France such protests have been intensified with the support of people like Bridgett Bardot, the famous ‘sexkitten’ of French cinema. 18 If only these people were to examine the way of the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), would they realise that even in the slaughter of animals Islam has regulated compassion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Islamic method of slaughtering is one which embodies true mercy. To have mercy whilst slaughtering will bring mercy from Allaah, as the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Whosoever has mercy, even if he is slaughtering a sparrow, Allaah will have mercy upon him on the day of resurrection.” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the method of slaughtering with a knife (at the wind pipe) is far painless then the electric shocks or crushing bows to the head which are administered in the West. The Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:<br />
“Allaah has enjoined goodness to everything.. when you slaughter, slaughter in a good way. Let every one of you sharpen his knife and let the slaughtered animal die comfortably.” [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By using a sharp knife to slaughter, the pain is minimised and the animal dies very quickly. Such is the mercy of Islam, that it even forbids that a knife be sharpened in front of the slaughtered animal, lest it would feel terror and anxiety. Once the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) passed by a man who had his foot on the neck of a sheep. Whilst he was sharpening his blade, the sheep was looking towards it. The Prophet of Mercy (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said to him:<br />
“Do you intend to give it two deaths? Why did you not sharpen your knife before you laid it on the ground?” [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This compassionate behaviour of the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) was understood and implemented in the best way by his noble companions. Thus, we find that Umar, the second righteous caliph of Islam, once hit a man with a stick because he sharpened his blade in front of a sheep. Another time, Umar saw a man dragging a sheep to slaughter it. Umar hit him with a stick [22] and said:<br />
“Drive it – may your mother be bereaved of you – to its death in a nice way.” [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After reading this, who can say that Islam encourages wide scale slaughter? Surely those who criticise Islam after knowing how merciful it is towards animals, do so from desire. Animals have been created for our use and provision; yet such is the beauty of Islam, that it has set a standard for use and provision which is truly humane. There is no other way which is so balanced in its treatment of the animals of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From cruelty to craziness, the extremes regarding animals are astounding. These extremes show how ignorant people are of their purpose in life. Once people realise that Allaah deserves to be worshipped alone, will everything else fall into place. Our actions on this earth stem from whether or not we worship Allaah correctly. Those who worship Allaah correctly are those who treat the animals of the earth correctly. Those who worship other than Allaah, are those who go to extremes with animals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The world is beautiful and green and Allaah &#8211; be He exalted – has made you governors over it to see how you will act” 24 said Muhammad the last Messenger of Allaah. By worshipping Allaah as guided by Islam, we can act correctly with the animals, the plants and all that is in the beautiful and green world of ours. May Allaah help us to show compassion to all the creatures which He has created. Ameen</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you know this Book?</strong></span><br />
[From the &#8216;Invitation to Islam&#8217; Newsletter, Issue 2, July 1997]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of all the acclaimed masterpieces that the world has seen, nothing can be compared to the book known as the Qur&#8217;an. Millions have become Muslims upon simply hearing a verse from this amazing book, yet still the majority knows nothing of it. The Qur&#8217;an is the Final Revelation from the Creator to humanity. It was revealed in the year 610 CE to the Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him), and completed over a period of 23 years. These 23 years of revelation resulted in a book which comprised of 114 chapters and 6,666 verses. All of this was to become the primary source of law for the whole of mankind to live and die by.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The impact of this book is such that Allah says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Had We[1] revealed this Qur&#8217;an upon a mountain, surely you would have seen it humble itself and crumble out of the fear of Allah. Such are the parables We put forward to mankind so that they may reflect&#8221; (Surah Al-Hashr 59:21)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it seems as if the hearts of the people have become harder then the mountains which tower above us. When the Qur&#8217;an is recited or even mentioned, people turn away with disgust. In the West, this is primarily due to the negative exposure from the media. It has resulted in many non-Muslims not even wanting to hear the name of this amazing book. Muslims too, have become hardhearted because of the cultural influences of the West. Many young Muslims perceive the Qur&#8217;an to be nothing more then an old wrapped up book, which comes off the highest shelf once a year during Ramadan!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If people were to truly reflect upon this book, they would realise that nothing in this world is quite the same. So why should this claim be accepted over others? Why should the Qur&#8217;an be given precedence over the likes of the Bible, the Gita[2] or the Granth Sahib[3] ? The following reasons will inshallah give an indication as to why this book deserves the attention of all humanity.</p>
<p><strong>Preservation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is probably in the world no other book which has remained twelve centuries with so pure a text&#8221;. Writing 200 years ago, these are the words of the famous English critic of Islam, Sir William Muir. But as Muslims we do not need Williarn Muir to tell us this. 1400 years ago, the Muslims accepted this reality when Allah revealed to them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed it is We who have sent down the reminder (the Qur&#8217;an), and indeed it is Us who shall preserve it&#8221; (Surah Al-Hijr 15:9)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These words have proved true to this very day. From the moment the first words were revealed to Muhammed (Peace be upon him), to this very day, every single letter and word of the Qur&#8217;an has remained unchanged.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before Islam, all the revelations sent were not given this divine assurance. This is why we find that books like the Bible are riddled with corruption and inaccuracies. It is well known that man has tampered with the Bible to the extent that annually different versions are produced to suit trends and desires[4]. In fact this has been going on for so long that it is almost impossible to see what of the words of the Creator are left, if any!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the Qur&#8217;an it is the exact opposite. The contents of this amazing book are stored in the hearts of millions of Muslims worldwide. Children as young as 12 have memorized the entire book in its original language, Arabic. There is no other religious scripture on earth which is orally preserved in its original language by so many and over such a period of time, without having been tampered somewhere along the line. The Bible is a prime example of this. Many Christians believe that English is the divine language of the Bible. However Jesus (as) spoke Aramaic. From Aramaic, his life-story was translated into Hebrew. From Hebrew it was translated into Greek. From Greek to Latin, and then finally from Latin to English! There has not been a single vicar, priest or layman in recorded history who has even memorised the Bible in English, let alone the Aramaic! As Muslims we believe the Qur&#8217;an can only be in the language it was revealed in, i.e. Arabic. Anything else is a translation and not the divine words of the Creator. A true test of this divine preservation would be to burn all the books and manuscripts in existence, to see which can return as it was. The Qur&#8217;an would be the only book which would return in its original form, letter for letter, word for word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many Christians say that the Qur&#8217;anic claim of preservation needs to be backed-up by manuscript evidence. For us this is not a necessary criteria, but in order to quell the doubts, the Muslims have ample proof. Two copies of the Qur&#8217;an are in existence which date back to the Third Caliph Uthmaan (may Aah be please with him), 20 years after the death of the Prophet (Peace be upon him). These two copies are to be found in the Topkapi museum, Istanbul, Turkey and in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The Tashkent copy is thought to have been the personal copy of the Caliph as it still contains stains of his blood, which was shed when he was murdered whilst reading it. Any copy of the Qur&#8217;an which is compared to these copies, will show that there is not a single difference between what we have today and what was in existence 1400 years ago. Thus Allah&#8217;s promise holds true.</p>
<p><strong>No Mistakes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man as a creature is fallible. For this reason anything which is produced by him will naturally have faults. With the Qur&#8217;an, such a notion cannot even be considered as it is from the one who is Infallible. In fact Allah clarifies this matter beautifully when he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do they not consider the Qur&#8217;an? Had it been from other then Allah surely they would have found much discrepancies within it&#8221; (Surah An-Nisa 4:82)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Throughout history many have tried to scrutinize and search the Qur&#8217;an for mistakes and errors. To this day no one has been able to bring a shred of proof showing that this book is not from Allah. Some Christians have even called it the work of the Devil because the book affected them so much when they read it! With other scriptures, contradictions, mistakes and absurdities are constantly present. When people contrast these ambiguities with the Qur&#8217;an, it often results in the acceptance of this faultless book.</p>
<p><strong>The Arabic Language</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon hearing Qur&#8217;anic recitation, you may be rather startled. Besides hearing the reciter of the prayer, you often hear people in the background sobbing and wailing heavily. So what is it that makes these people cry so much? It is nothing more then the beauty and eloquence of this book which moves millions to tears. This beauty is expressed in the language of Arabic. Allah says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed We have revealed this as an Arabic Qur&#8217;an so that you may understand&#8221; (Surah Yusuf 12:2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the time of the Prophet (Peace be upon him) three modes of expression were used. There was normal speech, the speech of the soothsayer and poetry. The Arabs were the masters of their language, and poetry was their cultural highlight. Arabic poetry is split into 16 categories, each separate from the other. When the Qur&#8217;an was proclaimed to the Arabs it amazed them beyond all limits. It was like nothing they had ever heard before. It did not fit into the 16 categories of poetry, nor was it the speech of a soothsayer, and it certainly was not normal speech. If it was not all these, then it could only be the word of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eloquence and majesty of the early chapters of the Qur&#8217;an moved many to tears, and the beautiful Qur&#8217;anic Arabic converted millions of Arabs in the Middle-East. Not only did the Qur&#8217;an effect the lives of these Arabs, but it also transformed their culture. Even today, no serious study of the Arabic language is possible without reference to this book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reaction of some pagans was that they accused Muhammed (Peace be upon him) of being a soothsayer and a madman. In order to silence them, Allah issued a challenge. At first he asked them to produce a book like the Qur&#8217;an. When it could not be done, Allah asked them to produce ten chapters like it. When this too could not be done Allah finally stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And if you are in doubt as to what We have revealed to Our slave, then produce a chapter like it&#8221; (Surah Al-Baqarah 2:23)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The smallest chapter in the Qur&#8217;an is only 3 verses long (Chapter 108). The pagans at the time of the Prophet (Peace be upon him) could not even produce something as small as this, and since then no one else has completed this impossible task. All of this is in light of the fact that the Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him) could not read or write, thus refuting those who say that the Qur&#8217;an was his own handiwork.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an is the Final book of revelation. After it there will be no more. However, many have tried to deny this by producing their own new versions of the Qur&#8217;an. Among them have been the two false prophets, Musailama[5] and Ghulam Ahmed[6]. Many Chapters in the Qur&#8217;an are named after animals, such as the Ant, Spider etc. Musailama tried to copy this, and went about creating a chapter in his book called the Weasel! In Arabic it is called Al-Wabl and it hardly causes people to be struck in awe! On the other hand Ghulam Ahmed, the &#8216;British stooge&#8217;, claimed to receive revelation in cockney English!! Such foolishness could never compare to the beauty of the Qur&#8217;an with its clear and beautiful Arabic language.</p>
<p><strong>Science</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Over the past few decades much interest has been shown in the scientific content of the Qur&#8217;an. Scientific data which has been discovered in recent times, has been existent in this book for 1400 years. In fact the very common origin of this universe is stated clearly by Allah, the Most High:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not the disbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together, then We parted them. And We made from water every living thing. Will they then not believe?&#8221; (Surah Al-Anbiya 21:30)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This parting of the heavens and the earth is more commonly known to scientists as the &#8216;big bang&#8217;. It is also a fact that life originated from water and that every living cell is composed of 85% water. Without water life is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mountains of the earth, like icebergs, have roots going deep into the ground. This ensures that they will not topple with their extreme heights &#8211; this is known as &#8216;isostasy&#8217;. In this way the mountains are like the stakes which are used to anchor a tent. But this fact is already known to us when Allah says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Have We not made the earth an expanse and the mountains stakes?&#8221; (Surah An-Naba 78:6-7)<br />
&#8220;Allah has cast into the ground mountains standing firm so that it does not shake with you&#8221; (Surah Luqman 31:10)</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The embryological data which is found in the Qur&#8217;an is astounding. Allah describes the formation of a baby inside the womb from the very moment the sperm reaches the ovum, to its formation into a human. This data, which was only discovered about 30 years ago, has amazed many Western scientists. Amongst them is Dr Keith Moore from the University of Toronto, Canada. Dr Moore[7] is a recognized authority in embryological circles, with his university text book being set as a standard text in many universities throughout the world. When Dr Moore was asked as to how this information in the Qur&#8217;an could be explained, he replied: &#8220;It could only have been divinely revealed&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an is a book of historical accuracy. One accuracy which has corrected the mistakes of many Christians and historians, is the fate of the pharaoh who drowned in the Red Sea whilst pursuing Moses. The Biblical story would have us believe that the matter ended when the pharaoh drowned. But the Qur&#8217;an explains further. When he was drowning the pharaoh confessed his faith in Allah. But it was too late, and Allah promised him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This day We shall preserve you in your body, so that you may be a sign for those who come after you. But indeed many of mankind are heedless of Our signs&#8221; (Surah Yunus 10:92)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In 1898 the tombs of various pharaohs were discovered in the Valley of the Kings, in Egypt. In 1975 Dr Maurice Bucaille, an eminent French surgeon was allowed to examine the mummified bodies of Rameses II and the pharaoh who had pursued Moses &#8211; Merneptah. Dr Bucaille discovered that Merneptah had received very violent blows to several parts of his body and had suffered a massive heart attack. Amazingly, these are the results which occur when someone dies from drowning! Thus Allah had saved the body of the transgressing pharaoh as a sign for all humanity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For those who say that Muhammed (Peace be upon him) knew his history and wrote it in the Qur&#8217;an, the following shall prove otherwise. In the year 615 CE the Roman army was defeated by the Persians. About this event Allah revealed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Romans have been defeated in the lowest land, but in a few years they shall be victorious again, within three to nine years. The decision of the matter, before and after, is only with Allah&#8221; (Surah Ar-Rum 30:24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words of Allah proved true as the Persians were defeated at the battle of Issus, 7 years later in 622 CE. There is no possible way that Muhammed (Peace be upon him) could have known (if he wrote the Qur&#8217;an) that the Romans would be victorious. In fact he also did not know that the &#8216;lowest land&#8217; at which the battle was fought was literally that. The battle in 615 CE was fought on the shores of the Dead Sea, the lowest point below sea level on earth, at 1300 ft.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A book with these credentials could only be from the Creator of the heavens and the earth. A book which we need to acquaint ourselves with. A book . . .</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;. . . which has been revealed to you (O&#8217; Muhammed) so that you may lead mankind out of the darkness and into the light&#8221; (Surah lbrahim 14:1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Footnotes</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 The word &#8216;WE&#8217; does not mean that there is more then one God. Rather it is a plural of respect which gives Allah grandeur over his creation.<br />
2 The Baghyad Gita is one of the Hindu scriptures.<br />
3 The Guru Granth Sahib is the Sikh scripture<br />
4 The most recent version of the Bible is the &#8216;Politically Correct Version&#8217;!!<br />
5 Musailama claimed prophethood just before the death of the Prophet Muhammed (Peace be upon him). He was from the region of Yamaamah in Arabia and from the tribe of Haneefah.<br />
6 Ghulam Ahmed was born in 1840 in Qadian, India. He claimed prophethood at the request of his imperialist masters, the British Government.<br />
7 Besides Dr Moore, there have been many other famous Western scientists who have accepted Islam. One of the most prominent was the famous French oceanographer, Jacques Yves Cousteau who has recently passed away. Cousteau was amazed at the accuracy of the Qur&#8217;anic statements regarding underwater activity and thus embraced Islam. As a result of his death, Cousteau&#8217;s life achievements have been highlighted in the Western media. However his acceptance of Islam was conveniently absent from the news-reports.</p>
