										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">How a Companion of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-   is Identified</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">By Miseekah bint ‘Assim al-Quruti</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Companions can be known in a number of different ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Sometimes the Companions can be known by being mentioned in the Noble Qur’aan, like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;as one of two, when they were in the cave&gt;&gt; [Tawbah: 40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the meaning of that is as-Siddiq <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> [Abu Bakr].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the scholars say: ‘Whoever rejects Abu Bakr’s companionship of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is a disbeliever.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the mention of the companionship of Zayed bin Harithah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>due to the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">&lt;&lt;So when Zayd had no longer any need for her, We married her to you&gt;&gt; [Ahzab: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – By <em>Tawatir</em> (Recurring narratives) like the companionship of Umar, Uthmaan, Ali, Hudayfah, Abu Huriarah, ‘Aeysha and others from the senior Companions <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – By beneficial information, and that is by a Companion of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> being well-known amongst the other Companions. It is less than<em>Tawatir</em> (Recurring narratives), which means that many of the people knew them, even if it was hidden from a small number of them, like: Thaabit bin Qaays, Dhul-Yadain, Mu’aawiyah ibn al-Hakam as-Sulami, Bareerah the freed slave of ‘Aeysha and others from amongst them <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – By the testification of other Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam,</em> as in the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> regarding the seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without reckoning; so ‘Ukashah bin Mihsan stood up and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah make <em>Dua’</em> to Allaah to make me from amongst them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘You are from them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – By a Companion actually narrating from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>that he heard him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saying, or that he witnessed the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in his time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – By the testification of a <em>Taabaiee’</em> (a successor of the Companions) where he says: ‘So and so from the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> narrated to me.’  And this has some conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a-    That the <em>Isnad</em> (chain) is authentic from that <em>Taabaiee’</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b-    That he is a senior <em>Taabaiee’</em> so that most of his narrations are from the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c-    That the <em>Taabaiee’</em> is well known for his memory and precision. No mistake has been experienced from him, since he could have made a mistake and he was not aware of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – That the person himself says ‘I am a Companion of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.’  That he is known to be just. It is obligatory that his announcement had been made within one hundred years of the death of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. It has been affirmed by <em>Tawatir</em> (Recurring narratives) that the last of the Companions to die was Abu at-Tufayl bin ‘Aamir bin Waathilah al-Laythi, and what is correct is that he died in the year 110 A.H. so whoever claims companionship after that, then it is not accepted from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a principle, which is beneficial, and through it we can identify the companionship of a large number of Companions by knowing a general characteristic which includes all of them to be from the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, and this principle is taken from three <em>Athaar</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first: ‘The general people would only place the Companions in charge of battles. Whoever researches narrations which talk about the battles against those who apostated after the death of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and the battles concerning conquering other lands, finds that there had been many Companions mentioned.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second: ‘That Ibn ‘Awf said: ‘No one would have a new born except that he would bring it to that Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and he would supplicate for it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third: ‘There had not remained anyone in Madina, nor Makkah, nor Taif by the tenth year after the <em>Hijra</em> except that he had accepted Islaam and had witnessed the farewell Hajj.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, whoever was present at that time is classified as a Companion under this Companionship due to them seeing the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> even if he himself did not see them.’</p>
