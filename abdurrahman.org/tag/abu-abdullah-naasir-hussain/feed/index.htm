<p style="text-align:center;">Video Courtesy: Bilal Nahim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is a woman that is menstruating or in her post-partum period allowed to touch the mus-haf or read from it? Also, is the menstruating woman allowed to enter the masjid in order to gain religious knowledge?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Abdulazeez bin Abdullah bin Baaz:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The menstruating woman is not allowed to sit in the masjid nor touch the mus-haf until she has become purified. However, if a need for her to touch it arose, such as in order to revise a verse (of the Qur&#8217;an) or something like that, there is no problem to do so by wearing gloves or by using some other barrier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for touching it without some sort of barrier, then no, she should not do that. This is because her impurity is major, like the one who is impure due to sexual relations (junub). The one who is &#8216;junub&#8217; does not read or touch the mus-haf. As for the menstruating woman, she may recite [the Qur&#8217;an] during the whole period. So can the one in her post-partum period, according to the correct Opinion. She can read from her memory without touching the mus-haf unless she has to in order to revise a verse in which case it is alright if she touches it using a barrier.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This questioner says: O virtuous Shaykh, l have heard that the Prophet, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him, commanded that water should be drunk in one go. Is this correct?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not correct. Rather the Prophet, may the praise of I Allah and peace be upon him, prohibited drinking water in one go. This is because it is in imitation to camels. The Prophet, may the praise of Allah and peace be upon him, instructed us to drink with three breaths. To drink with three breaths. Yes.</p>

<p>أخطار الاجهزة الذكية وبرامج التواصل الاجتماعية – لفضيلة الشيخ العلامة صالح بن فوزان الفوزان – حفظه الله</p>
<p><strong>The Dangers of Smart Phones and Social Networking</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praises are due to Allah for His favours and kindness and I thank him for his assistance and for his blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah alone, having no partners, and I testify that Muhammad is his slave and messenger &#8211; May Allah mention him, his family and his companions with praise and send an abundance of peace upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:  O mankind&#8230; Know that from the greatest of hindrances preventing you from being upright are trials and tribulations that block you from the path of Allah and cause you to fall into misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How great in number they are in this time, and how numerous are the callers calling to them through their writings, through their tweets on Twitter and those things like it &#8211; through the various means of communication that are widespread amongst the people and have filled their homes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How numerous are those that go astray because of these evil channels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be weary of them, O slaves of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be cautious of them and don&#8217;t look into them.  Don&#8217;t bring them into your homes.  Don&#8217;t leave them with your children and your wives because they are what hinder from the religion and from the path of Allah, and divert them from being upright and cause them to fall into deviation and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How numerous are the ones who were misguided and deviated. They deviated and their features changed. Their ways changed and this is evident through their conduct, their sayings and their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are stuck to these means day and night. Their eyes are fixed to these things in these wicked devices. What came?  What happened?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the time&#8230; until they have become afflicted by using them all the time&#8230; they have become afflicted with addiction&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is mentioned by the experts that those that have fallen into this, becoming afflicted with addiction, they cannot bear to be without it, and this is something apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You see them staring at these devices all the time&#8230; in his pocket&#8230; in his car&#8230; all the time&#8230; to the extent that he doesn&#8217;t talk to the one next to him, or his family or to his children in his house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He&#8217;s always with these sites.  Even to the extent that he doesn&#8217;t pray &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t get up to pray!  He&#8217;s afraid he&#8217;s going to miss something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He doesn&#8217;t sleep because he&#8217;s afraid to miss something or to present something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because he has been afflicted with addiction so he cannot bear to be without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If only he had avoided it from the beginning, he would have been safe from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, have fear of Allah, O slaves of Allah. Protect your religion from these distractions, trials and evils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the best of speech is the book of Allah and the finest of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), and the worst of affairs are the newly invented ones and every innovation is misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stay with the body of Muslims upon the truth because Allah&#8217;s hand is upon the Jamaa&#8217;ah, and whoever deviated then he deviated in the hellfire.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Translated by Abu &#8216;Abdullah Naasir Hussain (Hafidhahullah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Transcribed text from the Video:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Noble Shaykh Saalih Al-Fawzaan حفظه الله</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.  May Allah send prayers and peace upon our Prophet Mohammad, and upon all his family and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To proceed:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, indeed we are&#8230;  and all praises are due to Allah&#8230;  in this month&#8230;  whomever Allah helps from amongst us, then we are upon great goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For it is a noble month, which Allah, the Most High far from imperfections, made better than other months.  Allah, the one far from imperfections, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Quran, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the criterion (between right and wrong). So whoever of you sights (the crescent on the first night of) the month (of Ramadan i.e. is present at his home), he must observe Saum (fasts) that month&#8230;”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah Al-Baqarah: 185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah made the fasting in it obligatory and praying during its nights voluntary.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fasting in it is the fourth pillar of Islam.  The standing at night in taraaweeh  and tahhajjud prayers is a Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah established by him, may Allah send prayers and peace upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasting has important rulings because it is a striving of oneself – striving of oneself against its desires.  The person leaves that which he desires, what his self wants, he leaves it in obedience to Allah, the Most High far from imperfections, preferring the obedience of Allah over the obedience of his own self.  He leaves that which he desires seeking to draw close to Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.  This is a sign of faith&#8230; this is a sign of faith&#8230; the one who chooses the obedience of Allah over the obedience to his self; this is a sign of his faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who is the opposite – the one who chooses obedience of oneself over the obedience of Allah, then he is a hypocrite.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the believer during these days knows that Allah has commanded him to leave his food, drink and (relations with) his wife; leaving these for Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.  Then, from the Mercy of Allah, the One free from imperfections, is that He has provided for him a time in which he can enjoy these desired things which are permissible.  They are impermissible during the day because of fasting, but are allowed at night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Saum (the fasts)&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Until the saying of Allah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“&#8230;and eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night), then complete your Saum (fast) till the nightfall&#8230;”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah Al-Baqarah: 187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, He designated the fast to begin at Fajr time and end at sunset.  The night is the setting of the sun.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer obeys Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.  He breaks his fast at the time of breaking the fast.  It is obligatory upon him to break his fast at the time of breaking the fast, just as it is obligatory upon him to fast at the time of fasting, because he is a slave of Allah.  He obeys Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, in those things that he has ordered and abstains from those things that he has prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not allowed for a person to continuously fast during the day and night – this is not allowed.  He, may Allah send prayers and peace upon him, prohibited al-wisaal (fasting continuously without breaking the fast).  They said: &#8216;O messenger of Allah, you perform a continuous fast&#8217;.  He used to perform a continuous fast, but this is from the things that were specific to him, may Allah send prayers and peace upon him.  This is from the things that were specific to The Messenger.  As for us, then we break our fast at the time of breaking the fast and we fast at the time of fasting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if a person fasts, then this does not mean that he follows (the example only) in leaving food, drink and (relations with) his wife, rather he leaves all of that which Allah has prohibited for him outside of the time of fasting, because there are things that are always prohibited and there are those things that are allowed but they are prohibited at the time of fasting only:  eating, drinking and relations with the wife – these are allowed at other than the time of fasting.  So, they are allowed at a given time and prohibited at a given time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those things which are not allowed, such as, back-biting, tale-spreading,  false speech, cursing, prohibited speech, looking at that which is prohibited and listening to that which is prohibited, these are prohibited forever and always.  So, if a person does these things during the fast, then this makes his fast deficient or could invalidate the reward of his fast, so no reward remains for him with Allah.  He justify his food and drink, which are allowed at other than the time of fasting, but he didn&#8217;t leave that which Allah prohibited for him at all times.  That which Allah prohibited at all times, he didn&#8217;t leave it – so this one, in reality didn&#8217;t fast!  He fasted from one perspective – fasted from that which Allah allowed, and he wasn’t fasting from those things that Allah prohibited!  So for this one, there is no reward!  His share from the fasting is just hunger and thirst, as the Messenger of Allah, may Allah send prayers and peace upon him, stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It may be that a fasting person’s portion from his fast is merely hunger and thirst”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, it may be that the share of the one who stands in prayer is merely staying up late.  Why?  Because he didn&#8217;t purify his intention for Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, in his standing for prayer.  He stands in order to show-off and to be heard of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“And when they stand up for As-Salat (the prayer), they stand with laziness and to be seen of men, and they do not remember Allah but little”.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah An-Nisaa: 142]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Things are based upon the sincerity to Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, and obedience to Allah, the Mighty and Majestic, as Allah ordered you to break your fast, you break it&#8230; he ordered you to fast – fast.  You are a slave to Allah, the Most High far from imperfections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is amazing is that many people especially in our times, they fast, they fast, they leave food, drink and those apparent things that break the fast – they leave them.  But, they don&#8217;t perform the prayers at their appointed times.  They sleep through them – they sleep throughout the whole day!  There is no Fajr prayer, no Thuhr prayer, no ‘Asr prayer!  They get up at the time of breaking the fast.  If the time for breaking the fast comes, they get up to eat and drink.  Their prayer has been lost.  These people have no fast with Allah, the Mighty and Majestic.  They have no fast with Allah, even though they fasted in the daytime.  They justify food and drink but, they have no fast with Allah!  Why?  Because the one who justify the prayer, then there is no fast for him.  The prayer is the second pillar of Islam and fasting is the fourth pillar.  So, the fast is not accepted from the one who has neglected the prayer.  These ones neglect the prayer and they fast?  This will not be of any use to them and it will not benefit them with Allah, the Most High far from imperfections, until they establish the prayer.  There is no religion for the one who doesn&#8217;t establish the prayer – he has no religion!  Because the prayer is a pillar of Islam.  It is the distinguishing factor between a Muslim and a disbeliever.  The one who doesn&#8217;t pray, is a disbeliever.  The one who totally abandons the prayer is a disbeliever, by the consensus of the scholars.  As for the one who didn&#8217;t leave the prayer, but doesn&#8217;t offer it at the times that Allah has legislated, this one didn&#8217;t pray – he neglected his prayer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Then, there has succeeded them a posterity who have given up As-Salat (the prayers) [i.e. made their Salat (prayers) to be lost, either by not offering them or by not offering them perfectly or by not offering them in their proper fixed times, etc.] and have followed lusts&#8230;”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah Maryam: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“So woe unto those performers of Salat (prayers) (hypocrites), who delay their Salat (prayer) from their stated fixed times”.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Soorah Al-Maa&#8217;oon: 4-5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He named them as those who pray – they pray, but at a time which is other than the time which Allah ordered them.  So they have neglected it and its prescribed time.  Allah warned them with wayl and punishment – al-wayl is punishment and we seek refuge with Allah.  He is punished and he prays?  Yes, he is punished!  He is punished and he prays, because he didn&#8217;t pray as he was ordered to do so by Allah, rather he prays as his self tells him to.  This means that he is a slave to himself and his desires and not a slave to Allah, the Most High far from imperfections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim should be aware of these issues.  He should preserve his religion, his prayers, his Zakaah, his fasting, his Hajj, his ‘Umrah, his whole religion.  This is the one who is a Muslim.  As for the one who establishes a part of the religion, and leaves another part, this is like the one who lives in a ruined house – it doesn&#8217;t have doors or walls!  A dilapidated house!  It doesn&#8217;t protect him from the heat or the cold or prevent thieves.  Likewise in Islam, the one who doesn&#8217;t live upon that which Allah has ordered, then this will not benefit him, even if he is named as being upon Islam.  Islam is indeed as Allah has ordered – it is submission to Allah &#8211; submission to Allah by singling him out (in worship).  Subservience to him with obedience.  Distancing oneself from associating partners to Allah and from the polytheists – this is Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah that he helps us to righteous speech and action.  May Allah send prayers and peace upon our Prophet Mohammad, and upon all his family and companions.</p>

</div>
<p><span style="text-align:justify;">The </span><i style="text-align:justify;">Nikah</i><span style="text-align:justify;"> is from the ways of Allah with regard to his creation, between the children of Adam, male and female.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With it there are great benefits, from them: chastity of the two spouses, one to the other; to fulfill what is required from the husband towards his wife; the husband taking care of his wife; and protecting her. From it is also the fulfilling of the desires of both sexes and from it is having children. There are many benefits from <i>Nikah</i>&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most important thing is that it keeps you chaste from adultery, from fornication and the loss of lineage, and from the corruption of moral uprightness. There is the protection of one’s health.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for adultery and fornication then their end place is in epidemics and in lethal illnesses, as is well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><b>وَلَا تَقْرَبُوا الزِّنَا إِنَّهُ كَانَ فَاحِشَةً وَسَاءَ سَبِيلًا ٣٢</b><b></b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">And come not near to unlawful sexual intercourse. Verily, it is a <i>Fahishah</i> [i.e. anything that transgresses its limits (a great sin)], and an evil way (that leads one to Hell unless Allah forgives him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">[Surah Al-&#8216;Isrā&#8217;:32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With it there is the loss of lineage, the spread of illnesses, the loss of modesty and chastity. With it there are great harms; fornication, we seek refuge with Allah, what an evil way. The harms of fornication are not limited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With <i>Nikah</i>, there is a protection from fornication and from its harms, and all praises are due to Allah. <i>Nikah</i> produces offspring. As for fornication then it is a loss. The offspring from fornication have no father and no lineage, and we seek refuge with Allah. Lost&#8230; This is from the disadvantages of fornication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Allah) didn&#8217;t say don&#8217;t fornicate, he said don&#8217;t come close to it, &#8216;don&#8217;t come near to it&#8217;, i.e. stay away from the means that lead to fornication. Such as: looking, the seclusion with a man, the traveling of the woman by herself, her showing off her beauty. These are means that lead to falling into fornication. Allah has not allowed them, he has prohibited them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there is leniency in these means then fornication will take place. If there is leniency in these means then fornication will take place, because the desires are present. Desires are present between men and women. If they sat together and mixed then fornication is close. <i>Shaytaan</i> is present, if a man secluded himself with a woman, then <i>shaytaan</i> is the third one amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say you have bad thoughts and that you are pessimists. We are not pessimists, this is the reality. This is the reality and if these means that Allah has prohibited are violated, then fornication will occur, no doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even the righteous man, the religious one, there is a danger upon him from the woman. Especially if she was beautiful and he secluded himself with her or traveled with her or she joined him at work. Or if she sat with him in the classroom, or in an exam, or in meetings. Or if she sat with him on the television, or on the radio, as his colleague, i.e. a presenter next to him, and she is beautified and he is a youth. Far is Allah from all imperfections. Do you bring petrol next to fire? Petrol is by itself and the fire is by itself. You bring her next to him! This is like that; no it is worse than petrol and fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Desires… we seek refuge with Allah, desires are strong. So for this reason Allah (the Exalted, Most High), has placed barriers that prevent falling in to fornication. If they are preserved, fornication is lessened or cut-off. If they are lost, then fornication will occur without a doubt. No matter what, even if they are religious or modest, the children of Adam are not saved from fornication except by the means that prevent it.</p>
