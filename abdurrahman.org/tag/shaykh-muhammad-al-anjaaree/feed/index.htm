<span style="color:#993300;"> Taken from the book<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">‘The Life of the Greatest Man After the Prophets &amp; Messengers: Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq’</span></span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Compiled By Muhammad Uthmaan al-Anjaaree</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- On the authority of Abu Huraira -Radi Allaahu anhu- who said the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- prayed the morning prayer, then he faced the people and said: ‘While a man was leading a cow, he began to ride it and beat it. So the cow said to him: ‘we were not created for this, rather we were created for ploughing.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people said: ‘Subhana Allaah a cow spoke!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘<strong>Indeed I believe this, me and Abu Bakr and Umar.’</strong> Even though they were not present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- continued: ‘While a man was with some sheep, suddenly a wolf attacked them and took away one sheep from amongst them. The shepherd called the sheep as if trying to rescue it from the wolf. The wolf said to him: ‘You want to rescue it from me, so who will protect it on the day when the predatory animal comes, the day when it has no shepherd other than me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the people said: ‘Subhana Allaah, a wolf spoke.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: ‘Indeed I believe this, me and Abu Bakr and Umar.’ Even though they were not present.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">* Hafidh Ibn Hajr said: ‘It is possible that the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said that due to what he knew of their overwhelming Eemaan and the strength of their certainty.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- On the authority of Abu Huraira -Radi Allaahu anhu- who said the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said: There was a man walking wearing a garment whose appearance impressed his own self. Allaah made the ground swallow him up and he kept tumbling down into it until the Day of Judgement.’ Abu Bakr and Umar testified to it, while Abu Bakr and Umar were not present.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- On the authority of Ayyoob who said: that AbdurRahmaan bin Abu Bakr said to his father (Abu Bakr): I saw you on the day of Uhud but I avoided you. So Abu Bakr said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘if I had seen you I would not have avoided you.’</strong></span>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- On the authority of Umar:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘If the Eemaan of Abu Bakr was weighed against the Eemaan of the people of the earth, the Eemaan of Abu Bakr would outweigh the others.’</strong></span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- On the authority of Aa’ishah who said: <strong>‘I swear by Allaah that Abu Bakr left drinking alcohol in pre-Islaamic times and he did not doubt in Allaah after having accepted Islaam.’</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- On the authority of Ibn Shihaab who said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘From the excellence of Abu Bakr is that he never ever doubted in Allaah – Azza wa Jal – even for an hour.’</strong></span>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- On the authority of Bakr bin Abdullaah who said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Indeed the people did not prefer Abu Bakr because he would pray and fast more than them, rather they preferred him due to something his heart.’</strong></span>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aboo Bakr did not have excellence over the people ( lam yafdulin-naasa) on account of praying and fasting more than them, but rather he had excellence over them on account of something which was in his heart.&#8217; -And I think the reference should be Narrated by Imam Ahmad in ‘Fadail as-Sahabah’ with this wording (1:141) no. 118 .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from the book: ‘The Life of the Greatest Man After the Prophets &amp; Messengers: Abu Bakr asSiddeeq’ P.190-191]</p>

<span style="color:#666699;">Compiled By Muhammad Uthmaan al-Anjaaree</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the level excellence of Abu Bakr then Umar, then Uthmaan and Ali, then this is agreed upon between the Imams of knowledge and <em>Deen</em>, from amongst the Companions and <em>Taba’een</em>.  It is the <em>Madhab</em> of Malik, <em>Ahl-ul- Madinah</em>, Abu Hanifah, Hamad bin Zayed, Hamad bin Salamah and the likes of them from the people of Iraq and it is the <em>Madhab</em> of Shaafi’ee, Ahmad, Ishaq, Abu Ubayd and other than them from the Imams of Islaam who have a truthful tongue from amongst the <em>Ummah</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Majmoo’ al-Fatawa 4/421]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b – Imam Nawawi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The <em>Ummah</em> is agreed upon the correctness of the <em>Khalafah</em> of Abu Bakr and his precedence over the Companions <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>&#8211; due to him being the best of them, and the most deserving for the <em>Khalafah</em> than other than him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Tahathab al-‘Asmaa 2/191]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c – Hafidh Suyootee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah</em> are united that the best person after the Messenger of Allaah is Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan and then Ali.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Tareekh al-Khulafah p.34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">d – From Ibn Abi Layla who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Bakr and Umar were being discussed, so a man from ‘Attarad said: ‘Umar is better than Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Jarrood said: ‘Rather Abu Bakr is better than him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This news reached Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>, and he began to beat him with a stick until he ran off, then he turned to al-Jarrood but he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Be away from me!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Umar said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Bakr was the best of the people after the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in such and such thing.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Umar said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever says other than this, then we will do to him what we do to a slanderer.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal in ‘as-Sunnah’ 2/579]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">e – From Abdullaah bin Salmah who said I heard Ali saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best of the people after the Messenger of Allaah is Abu Bakr, and the best of the people after Abu Bakr is Umar . . . . .’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Majah &amp; authenticated by Albaani no. 86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">f – From Abu Juhayfah who said: ‘I heard Ali saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shall I not inform you who is the best of this <em>Ummah</em> after its Prophet, it is Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ali continued:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Shall I not inform you who is the best of this <em>Ummah</em> after Abu Bakr it is Umar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad &amp; authenticated by Ahmad Shakir. Imam Dhahabi said in ‘Tareekh al-Khulafah’ p.115: ‘I swear by Allaah the Magnificent, that this is what Ali said and it is<em>Mutawatir</em> from him, because he said this while on the <em>Mimbar</em> in Koofah, may Allaah fight the Rafidaah, how ignorant they are!’]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">g – From Muhammad bin al-Hanafeeyah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I said to Ali bin Abi Taalib: O my father, who of the people is the best after the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal in ‘as-Sunnah’ No.1363]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">h – From Muhammad bin al-Hanafeeyah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I asked my father, who of the people is the best after the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘Abu Bakr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked: ‘Then who?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘then Umar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I feared that he would say Uthmaan, I then said: ‘Then you?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I am no other than a person from amongst the Muslims.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i – From Shaqeeq who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It was said to Ali <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>: ‘Will you not appoint a leader?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> did not appoint a leader, so how can I appoint one.  If Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> wants good for the people then He gathers them as He gathered them after their Prophet upon the best of them.’ [i.e. Abu Bakr]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Abi Aassim in ‘as-Sunnah’ 1221]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">j – From Sufyan at-Thawri who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever claims that Ali <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> was more deserving of ruler ship than Abu Bakr and Umar, then he has claimed that Abu Bakr was wrong, likewise Umar, the<em>Muhajiroon</em>, and the <em>Ansaar</em>.  I hold the opinion that this person’s good actions will not rise up to the heavens (not accepted by Allaah), if he holds this view.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abu Dawood &amp; Albaani said it is Saheeh al-Isnaad although it is disconnected. No.4387]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">k – From Abdullaah bin Umar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We used to say while the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was alive: ‘The best of the <em>Ummah</em> of the Prophet after the Prophet is Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Abu Dawood, Ibn Abi Aassim in ‘as-Sunnah’ &amp; Abdullaah bin Ahmad in ‘as-Sunnah’, Albaani said it’s <em>Isnad</em> is Saheeh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">l – From Ibn Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘During the time of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> we would not equate anyone along with Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan then we would leave the Companions of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and not choose a preference between them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">m – From Shaafi’ee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Companions and their followers are gathered upon the excellence and precedence of Abu Bakr, then Umar, then Uthmaan, then Ali.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘al-Itiqaad’ by Bayhaqi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">n – Imam Dhahabi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The scholars of the Sunnah are agreed that the best of the Companions are the ten who had been testified with entering Paradise.  The best of those ten were Abu Bakr, then Umar bin al-Khattab, then Uthmaan bin ‘Affan, then Ali bin Abi Taalib <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum ajmaeen</em>&#8211; and no one doubts that except an innovator, a hypocrite, or a filthy person.’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Love of Ahl-ul-Bayt <em>-RadiAllaah anhum-</em> for the<em>Khalifah</em> of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –<br />
</em>Taken from the book ‘The Life of the Greatest Man After the Prophets &amp; Messengers: Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq’</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Compiled By Muhammad Uthmaan al-Anjaaree</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- On the authority of ‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; who said: If it was that I heard a hadeeth from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>then Allaah would cause me to benefit me from it with whatever He willed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If anyone other than myself would narrate to me from the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>, I would request of him to swear that he heard it and if he swore then I would believe him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Abu Bakr narrated to me, and Abu Bakr spoke the truth, that he heard the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is no-one who commits a sin, then performs <em>Wudu</em> correctly, prays two <em>Rakah</em> and seeks forgiveness from Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal &#8211;</em>except that he is forgiven.’[0]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- Fatima <em>–RadhiAllaahu anha</em>&#8211; said to Abu Bakr, the <em>Khalifah</em> of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>: ‘You and what you heard from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> know better.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- ‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; said to Abu Bakr <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; in front of Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>: ‘Indeedwe know well, O Abu Bakr, your excellence,’ and he mentioned their relationship with the Messenger of Allaah  <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em>and their rights.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em>: ‘It reached ‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; that Ibn Sowda’ cursed Abu Bakr and Umar, so he requested his presence.  It was said that he requested him to attendin order to kill him, but Ibn Sowda’ escaped ‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; also said: No-one comes to me, preferring meover Abu Bakr and Umar <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhuma</em>&#8211; except that I will lash him with the punishment of slanderer.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – Shaykhul-Islaam &#8211;<em>Rahimullaah-</em> said: ‘Alee –<em>RadhiAllaahu anhu</em>&#8211; named his two sons Abu Bakr and Umar.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:justify;">The Da&#8217;wah Sharee&#8217;ah [1] has its basis in the Book and the Sunnah, and its starting point is love for Allaah and desire for His Jannah (Paradise) and fear of His (Hell)Fire, and the way which the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions (radiAllaahu anhuma) were upon. Its end result is with Allaah, <em>&#8220;Verily, you do not guide those whom you love, but Allaah guides whomever He wills.&#8221;</em> [2]</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">The da&#8217;wah Siyaasiyyah (the political da&#8217;wah) [3] has its basis in politics, its starting point is ideological, and its means are the party and the organization and the jamaa&#8217;ah, and its end result is planned and designed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah seeks to unite the Ummah upon the foundations of the belief which the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam) and his Companions embodied by the saying of Allaah the Exalted: &#8220;And hold on to the Rope of Allaah all of you together and do not divide amongst yourselves.&#8221; [4]</td>
<td>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah seeks to struggle for the promotion of parties (ahzaab) in the Muslim country to secure for itself a seat amongst the ranks of the [other] parties of the state. And they read the saying of Al-Haqq [Allaah], the Exalted: &#8220;And be not like those who divided and differed among themselves after the clear proofs had come to them. It is they for whom there is a terrible punishment.&#8221; [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying, Exalted is He:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;But they have broken their religion into sects, each group rejoicing in what it has.&#8221;</em> [6]</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah criticizes by sincere advice, by eloquence and wisdom and handsome admonition, complying with the principles of the Sharee&#8217;ah.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah criticizes by open demonstrations, sit-ins and strikes, and through rousing the (people in the) street under the pretense of islaah (rectification)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah is concerned with the guidance of mankind to obedience to Allaah and adherence to His law(shar &#8216;)</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah is concerned with the achievement of appeasing the people through success in elections, and then exerting pressure on the government to meet their partisan demands, the most important of which is their reaching power (in the government)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah looks to the Muslim for what is apparent, and that verily he is from among the Muslims, and you address him with the name of Islaam.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah looks to the Muslim for what is of benefit to the party (hizb) and the organization, so perhaps this is often the cause of their saying: &#8220;so and so is a secularist&#8221;, &#8220;so and so is a liberal&#8221;, &#8220;un-islaamic&#8221; , and so on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah, its leaders are the `Ulamaa ar-Rabbaaniyoon [7] recognized for their leadership and protection [of the Ummah], like : al-`Allaamah Muhammad Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee, al-`Allaamah `Abdul-`Azeez bin Baaz and al-`Allaamah Muhammad bin Saalih al-&#8216;Uthaymeen ? may Allaah have mercy upon them all -, so verily from them was an effect on hearts of the common Muslims and the students of knowledge.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah, its leaders are the politicians. They have no connection to knowledge, and they don&#8217;t have an effect on the hearts of the common Muslims, verily their effect is on the members of the Hizb (party) and the organization only.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah calls them to believe and work in the da&#8217;wah to earn Allaah&#8217;s Pleasure, and not on the basis of gaining status and prestige.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah, some of its call is their making an affiliation to the hizb (party) a means to achievement, so it is their means for obtaining position and status.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah, its callers spend from their own wealth, as embodied in the saying of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam) &#8220;And do not ask the people for anything&#8221; [8], and by that they are also in agreement with the Prophets (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam) saying: &#8220;The upper hand is better than the lower hand.&#8221; [9]</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah , its collection boxes and bank allotments and asking of the people is their constant, inseparable characteristic. Indeed it is from their most apparent traits. And they believe that these financial resources are a mainstay of their da&#8217;wah and their activities.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:justify;">The people of Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah, their manhaj (methodology) is clear for them, so there is no secrecy and no covertness, so they are &#8220;upon al-Baydaa&#8217; (a clear proof), its night is like its day (in clarity).&#8221; [10]</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah, their manhaj is secrecy and obscurity, and devoid of clarity in those matters that it is obligatory to make clear.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah, its positions are fixed and clear, and even if it differs with most of mankind.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah, its positions change, so what was correct yesterday perhaps will be wrong today, and what was wrong today could be correct tomorrow, and so on.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah derives the steps of islaah (rectification) through the legislative texts [i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan and authentic Sunnah], and even if this rectification wasn&#8217;t achieved, so verily he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam) said: &#8221; And a Prophet will come and there will not be anyone with him&#8221; [11]- meaning a Prophet from among the Prophets of Allaah will come on Yawm al-Qiyaamah (the Day of Resurrection) and not one person believed in him, and he didn&#8217;t change the condition of any one from the individuals of his society which he was sent amongst, so this Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wasallam) called to rectification, and no one from his people answered him.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah derives the steps of islaah through achievement of forming the political decision, and through &#8220;the aim justifies the means&#8221;.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah ash-Sharee&#8217;ah, its flags and signs are known by their scholastic efforts through exerting themselves to spread the correct `Aqeedah and the Sunnah.</td>
<td style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Da&#8217;wah as-Siyaasiyyah, its flags and signs are manifest and known by the virtues of the Jamaa&#8217;ah and the Hizb and its wealth and its influence, so if you go back in your memory through history, you know that its leaders who were well known, they didn&#8217;t reach the position which they reached except through the Jamaa&#8217;ah, the Hizb, and its wealth. I will give you an example to make clear the difference between the true flags of al-Haqq (the truth) and other than them:So al-`Allaamah Naasiruddeen al-Albaanee, verily love of him is fixed firmly in the hearts of al-`Aalaameen, and his leadership in `uloomud-Deen (the sciences of the Religion) is firmly established through his strength and steadfastness in sharee&#8217; (legislated) knowledge. And there was no charity to publish his books, and no committee to pay for his expenses, no organization to sponsor his residency visa, and no hizb which promotes his efforts, nor media to publish his essays and show his pictures. On the contrary, his establishment in knowledge was his sign, so he was able to face the nations and the people with his knowledge and understanding, without any organization or leader, and no support except through the Tawfeeq of Allaah. Therefore it was his knowledge which made his leadership a duty upon him in all areas. Noble reader, the saying goes:&#8221;And with its opposite, things are made known.&#8221;</td>

[9] Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (1472) and Saheeh Muslim (1033, 1035, 1036).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[TN]: The narrations that show that the way of Ahlus-Sunnah is not asking the people for their filth (their sadaqaat) are many and clear. So those who ascribe themselves to the way of the Salaf and want to call to the Haqq, they do not establish their da&#8217;wah upon asking for the peoples money. Rather they establish their da&#8217;wah upon hard work and spending upon their da&#8217;wah from their own pockets. And Shaykh Ahmad as-Subay&#8217;ee explains, you will not find even one athar (narration) from the Companions, nor the Taabi&#8217;een, nor the Atbaa&#8217;ut-Taabi&#8217; een, nor those who followed after them where they stood up in the masjid to ask the people for their sadaqaat ý not one! And if this had been their way and their guidance, they would have done it. And from those matters which distinguish the Da&#8217;watus-Salafiyyah from all the other da&#8217;waat is that we take the understanding of the Book and the Sunnah from these aathaar (narrations) from the Salaf of this Ummah, contrary to the political groups and parties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Ahmad (4/126), Ibn Maajah (43), and al-Haakim (1/96). Al-`Allamah al-Albaanee declared it Saheeh in Saheeh al-Jaami&#8217; (4369).<br />

Amma-ba&#8217;d</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Call is to Correct What People Have Corrupted<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>, by Shaykh Muhammad al-Anjaree (hafidhahullaah Ta&#8217;aala)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">[The following are notes &#8211; not verbatim &#8211; from this highly beneficial Scholarly Lesson and Advice]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">After beginning with the name of Allaah, and praising Allaah, and asking Allaah to send His peace and security upon the noblest of His Messengers, our Prophet Muhammad, then Shaikh Al-Anjaree greeted the Muslims with the greeting of Islaam &#8211; as-salamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa baarakatu &#8211; before beginning:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:x-large;color:#000000;">كُنْتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَتَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You [true believers in Tawheed, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad, and his Sunnah] are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma&#8217;roof (Tawheed and all that Islaam has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islaam has forbidden), and you believe in Allaah&#8230;</strong> (Aali &#8216;Imran, ayah 110)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah, Ta&#8217;aala, said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:x-large;color:#000000;">وَلْتَكُنْ مِنْكُمْ أُمَّة ٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنْكَرِ وَأُوْلَائِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Let there arise out of you a group of people inviting to all that is good (Islaam), enjoining Al-Ma&#8217;roof (Tawheed and all that Islaam orders one to do) and forbidding Al-Munkar (polytheism and disbelief and all that Islaam has forbidden). And it is they who are the successful.</strong> (Aali &#8216;Imran, ayah 104)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, has made the goodness of this nation in its commanding of the good and forbidding of the evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Commanding the good means commanding with the Religion, with Tawheed &#8211; that Allaah be singled out with worship &#8211; and the correct Manhaj and the Sunnah. And forbidding the evil means that they forbid Shirk, Bid&#8217;ah, and sins, and whatever is contrary to this Religion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So the good comes about with enjoining of the good and forbidding the evil. And this is what Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, commanded us with. So this Ummah is commanded to enjoin the good, and this was the duty carried out by the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and the Sahaba (radiallaahu Ta&#8217;aala &#8216;anhum), who called to good and called to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The Sahaaba called to good, and they likewise forbade all evil, all that the Religion prohibits, such as Shirk, Bid&#8217;ah, and the rest of the evil &#8211; everything that runs contrary to this Deen.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The flag-bearers, banner-carriers of the Sunnah are the carriers of this Religion, and they are those who command with the Sunnah and forbid Bid&#8217;ah, and the sahaaba (radiallaahu Ta&#8217;aala &#8216;anhum) carried out this role and were the carriers of this banner, and this is clear from their narrations.*</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is reported that Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radiallaahu &#8216;anhumma) said: <strong>&#8220;By Allaah, I do not think that anyone will be more pleased with my death than Shaytaan.&#8221;</strong> It was said, &#8220;How is that?&#8221; He replied, <strong>&#8220;An innovation is invented in the East or the West, and a man brings it to me. When it reaches me, I crush it with the Sunnah.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">They [the Sahaaba] called to revival of the Sunnah, and from forbidding evil is to demolish innovations (heresies).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So when it reached &#8216;Umar ibn al-Khattab (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu) that Sabeegh ibn &#8216;Asl had come up with some tafseer of the Qur`an off the top of his head, from Soorat an-Nazi&#8217;at, &#8216;Umar told him: <strong>If you were <em>MuHaliqqa</em> (bold-headed, like the Khawaarij), I would have cut off your neck.</strong> Meaning (he would have done that) to preserve the religion, the Sunnah, the methodology of Prophethood. This was their eager concern.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Ordering the good &#8211; the Sunnah &#8211; and forbidding evil &#8211; bid&#8217;ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) described these people of truth, these people of strangeness in his saying: <strong>Glad tidings is for the strangers. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He was asked: Who are the strangers? He (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>They are a righteous people amongst many evil people. Those who disobey them will be more than those who obey them.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So these are the strangers. The sahaba (radiallaahu &#8216;anhum) were like this. As was indicated by the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) in his saying: <strong>Islaam began as strange, and it will return strange as it began. So glad tidings to the strangers.</strong> [Saheeh Muslim, no. 145] He was asked: Who are the strangers? He (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>They are a righteous people amongst many evil people. Those who disobey them will be more than those who obey them. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Obey them in what?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Meaning those who obey them in their call to the Sunnah and clarifying the truth and seeking to kill off &#8211; refute &#8211; bid&#8217;ah and falsehood.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>Whoever revives a Sunnah from my Sunnah, and the people act upon it, then for him will be the reward for all those who act on it.</strong> [Ibn Majah]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">This is the Sunni who commands the Sunnah &#8211; commands the good &#8211; and forbids the evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Whoever revives a Sunnah &#8211; from the Prophet&#8217;s Manhaj, his path &#8211; and calls to the Sunnah, and the people act on it, so he receives the reward of all those who act on it without their reward reducing. This Sunni is the one who enjoins the good and forbids the evil. And this is a bounty from Allaah, Who bestows this upon whomever He wishes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">And opposite to this: <strong>Whoever calls to bid&#8217;ah, he will incur the sin of all those who act on it, without their sins reducing.</strong> So therefore, it is a right upon the people of the Sunnah &#8211; callers to the truth &#8211; to carry out this role, and call to the Sunnah, and strive to uproot innovation (heresies).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The true person of the Sunnah strives to uproot bid&#8217;ah. A person truly upon the Sunnah calls to the revival of the Sunnah. A person of bid&#8217;ah calls to revival of bid&#8217;ah. The Sunni encourages people upon the Sunnah and upon crushing bid&#8217;ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It has been reported that the Mesenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said about the strangers: <strong>They will be a people who rectify what the people have corrupted from my Sunnah after me.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Imam at-Tirmidhi said it is hasan-saheeh. [Although some scholars of hadeeth have said it is not authentic,] the meaning of this is correct. The strangers are those who rectify what people have corrupted from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) after his passing. So, this is the description of the strangers, that they rectify what the people have corrupted. <em>Fasad</em> (corruption) comes about as a result of bid&#8217;ah &#8211; no doubt. Bid&#8217;ah results in corruption &#8211; no doubt!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A person upon the Sunnah calls to the Sunnah, and seeks to benefit the people with what is beneficial in their beliefs, sayings, actions, and methodologies, and strives to rectify what people have corrupted.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So these are <em>Al-Ghuraabah</em> (the strangers). They are the people of the Sunnah, those who revive the Sunnah of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and who revive the Prophet&#8217;s Methdology, and bring back to life what has been killed from his Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Because in the hadeeth, the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>Whoever revives a Sunnah from my Sunnah.</strong>.. This being the opposite of killing off a Sunnah.** Then the Sunni comes and he revives it, brings it back to life (after learning it, he practices it, becomes firm upon it, and teaches it to others). This is their role.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">And this is why Imam Ahmad (rahimahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said about them (those who call to the Sunnah and its revival) in the introduction of his book <strong><em>Ar-Rad &#8216;alal Jahmiyyah</em></strong> (The Refutation upon the Jahmiyyah):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;<strong>All praise is for Allaah, Who leaves a group after the Messengers from amongst the people of knowledge who negate the changes, distortions of those who go to the extreme. And the changes of those who are ignorant. [This group] is those who call people from misguidance to guidance, and are patient upon harm. How many are they who have gone astray whom they helped bring back to guidance? How many are those [whose eeman] have been killed by Iblees whom they have helped give life to again? How beautiful is their effect upon the people, and how ugly and vile is the effect of the people upon them?</strong>&#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Imam Ahmad described these callers to the Sunnah by saying about them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>How beautiful is their effect upon the people, and how ugly and vile is the effect of the people upon them?  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">How ugly is the effect of those who raise the banner of bid&#8217;ah upon the people of the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The people of the Sunnah are the strangers, those who repel the false distortions, the false tafseer, and refute the changes. The strangers correctly interpret and understand the Qur`an and Sunnah, and the Names and Attributes of Allaah.</strong> <strong>Those who carry this duty are the Awliyya` of Allaah, the beloved and obedient servants of Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said: &#8220;<strong>Those who establish the duty of preserving what was inherited from the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; and safeguard it from any addition or deletion &#8211; <span style="font-size:medium;">are from the greatest of the awliyya` of Allaah</span>; they are of the beloved servants of Allaah and His party.</strong>&#8220;</span></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;color:#000000;">Pay attention to what Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;<strong>Those who establish the duty of preserving what was inherited from the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; and safeguard it from any addition or deletion &#8211; <span style="font-size:medium;">are from the greatest of the awliyya` of Allaah</span>; they are of the beloved servants of Allaah and His party.</strong>&#8220;</span></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So this is the duty and role of Ahlus-Sunnah, who revive what Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah have killed off.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">If a Sunni is asked: what do you call to?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He [the Sunni] says: I call to the religion of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; reviving it and reviving the Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah &#8211; and to crushing Bid&#8217;ah so as to make the truth clear from innovations (bid&#8217;ah), distortions and false interpretations.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah, The Most High, consoled His Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:x-large;color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ كُذِّبَتْ رُسُل ٌ مِنْ قَبْلِكَ فَصَبَرُوا عَلَى مَا كُذِّبُو</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, (many) Messengers were denied before you (O Muhammad), but with patience they bore the denial&#8230;</strong> (Al-An&#8217;aam, ayah 34)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">This shows us that this path that the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and his companioions proceeded upon is a path that requires patience. So, oh person who carries the banner of the Sunnah, you need to remember this and that you are a stranger.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">You will have to bear harm, just as Imam Ahmad (rahimahullaah) said: <strong>How beautiful is their effect upon the people, and how ugly and vile is the effect of the people upon them?  </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The person upon this path needs sabr. <em>The people need from you that you have sabr.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Imam Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;<strong>Whoever proceeds upon the Straight Path that the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and his companions were upon, let him make himself get used to trouble from the ignoramuses and Ahlul-Bid&#8217;ah, such as them belittling him, attacking him, warning against him</strong>.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">This is the path of the <em>ghuraba</em>, the strangers, Ahlus-Sunnah, those who want to revive what the people kill off from the Manhaj of Ahlus-Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">So you need to have <em>sabr</em> upon that. You will receive attacks from Ahlul Bid&#8217;ah, which is normal that it will happen, just as Imam Ahmad, Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahumullaah) said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>Ahead of you there lie days of patience, during which being patient will be like grasping a hot coal&#8230; </strong>***</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Meaning the one who clings to the Sunnah, the methodology of the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and his companions (radiallaahu &#8216;anhum).</span></p>
