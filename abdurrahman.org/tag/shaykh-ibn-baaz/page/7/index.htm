		<p><b>Ruling on restoration of monuments</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">All praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family and Companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some newspapers have published articles on reviving and paying attention to monuments, written by some authors, including Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Salih Muhammad Jamal. </span>These articles have been responded to by His Eminence, Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Humayd. </span>He efficiently and instructively answered to the claims included therein, may Allah reward him. However, Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Anwar Abul-Jadayil, </span>may Allah guide and inspire him with what is right, was not satisfied with that reply or had not seen it. Therefore, he wrote an article on the subject, published by the &#8216;Madinah&#8217; newspaper, issue number 5448, dated 22/4/1402 A.H. In this article, which is entitled &#8220;The Way of the Two Hijrahs&#8221;, he stated: &#8220;This is a review of the word published in the &#8216;Madinah&#8217; newspaper, issue 5433, on 7/4/1402 A.H., by Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdul-Quddus Al-Ansary, </span>as a commentary on the investigation done by the researcher and man of letters, Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdul-`Aziz Al-Rifa`y, </span>of the sites which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) passed through on his Hijrah (emigration) from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah </span>to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah. </span>It urges us to stimulate officials to set signs indicating such posts such as, for example, two tents as close as possible to the two tents of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Um Ma`bad </span>with whatever else is suitable for the rest of posts, after taking the necessary precautions to prevent any transgression that could impart to them the tinge of sanctity or glory, and any deviation from the requirements of Shari`ah (Islamic law). For, the aim is to inform students, researchers and tourists who want to know about this path and these posts, to perceive the difficulties that the Messenger (peace be upon him) went through during this secret and covert trip.This is meant only to give lesson and example and inure people to hardships in Da`wah (calling people to Allah), following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">However, side roads should be built and paved, off the main roads, with rest houses for the tourists, making it easier for people to enter the places where the Prophet (peace be upon him) passed, starting with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Hira&#8217; Cave, </span>then<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Thawr, </span>and the place where the Prophet (peace be upon him) was pursued by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Suraqah ibn Malik, </span>until we reach<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Quba&#8217;. </span>This should also include the preceding sites in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah Al-Mukarramah, </span>such as Dar<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Arqam ibn Abul-Arqam, </span>the pass where he and his family were boycotted, the pathway he assumed during the Conquest of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah, </span>and then the places he stopped at in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Abtah, </span>and also in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Hudaybiyah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Hunayn, </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Badr. </span>This also applies to sites he stopped at in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, </span>the battlefields of the conquests, and his places of presence in their rural areas, then his path to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Khaybar </span>and to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Tabuk. </span>This is thus meant to provide people with more information about his unique efforts in spreading the Da`wah, and to teach them to follow the Prophet&#8217;s example in that regard.<strong> [End of quote]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Likewise, Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Faruq Akhdar </span>recommended in his article, published in Al-Jazirah newspaper, issue number 3354, dated 13/1/1402 A.H., the development of archaeological sites in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by the Muslims on a continuing basis, to ensure income; as he alleged that petrol reserves would run out. Maintaining his viewpoint, he stated<em> &#8220;that Christian religious tourism in the Vatican is one of the main sources of income in Italian economy. Israel sold empty bottles to the Jews in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> America, </span>under the claim that such bottles were full of holy air from Al Quds.&#8221;</em> He also pointed out that among the benefits this will bring about is that it will<em> &#8220;Engrave knowledge about Islam in the minds of Muslim children&#8230;&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Due to the <strong>bad effects that reviving religious monuments have on the `Aqidah (creed)</strong>, I wanted to clarify the truth and corroborate the writings of scholars on this issue, cooperate with those scholars in righteousness and Taqwa (fear or wariness of offending Allah), advise people for the Sake of Allah, expose suspicious points, and illustrate supporting evidence. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Hence, I would like to say that taking care of monuments in the way mentioned above <strong>would lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)</strong>. This is because people&#8217;s souls are weak and are prone to cling to that which they deems beneficial. Besides, there are many types of Shirk, which are imperceptible for most people. Hence, those who stop at these monuments &#8211; whether they are real or fake monuments &#8211; will realize that ignorant people wipe themselves with the dirt of these places, and with the trees and stones therein. Those ignorant people also pray there and invoke those to whom the sites are attributed, thinking that this is a means of approaching Allah (Exalted be He), attaining Shafa`ah (intercession), and having theirs distresses relieved. Such an ignorance-based approach is maintained by misleading callers whose souls are impregnated with idolatry, and who exploit these monuments to misguide people and encourage them to visit these monuments in order to acquire some financial gains. Regretfully, there is no one at these monuments to inform people that they are meant only for people to derive an example. Rather, the opposite usually takes place. </span></p>

		<p><b>Warning against building Masjids over graves</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ctl00_RedirectContronl1_lblTitle">Fatwas of Ibn Baz :</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I was asked: Is it permissible to build a Masjid over the site of the People of the Cave? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, all praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have read the article published in the third edition of the Islamic Sciences League magazine in the &#8220;Muslim News in a Month&#8221; section.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Islamic Sciences League, in<span id="ContentParagraph"> The Hashemite Kingdom of <strong>Jordan</strong>, </span>intends to build a Masjid over the site of the cave recently discovered in<span id="ContentParagraph"> the village of Al-Rahib, </span>which is said to be the cave where <span id="ContentParagraph">the People of the Cave </span>mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an slept</span>.</span> End Quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As it is my duty to advise for the sake of Allah and His servants, I thought it would be beneficial to say a word in the same magazine of the Islamic Sciences League published in<span id="ContentParagraph"> the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. </span>I must <strong>admonish</strong> the league to give up the intention of building a Masjid over the site of this cave, mainly and solely for the reason that <strong><span style="color:#000000;">building Masjids over the graves and remains of the Prophets and righteous people is utterly forbidden by the Shari`ah (Islamic law) and that those who do so are cursed</span></strong>. This is because such an act <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>may lead to Shirk</strong></span> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and <strong><span style="color:#000000;">excessive veneration and over praising of the prophets and pious people</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reality bears witness to the validity of the texts of the Shari`ah and proves that it is revealed from Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), and provides decisive proof of the truthfulness of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the message sent down to him which he conveyed to the Ummah (nation). <span style="color:#ff6600;">Whoever is aware of the conditions that exist in the Islamic world and the acts of Shirk, excessive reverence of prophets and the pious that prevail due to establishing Masjids over shrines and glorifying them by means of lavish structures and the presence of custodians to collect money from people unlawfully, will certainly know that they are avenues leading to Shirk</span>. One of the outstanding virtues of Shari`ah is to forbid building of Masjids over graves and to warn sternly against it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Two Shaykhs,<span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Bukhari </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph"> Muslim </span>(may Allah be merciful to them), narrated some Hadiths to this effect on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph"> `Aishah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"><a name="MayAllahcursetheJewsandthe"></a><span style="color:#339966;"><span id="ContentParagraph">May Allah curse the Jews and the Christians; they have taken the graves of their prophets as places of worship</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">`Aishah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) said: <span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;</span><span style="color:#339966;">He warned against what they did and had it not been for this, his grave would have been raised above the ground but he feared that it would be taken as a Masjid</span><span style="color:#000000;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim that <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"><a name="UmSalamahandUmHabibah(may"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"> </span><span id="ContentParagraph" style="color:#339966;">Um Salamah and Um Habibah (may Allah be pleased with them) mentioned a church they had seen in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in which there were pictures. When they told the Prophet (peace be upon him) of this, he said, &#8216;When a pious person among these people died they built a place of worship over his grave and painted these pictures therein. They will be the worst of creation in the Sight of Allah</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related in Sahih<span id="ContentParagraph"> Muslim </span>on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jundub ibn `Abdullah </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (peace be upon him) five days before his death, stating: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"><a name="IstandfreeofblamebeforeAllah"></a><span style="color:#339966;"><span id="ContentParagraph"></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths in this regard. Imams of Muslim scholars from the four Madh-habs (Schools of Jurisprudence) and others have stated the prohibition of building Masjids over graves. They issued the sternest warning against doing so, urging Muslims to observe the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and advising this Ummah lest it should fall into the same excessiveness and veneration of the prophets and pious people the way its predecessors from the extremist<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jews </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph"> Christians </span>and their like who deviated from the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is incumbent upon the Islamic Sciences League in<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jordan </span>and Muslims to adhere to the Sunnah and the way of the righteous Imams, and to be cautious not to commit what Allah and His Messenger warned against. It is the only way that leads to people&#8217;s uprightness and happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. <span style="color:#ff6600;">It should be noted that some people formed their opinions based on the misinterpretation of Allah&#8217;s Statement in the story<span id="ContentParagraph"> of the People of the Cave: </span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Kahf, 18: 21" target="_blank" name="AndthusWemadetheircaseknown"></a>(then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): “We verily shall build a place of worship over them.”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this is that Allah (Praised and Exalted be He) informed us about the rulers and prominent people who announced this statement. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He told their story not by of expressing content and agreement with what they said, but rather as a kind of dispraise and expressing abhorrence of their action</strong></span>. This is even indicated by the Messenger (peace be upon him) to whom this Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) was revealed and was the most knowledgeable of its interpretation, for he forbade his Ummah from building Masjids over the graves and cursed and dispraised those who do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this had been permissible, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would not have strongly affirmed its prohibition to the extent of cursing those who did it, or describing them as the worst creatures in the Sight of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). This should be sufficient in pointing out the gravity implied in the matter and providing a convincing answer to those who seek the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Even if we supposed that building Masjids over graves was permissible for those who preceded us, still we are not permitted to follow their example because the Shari`ah (Islamic law) abrogates all previous laws, and our Prophet (peace be upon him) is the Last of the Messengers and the Shari`ah revealed to him is comprehensive</strong>. He (peace be upon him) forbade building Masjids over graves, and as such, we are not permitted to disobey him. We must follow his example and adhere to his Sunnah and abandon what contradicts it regarding the previous Shari`ahs (Divine laws) and favorable customs followed by some people, because Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah is perfect and comprehensive and no guidance is better than that of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah is the One Whom we invoke to grant all Muslims and us success and to keep us firm on the truth and help us adhere to the Sunnah of His Messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him) in words and deeds, whether manifested or hidden, and in all our daily affairs until we meet Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). Allah is the All-Hearer, Ever-Near and Responsive. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions and those who follow his guidance until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">By the Shaykh &#8211; the noble Scholar &#8211; &#8216;Abdul-Azeez bin Baaz [1]<br>
Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.3 &#8211; Rabî&#8217;ul-Awwal 1417H / August 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah and the blessing of Allaah and His peace be upon the Messenger, and upon his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance. After that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to celebrate <i>Milaadun-Nabee</i> (the birthday of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), nor the birthday of anyone else, since this is from the acts of <i>bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovations) that have been newly-invented into the religion. 2 Neither did Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, nor the Rightly-Guided <i>Khaleefahs</i> (Successors), nor the Companions, may Allaah be please with them all, nor any of their followers from the first three excellent generations, celebrate this day &#8211; and they were the most knowledgeable of people concerning the <i>Sunnah</i> (the Prophetic guidance), and had the greatest love for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and were the foremost in following his <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Laws).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been authentically established from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever introduces into this affair of ours, that which is not part of it, will have it rejected.&#8221;</i> 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another authentic narration, he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Hold fast to my Sunnah (guidance) and the way of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs after me, cling to it tightly. And beware of newly-invented matters, for every newly-invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance.&#8221;</i> 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these two narrations contain a strong warning against innovations in the religion, and acting upon them. This is why Allaah &#8211; the One free of all defects &#8211; says in His Clear Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And whatever the Messenger gives you, take it. Whatever he forbids you from, then keep away from it.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Hadeed 59:7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Let those beware who withstand the command of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, unless some trials and afflictions befall them, or unless they are afflicted with a painful punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:63].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And the first to embrace Islaam from the <i>Muhaajirs</i> and the <i>Ansaar</i>, and those who followed them in goodness, beliefs and actions. Allaah is well-pleased with them, and they are well-pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever. That is the supreme achievement.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:100].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen Islaam as your way of life.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verses with this meaning are plenty. So to accept this celebration, or any other newly-invented act of worship, implies that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; did not complete and perfect the religion for this Ummah, and that the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> did not completely convey to his Ummah what was necessary regarding their duties, until the advent of those who came later and innovated in the religion of Allaah that for which they had no permission, claiming that they would draw closer to Allaah by such innovations. And this &#8211; without doubt &#8211; is a great danger and amounts to criticising Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. For Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; has indeed perfected this religion for His servants, and has completed His favour upon them. And the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> has clearly conveyed the Message, not leaving any way that leads to Paradise, nor any way that distances a person from the Fire, except that he explained it to his Ummah. This has been established in an authentic narration, from &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, in which Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Allaah did not send any Prophet except that it was his duty to inform his Ummah of the good that he knew, and to warn them about the evils that he knew.&#8221;</i> 5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that our Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> is the best of all the Prophets and the last of them and the most perfect of them with regards to conveying the Message and advising the people. So if celebrating his <i> milaad</i> (birthday) was a part of the religion that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect chose, then the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> would have most certainly explained it to his Ummah, or he would have celebrated it himself, or his noble Companions <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> would have celebrated it. However, since nothing like this happened, then we know that the celebration of <i> milaad</i> has nothing to do with Islaam whatsoever. Rather, it is from those innovations which the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> warned his Ummah from, as has been shown in the preceding narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another authentic narration similar in meaning to the two preceding ones, and it is his <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying in his <i> Jumu&#8217;ah khutbah</i> (Friday sermon):<i> &#8220;Indeed the best speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best guidance and example is that of Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. And the worst affairs are the newly-invented ones, and every newly-invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance.&#8221;</i> 6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, a group of the Scholars rejected the practice of <i>milaad</i> and warned against it, acting upon the aforementioned proofs, and their like. However, some of the later Scholars differed, in that they have allowed such a practice, providing it does not entail any sinful and evil matters; such as exaggerating in the praise of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, or free-mixing between men and women, or the playing of musical instruments and singing, and other such matters which are rejected by the pure <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Law). They think that such a practice is a <i> bid&#8217;ah hasanah</i> (a good innovation in the religion). 7 However, the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> principle is: whenever any dispute arises amongst the people, then the issue should be referred back to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of His Messenger, Muhammad <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you. If you differ in anything amongst yourselves, then refer it back for judgment to Allaah and His Messenger, if you do truly believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and more befitting for final determination.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And in whatever you differ, the judgement is with Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:10].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if we refer this issue &#8211; about the validity of celebrating <i> milaad</i> &#8211; back to the Book of Allaah, we find that the Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) commands us to follow the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> in that which he brought, and it warns us against that which he prohibited. It also informs us that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; has perfected the religion of Islaam for this Ummah. Thus, from this angle, there is nothing in what the Messenger came with concerning this celebration, and therefore it cannot be part of the religion which Allaah perfected for us and ordered us to adhere to by following the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then if we turn to the <i> Sunnah</i> of the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> we do not find in it that he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> celebrated his own birthday, nor ordered its celebration, nor do we find any of the Companions <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> celebrating it! Therefore, it will be absolutely clear to anyone who has the slightest insight and is desirous of truth and justice, that the practice of celebrating the <i> Milaadun-Nabee</i> (the birthday of the Prophet) is not part of t he religion, rather it is a <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation) which we have been warned against and ordered to abandon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also a form of blind imitation of the Jews and Christians in their festivals. Therefore, the sensible person should not be deceived by the large number of people, from the various lands, who practice this, since the truth is not known by mere numbers, but the truth is known by the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> proofs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High said concerning the Jews and the Christians:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they say: None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian! These are their own desires. Say to them: Bring your proof if you are indeed truthful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:111].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you were to obey most of those on earth, they would mislead you far away from Allaah&#8217;s path.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:116].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of these <i>milaad</i> celebrations &#8211; as well as being an innovation &#8211; involve other types of evils as well; such as the free-mixing between men and women, singing and playing musical instruments, and the drinking and smoking of intoxicants. There are in such celebrations, something which is worse than all this, and it is the greater form of shirk (associating partners in the worship of Allaah), through exaggerating about Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, or the dead awliyaa (pious servants of Allaah), by supplicating to them, seeking their aid and help, or by believing that they have the knowledge of the <i> ghayb</i> (hidden Unseen), and other such matters of <i>kufr</i> (disbelief). Whereas it is authentically related from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i> &#8220;Beware of ghuloo (exaggeration) in the religion. For indeed those who came before you were destroyed due to their exaggerating in the religion.&#8221;</i> 8 And he <i>&#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</i> also said:<i> &#8220;Do not over-elevate me as the Christians over-elevated Jesus, Son of Mary, but rather I am just a slave of Allaah. So call me the slave of Allaah and His Messenger.&#8221;</i> 9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the strangest matters is that a great number of people who actively participate in this innovated celebration, and who defend it vigorously, do not take care of fulfilling those matters which Allaah has made obligatory upon them, such as praying the five daily Prayers, and this does not even bother many of them at all. Indeed many of them do not even think that they are committing a great sin! There is no doubt that this is due to their weak <i> eemaan</i> (faith) and their short sightedness and the Fact that their hearts are covered with the filth of sins and disobedience. We ask Allaah to protect and forgive us and all of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the strangest matters also is that some of them believe that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> is actually present at their <i> milaad</i> celebrations, so consequently the participants stand to greet and welcome him. However, this is from the greatest of lies and the worst form of ignorance, because the Messenger <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> shall neither come out of his grave before the Day of Judgement, nor will he meet anyone, nor attend their gatherings. Rather, he shall remain in his grave until the Day of Judgement, whilst his noble <i>rooh</i> (soul) resides in the highest of places with his Lord in the home of the exalted, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Then you shall surely die, then you shall be raised-up again on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Mu&#8217;minoon 23:15-16].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;I will be the leader of the children of Aadam on the Day of Resurrection, and I will be the first for whom the earth will split open, and will be the first to intercede and the first whose intercession will be accepted.&#8221; 10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this noble <i> aayah</i> (verse) and this noble <i> hadeeth</i> &#8211; and those verses and <i> ahaadeeth</i> with a similar meaning &#8211; prove that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and others that have also died, will only come out of their graves on the Day of Resurrection. And this is a matter about which there is an agreement amongst the Muslim Scholars, there being no difference between them. So it is a must upon every Muslim, to carefully consider these matters and to beware of those innovations and deviations that have been introduced by the ignorant ones and their like, for which Allaah has not sent down any authority. It is Allaah&#8217;s help that is sought, and He alone is relied upon, and there is no might, nor any power, except with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for sending the <i> salaah</i> and the <i> salaam</i> (invoking praises and blessings of peace) upon Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, then this is from one of the best ways of drawing closer to Allaah and from those actions which are righteous. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah sends His <i>salaah</i> upon the Prophet (i.e. Allaah praises the Prophet to the angels), as do the angels (by supplicating for forgiveness for him) O you who Believe! Send your <i> salaah</i> upon him and invoke the best <i> salaam</i> (blessings of peace) for him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said</i>: &#8220;Whosoever sends a single blessing upon me, then Allaah will send upon him ten blessings.&#8221; 11 So this is prescribed at all times, particularly at the end of every Prayer. Rather, a group from the people of Knowledge actually consider it obligatory in the final sitting of every Prayer, and consider it highly recommended at other times, such as after the <i> adhaan</i> (call to Prayer), and after mentioning the Prophet, <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> name, and also on the day of <i>Jumu&#8217;ah</i> (Friday), as is proven by the various authentic narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah help us and all the Muslims to attain a sound understanding of the religion, and that He favours us all by causing us to cling to the <i> Sunnah</i> and causing us to beware of <i>bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovations in the religion). Indeed He is the Most Generous, the Most Kind. And may the <i>salaah</i> and <i> salaam</i> (Allaah&#8217;s praises and blessings of peace) be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his Family, his Companions and his followers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Learn Islaam. Then when you have learnt Islaamic do not turn away from it to the right, nor the left. But be upon the Straight Path and upon the Sunnah of your Prophet sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and that which his Companions were upon and beware of these innovations because they cause hatred and enmity amongst you. But stick to the original state of affairs which was there before they divided.&#8221;</p>

Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin &#8216;Abdullaah bin Baaz [1]<br>
Al-Istiqaamah Issue Issue No.2 &#8211; Safar 1417H / July 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>INCREASING EEMAAN (FAITH)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: <span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Firstly</i></span>: I begin my question by seeking your advice that I may benefit from you with regards to how I may increase my <i> eemaan</i> (faith)?<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Secondly</i></span>: I wish to learn about the religion, however Islaamic books are very rare in my country (Algeria), except some books which are with some brothers &#8211; may Allaah reward them with goodness.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Thirdly</i></span>: I work as a builder and the people that I work with do not really have sound faith and their speech is nothing more than gossip and obscenities.<br>
<span style="color:#ff0000;"><i>Fourthly</i></span>: I keep company with a brother whose beliefs are corrupt and who constantly speaks ill of the righteous and believing brothers and I feel very distraught about this. So I hope that you will direct me to a cure for this disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[A]</i></b>: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>Firstly</i></strong></span>: We advise you to recite the Qur&#8217;aan frequently and that you increase in your hearing of it and in your recitation of it. Reflect and consider its meaning to the best of your ability and what you do not understand of it, then ask the people of knowledge of your country about it, or write to those outside of your country from the Scholars of Sunnah (Prophetic guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise you to increase in the <i> dhikr</i> (remembrance) of Allaah with such remembrances and supplications that are authentically related, such as saying <i>laa ilahaa ilallaah</i> (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), or saying <i>subhaanallaah</i> <i>wal-hamdulillaah wa laa ilaha ilallaahu wallaahu akbar</i> (declaring Allaah free from all imperfections, praising Him and declaring that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and that He is greater), and their like. For this purpose, we urge you to refer to books such as al <i>Kalimut-Tayyib</i> of Ibn Taymiyyah, al <i>Waabilus-Sayyib</i> of Ibn al-Qayyim, <i>Riyaadhus-Saaliheen</i> and <i> al-Adhkaar</i> both by Imaam an-Nawawee, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the remembrance of Allaah increases <i> eemaan</i> (faith) and causes hearts to attain tranquility, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find tranquility.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;dd 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also preserve your five daily Prayers, your Fasting and the rest of your obligations &#8211; along with hoping in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness and relying upon Him in all your affairs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;The Believers ate only those who, when Allaah is mentioned, feel a fear in the hearts, and when His Verses are recited to them, it increases their <i>eemaan</i> (faith), and they put their trust and rely upon Allaah alone. They are those who perform the Prayer and spend out of that which We have given them, they are Believers in truth. For them ate grades of dignity and nobility with their Lord, and also forgiveness and generous provisions.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:2-4].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><i>Secondly</i></strong></span>: Islaamic books are easily found in every Muslim country, especially in public libraries and bookshops. So the one who seeks after them will find them. We advise you to refer to the people of knowledge of the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Law of Allaah) so that they may direct you to suitable books for you to read, borrow or buy. If there are any problems regarding this, then it is not fitting for us to stop answering your questions from the Pure Revelation &#8211; and We ask Allaah that He makes us firm in that, and only His help is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;"><i>Thirdly</i>, <i>Fourthly</i>:</span> </strong>It is upon you to keep good company and to sit in righteous gatherings in order to benefit from them and their manners and their knowledge and that they may assist you in cultivating obedience to Allaah. So be careful and beware of bad companionship, and evil gathering. Beware, so that they may not influence you, adversely affecting your morals and manners, such that you fall into ill-repute, or that they weaken your resolve and determination in fulfilling your religious obligations and the obligations to your family. Indeed, the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> advised the Ummah to sit in good gatherings, and he warned them from the evil and foul gatherings, and he gave a noble example about this, when he said: <i>&#8220;The example of a good companion and a bad companion is like that of a seller of musk, and the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows. As for the seller of musk then either he will grant you some, or you buy some from him, or at the very least you enjoy a pleasant smell from him. As for the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows, then either he will burn your clothes, or you will get an offensive smell from him.&#8221;</i> This was related by al-Bukhaaree (4/323), from Abu Moosaa al-Ash&#8217;aree <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu.</i> 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CONCERNING A WOMAN&#8217;S <i>MAHR</i> (DOWRY)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: I and many others have observed that many people are very excessive when it comes to the matter of the <i> mahr</i> (wedding dowry that is paid to the bride), and that they seek great amounts of <i> mahr</i> when it comes to the marriage of their daughters, and they stipulate as a condition the giving of other gifts to them, along with the <i> mahr</i>. This wealth that people demand in such cases, is it <i> halaal</i> (lawful) or <i> haraam</i> (unlawful)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: What is prescribed in the <i> Sharee&#8217;ah</i> is that the <i> mahr</i> should be a small amount and that people should not compete with each other in this regard, acting in accordance with the many <i> ahaadeeth</i> which are related about this. They should also help facilitate marriages and be keen in preserving the modesty and decency of the young Muslim men and women. And it is not permissible for the <i>awliyaa</i> (guardians of the brides-to-be) to demand and stipulate gifts for themselves, since they have no right at all in this matter. Rather the right belongs to the woman, and in some particular cases to the father. He may stipulate a condition as long as it does not harm the daughter, nor lead to the delaying of the marriage. However, if the father forgoes such a right then this is better and more preferable. Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; says:<b> &#8220;And marry those amongst you who are single and also marry the pious of your male and female slaves. If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty.&#8221; </b>[Soorah an-Noor 24:32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <i> hadeeth</i> of &#8216;Uqbah ibn &#8216;Aamir <i> radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;The best dowry is that which is easy.&#8221;</i> This was narrated by Abu Daawood and al-Haakim who authenticated it. And once a woman offered herself to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> for marriage. However, one of his Companions desired to marry her, so the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said [regarding the <i>mahr</i>]: <i>&#8220;Bring something, even if it be an iron ring.&#8221;</i> So when he could not find even this, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> married them for the dowry that the man would teach whatever of the Qur&#8217;aan he knew to her. 2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the dowry of the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> wives was five-hundred dirhams, which is equivalent to one-hundred and thirty riyaals today. And his daughters were married for the <i> mahr</i> of four-hundred dinaars, which is equivalent to one-hundred riyaals today. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a most beautiful example to follow.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:21].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whenever the difficulties relating to marriage are lightened, then preserving the modesty and decency of young men and women becomes easier, shameful and evil deeds decrease, and the Ummah &#8211; as a result &#8211; will increase in number. However if this matter is made difficult, and people continue competing with each other with regards to the <i> mahr</i> (dowry), then the number of marriages will decrease, fornication will become more widespread and more young men and women will remain unmarried &#8211; except those whom Allaah saves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So my sincere advice to all the Muslims, wherever they may be, is to facilitate the marriage process and to cooperate in this and make it easy. They should turn away from demanding excessive <i> mahr</i> and avoid unnecessary hardships and difficulties in the <i>waleemah</i> (wedding-feast). Rather, they should content themselves with a <i> waleemah</i> that is according to the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i>, in which the burdens and difficulties for the husband and wife are minimal. May Allaah improve and rectify all the affairs of the Muslims and may He give them the guidance and ability to cling to the <i> Sunnah</i> (Prophetic guidance) in all matters. 3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>IMPURITIES UPON ONE&#8217;S CLOTHING WHILST PRAYING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: If a person finds some impurity upon his clothes after he has finished praying in it, does the Prayer have to be prayed again?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[A]</i></b>: Whosoever prays, and is unaware that there are impurities upon his body or his clothes during the Prayer, but only realises after he has completed it, then his Prayer will be deemed as correct, according to the most correct position of the Scholars. Similarly, if he was aware of such impurities before the Prayer, but then forgot about this at the time of praying and did not remember except after the Prayer, then his Prayer likewise will be correct. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic said: <b> &#8220;Our Lord! Do not take us to task if we forget or fall into error.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:286]. It has been authentically related about Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, that one day he <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> led the people in Prayer, wearing his shoes. Then the angel Jibreel came to him during the Prayer and informed him that there was some dirt on his shoes. So the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> removed them and continued with his Prayer and he did not repeat the Prayer.4 This is part of the ease which Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; has given to His servants out of His Mercy for them. However, if a person forgets that he had passed wind, then prays in that state, he must &#8211; by <i> ijmaa&#8217;</i> (consensus) of the Scholars &#8211; repeat his prayer again, when he remembers. This is due to the saying of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>: <i> &#8220;The Prayer will not be accepted without purification nor will charity be accepted from wealth that is unlawful.&#8221;</i> This has been related by Muslim in his <i> Saheeh</i> (1/140) and the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying: <i> &#8220;The Prayer of any one of you who has released wind will not be accepted, until he makes wudhoo (ablution).&#8221;</i> Related by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. 5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SLAUGHTERING FOR OTHER THAN ALLAAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>[Q]</i></b>: The slaughtering of sheep and other such animals at the graves of the pious people, for their sake and in order to please and draw closer to them, is a custom amongst my family. I have tried to prevent them from doing so, but it has only made them more resolute in doing so. I have said to them that this is shirk (associating partners in the worship) of Allaah. But they respond by saying: We only worship Allaah the way He deserves to be worshipped. However, we visit the graves of the <i>awliyaa</i> (the pious friends of Allaah) and supplicate to Allaah, through the right of the pious people, so that harm and difficulties may be averted from us. I have said to them that this is not from the religion, but they just tell me to leave them alone upon what they are doing. So what do you suggest should be the cure for such people, and what do you suggest I do to counter act this <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i></i></b><b><i>[A]</i></b>: It is known from the evidences related in the Qur&#8217;aan and the <i> Sunnah</i> that sacrificing for other than Allaah, in order to draw close to other than Allaah &#8211; whether sacrificing for the <i>jinns</i>, <i>awliyaa</i>, idols or other than that from the creation &#8211; is an act of shirk and is an act of <i>jaahiliyyah</i> (pre-Islaamic ignorance) that was practiced by the <i>mushriks</i> (those who worshipped the pious men, <i>jinns</i>, angels, stones, statues, etc, along with worshipping Allaah). Allaah- the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Say: Indeed my Prayer, my sacrifce, my living and my dying are all for Allaah Lord of the worlds. No partner do I setup with Him in this, and this is what I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:162]. So Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; clearly explains in this verse that sacrificing to other than Allaah is like praying to other than Him. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;Indeed We have granted to the Prophet sallallaabu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam the Kawthar (a river in Paradise whose banks are lined with tents made from hollow pearls). Therefore turn in Prayer to your Lord and sacrifice to Him alone.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Kawthar 108:1-2]. So Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects &#8211; commanded His Prophet in these noble verses that he should pray only to His Lord and that he should sacrifice to only Him, which was opposite of what the <i>mushriks</i> did, in that they used to prostrate to other than Allaah and to sacrifice to other than Him. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And your Lord has commanded that you worship none but Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Israa 17:23]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b> &#8220;And they have not been commanded except to worship Allaah alone making the religion purely and sincerely for Him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Bayyinah 98:5]. And there are many other verses with the same meaning. So, since sacrificing is one of the acts of <i> &#8216;ibaadah</i> (worship), then it is obligatory to make this action purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, without directing it to other than Him. Also &#8216;Alee ibn Abee Taalib <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said that the Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;May Allaah curse the one who sacrifices to other than Allaah.&#8221;</i> This has been related by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.765).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for supplicating to Allaah and asking Him by the right of the <i> awliyaa</i> or by the right of His Messenger, or by the status of His Messenger &#8211; then this does not constitute shirk, but rather it is a <i> bid&#8217;ah</i> (innovation) which leads to shirk, in the opinion of the majority of Scholars. This is because <i>du&#8217;aa</i> (supplication) is an act of worship, and how it is to be done can only be known from the Revelation. And there is nothing authentically established from our Prophet <i> sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> to show the permissibility or validity of this type of <i> tawassul</i> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah by invoking an intermediary) in which Allaah is asked through the right of His Prophet or the right of the <i> awliyaa</i> or any of His creation. So it is not permissible for any Muslim to innovate new forms of <i> tawassul</i> which has not been prescribed by Allaah, as He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;Or do they have partners with Allaah who prescribe for them a religion which Allaah has not prescribed.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:21]. And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i> &#8220;Whosoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, will be rejected&#8221;</i>, and in another authentic narration: <i> &#8220;Whosoever does an action that I have not commanded, it will be rejected.&#8221;</i> 7 And the meaning of this is that such innovated actions will be rejected and not accepted from its doer. Thus it is obligatory for the Muslims to restrict themselves to only what Allaah has prescribed and to beware of what people have innovated into the religion. As regards the prescribed forms of <i>tawassul</i> then they are: <i>tawassul</i> (seeking the means of nearness to Allaah) through His Names and His Attributes and by righteous actions, and by one&#8217;s <i>eemaan</i> (faith) in Allaah and His Messenger, and other righteous and prescribed actions similar to this. 9</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh bin Baz , Majmoo&#8217; Fataawaa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi&#8217;ah (3/438-446)<br>
Al-Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.8 &#8211; Shawwal 1418H / February 1998</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q1]: What, in your opinion, is the definition of al-ghazwa al-fikree (the ideological attack)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A1]: Ideological warfare is a modern term which refers to a set of efforts in which a nation engages in order to conquer or influence another nation, so that [the attacked nation] takes a particular course of direction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is far more serious than military warfare, since it aims at secrecy, seeking to achieve subtle objectives initially; so that the attacked nation does not perceive it, nor prepare to halt it, nor stand in its way &#8211; thereby falling victim to [such an attack]. The eventual result of this onslaught is that this nation becomes sick in mind and sense; loving what the enemy wants it to love and hating what they want it to hate. It is a chronic disease which attacks and destroys nations, doing away with its personality, removing such meanings as foundations and strength. The nation which is struck by this [ideological attack] does not even feel what has hit it, or what it even is! That is why curing it becomes somewhat difficult, and making [the attacked nation] understand the ways of righteousness becomes a struggle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This war takes place by means of school curriculums, general education, media, small and large size publications, and other such channels [that influence the thoughts of its people]. Through this the enemy hopes to deviate the nation from its beliefs; becoming attached to what the enemy throws at it. We ask Allaah for safety and protection from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q2]: Are the Arabs generally subject to this type of warfare, in particular the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A2]: Yes, the Muslims in general, including the Arabs, the Kingdom, and other than them, are all subject to a great ideological warfare from the nations of kufr (unbelief); from both the east and the west. The severest and most serious of these [ideological] onslaughts is:- [1] <b>The war of the christian crusaders.</b> [2] <b>The zionist war.</b> [3] <b>The communist and atheistic war.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[THE CHRISTIAN CRUSADERS]</b> The war of the christian crusaders is today at its most intense. Since Salaahud-Deen al-Ayyoobee achieved victory over the christians crusading in the Muslim lands with their strength and weapons, the christians realised that even though they had achieved [some] victories, these victories</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">were temporary ones that did not last. That is why they started thinking about the most destructive alternatives. After numerous case studies and assemblies they arrived at [something] that was far more dangerous and destructive than military warfare; which was that the christian nations, both individually and collectively, should launch an ideological attack on those Muslims who were just beginning to grow and develop. This is because conquering the hearts and thoughts [of people] is far more permanent than conquering their lands! The Muslim whose mind has not been corrupted cannot bear to see the unbelievers wielding authority, and ordering and prohibiting in his own country. Therefore such a Muslim strives his utmost to expel and distance them &#8211; even if he has to sacrifice his own life, or or his most cherished possession, for this cause. And this is what happened after the major conquest of the crusaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Muslim who is exposed to the [effects] of this filthy war, he becomes ill in thought and desensitised to this disease. He does not see any danger with the presence of christians in the lands of the Muslims. Indeed, he may even think that their presence is a source of goodness which aids and advances civilisation. So the christians have sufficed themselves with this ideological warfare, as opposed to the military one, because it is more effective and more permanent. What need do they have of deploying troops or spending huge sums of money, when there exists amongst the children of the Muslims those who can actually fulfill their wishes &#8211; intentionally or unintentionally, with a price or without one! This is why they do not resort to openly fighting the Muslims with weapons and arms, except in rare cases when necessity dictates this. They resort to this in situations where speed is sought; such as what happened in Uganda and Pakistan; or when there is a need to stabilise the advancement, or establish centres, or to establish bases which engage in destructive ideological warfare; such as what happened in Egypt, Syria, Iraaq, and other countries, before their expulsion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[THE ZIONIST JEWS]</b> The zionist war is just the same. The jews strive their utmost to corrupt the beliefs, morals and manners of the Muslims. The jews scheme and crave after possessing the Muslim lands, as well as the lands of others. They have fulfilled some of their plans and continue striving hard to implement the rest of them. Even though they they do engage the Muslims in warfare involving strength and arms and have occupied some of their lands, they also fight them through spreading</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and aiding the spread of] destructive thoughts, beliefs and ideologies; such as Freemasonry, Qadiaanisim, Bahaaism, Teejaanism, and others &#8211; seeking the support of the christians, and others, in order to fulfill their objects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>THE COMMUNISTS AND ATHEISTS</strong>] As for the communist/atheist war, then presently it is spreading like wildfire across the Muslim lands.2 This happens as a consequence of their being an emptiness [with regards beliefs], weak eemaan (certainty of faith) in most people, wide spread ignorance, and the lack of a correct and healthy [Islaamic] cultivation and development. The communist parties from Russia and China, as well as others, have managed to ensnare [into this false ideology] every spiteful, malicious person; driven by those weak in faith, or having no faith at all! They selected these types of people as being their puppets and plants in that country; spreading through [such puppets] their filthy atheistic and communistic ideologies. They lured them with promises of high positions of power and status. Through them they tore apart the Muslim Ummah and they were made [to act as] the troops of Shaytaan. They were aided in this by the christians and the jews, who sometimes assisted in their preparation, whilst at other times they aided and supported them. Thus, even though they do have differences between them, yet they become a single hand against the Muslims. They view the Muslims as their worst enemy, that is why we see them co-operating with each other, as allies, against the Muslims. And Allaah&#8217;s aid is sought, and He suffices us and is the best of guardians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q3]: What are the means which the west uses in order to spread their ideas and thoughts?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A3]: The means that the west employs in order to spread their thoughts and ideas are many, from them:-</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: The attempt to conquer the minds of the Muslim children. They do this by infusing in them western values and concepts so that they then believe that the best way to adopt in any matter is that of the west &#8211; whether it is with regards to what religion or sect they believe, or with regards to the languages that they speak, or the manners, customs and values with which they clothe themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Custody of a large group of the children of the Muslims in every country, concern for them and bringing them up, so that when they absorb western thoughts, they return to their countries with a halo of praise and compliment, until they acquire position and authority in their countries by which they circulate western ideologies and establish learning centres conforming to western curricula or are directly influenced by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Their active drive towards promoting the learning of western languages in the Muslim lands, making them compete with the Muslims&#8217; languages, especially the Arabic language, which is language of the Qur&#8217;aan &#8211; by which this Book was sent and by which the Muslims worship their Lord;in their Salaah (Prayer), their rites of Hajj (Pilgrimage), their forms of remembrances and glorifications, etc. From this is the encouragement of destructive propaganda that fights against [the usage and learning] of [pure and classical] Arabic Language and attempt to weaken the conformity to it in the Muslim lands. They do this by calling to using colloquialism, and by arranging numerous studies that intend to &#8216;develop&#8217; grammar in order to corrupt it; as well as formalising folk literature and and matters of national heritage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>: Development of western universities and missionary schools in Muslim countries and also initiating the role of kindergarten and playschools, hospitals and clinics which they make as dens and nests for their evil aims. They encourage the higher classes to study in them (western and missionary schools and universities) and after them help in acquire leadership posts and great position until they become an aid for their masters in following their plots in the Muslim lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong>: The attempt to control education curricula in Muslim lands and drawing out their politics, either directly; as occurred in some Muslim countries when the priest Dunlop undertook that task there, or by indirect methods. When the task was undertaken, most of the successful students who studied in Dunlop&#8217;s schools and graduated in them, arose as a destructive pickaxe in their country, or as one of the enemies most lethal weapons. [Such students] strive hard to influence the educational curriculum and steer it towards secularism &#8211; an ideology which does not centre around having eemaan (faith) in Allaah and His Messenger; but rather steers in the direction of atheism, or towards immorality and corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixthly</strong>: The large number of individuals amongst the jews and christians who have undertaken the study of Islam, Arabic Language, compiling books, and taking positions of teaching in universities; until they created an ideological turmoil and confusion amongst the educated Muslims, which they hurl at those that they are teaching, or with which they fill their books &#8211; until some of those books became sources which writers and researchers refer to in matters of ideology or history. Many people who were responsible for creating some of these fitnahs (trials and turmoil) in the Muslim countries, were actually Muslims who graduated at the hands of the people. The praise and awe which surrounded such graduates helped them to achieve this, as well as achieve their post and positions; such as important posts in teaching and leadership. So they completed what their teachers had initiated [of corruption and destruction] and fulfilled what they couldn&#8217;t achieve, because they were of Muslim offspring and from the same skin, ascribing themselves to them and speaking their tongue &#8211; so we ask and seek Allaah&#8217;s help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventhly</strong>: A large number of missionary workers calling to christianity have proceeded between the Muslims that they have performed their work on. [This missionary activity is done upon] well studied principles, and upon a large scale; employing hundreds of thousands of men and women. Huge financial budgets are put aside for this task, and [they are aided in such a way that] their task is made easier for them and obstacles are removed for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;They want to extinguish the Light (i.e, the Religion) of Allaah with their mouths, but Allaah will bring His Light to perfection and completion, even though the disbelievers hate it.&#8221;</b> [Soorah as-Saff 61:8].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as the efforts of the missionaries are set up and aimed mostly at the common levels; then the efforts of the orientalist are directed to the educated &#8211; as I previously mentioned. The missionaries take on huge hardships in their work in the African Countries, and in the remote villages of the far extreme Muslim lands; in eastern Asia. After that, every so often, they hold conferences in order to review their accounts and their plans; then they analyse, adjust and implement. They met in Cairo in 1906, in Edinburgh in 1910, in Lucknow (India) in 1911, and in Jerusalem in 1935, and they continue to hold such assemblies, seminars and conferences &#8211; so glory be to the One in Whose Hand is the sole sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and to Him return all affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eighthly</strong>: Spreading corruption in the Muslim societies; belittling the [status of women] with regards to their role in life, making her transgress the limits set by Allaah for her, creating in her a satisfaction in abstaining from the [correct] Path. They do this by spreading propaganda amongst the Muslims in various ways and manners, so that women freely mix with men, and so that women work in the places of men. By this, they aim to corrupt the Muslim society, and to put an end to the chastity and purity which is found therein. Additionally, by bringing up imaginary issues and false propaganda &#8211; [claiming] that Islaam oppresses women, and that Muslim women have very little rights &#8211; they want to take her out of her home, and put her wherever they may want; even though the limits that Allaah has set [in the Qur&#8217;aan] are clear; as are His commands [concerning these matters], and as is the Sunnah (Guidance) of His Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the Believing women to draw their jilbaabs (cloaks) over their entire body. That will be better, that they should be known (as free and respectable women), so as not to be harassed, And Allaah is Ever-Forgiving, Most-Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And let the Believing women draw their khimaars (head-scarves) over their faces, necks and chests, and not to display their beauty, except to their husbands, or their fathers, or their husband&#8217;s fathers, or their sons, or their husband&#8217;s sons &#8230;&#8221; </b>[Soorah an-Noor 24:31].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And when you ask them for something, ask them from behind a screen; that is purer for your hearts and their hearts.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:53].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of jaahiliyyah (pre-lslaamic ignorance).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Ahzaab 33:33].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said:<br>
<i>&#8220;Beware of entering into the company of women.&#8221;</i> A man from the Ansaar said: O Messenger of Allaah, what about the husband&#8217;s brothers and relatives! He replied: <i>&#8220;The husband&#8217;s brothers and relatives are death!&#8221;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said:<br>
<i>&#8220;A man must not be alone in the company of a women, for indeed the third of them is shaytaan.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ninthly</strong>: The Building of churches and temples in the Muslim lands and spending great amounts of wealth on them; beautifying them, making them very conspicuous and noticeable, and building them in the largest and best of places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tenthly</strong>: Radio stations set up solely for the purpose of calling to christianity and communism, spreading their [false] objectives. They intend to misguide, through such false ideas, the children of the innocent and naive Muslims &#8211; who neither understand, nor did they receive a sufficient Islaamic education. This is the case, in particular, in Africa where the Bible is published and distributed in plenty of hotels, etc. [They also] send missionary publications and false preaching to many of the Muslim children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the means utilised by the enemies of Islaam today &#8211; from east and the west &#8211; in waging war against the Muslim&#8217;s thought, [intending by this ideological attack] to put an end to correct righteous thought, so that they are replaced by [false and] foreign ideas; whether eastern or western. And &#8211; O noble reader &#8211; as you can see, these means involve tremendous efforts, enormous amounts of money and a multitude of soldiers. All of this is done in order to take the Muslims away from Islaam, even if they do not actually embrace christianity, judaism or marxism. Since their primary goal in doing this is to take the Muslims away from Islaam, so that when this stage is achieved, then whatever [misguidance] follows becomes far easier to implement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, despite all this we say: that Allaah will frustrate them in their hopes, and will nullify their plans &#8211; but only if the Muslims are sincere in their fight against them, cautious and alert to their plans, and obedient and upright upon their Religion; as Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But if you remain patient and become pious and obedient to Allaah, their plots will not harm you in the least. Indeed, Allah encompasses all that they do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-lmraan 3:120].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since they are spreaders of corruption, Allaah Will not give total facilitation to their actions. Rather Allaah &#8211; the Most High- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;They plot and plan, and Allaah plans, and indeed Allaah is the best of planners.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:30].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed they are planning a plan, but I am planning a plan, but give a respite to the disbelievers; deal gently with them for a while.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Taariq 86:15-17].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;O you who Believe! If you help Allaah [by acting upon that which He has commanded you to do], He will help you against your enemies, and make your foothold firm.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Muhammad 47:7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And indeed Allaah will help those who help His Cause. Truly, Allaah is Most-Powerful, Most-Mighty. Those who, if We give them power and authority in the land, establish the Salaah (Prayer), give the Zakaah, command the good and forbid the evil. And with Allaah rests the end of all affairs.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hajj 22:40-41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many verses carrying this same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, without a doubt, the matter requires the Muslims to have some common sense and some contemplation, some study about the course of action that should be taken, about the most suitable stance they should take, and that they should be heedful and have some awareness which will make them capable of understanding the schemes of their enemies, and active upon rendering them futile and false. This shall not be accomplished for them except by adhering to Allaah, adherence to His guidance, returning to Him, repenting to Him and seeking His aid. Additionally, by bearing in mind His guidance in everything, especially with regard to the relation of the believers with the unbelievers, and by understanding Soorah <b>&#8220;Say, O Disbelievers&#8221;</b> and what Allaah the Most High &#8211; mentions in His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Never will the jews and the christians be pleased with you until you follow their religion and way of life.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Baqarah 2:120].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also [what He mentions in] His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And they will not stop fighting you, until they turn you back from your Religion; if they are able.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al- Baqarah 2:217]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; that He grants right guidance to this Ummah, with regards to their affairs, and that He grants protection to it from the plots of its enemies, and that He grants it firmness and obedience, both in speech and action &#8211; so that there can be for them might, strength and honour; as Allaah desires for them. Indeed He is the only One Who has the power to do so. And may Allaah extol, and send the blessings of peace upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions, and followers.</p>

Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Govt Publication – <a href="https://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2014/08/indispensable-implication-of-sunnah-and-caution-against-innovation-ibn-baz.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Download PDF</strong></a>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allâh who completed the religion for us, perfected the blessing on us and chose Islam as our religion. May the blessings and peace be upon His slave and Messenger, who called upon people to obey his Lord and cautioned against extravagance, innovation and disobedience; and may Allâh bless his posterity, his companions and those who follow his footsteps till the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have been acquainted with the article published on the first page of the weekly magazine <em>Edarat</em> of Kanpur , an industrial city of Uttar Pardesh in India , which contains an implied campaign against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , its adherence to the Islamic creed, and its opposition to innovations. The writer alleges that the creed of the <em>Salaf</em> (early adherents to Islam) which is held by Saudi Kingdom does not agree with the<em> Sunnah</em>. By this, the writer aims at creating division amongst the<em> Ahl-as-Sunnah</em> and encouraging the innovations and superstitions. This attitude, no doubt, is most abominable and dangerous and aims at offending the Religion of Islam and spreading innovations and deviations from the truth. Furthermore, the article concentrates clearly on the subject of celebrating the Prophet&#8217;s birthday as an excuse to discuss the creed of the Kingdom and its rulers. Therefore, I consider it necessary to enlighten the people on this subject. So seeking help of Allâh, I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to celebrate the birthday of the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم or somebody else. In fact, it must be stopped, as it is an innovation in the religion. Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم neither celebrated it, nor commanded others to do this for himself; or for anyone who died before him amongst the Prophets, or for his daughters, or his wives, or his other relatives. The rightly-guided Caliphs, the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم or the Successors who rightly followed them did not celebrate this event, nor did anyone of the Muslim scholars in the centuries before.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew the <em>Sunnah </em>of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم best, they loved him more, and followed the <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> better than those who came after them. If celebrating his birthday was a good deed, they would have done it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are commanded to follow and forbidden to innovate. This is because of the perfection of the Islamic religion and the sufficiency of what Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم have given us and are accepted by <em>Ahl-as-Sunnah wal-Jama&#8217;ah.</em> The Muslim community of the Companions and those who followed them in the best way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من أحدث في أمرنا هذا ما ليس منه فهو رد &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;He who innovates something in this matter of ours that is not of it, will have it rejected). (Transmitted by<em> Al-Bukhâri</em> and <em>Muslim)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to Muslim who reported:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من عمل عملا ليس عليه أمرنا فهو رد &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever does an act which is not in agreement with our matter, will have it rejected.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another tradition, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; عليكم بسنتي وسنة الخلفاء الراشدين المهديين من بعدي, تمسكوا بها وعضوا عليها بالنواجذ, وإياكم ومحدثات الأمور, فإن كل محدثة بدعة وكل بدعة ضلالة &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;You must keep to my <em>Sunnah </em>and of the <em>Sunnah</em> of the rightly-guided Caliphs, cling to it firmly. Beware of newly invented matters, for every new matter is an innovation and every innovation is misleading&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He used to say in every Friday <em>Khutbah</em> (sermon, religious talk):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; فإن خير الحديث كتاب الله وخير الهدي هدي محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم وشر الأمور محدثاتها وكل بدعة ضلالة &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The best discourse is the Book of Allâh and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, the Messenger of Allâh, and the worst matter is that of innovation and every innovation is misleading&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, these<em> Ahâdith</em> (traditions) contain a strong caution against innovations and a warning that such an act is a deviation from the right course. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم warned the people of the gravity of these innovations and of their bad consequences. There are many traditions adduced in this connection. And the Almighty has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا آتَاكُمُ الرَّسُولُ فَخُذُوهُ وَمَا نَهَاكُمْ عَنْهُ فَانْتَهُوا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230; And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it), &#8230;&#8221; (V.59:7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh, the Most High said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">فَلْيَحْذَرِ الَّذِينَ يُخَالِفُونَ عَنْ أَمْرِهِ أَنْ تُصِيبَهُمْ فِتْنَةٌ أَوْ يُصِيبَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230; And let those who oppose the Messenger&#8217;s (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ) commandment (i.e. his <em>Sunnah</em> &#8211; legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) (among the sects) beware, lest some <em>Fitnah </em>(disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.&#8221; (V.24:63).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh the Almighty said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏لَقَدْ كَانَ لَكُمْ فِي رَسُولِ اللَّهِ أُسْوَةٌ حَسَنَةٌ لِمَنْ كَانَ يَرْجُو اللَّهَ وَالْيَوْمَ الْآخِرَ وَذَكَرَ اللَّهَ كَثِيرًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allâh and the Last Day and remembers Allâh much.&#8221; (V.33:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh the Almighty said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏وَالسَّابِقُونَ الْأَوَّلُونَ مِنَ الْمُهَاجِرِينَ وَالْأَنْصَارِ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّبَعُوهُمْ بِإِحْسَانٍ رَضِيَ اللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا عَنْهُ وَأَعَدَّ لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي تَحْتَهَا الْأَنْهَارُ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا أَبَدًا ذَلِكَ الْفَوْزُ الْعَظِيمُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And the first to embrace Islam of the <em>Muhâjirun</em> (those who migrated from Makkah to Al-Madinah) and the <em>Ansâr</em> (the citizens of Al-Madinah who helped and gave aid to the <em>Muhâjirun</em>) and also those who followed them exactly (in Faith). Allâh is well-pleased with them as they are well- pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens under which rivers flow ( Paradise ), to dwell therein forever. That is the supreme success.&#8221; (V.9:100).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh the Almighty said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230; This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion&#8230;&#8221; (V.5:3).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse decisively indicates that the Almighty Allâh has completed the religion for this <em>Ummah,</em> and has showered His blessings on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم passed away only after he had imparted the complete Message of Allâh to the <em>Ummah </em>as well as his legislations concerning sayings and deeds. He also stressed that all things invented by people and then attributed to the religion of Islam are innovations and to be rejected, even if their inventors did so in good faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established that the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and the righteous Successors after them warned the people against innovations as they add to Islam and legislate what is not permitted by Allâh, in line with the enemies of Allâh such as the Jews and the Christians who added to their religion and innovated what was not allowed by Allâh. Moreover, to admit innovation in Islam is to admit that Islam is incomplete and imperfect. Such a belief is not only an evil but contradicts the following verse: &#8220;This day have I perfected your religion for you,&#8221; and the sayings of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم which warn us against innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To celebrate the anniversary of the birth of Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and the others, means that the religion is not perfected by Allâh (the Glorious, the Almighty) for this <em>Ummah,</em> and the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم did not impart to the people what was necessary regarding their religious duties, till these late ones appeared and invented in the religion what is not permitted by Allâh, thinking that this would bring them nearer to Allâh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly, this is a great danger and is tantamount to criticizing Allâh the Almighty and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم ; whereas Allâh the Almighty has already completed the religion and perfected His Grace, and the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has conveyed the Message openly and informed the <em>Ummah</em> of all such ways that will lead them to the Paradise and save them from Hell-fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to an authentic<em> Hadith,</em> on the authority of Abdullah bin Amr bin Al-Aas, Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; ما بعث الله من نبي إلا كان حقا عليه أن يدل أمته على خير ما يعلمه لهم وينذرهم شر ما يعلمه لهم &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allâh تعالى (the Almighty) did not send a Prophet but obliged him to lead his people to the best way which is known to him, and warn them against the worst which is known to him.&#8221; (Transmitted by<em> Muslim)</em><br>
It is well-known that our Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم is the best of all the Prophets, the last and the most perfect of them regarding the way he conveyed the Message and advised his people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Had the celebration of <em>Milâd</em> been an act of religion chosen by Allâh for His slaves, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم would have either explained that to his people and would have celebrated it during his life, or his Companions would have done it. As these did not happen, it becomes clear that Islam has no concern with <em>Milâd.</em> On the contrary, it is one of the innovations against which the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has warned his people as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A host of scholars have not only rejected the celebration of <em>Milâd</em> but have warned against it in view of the evidences given above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the rule of the Islamic <em>Shari&#8217;ah</em> all matters regarding legalization or prohibition and all disputes among the people, should be referred to the Book of Allâh and the <em>Sunnah </em>of His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم in line with the saying of Allâh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَطِيعُوا اللَّهَ وَأَطِيعُوا الرَّسُولَ وَأُولِي الْأَمْرِ مِنْكُمْ فَإِنْ تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ تُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ ذَلِكَ خَيْرٌ وَأَحْسَنُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe! Obey Allâh and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم , if you believe in Allâh and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.&#8221; (V .4:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh the Almighty said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِنْ شَيْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allâh (He is the ruling Judge). (42:10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Referring this issue back to the Book of Allâh, we find it ordaining upon us to follow Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم in his commandments and warns us against whatever he prohibits. Furthermore it tells us that Allâh has perfected the religion for the people. So, as long as <em>Milâd</em> is not among the teachings of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , it cannot be a part of the religion which Allâh has perfected for us and asked us to adhere to by following the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again when we refer this issue back to the <em>Sunnah</em> of Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم , we do not find either the Prophet or the Companions doing it by themselves or asking others to do it. So it becomes evident that<em> Milâd,</em> is not a part of religion, rather one of innovations and blind imitation of the people of the Scripture, i.e. the Jews and the Christians in their festivals. With this argument in mind, it becomes crystal clear for everyone having the least insight and inclination towards truth and justice, that celebrating any birthday has nothing to do with Islam. It is rather among the innovations which Allâh and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم warned against emphatically.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A wise man must not be deceived by seeing a large number of people doing it throughout the world because the truth is known and recognized by the evidences of<em> Shari&#8217;ah</em> and not by the acts of a great number of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh تعالى (the Almighty) says regarding the Jews and the Christians:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَقَالُوا لَنْ يَدْخُلَ الْجَنَّةَ إِلَّا مَنْ كَانَ هُودًا أَوْ نَصَارَى تِلْكَ أَمَانِيُّهُمْ قُلْ هَاتُوا بُرْهَانَكُمْ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And they say, `None shall enter Paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian.&#8217; These are their own desires. Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ): `Produce your proof if you are truthful.&#8221;&#8217; (V.2:111).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Almighty also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏وَإِنْ تُطِعْ أَكْثَرَ مَنْ فِي الْأَرْضِ يُضِلُّوكَ عَنْ سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ إِنْ يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا الظَّنَّ وَإِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا يَخْرُصُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And if you obey most of those on earth, they will mislead you far away from Allâh&#8217;s path. They follow nothing but conjectures, and they do nothing but lie.&#8221; (V.6:116).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of these innovations, in addition to their innovatory nature, also do not usually escape from a number of other evils, such as mixed gatherings of men and women, songs accompanied by musical instruments. drinking intoxicants, narcotics and the like. They may also involve the worst thing i. e. the greatest <em>Shirk,</em> through showing exaggeration in Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم and other saints and through praying to him, invoking his help or believing that he knows what is hidden and all similar claims which render a believer as an infidel. It is authentically reported that the Messenger of Allâh has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; وإياكم والغلو في الدين فإنما أهلك من كان قبلكم &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beware of extravagance in the religion: It has caused the people before you to perish&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; لا تطروني كما أطرت النصارى ابن مريم, إنما أنا عبد فقولوا عبد الله ورسوله &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not lavish praise on me as the Christians did with the son of Maryam. I am just a slave. So simply say: The slave of Allâh and His Messenger&#8221;. (Transmitted by <em>Bukhâri)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is curious to note that a great many people participate most actively in these celebrations and defend them vehemently, while they sit back from attending the obligatory forms of worship such as daily and Friday prayers. They are not even ashamed of this, nor do they realize that they are committing a great evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly, this shows the weakness of their Faith, their short-sightedness, and the deeply ingrained rust on their hearts because of sins and disobedience. We ask Allâh&#8217;s protection for us and for all the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is even more astonishing to note that some people believe that Allâh&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم is present at <em>Milâd.</em> Consequently they stand to greet and welcome him. That is not only a sheer lie but a worst form of ignorance, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم shall neither come out of his grave before the Day of Resurrection, nor shall he meet the people or attend their meetings. Instead, he shall remain in his grave till the Day of Resurrection while his soul rests at the highest of the high with his Lord in the most exalted and highest place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh تعالى (the Almighty) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ لَمَيِّتُونَ. ‏ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ تُبْعَثُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;After that, surely, you will die. Then (again), surely, you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; (V.23:15, 16).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; أنا أول من يشق عنه القبر يوم القيامة وأنا أول شافع وأول مُشَفَّع &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I am the first one to rise from the grave on the Resurrection Day and I will be the first intercessor and the first one whose intercession is to be accepted.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforesaid evidences from the Qur&#8217;ân and <em>Hadith</em> prove beyond doubt that the dead people will come out of their graves only on the Day of Resurrection. All the scholars of Islam agree upon this. A Muslim should be aware of these things and must not be easily misled by the innovations and the superstitions created by the ignorant people with no authority from Allâh at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for offering the blessings and greetings (<em>Salât</em> and <em>Salâm</em>) to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , they are among the most preferred and virtuous deeds in accordance with the Saying of Allâh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَمَلَائِكَتَهُ يُصَلُّونَ عَلَى النَّبِيِّ يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا صَلُّوا عَلَيْهِ وَسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allâh sends His<em> Salat</em> (Graces, Honours, Blessings, Mercy, etc.) on the Prophet (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ) and also His angels too (ask Allâh to bless and forgive him). O you who believe! Send your <em>Salat</em> on (ask Allâh to bless) him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم ), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islamic way of greeting (salutation i.e.<em> As- Salâm-o-Alaikum)</em>.&#8221; (V.33:56).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من صلى عليَّ واحدة صلى الله عليه عشرا &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whosoever sends blessings on me one time, Allâh sends blessings on him ten times&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prescribed on all times, particularly at the end of each prayer. It is held obligatory at the last <em>Tashahhud</em> of each <em>Salât </em>(prayer) by most of the scholars. It is strongly required at a number of occasions such as immediately after <em>Adhân,</em> at the mention of the name of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , during the day of Friday and the night preceding it, according to a host of <em>Ahâdith.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what I wanted to emphasize regarding this issue. I hope it will satisfy everyone whom Allâh has shown the light.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How sad it is to see some devoted Muslims, known for their strength of Faith and love for the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم organizing such innovatory celebrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us ask such people: Tell us, if you belong to<em>Ahl-as-Sunnah</em> and follow the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم , whether he himself or one of his Companions or their Successors did this or is it no more than a blind-following of the enemies of Islam from among the Jews and the Christians and the like ؟</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The love of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم is not reflected by the celebration on his birthday, but by obeying him, believing in his teachings, keeping away from what he prohibited and by worshipping Allâh in the way he prescribed for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reflected through offering<em> Salat</em> and <em>Salâm</em> to him from time to time, particularly at the mention of his name and during prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Wahhabiyya,</em> as the writer tends to put it, are not new in rejecting all such innovations. Their creed is to hold fast to the Book of Allâh and the<em> Sunnah</em> of His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم ; to follow his footsteps and those of his rightly- guided Successors; to believe and practise what was propounded by the virtuous Predecessors and the <em>Imâms </em>of learning and guidance who were capable to issue religious injunction concerning the knowledge of Allâh, and His Attributes of perfection and dignity as shown in the Glorious Book and the authentic <em>Ahâdith</em> (traditions) of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم and as wholeheartedly accepted by his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Wahhabiyya</em> believe in them, the way they are reported without any alteration, personification, exemplifying or negation of such attributes. They stick to the way of the Successors and their followers from among the people of learning, Faith and piety. They believe that the foundation of the Faith is to bear witness that there is none to be worshipped except Allâh and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allâh. To them, this is the root of Faith and one of its most exalted branches as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They know in accordance with the consensus of the Muslims, that this root requires knowledge, acknowledgement and practice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It implies that none is to be worshipped except Allâh the Almighty, Who has no associates at all. It further implies the negation of worshipping any other except Him. It shows why jinn and mankind were created; why the Messengers were sent and why the Books were revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, <em>Ibâdah</em> (worship) is not only complete submission and love but also complete obedience and veneration as well. Islam is the only religion prescribed by Allâh and disseminated by the Prophets and nothing, except it, is acceptable to Allâh whether in the past or the present. The one who submits his will to Allâh as well as to someone else beside Him, is a <em>Mushrik</em> (polytheist). The same is true for the one who prays to Allâh and someone else beside Him. As for the one who does not submit to Him, he is arrogant concerning his duties towards his Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh, the Almighty says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‏وَلَقَدْ بَعَثْنَا فِي كُلِّ أُمَّةٍ رَسُولًا أَنِ اُعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَاجْتَنِبُوا الطَّاغُوتَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And verily, We have sent among every <em>Ummah</em> (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): &#8220;Worship Allâh (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from)<em> Tâghût</em> (all false deities etc. i.e. do not worship <em>Tâghût</em> besides Allâh).&#8221; (V.16:36).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus the creed of the <em>Wahhabiyya</em> is based upon fulfillment of witnessing that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allâh and completely abandoning all innovations, superstitions and whatever goes against the <em>Shari&#8217;ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Sheikh Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab رحمه الله believed and invited others to believe. Whoever accredits to him anything contrary to it, does not only lie but commits a great sin and claims what is totally unfounded. He will, no doubt, receive what Allâh has promised to all the fabricators of lies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has shown &#8211; through a series of his well-known treatises and scholarly books on the topic of the &#8220;Declaration of Oneness: <em>La ilaha illAllâh&#8221; &#8211;</em> that no one deserves worship except Allâh the Almighty, and that this type of worship should be devoid of all sorts of <em>Shirk</em> whether big or small. Anyone who is aware of these writings, his way of preaching and calling people to Allâh and of the way of his pupils and disciples, can easily find out that his approach was not different from that of our virtuous Predecessors, the great Imâms of learning and guidance. Indeed, he has propounded what they did throughout their lives concerning the worship of Allâh Alone and leaving all innovations and superstitions aside.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the foundation of the Saudi regime and this view is held by the scholars of Saudi Arabia . The hard attitude shown by the Saudi government is directed only against the superstitions and innovations in contradiction with Islam, or the extreme type of extravagance which is totally prohibited by the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم . All Muslims, scholars and rulers of Saudi Arabia hold great respect and love for every Muslim regardless of his affiliation to any group or country in the world. They do reject all types of celebrations or gatherings which are based on innovation, with no authority from Allâh or His Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم .<br>
They oppose them because every new matter in the religion is an innovation and because the Muslims are commanded to follow, not to innovate. Islam is perfect and complete by itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is in no need of any addition after what Allâh and His Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم have ordained and what the <em>Ahl-as-Sunnah wal-Jamâ&#8217;ah,</em> from among the Companions, the Successors and their followers have already received. To forbid celebrating the birthday of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم due to its innovative nature in addition to the signs of extravagance and <em>Shirk</em> normally associated with it, is not un-Islamic or derogatory to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم . Instead, it is an act of obedience as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم himself said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; إياكم والغلو في الدين فإنما أهلك من كان قبلكم الغلو في الدين &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beware of the extravagance in matters of religion. Those before you have perished because of extravagance in the matters of religion&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; لا تطروني كما أطرت النصارى ابن مريم, إنما أنا عبد فقولوا عبد الله ورسوله &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not lavish praise on me as the Christians did with the son of Maryam. I am but a slave. So simply say: `Slave of Allâh and His Messenger.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what I wanted to point out regarding the aforesaid article.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allâh help us and all the Muslims to understand His religion, to continually confirm us on it, stick to Sunnah and keep away from the innovation. Indeed He is Generous and Kind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And may Allâh shower His blessings and mercy upon our Prophet Muhammad, his posterity and his Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BASIS OF RIGHT GUIDANCE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahallaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Religion of the Muslims is built upon following the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of His Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon. So these are the three infallible <i>usool</i> (fundamentals). So whatever the Ummah differs in, then it is referred back to Allaah and His Messenger. Thus, it is not for anyone to set-up a person for the Ummah, and to call to his way, and form <i>walaa</i> (love, loyalty and allegiance) and <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and hatred) based upon that, except for the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Nor is any speech set-up for them based upon which they form <i>walaa</i> and <i>&#8216;adaa</i>, except for the speech of Allaah, and that of His Messenger, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon. Rather, this is the practice of the people of Innovation, who set-up a person, or a saying, with which they cause splits in the Ummah; forming <i>walaa</i> or<i> &#8216;adaa</i> based upon that saying or ascription.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; also said:<br>
&#8220;It is not for anyone to ascribe himself to a particular Shaykh and to have <i>walaa</i> with those who follow him, or to have <i>&#8216;adaa</i> based upon that. Rather, he should have <i>walaa</i> for everyone who is from the people of <i>eemaan</i> (i.e. is a Muslim) and is known to have <i>taqwaa</i> (piety and obedience to Allaah in that which He has ordered and prohibited), from the Shaykhs, or from others. No one should be particularised with an increase in <i>walaa</i> except if he sees from him greater <i>eemaan</i> and <i>taqwaa</i>. So precedence and excellence is given to whomsoever Allaah and His Messenger have given them to. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O mankind! Indeed We created you from a man and a woman, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Indeed the most noblest of you with Allaah are those that have the most <i>taqwaa</i> (piety).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:13].&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SECTARIANISM AND MISPLACED LOYALTIES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah said:<br>
&#8220;Indeed the people of the truth and the Sunnah do not follow anyone (unconditionally) other than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; who does not speak from his desires, rather it is nothing less than Revelation sent down to him. So it is obligatory to affirm all that he informs, and to obey all that he commands. This status is not given to anyone else from this Ummah. Rather, every person&#8217;s saying can be taken or left, except that of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. So whoever sets up an individual other than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, such that the one who loves and agrees with him is reckoned to be from <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, and the one that differs with him is reckoned to be from the people of innovations and sectarianism &#8211; as happens with those groups who follow certain Imaams of <i>kalaam</i> (theology and rhetorical speech) &#8211; then the person doing so is from the people of innovation, deviation and sectarianism.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; further said:<br>
&#8220;Indeed many &#8211; from the people who say such sayings &#8211; follow their desires in this, in order to elevate their egos, or to gain leadership; or whatever is connected to it. Their intention is not to make the word of Allaah uppermost, nor is it to make the Religion purely for Allaah. Indeed, they have hatred for those who oppose them &#8211; even if it is a <i>mujtahid</i> (a Scholar striving his utmost to arrive at the truth) who is excused, and whom Allaah is not angry with. Likewise, they are pleased with those who agree with them &#8211; even if it is an ignorant person with evil intentions, who neither has any knowledge, nor good intent. This leads them to praise those whom Allaah and His Messenger have not praised, and to censure those whom Allaah and His Messenger have not censured. It also causes them to have <i>walaa</i> (love and allegiance) and <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and hatred) based upon their own self-desires, not upon the Religion of Allaah and His Messenger &#8230; So whosoever does this will only bring about <i>fitan</i> (trials and discord) between the people.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PRESERVING THE LOVE AND UNITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Religion of Allaah orders to judge (with justice) in all matters, and not to have <i>walaa</i> (love, loyalty and allegiance) with your brother merely because he agrees with you, or to have <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and being distant) from him merely because he disagrees with you on a certain opinion or issue. This is not from justice at all! The Companions &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> &#8211; differed in various issues, yet this did not affect the happiness and sincerity between them, nor their <i>walaa</i> and love for each other &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all. So the Believer acts upon the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed and Divine Islaamic Law) of Allaah, follows the truth, gives priority to the evidences before anyone &#8211; yet in doing so, he does not oppress his brother, nor negate doing justice to him when he differs regarding any issue of <i>ijtihaad</i> in which the evidences are not so apparent. Likewise is the case for those issues in which differences occur due to a different interpretation of the text. So, in such instances he is excused, and it is upon you to sincerely advice him, and to love only the good for him, and not to split-up, nor to have enmity and hatred between you and your brother &#8211; and there is no might, nor any power, except with Allaah. &#8220;5</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SHAYKH &#8216;ABDUL-&#8216;AZEEZ BIN BAAZ</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: What is the obligation upon the Muslim Scholars with regard to the large number of <i>jam&#8217;iyyaat</i> (societies) and <i>jamaa&#8217;aat</i> (groups) in many of the Islaamic lands and elsewhere, and with regard to the differences that exist between them, to the point that each group declares the others to be misguided. Do you not hold that it is fitting to enter into explaining the like of this matter, and to clarify the truth concerning their differences, for fear that these differences will increase and lead to evil consequences for the Muslims?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;Our Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> made clear to us a single way which it is obligatory upon the Muslims to follow and traverse, and that is Allaah&#8217;s Straight Path and the methodology of His upright religion. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. Just as the Lord of Might and Majesty warned the Ummah (nation) of Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> against splitting and disunity, since that is one of the greatest causes of failure and of the enemy taking control, as occurs in the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s: <b>&#8220;And fold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not be divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:101]. And His &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nooh, and that which We revealed to you, and that which We ordained for Ibraaheem, Moosaa and &#8216;Eesaa <i>&#8216;alayhimus-salaam</i>, saying: that you should establish the religion by doing that which you are ordered with, and make no divisions in it. Intolerable for the Pagans is that to which you call them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:13]. So this is a Divine call to unity and for hearts to be harmonised. And in any Islaamic land, if there are many groups for the purpose of good, aid, co-operating in righteousness and piety between the Muslims &#8211; without their being differences between the desires of the companions and followers &#8211; then this is good, is a blessing, and produces great benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if each of them declare the others to be misguided and attack their actions, then this harm is very great and its evil consequences very serious. Then what is obligatory upon the Muslims is to clarify the true state of affairs and to discuss with each group and to sincerely advise all of them that they should proceed upon the way laid down by Allaah for His servants, and upon that which our Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> called to. Then those who ignore this, or continue in their stubbornness, due to personal benefit or goal &#8211; known only to Allaah &#8211; then what is obligatory upon those who know the reality is to make this known about them and to warn against them, so that the people may avoid their path, and that those who do not know the reality of their affair may not fall into it and be led astray, and that they are not turned away from the Straight Path which Allaah ordered that we follow, as occurs in His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. And from that which there is no doubt about is that the multitude of sects and groups in the Islaamic society is, firstly something desired by Shaytaan, and secondly something desired by the enemies of Islaam from amongst mankind. Since agreement and unification of the Muslims, and their being aware of the dangers which threaten them and their <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs), will make them active in refuting and rebutting it, and acting in a unified manner for the benefit of the Muslims &#8211; thus repelling the danger from their religion, their lands and their brothers. And this is something which the enemies &#8211; from amongst mankind and jinn &#8211; are not pleased with. Therefore they are very eager to split-up the Muslims, destroy their unity and to sow the seeds of enmity and discord between them. We ask Allaah that He unites the Muslims upon the truth and that He removes from their society every type of misguidance and every cause of discord. Indeed He is the One Who is able to do that, and He is the One having full power over it.&#8221; 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: &#8230; and the students of knowledge refer back to you and to the other major Scholars and ask them. So what do you advise them? Do you advise and approve of entering (i.e. joining) the likes of these groups; such as <i>Jamaa&#8217;atul-Ikhwaan</i>, <i>Jamaa&#8217;atut-Tableegh</i>, <i>Jamaa&#8217;atul-Jihaad</i>, and so on, or do you advise them to remain upon seeking knowledge with the students of knowledge from those who call to the way of the Salaf (the Pious Predecessors)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;All praise is for Allaah and may Allaah extol and send blessings of peace upon His Prophet. We advise them all to unite upon a single way and that is the way of seeking knowledge and attaining understanding of the Book and the Sunnah, and to proceed along the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah. I advise them all that their goal should be to follow the Book and the Sunnah and to proceed upon the <i>manhaj</i> of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah, and that they should all call themselves Ahlus-Sunnah or the followers of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors). But as for <i>tahazzub</i> (bigotted partisanship) for the <i>Ikhwaanul-Muslimeen</i>, or <i>Jamaa&#8217;atut-Tableegh</i>, or so on, then I do not advise that. That is a mistake. Rather we advise them that they should be together upon a single way, a single <i>jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, advising one another with the truth and having allegiance to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah. This is the correct way to prevent differences. But if there are various groups upon that same way (i.e. of following the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i>) &#8211; a group in such and such a place, and another in such and such a place &#8211; but all of them are upon the <i>Salafee</i>2 way, following the Book and the Sunnah, calling to Allaah and having allegiance to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah &#8211; without <i>tahazzub</i> (partisanship) and without <i>ta&#8217;assub</i> (bigotted blind-following) &#8211; then that is not harmful &#8211; even if there are a number of groups &#8211; as long as their way and their goal is one.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SHAYKH SAALIH AL-FAWZAAN</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: Noble Shaykh, with regards to the serious state in which the Ummah of Islaam lives &#8211; a state of confusion in peoples&#8217; thoughts &#8211; particularly in matter relating to the Religion. For the Islamic <i>Jamaa&#8217;ahs</i> (groups) and sects have become many, and each of them claim that their <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) is the correct Islamic methodology which must be followed. So the Muslim is left in a state of confusion as to what he should follow and which one is upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;Splitting up is not from the Religion, since the Religion commands us with unity and that we should be a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and a single Ummah upon the <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (belief) of Tawheed (i.e. to single out Allaah alone for worship) and upon following the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Indeed this Ummah of yours is a single Ummah and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone.&#8221; </b>[Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:92]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:103]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Indeed those who split-up their Religion and become sects, you have no part with them in the least. Their affair is with Allaah who will tell them what they used to do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:159]. So this contains a severe warning against splitting and differing. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;And do not be like those who split-up and differed after the clear evidences came to them. For them is a tremendous punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:105].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So our Religion is the Religion of <i>al-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, and the Religion of agreement and unity. Splitting is not from the Religion, since the Religion orders that we are a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;The Believer to the Believer is like a building, one part supporting the other.&#8221;</i>4 And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;The example of the Believers with respect to their mutual love, mercy and affection is like the example of a single body.&#8221;</i>5 And it is known that a building and a body are a single cohesive thing, not disunited and fragmented &#8211; since if a building splits then it will collapse; and likewise a body, if it splits, then life will be lost. Thus, there must be a unity and we must be a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> whose foundations is Tawheed and whose methodology is the <i>da&#8217;wah</i> (call) of the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; and which proceeds upon the Religion of Islaam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. So these groups, and this splitting which is present today, is not approved of by Islaam. Rather, Islaam forbids it severely and commands uniting upon the <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (belief) of Tawheed and upon the methodology of Islaam, a single <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and a single Ummah, just as our Lord &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; ordered. And splitting and their being many (differing) groups and parties is from the plots of the devils &#8211; from the jinn and mankind &#8211; against this Ummah. So the <i>kuffaar</i> (disbelievers) and the <i>munaafiqs</i> (hypocrites) have never ceased, since olden times, introducing their poison in order to split the Ummah. The jews said previously: <b>&#8220;And a party of the People of the Book say: Believe in the morning in that which is revealed to the Muslims, but reject it at the end of the day, so they may turn back.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:72]. Meaning: that the Muslims will leave their religion when they see you leaving it. And the Hypocrites said: <b>&#8220;Do not spend on those who are with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger until they desert him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Munaafiqoon 63:7]. <b>&#8220;And as for those who erect a mosque by way of disbelief and seeking to harm and disunite the Believers &#8230;&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:107].&#8221; 6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is the ruling with regards to those who align themselves with those <i>jamaa&#8217;ahs</i>, particularly those that are established upon secrecy and giving <i>bay&#8217;ah</i> (pledge of allegiance to the party leader)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> informed us that splitting would occur and he ordered us, at that particular time, to come together and to be upon that which the Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and his Companions were upon. So he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The jews split-up into seventy-one sects and my Ummah would split-up into seventy-three sects. All of them are in the Fire except one.&#8221;</i> They said: Who is it O Messenger of Allaah? So he replied: <i>&#8220;That which I and my Companions are upon this day.&#8221;</i>7 And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said, when his Companions asked him to advise him: <i>&#8220;I advise you to have taqwaa (fear and obedience) of Allaah and to hear and to obey, even if an Abysinnian slave is a leader over you. And those of you who live long after me will see many differences of opinion. So hold fast to my Sunnah and the guidance of the Rightly-Guided Khaleefahs (Successors) after me; cling to it tightly &#8230;&#8221;</i>8 So this is the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) which is obligatory for all the Muslims to follow, until the Day of Resurrection. So when disagreements occur then they must return back to that which the Salaf (the Pious Predecessors) of this Ummah were upon, with regards to <i>manhaj</i>, <i>bay&#8217;ah</i> (pledge of allegiance), and other matter connected to the Religion.&#8221;</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwaas by Shaykh ’Abdul-’Azeez bin Baaz, Shaykh Naasirud-Deen al-Albaanee, Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen<br>
Al-Ibaanah Online, Issue No.3 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1416H / April 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fatwa of Shaykh bin Baaz</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q] What is the obligation upon the Muslim Scholars with regard to the large number of <i>jamiyyaat</i> (societies) and <i>jamaa’at</i> (groups) in many of the Islaamic lands and elsewhere, and with regard to the differences that exist between them, to the point that each group declares the others to be misguided. Do you not hold that it is fitting to enter into explaining the like of this matter, and to clarify the truth concerning their differences, for fear that these differences will increase and lead to evil consequences for the Muslims?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Our Prophet <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> made clear to us a single way which it is obligatory upon the Muslims to follow and traverse, and that is Allaah’s Straight Path and the methodology of His upright religion. Allaah &#8211; <i>the Most High</i> &#8211; said: <b>“And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious.”</b> [Soorah al An’aam 6:153]. Just as the Lord of Might and Majesty warned the Ummah (nation) of Muhammad <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> against splitting and disunity, since that is one of the greatest causes of failure and of the enemy taking control, as occurs in the saying of Allaah &#8211; <i>the Mighty and Majestic’s</i> &#8211; : <b>“And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not be divided.”</b> [Soorah Aal-Imraan 3: 101 ]. And His &#8211; <i>the Most High’s</i> &#8211; saying: <b>“He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nooh, and that which We revealed to you, and that which We ordained for Ibraaheem, Moosaa and ’Eesaa ’alayhimus-salaam, saying: that you should establish the religion by doing that which you are ordered with, and make no divisions in it. Intolerable for the Pagans is that to which you call them.”</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a Divine call to unity and for hearts to be harmonised. And in any Islaamic land, if there are many groups for the purpose of good, aid, cooperating in righteousness and piety between the Muslims without their being differences between the desires of the companions and followers &#8211; then this is good, is a blessing, and produces great benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if each of them declare the others to be misguided and attack their actions, then this harm is very great and its evil consequences very serious. Then what is obligatory upon the Muslims is to clarify the true state of affairs and to discuss with each group and to sincerely advise all of them that they should proceed upon the way laid down by Allaah for His servants, and upon that which our Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> called to. Then those who ignore this, or continue in their stubbornness, due to personal benefit or goal &#8211; known only to Allaah &#8211; then what is obligatory upon those who know the reality is to make this known about them and to warn against them, so that the people may avoid their path, and that those who do not know the reality of their affair may not fall into it and be led astray, and that they are not turned away from the Straight Path which Allaah ordered that we follow, as occurs in His &#8211; <i> the Mighty and Majestic’s</i> &#8211; saying: <b>“And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious.”</b> [Soorah al-An’aam 6:153]. And from that which there is no doubt about is that the multitude of sects and groups in the Islaamic society is, firstly something desired by Shaytaan, and secondly something desired by the enemies of Islaam from amongst mankind. Since agreement and unification of the Muslims, and their being aware of the dangers which threaten them and their <i>’aqeedah</i> (beliefs), will make them active in refuting and rebutting it, and acting in a unified manner for the benefit of the Muslims, thereby repelling the danger from their religion, their lands and their brothers. And this is something which the enemies -from amongst mankind and jinn &#8211; are not pleased with. Therefore they are very eager to split-up the Muslims, destroy their unity and to sow the seeds of enmity and discord between them. We ask Allaah that He unites the Muslims upon the truth and that He removes from their society every type of misguidance and every cause of discord. Indeed He is the One Who is able to do that, and He is the One having full power over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fatwaa of Shaykh al-Albaanee</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is the <i> Sharee’ah</i> ruling concerning these numerous Islaamic groups, parties and organizations which differ amongst themselves in their <i>minhaaj</i> (methodology), their modes of operations, their <i>da’wah</i> (call), their ’aqeedah (beliefs) and the foundations upon which they are based. Especially when the group of truth is a single one, as is proven by the hadeeth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: We have spoken a lot about the answer to this question, therefore we shall be brief whilst speaking about it. So we say: It will not be hidden from any Muslim who has knowledge of the Book and the <i>Sunnah</i> and that which our <i> Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors) &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all &#8211; were upon, that firstly; formation of parties and organizing into groups with differing thought, and secondly; differing in the <i>minhaaj</i> (methodology), is not from Islaam at all. Rather it is from what our Lord &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; has actually forbidden, in more than one <i> aayah</i> (verse) from the noble Qur‘aan. From this is His &#8211;<i> the Most High’s</i> &#8211; saying: <b>“And do not be like those who worship others besides Allaah &#8211; those who split-up their religion and become sects. Each party rejoicing in only that which is with them.”</b> [Soorah Room 30:31-32]. And our Lord &#8211;<i> the Mighty and Majestic</i> &#8211; also says: <b>“And if your Lord has so willed, He could have made mankind a single nation. But they will not cease to differ, except those upon whom your Lord has bestowed His Mercy.”</b> [Soorah Hood 11: 118 -119] So Allaah &#8211; <i>the Most Blessed, the Most High</i> &#8211; made exempted from this differing and disagreement &#8211; a differing which must occur by Allaah’s creational Decree , but not as something that He is pleased with or desires from us &#8211; that sect upon which He has bestowed His Mercy, as occurs in His saying:<b> “ &#8230; except those upon whom your Lord has bestowed His Mercy.”</b> And there is no doubt whatsoever, that any group that has purity of intention for Allaah, and earnestly desire to be from that nation which is exempted from this differing; and upon whom Allaah has bestowed His Mercy, then there is no way to practically reach and attain this in the Islaamic societies, except by returning to the Book and to the <i>Sunnah</i> of the Messenger <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> and to what our <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors) &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all &#8211; were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah’s Messenger <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> made clear the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) and the correct way, in many authentic ahaadeeth: From the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>, that one day he drew a straight line upon the ground, and drew short lines around the straight line. Then he recited Allaah &#8211; <i>the Most Blessed, the Most High’s</i> &#8211; saying: <b>“And this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow paths other that will separate you from His Path.”</b> [Soorah al-An’aam 6:153]. He then pointed with his finger to the straight line and said that this is Allaah’s Straight Path. Then he pointed to the other lines away from the Straight Path and said: <i>“</i><em>At the head of each of these other paths, there is a devil calling the people to it.</em><i>”</i> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that these short paths are those which represent the many parties and groups. Therefore, what is obligatory upon every Muslim who truly desires to be from <i>al-Firqatun-Naajiyah</i> (the Saved Sect) is that he proceeds upon the Straight Path &#8211; neither turning to its left or its right. And there is no party which is successful, except the Party of Allaah, about which the noble Qur‘aan mentions to us: <b>“Indeed, it is the Party of Allaah who are succesful.”</b> [Soorah al-Mujaadilah 58:22].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, every party which is not the party of Allaah is only from the party of Shaytaan and not from the party of <i>ar-Rahmaan</i> (the Most Merciful). And there is also no doubt at all, that proceeding upon the Straight Path requires correct knowledge of it, and this cannot be attained by mere organization and mere formation of parties &#8211; that desire to be upon true Islaam, but not truly understanding what was the Islaam that Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High &#8211; sent down upon the heart of Muhammad <i> sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>. And the sign of the Saved-Sect was clearly stated by the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i>, when he was asked about it &#8211; so he said: <i>“</i><em>It is that which I and my Companions are upon.</em><i>”</i> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this hadeeth indicates to the one eagerly seeking knowledge of Allaah’s Straight Path, that one must have knowledge of two extremely important matters: &#8211; <i><b> Firstly</b></i>: That which the Messenger <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> was upon. <b><i>Secondly</i></b>. That which his <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam’s</i> Companions were upon. this is because the noble Companions were those who transmitted the guidance of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> and his <i>Sunnah</i> to us, and secondly that they were the ones who best followed this <i>Sunnah</i> in practice. So since this is the case, it is not therefore possible for us to have a correct understanding of the Prophet’s <i>Sunnah</i>, except by way of his Companions &#8230; Thus, attaining a correct understanding of Islaam cannot be possible except through knowing the life examples of the Companions and how they followed this great Islaam which they took from the Prophet <i> sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> &#8211; either from his sayings, actions or tacit approvals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we believe with certainty, that every group that does not establish itself upon the foundations of the Book and the <i>Sunnah</i> and the <i>manhaj</i> (methodology) of the <i>Salafus-Saalih</i> having extensively and comprehensively studied the rulings of Islaam, the large and the small, the principles and the branches then this group will not be from the Saved Sect; the Sect that which proceeds upon the Straight Path which was indicated by the Messenger <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> in the authentic hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if we imagined that there are separate groups in the Islaamic lands, upon this <i>manhaj</i> (methodology), then they will not be considered as being parties, rather they are a single group, with a single <i>manhaj</i> and its path is a single one. Though they are separated by land, they are not, however, separated in thoughts, <i>’aqeedah</i> (beliefs), or <i>manhaj</i>. Rather this separation is only due to a physical separation of land &#8211; as opposed to the various groups and parties, which may even be in a single land, yet despite this, each party is pleased only with what it possess. As for these types of parties, we do not believe that they are upon the Straight Path. Rather we state with certainty, that they are upon those paths &#8211; at the head of each one there is a devil calling the people to it. And hopefully this contains an answer for what has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fatwaa of Shaykh Ibn al-’Uthaymeen</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[QJ: Are there any texts from the Book of Allaah or the <i>Sunnah</i> of His Prophet <i> sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> which contain an allowance of multiple groups and parties or <i>al-Ikhwaan</i>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: I say: There is not in either the Book or the <i>Sunnah</i> that which allows multiple parties and groups. Rather, there is in the Book and the <i>Sunnah</i> that which censures this. Allaah &#8211; <i>the Most High</i> &#8211; said: <b>“Verily those who split-up their religion and become sects, you have no concern with them in the least. Their affair is with Allaah, Who will tell them about what they used to do.”</b> [Soorah al-An’aam 6: 159]. Allaah &#8211; <i> the Most High</i> &#8211; said: <b>“Each sect rejoicing in only that which is with itself.”</b> [Soorah Room 30:32]. And there is no doubt that these parties are contrary to what Allaah ordered. Rather what Allaah has ordered and encouraged is in His saying: <b>“And indeed this Ummah of yours is one Ummah and I am your Lord, so fear and obey Me.”</b> [Soorah al-Mu‘minoon 23:52]. And some people say: It is not possible for the <i> da’wah</i> (call) to be strong unless it is done within the framework of a party! We say to that: This is incorrect! Rather the <i>da’wah</i> will be strong whenever the person is under the Book of Allaah and the <i> Sunnah</i> of His Messenger <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> following the narrations of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu </i> <i>’alayhi wa sallam</i> and that of his Companions.</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Comprehensive Guidance</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From al-Haarith al-Ash’aree <i>radiallaahu ’anhu</i>, who said that Allaah’s Messenger <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah &#8211; <i>the Most High</i> &#8211; ordered Yahyaa ibn Zakariyyaa <i>’alayhimus-salaam</i> with five things; that he should act upon them and order the Chldren of <i> Israa‘eel</i> to cat upon them. ’Eesaa ibn Maryam <i>’alayhis-salaam</i> said to him: Indeed Allaah ordered you with five things, that you act upon them and that you order the Children of <i>Israa‘eel</i> to act upon them. So either you order them, or I will order them. So Zakariyyaa said: If you precede me in that, I fear that I will be punished or swallowed up by the earth. So he gathered the people in the mosque of Jerusalem until it was filled, and the people sat upon its walls. He admonished them saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Indeed Allaah has ordered me with five things which I should act upon and order you to act upon. The first of them is that you should worship Allaah and not associate anything along with Him in this worship. That one who associates anything in worship with Allaah is like a man who bought a slave with his own wealth &#8211; either gold or silver &#8211; and said: This is my house and this is my work, so work and give the wages to me. So the slave worked and gives the wages to other than his owner. So which of you would be pleased for his slave to be like that? But Allaah created you and provides for you, so do not associate anything in worship with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I order you with Prayer, and when you pray then do not turn aside.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I order you with Fasting. And that is the like of a man, amongst a group of people, who had a small pouch containing musk. Each of them likes to smell it. And, to Allaah, the fasting person is better than the smell of musk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I order you with <i>sadaqah</i> (charity). For its likeness is that of a man taken prisoner by the enemy, so they take hold of him and tie his hand to his neck, so he says: Will you not allow me to ransom myself from you? So he gives them small and large amounts to escape from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I order you to make mention and remember Allaah alot. And the like of this is a man being chased by the enemy, who are hastening after him. So he comes to a protected fortress and enters into its protection. Likewise is the case for the servant. For he does not protect himself from Shaytaan, except through the remembrance of Allaah &#8211; <i>the Mighty and Majestic</i>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger <i>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <b>“I order you with five things which Allaah ordered me with: The <i>Jamaa’ah</i>, [1] hearing, obeying, <i>hijrah</i> (migration) and <i>jihaad</i> in the way of Allaah &#8211; <i>the Mighty and Majestic</i>. So whosoever separates from the <i>Jamaa’ah</i> by a hand-span, throws of the yoke of Islaam from his neck, unless he repents. And whosoever calls with the call of the days of ignorance, then he is from the horde of Hell-Fire”</b> It was said: Even if he fasts and prays? He said: <b>“Even if he fasts and prays. So call with the call of Allaah, which Allaah gave: The Muslims, the Believers, Worshippers of Allaah.”</b> [2]</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. At Teebee said &#8211; as occurs in <i>Tuhfatul-Awaadhee Sharh Sununut-Tirmidhee</i> (5/162): “What is meant by the <i>Jamaa’ah</i> is the Companions, the <i> Taabi’een</i> and the generation after the <i>Taabi’een</i> &#8211; the <i> Salafus-Saalih</i> (Pious Predecessors): That is, I order you to cling to their guidance and their way, and to associate with them.”<br>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Istiqaamah &#8211; Shawwaal 1418H / February 1998 &#8211; Issue No.8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]:<b>THE OBLIGATION TO UNIFY THE RANKS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ibn al-&#8216;Uthaymeen &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;From the sincere advice which I hold to be necessary in the Religion to give to the youths, a word which I hope that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; will cause to be of benefit, and it is:That they should all be in conformity and harmony, so that they may become strong, and become an obstacle blocking the way of those who plot against Islaam and its people. This is what Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; has enjoined upon us. He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not be divided. And remember the favour of Allaah upon you, in that you were once enemies to one another, but He joined your hearts together, so that by His Grace you became brothers.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:103]. And Allaah the Blessed, the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Let there arise from amongst you a group of people inviting to all that is good, enjoining the good and forbidding the evil. It is they who are the successful ones, And do not be like those who differed amongst themselves after the clear proofs had come to them; for them is a painful punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:104-105]. So Allaah ordered that they should all cling together to His rope and He forbade splitting, and in other Aayahs He forbade differing, and informed us that it is the cause of failure and the cause of decline of strength, and He ordered us to persevere patiently. So Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And do not differ, lest you lose courage and your strength departs, and be patient. Indeed Allaah is with those who are patient.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:46]. And as is known, the people of good who help the youths of the revival in their work &#8211; with what they are able from wealth, and so on &#8211; if they see them splitting in this way, then they will not be so eager to help and assist them. So I call all of our brothers to unite together, and to fear Allaah with regards to themselves and with regards to the Ummah (nation) of Islaam, and that they should not cover up this light which has appeared on the horizon; the call to Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8230;&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:<br>
&#8220;Holding fast to the rope of Allaah altogether and not becoming divided is one of the greatest usool (fundamentals) of Islaam.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]:<b>THE PROHIBITION OF SPLITTING</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;Splitting up is not from the Religion, since the Religion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">commands us with unity and that we should be a single Jamaa&#8217;ah and a single Ummah upon the &#8216;aqeedah (belief) of Tawheed (i.e. to single out Allaah alone for worship) and upon following the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;aloyhi wa sallam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b>&#8220;Indeed this Ummah of yours is a single Ummah and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:92]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High -said: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmaan 3:103]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Indeed those who split-up their Religion and become sects, you have no part with them in the least. Their affair is with Allaah who will tell them what they used to do.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:159]. So this contains a severe warning against splitting and differing. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And do not be like there who split-up and differed after the clear evidences came to them. For them is a tremendous punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:105].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So our Religion is the Religion of al-Jamaa&#8217;ah, and the Religion of agreement and unity. Splitting is not from the Religion, since the Religion orders that we are a single Jamaa&#8217;ah and the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: <i>&#8220;The Believer to the Believer is like a building, one part supporting the other.&#8221;</i>3 And he sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam also said: <i>&#8220;The example of the Believers with respect to their mutual love, mercy and affection is like the example of a single body.&#8221;</i>4 And it is known that a building and a body are a single cohesive thing, not disunited and fragmented &#8211; since if a building splits then it will collapse; and likewise a body, if it splits, then life will be lost. Thus, there must be a unity and we must be a single Jamaa&#8217;ah whose foundation is Tawheed and whose methodology is the da&#8217;wah (call) of the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam; and which proceeds upon the Religion of Islaam. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b>&#8220;And this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:153]. So these groups, and this splitting which is present today, is not approved of by Islaam. Rather, Islaam forbids it severely and commands uniting upon the &#8216;aqeedah (belief) of Tawheed and upon the methodology of Islaam, a single Jamaa&#8217;ah and a single Ummah, just as our Lord &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; ordered. And splitting and their being many (differing) groups and parties is from the plots of the devils &#8211; from the jinn and mankind against this Ummah. So the kuffaar (disbelievers) and the munaafiqs (hypocrites) have never ceased, since olden times, introducing their poison in order to split the Ummah. The jews said previously: <b>&#8220;And a party of the People of the Book say: Believe in the morning in that which is revealed to the Muslims, but reject it at the end of the day, so they turn back.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: that the Muslims will leave their religion when they see you leaving it. And the Hypocrites said: <b>&#8220;Do not spend on those who are with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger until they desert him.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Munaafiqoon 63:7]. <b>&#8220;And as for those who erect a mosque by way of disbelief and seeking to harm and disunite the Believers &#8230;&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Tawbah 9:107].&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]: <b>THE CONNECTION BETWEEN UNITY AND REFUTING FALSE BELIEFS AND PRACTICES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is no doubt that it is obligatory upon the Muslims to unify their ranks and to unite their word upon the truth and to co-operate in goodness and piety against the enemies of Islaam &#8211; as Allaah, the Most Perfect &#8211; ordered them with in His saying: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:102]. And likewise, Allaah has warned the Muslims against splitting up, as occurs in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And do not be like those who differed and split-up after the clear evidences came to them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:105]. However, the order to unify the Muslims and unite their word upon the truth and to hold fast to the rope of Allaah, does not mean that they should not censure wrong beliefs and practices &#8211; whether from the Soofees or other than them. Rather, what the order to hold fast to the Rope of Allaah necessitates is: To order the good; forbid the evil; to clarify the truth, with the clear Sharee&#8217;ah proofs, to whomsoever is misguided or has a mistaken opinion, until they unite upon the truth and turn away from that which opposes it. All of this is included in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying:<b> &#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2]. And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Let there arise from amongst you a group of people calling to all that is good, enjoining the good and forbidding the evil, they are the ones who are successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal&#8217;Imraan 3:1 10]. And when the people of truth hold back from clarifying the mistakes of those who have erred or are mistaken, then they will not have achieved that which Allaah ordered them with, as regards calling to goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil. So the person in error will remain upon his error, and the one acting in opposition to the truth will remain upon his mistake. And this is contrary to what Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; prescribed, with regards to sincere advice, co-operation upon goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil &#8211; and Allaah alone is the One Who grants success.&#8221;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;Refuting ahlul-bida&#8217; (the innovators) is a Jihaad, to the extent that Yahyaa ibn Yahyaa (d.226H) said: &#8220;Defence of the Sunnah is more excellent than Jihaad in the path of Allaah.&#8221;7&#8243;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Humaydee (d.218H) &#8211; rahimahullaoh &#8211; said: &#8220;By Allaah, that I fight against those who reject the hadeeth of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam is more beloved to me than fighting the unbelievers.&#8221;9</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn al-Qayyim (d.751H)- rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;Jihaad with the clear proofs and the tongue; Comes before Jihaad with the sword and the spear.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;When some people asked Ahmad bin Hanbal (d.241H) that they felt uneasy about [criticising people] by saying that such and such is this, and such and such is that, he replied: &#8220;lf I were to remain silent, how would the ignorant ones know the authentic [narrations] from the inauthentic?&#8221; Similarly, the innovators who introduce heretical writings which oppose the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and those who innovate in matters of worship, then explaining their true condition and warning the Ummah against them is an obligation by the unanimous agreement of the Muslim Scholars. In fact, when Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal was asked whether a person who fasted, prayed and secluded himself in the mosque for worship was dearer to him than a person who spoke out against ahlul-bid&#8217;ah (the innovators), he replied: &#8220;When he fasts and prays and secludes himself, then he does so for the benefit of his own self. However, when he speaks out against the innovators, he does so for the benefit of the Muslims in general, and this is more virtuous.&#8221; So it is clear that opposing the Innovators is of general benefit to the Muslims and is considered one of the types of Jihaad in the path of Allaah. Since purifying the Religion of Allaah, and its minhaaj (methodology), its Shoree&#8217;ah, and defending it from their attacks and that of their enemies is a collective obligation &#8211; a fact which is agreed upon by the Scholars. For if Allaah did not raise up some people to repel the harms [caused by] others, then the Religion would become corrupted. Indeed, this type of corruption is even greater than the corruption resulting from the disbelievers conquering the Muslims. This is because <b>when the disbelievers conquer the Muslims, they do not corrupt their hearts nor their Religion, except after some time. Whereas the innovators corrupt the hearts from the very outset.&#8221;</b>11</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an important warning against a disease which has adversely affected many groups who ascribe themselves to the noble task of Da&#8217;wah. Everything which is outside the call of Islaam and the Qur‘aan, with regards to lineage, land, nationality, schools of thoughts and ways, then it is from the calls of jaahiliyyah. perfect opposite is confirmed for Allaah &#8211; the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Islaam has forbidden the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> (the pre-Islaamic days of ignorance) and there are many textual evidences which forbid all of the characteristics and manners of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> and their actions, except those (good and decent) practices which Islaam agreed to.  And there is no doubt that the call to nationalism is from these calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>, since nationalism is a call to other than Islaam and an aiding of other than the truth.  And how many ills, evils and serious wars has such calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> caused to their people, causing great harm to their souls, their wealth and their possessions. The consequences of such calls (for the Muslims) was a splitting up of their unity and a planting of enmity and hatred of each other in their hearts and a fragmentation and splitting between tribes and nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) – rahimahullaah – said: [2] “Everything which is outside the call of Islaam and the <em>Qur‘aan</em>, with regards to lineage, land, nationality, schools of thoughts and ways, then it is from the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>. Indeed, even when the <em>Muhaajirs</em> (those Companions who migrated from Makkah to al-Madeenah) and the <em>Ansaars</em> (those Companions who aided and supported those who migrated) argued, such that one of the <em>Muhaajirs</em> said: “O <em>Muhaajirs</em>! (implying; rally to my aid).”  And then one of the <em>Ansaar</em> said: “O Ansaar!”  Upon hearing this, the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Is it with the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> that you call, and I am still amongst you!”  And he became very angry at that.” [3]<br>
And from the textual evidences pertaining to this issue is Allaah the Most High’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And stay in your homes and do not display yourselves, like the display of the times of jaahiliyyah</strong> (pre-Islaamic ignorance)<strong>. But establish the Prayer, give the Zakaat and obey Allaah and His Messenger.</strong>” [Sooratul-Ahzaab 33:33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>When those who disbelieved placed in their hearts pride and arrogance the pride and arrogance of jaahiliyyah then Allaah sent down His tranquility upon His Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and upon the Believers&#8230;</strong>” [Sooratul-Fath 48:26].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Whosoever leaves off obedience and separates from the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> (united body) and dies, then he dies a death of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>.  Whoever fights under the banner of the blind, becoming angry for <em>’asabiyyah</em> (partisanship and party spirit), or calling to <em>’asabiyyah</em>, or assisting <em>’asabiyyah</em>, then dies, he dies a death of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>.” [4] Also in <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> (8/120), the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Indeed Allaah has revealed to me that you should have humility, and that no one should act proudly and oppressively over anyone else, nor should anyone boast over anyone else.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that the call to nationalism is a call to <em>’asabiyyah</em> (partisanship and party spirit) and it is a call to becoming angry for the sake of <em>’asabiyyah</em> and fighting for <em>’asabiyyah</em>. And there is no doubt also, that the call to nationalism is a call to transgression, pride and arrogance, since nationalism is not a divinely revealed way of life which prevents its people from oppression and proud boasting.  Rather it is an ideology from the time of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> which leads its people to boasting about it and having <em>’asabiyyah</em> for it even if they are the oppressors and the others are the oppressed!  So – O noble reader – consider this and the truth will be clear to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the textual evidences connected with this is what at-Tirmidhee relates from Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) that he said: “Let people stop boasting about their forefathers who have died, who are merely fuel for the Hellfire; or they will certainly be more insignificant with Allaah than the beetle which roles dung with its nose. Allaah has removed from you the party spirit of the days of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> and the boasting about one’s forefathers.  Indeed a person is either a pious Believer or a wretched sinner. All of mankind are the children of Aadam, and Aadam was created from clay.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) also said: “Indeed there is no excellence for an Arab over a non-Arab, nor a non-Arab over an Arab, nor a white person over a black one, nor a black person over a white one, except through <em>taqwaa</em> (piety and obedience to Allaah).” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this accords with Allaah the Most High&#8217;s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>O mankind! We have created you from male and female and have made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Indeed the most noblest of you with Allaah is the one who has the most taqwaa.</strong>” [Sooratul-Hujuraat 49:13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah – the One free from all defects – made clear in this noble <em>aayah</em> (verse) that people have been made into nations and tribes so that they may come to know each other, not that they should boast and have pride over one another.  And Allaah the Most High considered the most noblest of them to be the one with the most piety and <em>taqwaa</em>. Likewise, the previously mentioned narration shows the same meaning, and guides to the fact that it is from the ways of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> to vainly boast and to have false pride for one’s fore fathers and ancestry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> lead to, whereas Islaam is in opposition to this.  Rather Islaam calls to modesty, humility, <em>taqwaa</em> and to having love for the sake of Allaah, and that the true and sincere Muslims are merely one of the categories of the children of Aadam (<em>’alayhis-salaam</em>), and that the Muslims are a single body and a single structure; each part supporting the other and each part feeling the pain that the other parts are suffering as occurs in an authentic <em>hadeeth</em> (narration) from the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>), that he said: “The Believer to the Believer is like a solid building, one part supports the other.”  And he interlaced his fingers to demonstrate this. [7].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) also said: “The example of the Believer in their mutual love and mercy is like the example of a body, if one part of the body feels pain, then all the body suffers in sleeplessness and fever.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O people! I call to you in the name of Allaah. Does your nationalism call you to these noble manners of mercy and kindness to the Muslims the Arabs and the non-Arabs and of having mutual sympathy and concern for them, and feeling pain at their pain? No, by Allaah! Rather it calls you to having allegiance with those who have evil character and it calls you to cultivating enmity and hatred for those who deny this false creed of nationalism.  So beware, O Muslim who desires safety and salvation, and consider the reality of the affair with a fair consideration, without being prejudiced with party spirit and desires. Only then you will see the reality as it truly is.  So may Allaah guide me and you to the means of safety and salvation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is related by Imaam al-Bukhaaree in his <em>Saheeh</em> (8/137), that a young man from the <em>Muhaajirs</em> and a young man from the <em>Ansaar</em> quarreled.  So the <em>Muhaajir</em> said: “O <em>Muhaajirs</em>! (meaning: rally to my help).” And the <em>Ansaaree</em> said: “O <em>Ansaar</em>!” So the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) heard this and said: “Is it with the call of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> that you are calling out, and I am present amongst you!”  Even though the term <em>Muhaajir</em> and <em>Ansaar</em> are two ascriptions which are beloved to Allaah the One free from all defects and He has praised these two groups with a very great praise, in His the Most High’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And the first to embrace Islaam from the Muhaajirs and the Ansaar, and those who followed them in goodness, beliefs and actions. Allaah is well pleased with them, and they are well pleased with Him. He has prepared for them Gardens of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to live therein forever. That is the supreme achievement.</strong>” [Sooratut-Tawbah 9:100].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet in the above incident, this ascription to the <em>Muhaajirs</em> and seeking the help from them, and the <em>Ansaar</em> and seeking the help from them, when the likes of this was considered to be from the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>, then what about those who claim allegiance e to nationalism and seek help through that and become angry for that?  Will this not be more fitting to be considered one of the calls from the days of <em>jaahiliyyah</em>?   This is a matter in which there is no doubt, and it is one of the clearest of all matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is what has been established in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> (narration), from al-Haarith al-Ash’aree (<em>radiyallaahu ’anhu</em>), that the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “I order you with five things which Allaah ordered me with: The <em>Jamaa’ah</em>, listening, obeying, <em>hijrah</em> (migration) and <em>jihaad</em> in the way of Allaah the Mighty and Majestic.  So whosoever separates from the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> by a hand span, he throws the yoke of Islaam from his neck, unless he repents.  And whosoever calls with the call of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> (the days of ignorance), then he is from the hoarded heap of Hell Fire.” It was said: Even if he fasts and prays?  He said: “Even if he fasts and prays. So call with the call of Allaah which Allaah gave: The Muslims, the Believers, Worshippers of Allaah.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>hadeeth</em> is absolutely clear with regards to rendering futile the calls to nationalism.  Its callers deserve that they should be from the heap of Hellfire, even if they fast and they pray and claim that they are Muslims.  So what a severe threat and severe warning is given here; warning every Muslim from the calls of <em>jaahiliyyah</em> and warning them from entering into this even if such calls are adorned with false talks and enchanting speeches.  Rather it is a deception and a blind following which leads it s people to the worst and most despicable of ends. And we ask Allaah for safety and freedom from that.</p>

Source: Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: What is the obligation upon the Muslim Scholars with regard to facing the trials and calamities that have befallen the Islaamic world?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: From that which there is no doubt about is that sins, and being far removed from the correct Islaamic <i>&#8216;aqeedah</i> (beliefs) &#8211; in both sayings and actions &#8211; are from the greatest reasons of bringing about the various crisis and calamities that have befallen the Muslims. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Whatever of good reaches you, it is from Allaah; and whatever of evil befalls you, it is from yourself.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:79]. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the Most High &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. Yet He pardons much.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:30]. So Allaah is Most Forgiving and the Most Merciful to His servants, sending to them clear signs and warnings, in order that they may run back to Him in <i>tawbah</i> (sincere repentance) and that He may forgive them. So when a person runs to Allaah and draws closer to Him by an arm&#8217;s length, then Allaah draws closer to him by two arm&#8217;s length. For indeed Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; loves those of His servants that turn to Him in <i>tawbah</i> and is happy with that, whilst He &#8211; the Majestic, the Most High &#8211; remains absolutely self-sufficient from His servants. The obedience of the obedient ones does not benefit Him, nor do the sins of the sinful ones harm Him. But He is Most Kind, Ever Merciful to His servants. And He grants them the ability to do acts of obedience and to leave acts of disobedience. So these crisis and calamities are none other than a warning to His servants, in that they should turn back to Allaah in repentance and obedience, and He informs them of this by way of testing them. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And certainly We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruit. But give glad tidings to those who have <i>sabr</i> (patience); those who, when afflicted with a calamity, say: Indeed to Allaah we belong, and to Him shall we return. They are those for whom are the <i>salawaat</i> (blessings and forgiveness) from their Lord, and His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided-ones.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:155] Allaah &#8211; the One free From all defects &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Evil has appeared on the land and the sea, because of what the hands of men have earned. That Allaah may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return to Allaah in repentance.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Room 30:41]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And We shall test you by way of evil and good, and to Us will you return.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anbiyaa 21:35]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And We tested them with good blessings and evil calamities, in order that they may return to the obedience of Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-A&#8217;raaf 7:168]. And there are many other Verses with a similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the obligation upon the leaders of the Muslims &#8211; the Scholars, rulers, and other than them &#8211; is to have concern for the various afflictions and calamities that occurs, and to remind and admonish the people, and explain to them what they have fallen into. Also. those in authority &#8211; from the Scholars and the rulers &#8211; should set a good example of righteous conduct and should discuss the reasons as to why Allaah is angered and gives retribution; and they should seek to cure this with <i>tawbah</i> (repentance), <i>istighfaar</i> (seeking Allaah&#8217;s Forgiveness) and correcting their affairs. The rest of the Ummah will then follow them in this, since the guidance of the Scholars, and the wisdom of the rulers &#8211; and both being correct and upright &#8211; has one of the greatest effects with regards to the fulfillment of responsibilities. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Each of you is a guardian, and is responsible for those whom he is in charge of. So the ruler is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects; a man is the guardian of his family and is responsible for those under his care; a woman is a guardian of her husband&#8217;s home and is responsible for those under her care; a servant is the guardian of his master&#8217;s wealth and is responsible for that which he is entrusted with; and a man is the guardian of his father&#8217;s wealth and is responsible for that which is under his care. So each one of you is a guardian and is responsible for what he is entrusted with.&#8221;</i>2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, when the Muslims become accustomed to sinning and with being contented with it, and those who wield authority and power do not try to prevent them, then Allaah&#8217;s anger will quickly descend upon the Ummah. And when His anger occurs, and His punishment takes place, then it covers both the sinful and obedient, and Allaah&#8217;s protection is sought from this. About this Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;And beware of the <i>fitnah</i> (trial and discord) that does not affect in particular only those amongst you who are wrong-doers.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Afaal 8:25]. Likewise. the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;When the people see an evil, and they do not try to change it, then Allaah will cover them all with punishment from Himself.</i>&#8220;3 Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;Indeed Allaah will not change the condition of a people until they change themselves.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d 13:11]. So the Scholars will be thorougly questioned in front of Allaah with regards to them giving knowledge and guidance to the people, and explaining to them what is correct and what is wrong, and also clarifying the beneficial from the harmful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah that He favours all the Muslims and grants them the ability to be obedient to their Lord, and to cling to the guidance of their Prophet Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and that He grants their leaders the ability to fulfill their duties, and that He teaches their Scholars the ways of guidance, so that they may all traverse its path and direct the Ummah to it, and that He guides the misguided Muslims and corrects their affairs. Indeed He is the Guardian over this, and the One having power to do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: The enemies of Allaah are very eager to enter into the Muslim lands by various methods. So what efforts do you believe should be exerted in order to put a stop to this surge that has threatened the Islaamic societies?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: This is not something strange coming from the callers to Christianity, Judaism, or the other religions of <i>kufr</i> (disbelief). Since Allaah, the Most Perfect &#8211; and to Him belongs all praise &#8211; has informed us about this in His clear Revelation, when He said: <b>&#8220;Never will the Jews and the Christians be pleased with you until you follow their ways of life. Say: Indeed the Guidance of Allaah, that is the only true Guidance. And if you were to follow their false desires after what you have received of the knowledge of Revelation, then you would have neither a guardian, nor any helper against Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:120]. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;And they will never stop fighting you, until they turn you away from your Religion, if they can.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:217]. This is why they utilize every possible means to penetrate into the Muslim lands, and use various methods and tactics to acheive this. One of their methods is to plant the seeds of doubt and uncertainty into the minds and thoughts &#8211; and they continue to do so without easing-up or become weary &#8211; utilising the church to spread their hatred and enmity, and directing their efforts through it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is obligatory upon the leaders and Scholars to exert every possible effort in cautioning and directing the Muslim children, and to oppose the efforts of the enemies of Islaam with countermeasures. For indeed the Ummah of Islaam is an Ummah that has been entrusted  with a responsibility of carrying this Religion and conveying it to others. So when we &#8211; in the Islaamic societies &#8211; are determined to arm our sons and daughters with correct knowledge, and true understanding of the Religion; beginning this process at an early age, then we will never fear the enemy &#8211; by the permission of Allaah. Thus, as long as we continue to cling to the Religion of Allaah, glorifying and venerating Him, following His <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed Laws), and fighting those who oppose Him, then the opposite will happen; it will be the enemies of Allaah who will fear the Muslims. Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, the One to Whom belongs all praise &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O you who believe. If you help Allaah by acting upon what you have been commanded with, then Allaah will plant your feet firmly by giving you victory over your enemies.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Muhammad 47:7]. Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; also said: <b>&#8220;But if you have <i>sabr</i> (remain patient) and have <i>taqwaa</i> (piety) by doing what Allaah orders and refraining from what He has prohibited, then no harm will their cunning plots be to you at all. Indeed Allaah encompasses everything by His Knowledge.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-lmraan 3:120]. And there are plenty of other Verses with similar meaning. So the most important factor in stopping this attack is to prepare a generation that truly know and understands the realities of Islaam. This can be achieved by giving them the correct guidance and cultivation at home, and by utilising the various means of education in order to develop the society. Add to this the role of guiding, which is the duty of those in authority, and their duty of being constant in doing beneficial acts, being constant in reminding the people with what is of benefit to them, and doing that which cultivates the correct Islaamic <i>&#8216;aqeedah </i>(belief) in the people: <b>&#8220;Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts truly find tranquility.&#8221;</b> [Soorah ar-Ra&#8217;d 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that negligence is one of the causes that lets the enemies of Islaam into the Muslim lands &#8211; along with their ideological attack &#8211; which gradually distances the Muslims from their Religion, step by step. So with this, evil will increase amongst them and they will be affected by the false ideologies of their enemies. And Allaah &#8211; One free from all defects, the Most High &#8211; ordered the Believers to have <i>sabr</i> (patience), to call to patience, and to strive in His Path using every method at their disposal; as He &#8211; the Most Majestic, Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O you who Believe. Persevere and be more patient, and guard your territory by stationing army units permanently at the places from where the enemy can attack you, and have <i>taqwaa</i> of Allaah (by doing what He orders and keeping away from what He prohibits) in order that you may be successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;Imraan 3:200]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said:<b> &#8220;And those who strive hard in Our cause, We shall surely guide them to Our Avenues. Indeed Allaah is with the doers of good.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-&#8216;Ankaboot 29:69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah by His beautiful Names and lofty Attributes that He improves and corrects the affairs of the Muslims, and that He grants to them the understanding of the Religion, gathers the word of their leaders upon the truth, and improves and corrects their close advisors. Indeed He is the Most Kind, Most Generous. And may Allaah extol and send abundant blessings of peace upon our Leader and our Prophet, Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions, and his true followers.</p>

	<div class="entry-content th-content">
		<p style="text-align:justify;">By Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Azeez Ibn Baaz (d.1420H) (rahimahullaah) [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This small article was a response to a particular question concerning the position and status of Muslim women, and has been taken from his <strong><i>Majmoo&#8217; Fataawaa wa Maqaalaat Mutanawwi&#8217;ah</i></strong> (3/348-350).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Al-Istiqaamah , Issue No.1 &#8211; Dhul-Hijjah 1416H / May 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The status of the Muslim woman in Islaam is a very noble and lofty one, and her effect is very great in the life of every Muslim. Indeed, the Muslim woman is the initial teacher in the building of a righteous society, providing she follows the guidance from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Since adherence to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah distances every Muslim male or female from being misguided in any matter. The misguidance that the various nations suffer from, the path of Allaah the Most Perfect, the Most High, and from what His Prophets and Messengers, may Allaah&#8217;s peace and prayers be upon them all, came with. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <em>&#8220;I am leaving behind two matters, you will not go astray as long as you cling to them both, the Book of Allaah and my Sunnah.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great importance of the Muslim woman&#8217;s role &#8211; whether as wife, sister or daughter, and the rights that are due to her and the obligations due from her have been explained in the noble Qur&#8217;aan, and further details of this have been explained in the purified Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The secret of her importance lies in the tremendous burden and responsibility that is placed upon her, and the difficulties that she has to shoulder. In terms of responsibilities, some of which not even a man can bear. This is why from the most important obligations upon a person is to show gratitude to the mother, and kindness and good companionship with her. And in this matter, she is to be given precedence over and above the father. Allaah the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And We have enjoined upon man to be dutiful and good to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness upon weakness and hardship upon hardship, and his weaning is in two years. Show gratitude and thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination.&#8221; </strong>[Al-Qur&#8217;aan 31:14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Most High, said:<strong> &#8220;And We have enjoined upon man to be dutiful and kind to his parents. His mother bears him with hardship, and she brings him forth with hardship. And the bearing and the weaning of him is thirty months.&#8221;</strong> [Al-Qur&#8217;aan 46:15].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <em>O Messenger of Allaah! Who from amongst mankind warrants the best companionship from me. He replied: &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man asked: Then who? So he replied: &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man asked: Then who? So the Prophet replied again: &#8220;Your mother.&#8221; The man then asked: Then who? So he replied: &#8220;Then your father.&#8221;</em> So this necessitates that the mother is given three times the likes of kindness and good treatment than the father.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the wife, then her effect in making the soul tranquil and serene, has been clearly shown in the noble aayah (verse), in His &#8211; the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And from amongst His Signs is this: That He created for you wives from amongst yourselves, so that you may find serenity and tranquility in them, And He has put between you love and compassion. Indeed, in this are signs for those who reflect.&#8221;</strong> [Al-Qur&#8217;aan 30:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer (d.774H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said, whilst explaining the terms <i>mawaddah</i> and <i>rahmah</i> which occur in the above verse. &#8220;<i>Al-mawaddah</i> means love and affection, and <i>ar-rahmah</i> means compassion and pity, since a man takes the hand of a woman either due to his love for her, or because of compassion and pity for her; by giving to her a child from himself&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the unique stance that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> wife Khadeejah &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> &#8211; took, had a huge effect in calming and reassuring Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, when the angel Jibreel &#8211; <i>&#8216;alayhis-salaam</i> &#8211; first came to him in the cave of Hiraa. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayi wa sallam</i> returned to Khadeejah with the first Revelation and with his heart trembling and beating severely, saying to her, <em>&#8220;Cover me! Cover me!&#8221;</em> So she covered him until his fear was over, after which he told Khadeejah &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> &#8211; everything that had happened, and said:<em> &#8220;I fear that something may happen to me.&#8221; </em>She said to him: &#8220;<b>Never! By Allaah! Allaah will never  disgrace you. You keep good ties with relations, you help the poor and  the destitute, you serve your guests generouly and assist those who have been affected with calamities.</b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And do not forget about &#8216;Aaishah &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhaa</i> &#8211; and her immense contribution. Even the eminent <i>Sahaabah</i> (Companions) used to take knowledge of <i>Hadeeth</i> from her, and many of the <i>Sahaabiyaat</i> (female Companions) learnt the various rulings pertaining to women&#8217;s issues from her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I have no doubt that my mother (may Allaah shower His mercy upon her) had a tremendous effect upon me, and has a great excellence over me, in encouraging me to study, and she assisted me in it. May Allaah greatly increase her reward and reward her with the best of rewards for what she did for me. And there is no doubt also, that the house in which there is kindness, gentleness, love and care, with the correct Islaamic tarbiyah (education and cultivation) will greatly affect the man. So he will become, if Allaah wills, successful in his affairs and in any matter whether it be seeking knowledge, trading, earning a living, etc. So it is Allaah alone that I ask to grant us all success and to guide us all to that which He loves and is pleased with. And may the prayers and peace of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his Family, his Companions and his followers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">1. He is the exemplary Scholar: Abu &#8216;Abdullaah, &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin &#8216;Abdullaah bin Baaz. He was born in the city of Riyaadh (Sa&#8217;udi Arabiah) on the 12th Dhul-Hijjah in the year 1330H. He began seeking knowledge by first memorising the Qur&#8217;aan before reaching the age of maturity. He then went on to study the various Islaamic sciences, such as <i>&#8216;Aqeedah</i> (Beliefs), <i>Fiqh</i> (Jurisprudence), <i>Usoolul-Fiqh</i> (Fundamentals of Jurisprudence), <i>Hadeeth</i> (Prophetic Narrations), <i>Faraa&#8217;id</i> (Laws of Inheritance), <i>Nahw</i> (Grammar) and <i>Sarf</i> (Morphology) &#8211; even though the Shaykh became permanently blind at the age of seventeen. He studied these sciences under some of the most prominent Scholars of Riyaadh and Makkah of his time, including Shaykh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Lateef ibn Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Hasan and also the former grand-muftee and noble scholar, Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibraaheem &#8211; whom he studied under for ten years. He is eighty-six years old, mild, generous and forbearing in nature, whilst firm, yet wise, when speaking the truth. He is a <i>zaahid</i> (one who abstains) with respect to this world and is one of the foremost Scholars of <i>Ahlul-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;at</i> in this present age. The noble Shaykh has &#8211; by Allaah&#8217;s grace &#8211; devoted his whole life to the cause of Islaam and its people, authoring many books and booklets, teaching and serving the masses, along with being very active in the field of <i>da&#8217;wah</i>. May Allaah protect our noble father and Shaykh, and may He continue to benefit the Ummah with him.<br>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from Fataawaa Islaamiyyah (3/264)]<br>
Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Ibn ‘Abdullaah Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Q]:</strong> What are the valid reasons for divorce, from your point of view your Eminence?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [A]:</strong> For divorce there are many reasons: From them (i.e. the many reasons for divorce) is lack of harmony between the husband and the wife such that it does not cause love from either one for the other or from both of them. And from them is bad behaviour of the woman or lack of listening and obedience to the husband in what he commands of the good. And from them is bad behaviour of the husband and his oppressing the woman and lack of fairness/justice for her. And from them is his falling short of fulfilling her rights and her falling short of fulfilling his rights. And from this is the occurrence of wrongdoing from one of them or both of them such that the situation is made worse because of this, so the only route is divorce, and from this is the husband or the wife turning to intoxicants and smoking. And from them is the bad state of affairs between the woman and the husband&#8217;s parents or either of them, and the lack of use of wise politics in dealing with each other. And from them is the lack of the woman in caring and showing concern in cleanliness and dressing up and beautifying herself for her husband with perfume and good speech and cheerfulness when she meets her husband and when they have sexual intercourse.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">By Shaykh ’Abdul-’Azeez Ibn ’Abdullaah Ibn Baaz<br>
[al-Istiqaamah] [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>COMPATIBILITY IS ONLY BASED UPON RELIGION AND PIETY: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the evil and reprehensible matters is that some who claim to be from the tribe of Haashim (i.e. claim to be a <em>Sayyid</em>; someone related to the Prophet’s (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) family) say that there is no <em>kafaa‘ah</em> (marriage compatibility) between them and someone from outside of their own clan. So they do not get married outside of their clan, nor allow anyone from outside of their clan to marry them. This is a great error, a monstrous ignorance, oppression against the woman, and it is a legislation which neither Allaah nor His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) legislated or prescribed. Rather, Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>O mankind! We have created you from a male and female, and have made you into nations and tribes; that you may know one another, Indeed the most noblest of you with Allaah is the one who has the most taqwaa </strong>(piety, fear, and obedience of Allaah)<strong>.</strong>” [Sooratul-Hujuraat 49:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Indeed the Believers are but brothers.</strong>” [Sooratul-Hujuraat 49:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The Believers &#8211; men and women &#8211; are allies and protectors, one to another.</strong>” [Sooratut-Tawbah 9:71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>So their Lord accepted from them their supplication, and responded: Never will I allow to be lost the actions of any of you, be they male or female. You are one to another.</strong>” [Soorah Aali-’Imraan 3:195]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “Indeed there is no excellence for an arab over a non-arab, nor for a non-arab over on arab, nor for a white person over a black one, nor for a black person over a white one, except through <em>taqwaa</em> (piety and obedience to Allaah). The people are from Aadam, and Aadam was from earth.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) also said: “Indeed my <em>awliyaa‘</em> (friends and allies) are not the tribe of so and so. Rather my friends and allies are the <em>muttaqoon</em> (those who possess <em>taqwaa</em>) &#8211; wherever they may be.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) said: “If there comes to you a person whose Religion and character are pleasing to you, then marry him (i.e. give the girl in marriage to him). If you do not do this, there will be <em>fitnah</em> (trial and discord) and great <em>fasaad </em>(corruption) upon the earth.” This was related by at-Tirmidhee and others, with a <em>hasan isnaad </em>(good chain of narration). [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) married Zaynab bint Jahsh of the Quraysh (i.e. the Prophet’s clan) to Zayd Ibn Haarithah, his freed slave. He married Faatimah bint Qays from the Quraysh clan, to Usaamah, the son of Zayd. Bilaal ibn Rabaah, the Ethiopian married the sister of ’Abdur-Rahmaan Ibn ’Awf of the Quraysh. So the purpose here is to explain the falsehood of those who claim that it is forbidden, or detested, for someone from the Prophet&#8217;s (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) clan to marry outside of that clan or tribe. Rather, what it is obligatory in this matter is to consider only Religion as the compatibility factor. So the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) distanced Aboo Taalib and Aboo Lahab (his uncles) &#8211; because they were not Muslims and drew near Salmaan the Persian, Suhayb the Roman, and Bilaal the Ethiopian. This is because they possessed <em>eemaan</em> (faith) and piety, and they followed the Prescribed Laws and traversed the Straight Path. Thus, whosoever adopts this false and ignorant practice of barring Haashimee women from marrying from outside of their clan or tribe, will only achieve blameworthy results; such as corruption of the people, or adversely affecting the birth-rates, even though Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And marry those amongst you who are single, and the righteous from your slaves. If they be poor, Allaah will enrich them out of His Bounty. And Allaah is all-Sufficient for His creation, the all-Knowing about their state.</strong>” [Sooratun-Noor 24:32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He commanded to marry those that are single, and to marry all other categories of Muslims &#8211; irrespective of whether they be rich or poor. Thus, since the Islaamic <em>Sharee’ah</em> urges and encourages the institution of marriage. So the Muslims should hasten to fulfill this command of Allaah and of His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>) when he said: “O youths! Whosoever amongst you has the ability to marry, then let him do so; for it lowers the gaze and restrains the private parts. But whosoever does not have the ability then let him take to fasting; for indeed it is a shield for him.” Its authenticity has been agreed upon. [5] Thus, it is incumbent upon the guardians to fear Allaah concerning their guardianship, since it is an <em>amaanah</em> (trust and responsibility) around their necks, and Allaah will question them concerning this trust. So it is upon them to hasten in getting their daughters, sons, and sisters married, to the extent that this task has taken full effect in life, and the corruption and harms of not doing so have been minimized. And it is known that when women are prevented from getting married, or if their marriage is delayed and deferred, then this is a cause for calamities to occur, a cause for shameful moral crimes to take place, and a cause for a decline in standards of behaviour. So &#8211; O worshippers of Allaah &#8211; it is upon you to fear Allaah regarding your own selves, and with regards to the daughters, sisters, and other women whom Allaah has been placed under your charge and authority, and that the Muslims should come in order to realise the good and the happiness for the society, and to follow the path that will increase the good and lessen the crimes. And you should know that you will all be questioned and held to account about your actions, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>By your Lord! We shall call them all to account for all that they used to do.</strong>” [Sooratul-Hijr 15:92]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And to Allaah belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth, that He may punish those who do evil with that which they have done; and reward those who do good with Paradise which is best.</strong> ” [Sooratun-Najm 53:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So hasten in getting your sons and daughters married, following in the footsteps of your Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam</em>), and the footsteps of the noble <em>Sahaabah</em> (Companions) (<em>radiyallaahu ’anhum</em>), and all those who follow their path and guidance. I also advise you all not to seek excessive sums for the <em>mahr</em> (dowry), but rather be moderate in this, and that you strive to select pious and righteous people for marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to grant us the understanding of the Religion; grant us firmness upon it; and that He protects us and all the Muslims from the evil promptings of our own souls, and our evil resultant actions; and that He keeps away from us the deviating trials and discords, whether open or hidden. And we ask Allaah also to correct all those who have a position of authority over the affairs of the Muslims, and that He rectifies them. Indeed he is the One having the power to do so. And may Allaah extol and send blessings of peace upon Muhammad, and upon his Family, Companions and all those who follow them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">1. Question: Is it permissible for a father to compel his daughter into a marriage with someone she does not desire?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: It is not permissible for the father or someone besides him to compel the one who is under his guardianship to marry someone she does not desire to marry. Rather, it is necessary to seek her consent and permission due to the saying of the Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam): <i>The virgin is not to be married until her consent has been sought. They said: O Messenger of Allaah! What is her consent? He replied: Her silence.</i> And in another wording: <i>And regarding the virgin, her father seeks her consent and her consent is her silence.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is obligatory upon the father when she reaches the age of nine or greater that he asks for her consent. It is likewise for her guardians, they do not marry her without her consent. This is obligatory upon all of them. Whoever marries his daughter without permission/consent then the marriage is not correct because one of the conditions of the marriage is the consent and pleasure of both parties. So if he marries her without her being pleased with it and compels her with strong threats or even beating, the marriage is not valid&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is required from the prospective husband, when he knows that she does not desire him for marriage, that he does not pursue the matter even if her father facilitates this for him (give him permission). It is obligatory for him to fear Allaah and not to come to the woman who does not want him for marriage&#8230; It is obligatory for him to beware of what Allaah has made unlawful upon him and this is because the Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) ordered the girls consent to be sought (first).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2. Question: I have a sister and my father married her to someone without seeking her opinion and without her being pleased with it. She is twenty-one years of age and he made a false testimony for the marriage contract (saying) that the girl agrees to the marriage&#8230; So what is the ruling regarding this marriage contract&#8230;?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: &#8230;However the correct saying in this matter is that it is not lawful for the father or any one else to compel the girl into marriage with someone she does not desire even if he is suitable, because the Messenger (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said: <i>Do not marry the virgin until her permission has been sought.</i> And this is general &#8211; no one is exempted from it, not (even) her guardians. It is reported in Saheeh Muslim: <i>The virgin, her father is to seek her consent.</i>..</p>

</b>Fataawaa Lajnatud-Daa&#8217;imah lil-Buhoothul `Ilmiyyah wal-Iftaa, 3/185-187<br>
Al-Istiqaamah Newsletter, Issue No. 2, Safar 1417</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">I begin my question by seeking your advice that I may benefit from you with regards to how I may increase my <em>eemaan</em> (faith?)…</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We advise you to <strong>recite the Qur&#8217;aan frequently</strong> and that you <strong>increase in your hearing</strong> of it and in your recitation of it. Reflect and consider its meaning to the best of your ability and what you do not understand of it, then ask the people of knowledge of your country about it, or write to those outside of your country from the Scholars of <em>Sunnah</em> (Prophetic guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise you to <strong>increase in the <em>dhikr</em></strong> (remembrance) of Allaah with such remembrances and supplications that are authentically related, such as saying <em>laa ilaaha illallaah</em> (that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah), or saying <em>subhaanallaah wal-hamdulillaah wa laa ilaha illallaahu wallaahu akbar</em> (declaring Allaah free from all imperfections, praising Him and declaring that none has the right to be worshipped except Him and that He is greater), and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this purpose, we urge you to refer to books such as <em>al-Kalimut-Tayyib</em> of Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>al-Waabilus-Sayyib</em> of Ibn al-Qayyim, <em>Riyaadhus-Saaliheen</em> and <em>al-Adhkaar</em> both by Imaam an-Nawawee, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the remembrance of Allaah increases <em>eemaan</em> (faith) and causes hearts to attain tranquility, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>&#8220;</b><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed in the remembrance of Allaah do hearts find tranquility</span><b>.&#8221;</b><br>
[Soorah ar-Ra`d 13:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also <strong>preserve your five daily Prayers, your Fasting and the rest of your obligations</strong> &#8211; along with hoping in Allaah&#8217;s mercy and forgiveness and relying upon Him in all your affairs. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;The Believers are only those who, when Allaah is mentioned, feel a fear in the hearts, and when His Verses are recited to them, it increases their eemaan (faith), and they put their trust and rely upon Allaah alone. They are those who perform the Prayer and spend out of that which We have given them, they are Believers in truth. For them are grades of dignity and nobility with their Lord, and also forgiveness and generous provisions.&#8221; </span>[Soorah al-Anfaal 8:2-4]</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the ruling on Insurance, wether it be life insurance or property insurance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Insuring one&#8217;s life and property is forbidden; it is not permissible due to the fact that Al-Gharar (Uncertainty, Risk or Speculation) and usury are involved therein. And Allah &#8211; the Almighty the All-Powerful &#8211; has forbidden all types of dealings that involver usury and dealings in which there is Al-Gharar (Uncertainty, Risk or Speculation), as a mercy for the (muslim) community and a protection for them for what is harmful to them. Allah &#8211; Most Glorified, Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;where as Allah has permitted trading and forbidden riba&#8221; (usury). Al-Baqarah 2:275</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has been authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) that he forbade selling AL-Gharar. And Allah is the granter of success.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The following is taken from the Book <strong>&#8216;Words of Advice Regarding Da&#8217;wah&#8217;</strong> from Shaykh &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Azeez ibn &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Baaz, compiled by Ziyaad ibn Muhammad as-Sa&#8217;doon</span></p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;The youth in any nation are the backbone which form the element of movement and vitality in society. They have the energy to bring about effective results&#8230;Usually a nation is never revived except due to the awareness and continuous enthusiasm of the youth. However, <strong>over-enthusiasm of the youth must be guided through the wisdom of the old</strong>. The youth must contemplate and look into the experiences of the old, they shouldn&#8217;t leave one for the other, but rather must preserve both of these qualities&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;<strong>The leaders and the scholars</strong> should exert efforts to enlighten and direct the population of Muslims and combat the efforts of the enemies of Islaam, by retaliating with their own efforts&#8230;The Muslim Ummah is an Ummah that has been entrusted with this religion and has the responsibility of conveying it. If we are careful to arm our boys and girls in Islamic societies, with knowledge, understanding and comprehension of Islamic Jurisprudence and accustom them to apply these things from a small age, then we will not fear, by the permission of Allaah, the Most High, as long as they continue holding onto the deen of Allaah, glorifying it, following its laws, and fighting that which contradicts it. And indeed their enemies will fear them&#8230;There are many verses in the Qur&#8217;aan which convey this message. The most important factor for us in fighting against the efforts of our enemies is <strong>raising and preparing a generation that knows the reality of Islaam</strong>. This can be achieved through guidance, taking care of the house and family, the method of educating them, the media and improvement of the society&#8230;In addition to this is the role of steering and guiding which needs to be taken by the Muslim leadership, persevering in beneficial work and continually reminding the people that which will benefit them and make the belief within them grow and flourish&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have read and heard in the news much about our Muslim brothers in communities where the majority of the population is non-Muslim. They are under authorities which impose restrictions on them, in practicing their religion and establishing their rites of worship, in order to distance them from their religion through compulsion and in other ways. We ask Allaah to firmly establish these Muslim minorities, and indeed all the Muslims upon Islaam and keep them safe from the plots of the enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that they are in a seriously vulnerable situation. Because of this situation, these <strong>Islamic minorities need all the help, co-operation and assistance</strong>, from the political sphere and this is specially from the Islamic governments from the Arab world as well as others that have special concern for Islaam. They have relations with these nations through sending delegates, dispatching messages and urging their embassies to act, or any other similar methods that will help their brothers in these regions. This will raise the morale of the minorities and make the (oppressing) nations realize that these minorities have brothers from the same faith, who are concerned about their situation and who follow their news. If Allaah, the Most High wills, the injustice and oppression will then be lifted from the Muslims when these oppressing nations and others begin to realize that behind the minority of Muslims is a nation which feels their pain and is interested in their affairs. As a result they will give into their requests and will raise their hand from oppressing them, especially when the majority of these nations need Islamic countries for their economic and other affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the minority of Muslims everywhere are in urgent need of moral support and material help and resources to build mosques and schools that will help them in their Islamic work&#8230;So therefore it is obligatory upon every Muslim to help in accordance to his ability&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally I advise my Muslim brothers and sisters in Islaam, to have taqwa (fear) of Allaah in all matters and to be firmly established on His deen. They should fear Him wherever they are and be heedful of Him. They should take account of themselves, and be careful not to leave what Allaah has made obligatory upon them, nor to commit a sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise them to <strong>co-operate upon Birr and Taqwa</strong> and to be sincere to each other and advise each other with truth and patience wherever they are. I also advise them to gain a deep and good understanding of the deen and attend circles of knowledge and question the scholars&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to make those in charge of the Muslims and their leaders, upright and honest and to guide everyone to the straight path. I ask Him to make their leaders and their aides successful, and all their people to rule by the Islamic laws and rulings. And to be ruled by them, to be firmly established upon them, and to advise each other upon them, and to beware of and forbid that which contradicts them&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah, the Most High, and peace and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and his Companions.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The following is taken from &#8216;Al-Ibaanah&#8217; magazine (Vol 1, No.2, pp.7-8), being a translation of Ad-Da&#8217;wah Ilallaah wa Akhlaaqud-Du&#8217;aat (pp.37-43) by Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz:</span></p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon the da&#8217;ee (caller) to have <strong>ikhlaas</strong> (sincerity and purity of intentions and actions) for Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; <strong>neither desiring to show-off, nor desiring reputation, nor desiring the praises and the accolades of the people</strong>. Rather, the da&#8217;ee should only call to Allaah, seeking the Face of Allaah&#8230;and this is the most important etiquette and the greatest quality&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;call the people to Allaah upon <strong>&#8216;ilm (knowledge)</strong>, and not ignorance&#8230;so beware of calling to Allaah based upon ignorance, and beware of speaking without due knowledge. Indeed, ignorance destroys, it does not build; and it causes corruption, not reformation and correction&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the akhlaaq that it is necessary to have &#8211; O da&#8217;ee &#8211; is to be <strong>mild and forbearing</strong> in your da&#8217;wah, and being gentle and patient in it, as were all the Messengers &#8216;alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam. <strong>Beware of being hasty, harsh</strong> and strict in your da&#8217;wah, rather be patient, mild and gentle&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not turn the people away from the Deen due to your harshness, ignorance, or other such behavior. On the contrary, be mild, forbearing and patient; and be soft and pleasant in speech, so your words may have an effect upon the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect upon the one you are addressing the call to. Then the people will better appreciate your call and invitation. So undue strictness causes people to become distant, not close; and it causes separation, not unity. Therefore, it is a must to be gentle, as the Messenger &#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed gentleness does not enter into anything except it beautifies it, nor is it removed from anything except that it disfigures it</span>.&#8221; [Muslim 12/212].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he &#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam also said:</p>
<p> &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Whosoever is prevented from gentleness, is actually prevented from all good and excellence</span>.&#8221; [Muslim 16/145].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the necessary &#8211; or rather obligatory &#8211; etiquettes and qualities that a da&#8217;ee must possess is <strong>acting in accordance to what he is calling to</strong>, and being a righteous example of what is being called to. He should not call to do something and then not do it himself, nor call to leave something, whilst engaging in it himself. This is the condition of the losers &#8211; we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge in this!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;the daa&#8217;ee should have an <strong>excellent character and praiseworthy conduct</strong>, <strong>being patient</strong> and inviting to patience. The daa&#8217;ee should be <strong>sincere in his da&#8217;wah</strong> and strive in spreading goodness to the people and keeping them away from falsehood. At the same time the daa&#8217;ee should <strong>supplicate for the guidance of others</strong>, saying: &#8220;O Allaah! Guide him, and grant him the ability to accept the truth.&#8221; So from the excellent manners of the da&#8217;ee is supplicating, guiding and being patient with the harms that come with this da&#8217;wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet &#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam was informed that the tribe of Daws had become disobedient he said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O Allaah! Guide Daws and bring them.&#8221;</span> [Bukhaaree 6/105]. So the daa&#8217;ee should&#8230;not despair, nor feel hopeless, nor say anything except good. He should not be harsh and strict, nor should he say a word which may cause aversion to the truth. However, if anyone commits aggression and oppression, then a different treatment is to be afforded to such people&#8230;if possible such a person should be imprisoned, or something similar to that &#8211; depending upon the nature of his opposition to the da&#8217;wah. However, as long as he causes no harm, then it is upon you to be patient and self-evaluating and to debate with him in ways that are best. If any personal harm was caused by such a person, then such harm should be borne with patience &#8211; as did the Messengers and those who followed them in goodness and righteousness, patiently bear such harms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to grant us all the well-being and the ability to convey this da&#8217;wah in a wise manner, that He corrects our hearts and our actions, and that He grants to us the understanding of the Deen and firmness upon it &#8211; making us of those who are guided and guiding others, righteous and teaching others righteousness. Indeed He is the Most Majestic, the Supreme, the Most Generous.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><b>PREFACE</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear pilgrim brothers and sisters,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Assalamu alaikumwa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu. </i>Congratulations and welcome on your arrival at these sacred precincts, on this blessed journey as guests of Allah, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This brief but comprehensive Guide is presented to you to outline the obligatory rites of <i>Hajj </i>and <i>&#8216;umrah </i>with which you ought to be familiar. It begins with some important advice. This advice is, first of all, for ourselves, and then it is offered to you in accordance with what Allah, the Most High, says concerning those of His servants who receive salvation and success in this world and the Hereafter: &#8220;They counsel each other of the truth and counsel each other of patience.&#8221; It is further to put into practice His saying: &#8220;Cooperate with each other in goodness and fear of Allah, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask you to read this booklet before you begin the rites of <i>Hajj </i>in order that you may acquaint yourself with what is to be done. You will f Ind in It answers to many of your questions. We hope that you will keep this booklet with you as a reference for this year, and possibly for later years as well if It Is Allah&#8217;s will that you return again for <i>Hajj.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask you to share this booklet with other Muslims in order that they may also benefit from reading its contents. We ask Allah to accept from all of us our <i>Hajj, </i>our striving, and our good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Wassalamu &#8216;alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu.</i></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;">IMPORTANT ADVICE</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear pilgrims, we praise Allah for having guided you to the <em>hajj</em> of His House and to the visit of the Sacred Precincts. May He accept from all of us our good deeds and increase His reward for us and for you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following advice is being offered to you in the hope that Allah will accept from all of us our hajj and our striving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Remember that you are on a blessed journey. This journey, which is a migration toward Allah, is based on belief in His Unity <i>(tawheed), on </i>sincerity toward Him, on responding to His call, and on obedience to His commands. There is no greater reward than that of a <em>hajj</em> which<i> is </i>acceptable to Allah Ta&#8217;alah-the reward of the Garden of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Be on your guard against the mischief of Satan, who intends to cause dissension among you. Love each other as brothers and avoid disputes and disobedience to Allah. Know that the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him) said, &#8220;<strong>None of you has truly believed unless he likes for his brother what the likes for himself</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Whenever you have a question concerning religious matters or concerning the <i>hajj, </i>ask knowledgeable Muslims until you receive a satisfactory answer. This is in accordance with what Allah has said: &#8221; <strong>If you realize this not, ask of those who possess The Message</strong>.&#8221; it is also in accordance with what the Prophet (peace be on him) has said. &#8220;<strong>When Allah intends good for someone, He gives him understanding of the religion</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Know that Allah has made certain acts <i>fard </i>(obligatory) and other acts <i>sunnah </i>(according to the practice of the Prophet, peace be on him). Allah does not accept a <i>sunnah </i>which violates some fard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pilgrims ignore this fact when they harm believing men and women in their zeal to kiss the <i>Black Stone, </i>to hasten in their circuits around the K&#8217;abah, to make <i>salah </i>behind the Station of lbraheem, to drink from Zamzam,.and similar practices. These practices are <i>sunnah. </i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>To </i>harm any believer in doing them is <i>haram </i>(prohibited). How is it possible to carry out a <i>sunnah </i>observance while doing a <i>haram </i>deed? Therefore, avoid hurting each other, and Allah will grant you His mercy and will increase your reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We would also like to emphasize the following:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) It is not fitting that a Muslim man performs his Salat next to, or behind a woman in the holy Mosque or at any other place if it is at all possible to avoid doing so. Women should pray behind men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) The doors and entrances to the holy Mosque are for traffic and should not be blocked by people praying there, even though if it is to join the congregational prayer that may be in progress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) It is not permissible to block the free flow of people around the K&#8217;abah by sitting near the K&#8217;abah, by praying near it, or by standing near the Black Stone, or al-Hijr or at the Station of lbraheem, especially when the place is crowded, as this is a source of harm to other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(d) While safeguarding the dignity of Muslims is a <i>fard, </i>kissing the Black Stone is a <i>sunnah. A fard </i>cannot be sacrificed for a <i>sunnah. </i>When the area is crowded, it is sufficient to point to the Black Stone, saying <i>&#8220;Allahu akbar.&#8221; </i>and to continue to move with the flow of people without causing a break in the lines. indeed, keeping an easy flow during circuits is the most commendable thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(e) It is not a sunnah to kiss the Yamani corner, but to touch it with the right hand, if it is not overcrowded, and say: <i>&#8220;Bismillahi w</i>al-lahu <i>akbar. &#8221; But </i>if it is difficult to touch it, then move on, do not point to it with your hand, or say <i>takbir. </i>For it is not reported of the Prophet. It is mustahabb (good) to recite the following supplication in between the Yamani corner and the Black Stone:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">رَبَّنَا آتِنَا فِي الدُّنْيَا حَسَنَةً وَفِي الآخِرَةِ حَسَنَةً وَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>&#8220;Rabbana atina fid-donya hasanatan wa fil- akhirati hasanatan wa qina adhaban-nar&#8221;.</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, the best advice we can give you is that you follow the Book of Allah and the <i>sunnah</i><b><i> </i></b>of His Messenger (peace be on him) in all what you do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Obey Allah and the Messenger in order that you may receive mercy.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><b>VIOLATIONS OF ISLAM</b></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Brother and sister Muslim, you must be aware that there are matters which nullify your Islam. We will mention here the ten most common violations. Please be mindful of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Associating partners with Allah (shirk). Allah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Truly, if anyone associates partners with Allah, Allah will forbid him the garden and his abode will be the Fire; the wrongdoers will have no helpers</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Calling upon the dead, asking their help, or offering them gifts or sacrifices are all forms of <i>shirk.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Second</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Setting up intermediaries between oneself and Allah, making supplication to them, asking their intercession with Allah, and placing one&#8217;s trust in them is unbelief (kufr).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Third</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who does not consider polytheists <i>(mushrikeen)</i> to be unbelievers, or who has doubts concerning their unbelief, or considers their way to be correct, is himself an unbeliever (kafir).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fourth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who believes any guidance other than the Prophet&#8217;s guidance to be more perfect, or a decision other than the Prophet&#8217;s decision to be better, is an unbeliever. This applies to those who prefer the rule of <i>Evil (Taghout) </i>to the Prophet&#8217;s rule. Some examples of this are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) To believe that systems and laws made by human beings are better than the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>of Islam; for example,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Islamic system is not suitable for the twentieth century.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that Islam is the cause of the backwardness of Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that Islam is a relationship between Allah and the Muslim. It should not interfere in other aspects of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) To say that enforcing the punishments prescribed by Allah, such as cutting off the hand of a thief or stoning an adulterer, is not suitable in this day and age.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) To believe that it is permissible to give a rule from that which Allah did not reveal in Islamic transactions or matters of law, punishments or other affairs. Although one may not believe such rulings to be superior to the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>he in effect affirms such a stand by declaring a thing which Allah has totally prohibited, such as adultery, drinking alcohol or usury, to be permissible. According to the consensus of Muslims, one who declares such things to be permissible is an unbeliever (kafir).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Fifth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who hates any part of what the Messenger of Allah (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him) has declared to be lawful has nullified his lslam, even though he may act in accordance with it. Allah the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>Because they disliked what Allah has revealed. their deeds are brought to nothing</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Sixth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who ridicules any aspect of the religion of the Messenger of Allah (peace be on him), or any of its rewards or punishments, becomes an unbeliever. Allah. the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>Say: Do you ridicule Allah, His revelations and His Messenger? Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after your (profession of) faith&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>The Seventh</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The practice of magic included in this is causing a rift between a husband and wife by turning his love for her into hatred, or tempting a person to do things he dislikes by using black arts. One who engages in such a thing or is pleased with it is outside the pale of Islam. Allah the Most High, says, &#8220;<strong>The two (angels, Harut and Marut) did not teach anyone (magic) without warning them, &#8216;Indeed. we are a trial; then do not disbelieve.</strong>&#8220;&#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The <i>Eighth</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Supporting and aiding polytheists against the Muslims. Allah the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>The one from among you who supports them belongs to them. Truly. Allah does not guide the people who do wrong</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>The Ninth</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who believes that some people are permitted to deviate from the <i>Shari&#8217;ah of </i>Muhammad (peace be on him) is an unbeliever by the word of Allah, the Most High: &#8220;<strong>If anyone seeks a religion other than al-Islam it will not be accepted from him, and in the Hereafter he will by among the losers&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><i>The Tenth</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To turn completely away from the religion of Allah, neither learning its precepts nor acting upon it. Allah the Most High, says: &#8220;<strong>Who does greater wrong than the one who is reminded of the revelations of his Lord and turns away from them. Truly, We shall recompense the guilty</strong>,&#8221; and He also says: &#8220;<strong>But those who disbelieve turn away from that about which they are warned</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It makes no difference whether such violations are committed as a joke, in seriousness or out of fear, except when they are done under compulsion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge in Allah from such deeds as entail His wrath and severe punishment.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>How to perform HaJJ and &#8216;Umrah, and to visit the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Brother and sister Muslims:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are three ways of performing the hajj:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Hajj </i>al-tamatt&#8217;u (interrupted)<br>
<i>Haii </i>al-qiran (combined)<br>
<i>Haii al- ifrad </i>(single)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>Hajj al-Tamatt&#8217;u</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means entering into ihram for the &#8216;umrah during the months of <i>Haji, </i>i.e., the months of Shawwal, Dhul-Q&#8217;idah and the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah; to take off ihram after performing the &#8216;umrah; and then to take ihram again for the hajj from Makkah on the 8th day of Dhul-Hijjah during the same year in which the &#8216;umrah was performed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>Hajj al-Qiran</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This denotes entering into ihram for both the &#8216;umrah and the hajj at the same time, not taking off the ihram until the Day of Sacrifice (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah). Alternatively, one may first enter into <i>ihram </i>for the <i>&#8216;umrah, </i>and before beginning one&#8217;s tawaf may make the intention of <i>ihram </i>for the <i>hajj </i>as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><i>Hajj al-lfrad</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This signifies donning <i>ihram</i> for the <i>hajj </i>either from the prescribed Station of <i>lhram (al-miqat), </i>from Makka if one resides there, or from a place in between al-migat and Makkah in the event that one has brought a sacrificial animal with him, and to remain in <i>ihram </i>until the Day of Sacrifice. If one has not brought an animal for sacrifice, he is required to come out of <i>ihram </i>after performing <i>&#8216;umrah; </i>that is, he makes the (Sa&#8217;ye)&#8221;around the K&#8217;abah (tawaf), performs the (Sa&#8217;ye) the running between Safa and Marwah. cuts some of his hair and then comes out of <i>ihram, </i>resuming his usual clothing and state. This is what the, Prophet (peace be on him) prescribed for those people who had entered into <i>ihram</i> for the hajj without bringing a sacrificial animal; they then re-entered into ihram on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. The same applies to a person who is performing hajj al-qiran in the event that he has not brought with him an animal to sacrifice; it is required that he comes out of ihram after the &#8216;umrah, as described above.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE PERFORMANCE OF &#8216;UMRAH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When you reach the prescribed Station (<b>al-miqat</b>), make ghusl (a shower or full washing of the whole body), use perfume if available, and then put on the two-piece garment of <b>ihram </b>( izar and rida ), which preferably should be of white cloth. This applies to men only. A woman also makes ghusl but she does not use make up, and she may wear any clothes she has available as long as they do not display her adornments; she should be completely covered except for her face and hands. Then make your <b>intention</b> to perform &#8216;Umrah by saying; Labbayka &#8216;Umrah, or: Labbayk Allahumma Umrah, as follows:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><i>Labbayk, Allahumma. Labbayk</i></td>
<td>Here I am at Your service. O Lord, here I am.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>Labbayk. La shareeka laka. Labbayk.</i></td>
<td>Here I am. No partner do You have. Here I am,</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>lnnal-hamda wan-n &#8216;imata laka wal- mulk.</i></td>
<td>Truly, the praise and the favor is Yours, and the dominion.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><i>La shareeka lak&#8217;</i></td>
<td>No partner do You have</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Men should utter this aloud while women should say it silently. Repeat this <b>talbiyyah</b> frequently, and engage in the praise of Allah, in supplications for forgiveness, and in the enjoining of what is good and forbidding of what is evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. When you reach Makkah, make seven circuits <i>(<b>Tawaf</b>) </i>around the K&#8217;abah, beginning at the <b>Black Stone</b> with <b><i>t</i></b><b><i>akbir</i></b> (utterances of <i>&#8220;<b>Allahu akbar&#8217;</b>) </i>and ending each at the same place. While making your <i>(Tawaf) you </i>may praise Allah and make supplications to Him in any words you please. it is preferable to end each with the words.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;Rabbana, atina fid-dunya hasanatan wa fil-akhirati hasanstan wa qina adhaban-nar.&#8221;<br>
</i></b>(Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter. and save us from the punishment of the Fire.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After completing the seventh cirucit, pray <b>two <i>rak&#8217;ats</i></b> behind the <b>Station of Ibraheem <i>(Maqam lbraheem)</i></b><i> if </i>It is possible, even though you may be a little far from it. Otherwise at any other place within the Sacred Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. You then go to <b>as-safa</b> and climb on it. Facing the K&#8217;abah, praise Allah, raising your hands, say <i>takbir (&#8221;Allahu akbar&#8221;) </i>three times. Then make supplication to Allah, repeating your supplication three times as this is the <i>sunnah. </i>Then say</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;La ilaha illal- Lah, wahdahu La sharika La. &#8221;<br>
</i></b><em><strong>Lahul-mulk wa Iahul-hamd, wa huwa &#8216;ala kulli Shayin qadeer&#8221;.</strong></em><br>
<b><i>&#8220;La illahe illal-lah, wahdahu. Anjaza wadahu Wanasara abdahu wa hazama alahzab wahdahu. &#8220;</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(There is no deity except Allah, the One without a partner.<br>
His is the dominion and His is the praise. and He is powerful over everything.<br>
There is no deity except Allah, completed His promise, supported His Slave and defeated the parties Alone.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is preferable to utter this supplication three times but there is no harm in saying it less than three times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You then descend from as-Safa and do the sa&#8217;ye of the umrah seven times. Increase your pace between the green posts, but walk at a normal pace before and after them. When you climb on the Marwah, praise Allah and do as you did at as-Safa, repeating your supplications, if you can conveniently do so, three times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are no required formulas or supplications for tawaf and sa&#8217;ye. It is up to the worshipper to praise Allah or supplicate Him in his own words, or he may recite portions of the Our&#8217;an, with due regard to the supplications which the Prophet (peace be on him) recited during the performance of these rites.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. After sa&#8217;ye end your &#8216;umrah by shaving or shortening your hair. After this, the prohibitions pertaining to the state of ihram are lifted and you may now resume your normal life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are doing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u the sacrifice of a sheep or the seventh part of a camel or a cow becomes obligatory for you on the Day of Sacrifice (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah) .If you cannot afford this sacrifice, it is obligatory for you to fast ten days, three of them during the hajj and seven after returning home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are performing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u or hajj al-qiran, it is preferable to fast these three days before the Day of &#8216;Arafat (the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah).<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE PERFORMANCE OF HAJJ</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. If you are performing hajj al-ifrad or hajj al-qiran (i.e., hajj combined with &#8216;umrah), you enter into ihram at the &#8216;station of ihram (al-miqat) through which you pass on your way to Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you do not pass through any Station of ihram on your way to Makkah, you enter into ihram from your residence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you are performing <i>hajj </i>al-tamatt&#8217;u (the interrupted <i>haii), you </i>enter into ihram for hajj from your residence in Makkah on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah. Perform ghusl (shower or washing of the entire body), perfume yourself if possible, and put on the two garments of ihram. This applies to men. Women likewise perform ghusl but are not to use perfume. They may wear any suitable clothes they have as long as they do not show their adornments and cover every part of their bodies excepting the hands and face. For woman, if she is in the presence of other men who are not her immediate relatives like her husband, father, brother or son then she should cover her face. After putting on ihram make your niyyah (intention) by Saying: <i>Labbayk Hajjan </i>then recite <i>talbiyyah</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Labbayk, Allahumma. Labbayk.<br>
Labbayk. La shareeka laka. Labbayk.<br>
lnnal-hamda wan-n&#8217;imata laka wal-mulk. La shareeka lak&#8217;.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Here I am at Your service, O Lord, here I am. No partner do You have. Here Iam. Truly, the praise and the favor is Yours, and the dominion. No partner do You have.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. You then go to Mina, where you pray the Dhuhr, &#8216;Asr, Maghrib, &#8216;Isha and Fajr prayers at their proper times, shortening prayers of four rak&#8217;as to two rak&#8217;as. Do not combine these prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. When the sun has risen on the 9th of Dhul-Hijjah, proceed toward &#8216;Arafat in a dignified manner and without harming your fellow pilgrims. At&#8217;Arafat, pray the Dhuhr and &#8216;Asr prayers, shortened and combined during the time of Dhuhr with one adhan and two iqamahs</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Make sure that you are within the boundaries of &#8216;Arafat. Stay within the boundaries of &#8216;Arafat, except the valley of Oranah, reciting the praise of Allah the Most High, and offering supplications facing qiblah with upraised hands, as was the practice of Prophet Muhammad (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him). Remain at &#8216;Arafat until after sunset.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. When the sun has set, proceed toward Muzdalifah in a peaceful and dignified manner, reciting <i>talbiyyah. </i>Do not harm or cause any discomfort to your fellow Muslims. When you arrive at Muzdalifah, pray the <i>Maghrib </i>and <i>&#8216;lsha </i>prayers combined, shortening <i>&#8216;Isha </i>to two <i>rak&#8217;ats. </i>Stay at Muzdalifah until you have prayed the <i>Fair </i>prayer. Then wait until the brightness of the morning is wide spread, supplicate facing <i>qiblah </i>with upraised hands, following the practice of the Prophet (peace be on him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For women or weak individuals, it is permissible to proceed to Mina at any time after midnight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Muzdalifah, pick up only seven pebbles to throw at the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah. Other pebbles can be picked up at Mina. There is no harm even if the seven pebbles to be thrown at the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah are also picked up at Mina.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. When you arrive at Mina, do the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) At the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah (this is the pillar nearest to Makkah) throw the seven pebbles one after the other, saying <i>&#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221; </i>at each throw.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) If you are required to sacrifice, slaughter your sacrificial animal. You are to eat some of its meat and distribute the major part of it to the needy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) Shave your head or cut some hair from it. Shaving is preferable for men, while for women the length of hair to be cut is that of a fingertip.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above-mentioned order of doing things is preferred, however, if they are done in some other order, there is no harm in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After you have thrown the pebbles and shaved or cut some of your hair, the prohibitions of <i>ihram </i>are lifted, excepting the prohibition of sexual intercourse with your spouse. This is the first <strong>tahallul</strong>, i.e., returning to one&#8217;s normal state. You are now to wear your usual clothes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Then you go to Makkah and perform the tawaf al-ifadah (the tawaf which is an essential part of the Hajj). If you are doing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u, you also perform sa&#8217;ye. If you are performing hajj al- ifrad or hajj al-qiran and you did not perform sa&#8217;ye with tawaf al- qudum (the Tawaf of Arrival), you must do sa&#8217;ye now. After this, the prohibition of marital relations is also lifted and you return to a completely normal life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to delay the tawaf al-ifadah until the days spent at Mina are over, going to Makkah for this tawaf after all three Pillars have been stoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. After performing your tawaf al-ifadah on the Day of Sacrifice, return to Mina and spend there the nights preceding the 11th, 12th and 13th days of Dhul-Hijjah (the three days following the Day of Sacrifice which are known as ayyamu-tashreeq. It is however, permissible to spend only two nights in Mina instead of three.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. At any time in the afternoon of each of the two or three days of your stay in Mina, stone each of the three Pillars, starting with the first Pillar( i.e., the one which is farthest from Makkah), followed by the middle Pillar and lastly the Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah. Throw seven pebbles, one by one, at each of these Pillars, saying <i>&#8220;Allahu </i>akbar&#8221; at each throw.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you stay in Mina for only two days, you must leave Mina before the sun sets on the second day. if the sun should set before you are able to depart, remain in Mina for the third night and throw pebbles again the next day. In any case, it is preferable to remain in Mina for three nights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for the sick and the weak to appoint a proxy to throw their pebbles. The proxy first throws his own pebbles, followed by the pebbles of the person he represents while at the same pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. If you decide to return to your Country after completing the rites of <i>hajj, you </i>perform the Farewell Tawaf (tawaf al-wida &#8216; ) before leaving Makkah. No one is excused from this except women who are menstruating or in the period of discharge following childbirth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>OBLIGATIONS DURING IHRAM</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the state of <i>ihram </i>for <i>hajj </i>or &#8216;Umrah, the following are obligatory;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To faithfully observe all that Allah has made obligatory, such as the daily prayers at their proper times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To avoid what Allah has prohibited, such as wrongdoing, quarreling and committing sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. To guard against injuring the Muslims by deed or by word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To abstain from what is prohibited during <i>ihram, </i>namely:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) Do not cut your nails or pull out hair. There is no blame on you if these break or come off by themselves without your intending it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) Do not use scent, whether on the clothes or on the body, or in food or drink. There is no harm if the effect of scent applied before putting on ihram remains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) Do not kill, frighten or assist in hunting any land game as long as you are in ihram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(d) Within the precincts of al-Haram no one, in the state of ihram or not, is allowed to cut trees, pluck vegetables or collect a lost property except for the sake of identifying it for its owner. For the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(e) Do not propose to a woman or contract marriage either for yourself or on behalf of others. Sexual intercourse is prohibited too, so is touching the apposite sex with desire. All these actions are-prohibited during the period of ihram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these prohibitions apply equally to men and women alike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In particular</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man may not put any covering on his head. However, the shade of an umbrella or the roof of a car is permissible. There is no harm in carrying something on the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man may not wear a shirt or anything else which is sewn, such as a burnoose, turban, trousers, <i>khuff </i>(short, thin boot), on the whole or a part of his body. However, if an <i>izar </i>(one of the two garments of <i>ihram, </i>worn on the lower part of the body) is not available, trousers may be worn, and if sandals are not available <i>khuff </i>may be worn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is forbidden for a woman to wear gloves on her hands or to cover her face with a face-veil <i>(niqab) </i>or <i>burqa </i>(drape) during the state of <i>ihram. </i>However, if male strangers are around her, she should conceal her face with her head-covering or something similar. These rules apply until she comes out of <i>ihram</i><i>..</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person wears a sewn garment or covers his head (for men), uses perfume, pulls out some hairs, or cuts his nails through forgetfulness or due to ignorance, there is no <i>fidyah </i>(expiation) for him. He should stop doing such things as soon as he remembers or is reminded of then.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to wear sandals, a ring, a pair of glasses, a hearing aid, a wrist watch, and a belt or a girdle which protects one&#8217;s money or documents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to change one&#8217;s clothes and to wash them, as well as to wash one&#8217;s hair and body, and it does not matter if some hair inadvertently falls out during washing.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>VISITATION OF THE PROPHET&#8217;S MOSQUE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Going to Madinah at any time with the intention of visiting the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque is a sunnah, as is performing <i>salah </i>in it, According to a <i>hadith of the Prophet </i>(may peace and blessing of Allah be on him). A salah performed in the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque is better than a thousand salats in any other place excepting the Sacred Mosque (Masjid al-Haram) in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. There is no <i>ihram</i> nor <i>talbiyah </i>for the visit to the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, and it should be emphasized that there is no connection whatsoever between this visit and the <i>hajj.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. When you enter the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, enter with your right foot first, saying the name of Allah the Most High, and invoking blessings on His Prophet (may His peace and blessings be on him), and ask Allah to open the gates of His mercy for you. The recommended words for entering any mosque, including the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;A&#8217;udhu billahil-adheem wa wajhi hil-kareem wa sultanihil- qadeem mina &#8211; shaytani-rajeem. Allahhumma, iftah li abwaba rahmattk.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I seek refuge in Allah the Al-mighty, and in His noble countenance and in His eternal power, from Satan the Rejected. 0 Allah, open to me the doors of Your mercy.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Perform two <i>rak&#8217;ats </i>of <i>tahiyyat al-masjid </i>(the <i>salat </i>of &#8220;greeting of the mosque&#8221;) after entering the Mosque, preferably in the <i>Rawdah </i>or otherwise anywhere else in the Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Then go to the grave of the Prophet (may the peace and blessing of Allah be on him), and standing in front of it and facing it, say in a respectful and hushed voice:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Assalamu &#8216;alaika, ayyuhan-nabiyya wa rahmat al lahi wa barakatuhu. &#8221;<br>
</i><em>(Peace be on you, O Prophet, and the mercy and blessings of Allah), </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and call for the blessings of Allah on him. There is no harm if you add:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;Allahumma, atihil-waseelata wal-fadeelata wab-&#8216;athul-maqamal-mahmoudal-ladhee wa-adtahu. Allahumma, ajzih &#8216;an ummatihi afdalal- jaza&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(O Lord, give him the right (of intercession) and the favor, and raise him to the praiseworthy station which you promised to him.O Allah, reward him on behalf of his ummah (people) with the best of rewards.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then move a little to the right to stand before the grave of Abu Bakr (may Allah be pleased with him). Greet him and supplicate Allah to bestow His mercy and forgiveness on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Again move a little to the right to stand before the grave of &#8216;Umar (may Allah be pleased with him), and greet him and make supplication for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. It is sunnah to have (Taharah), and visit the Mosque of Quba and offer salat in it, as the Prophet (peace be on him) prayed there and encouraged others to do the same.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. It is sunnah to visit the graves of al-Baqe&#8217;e cemetery, and the grave of Uthman (May Allah be pleased with him) and the martyrs of &#8216;Uhud, and the grave of Hamzah (May Allah be pleased with them.); to greet them and to pray for the mercy of Allah upon them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to visit all these graves and pray for the souls of those who were buried there. He taught his companions when visiting graves to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;Assalamu &#8216;alaikum, ahlal-diyar minal-mu&#8217;mineen wal-muslimeen,<br>
wa inna insha-Allah bikum lahiqoon.<br>
Nasalal-laha lans wa lakumul-&#8216;afiyah.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Peace be on you, O dwellers of this place from among the Believers and the Muslims,<br>
and we <i>will insha-&#8216;Allah </i>join you.<br>
We ask Allah for security (from the Fire of Hell) for ourselves and for you.)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Reported by Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>besides the mosques and other places mentioned above, there are no other mosques or places in Madinah which are to be visited. Therefore, do not burden yourself by visiting places for which there is no reward or for which, in fact, there might be some blame for doing so. And Allah is the source of guidance.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>ERRORS OFTEN COMMITTED BY PILGRIMS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>First: Errors Related to lhram</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pilgrims bypass the designated Station of <i>lhram </i>on their route without either being in <i>ihram </i>or entering into <i>ihram </i>there, proceeding until they reach Jeddah or some other place within the precincts of the Stations, at which they enter into <i>ihram. </i>This is against the command of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be on him), which stipulates that every pilgrim should enter into <i>ihram</i> at the Station of <i>ihram </i>which lies on his route.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this happens to someone, he must either go back to the Station of ihram lying on his route and there enter into ihram, or he must make expiation by sacrificing a sheep in Makkah and feeding all its meat to the poor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This applies to all pilgrims regardless of whether one passes the Station of ihram by air, by sea or by land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one did not pass through one of the five designated Stations of lhram, he should enter into ihram at a point which is nearest to the Station of ihram on his route.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Second: Errors Related to Tawaf</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Starting the tawaf at some point other than the site of the Black Stone, while it is obligatory to begin tawaf from the Black Stone</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Doing one&#8217;s tawaf inside the Hijr of lsma&#8217;il, which means going around a portion of the K&#8217;abah rather than the whole of it since the Hijr of Isma&#8217;il is a part of the K&#8217;abah which would then be left out of tawaf<b>. </b>Such a tawaf is invalid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Doing ramal (i.e., taking quick short steps) during alI seven circuits while ramal is to be done only during the first three of the Tawaf of Arrival (tawaf <i>al-qudum).</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Struggling vehemently to kiss the Black Stone in this process and hitting or pushing people. Such acts, which are injurious to Muslims, are not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It should be noted that the tawaf remains perfectly valid without kissing the Black Stone. If one does not or cannot kiss the Black Stone. it is sufficient simply to point to it, saying &#8220;Allahu <i>akbar&#8221; when </i>one comes parallel to it, although one may be at a distance from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Wiping one&#8217;s hand over the Black Stone, seeking &#8220;blessings&#8221; <i>(barakah) thereby </i>is an innovation <i>(bid&#8217;a) </i>with no basis in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>of Islam. The <i>sunnah is </i>to touch it or kiss it only when it can be done easily.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Touching the four corners of K&#8217;abah or its walls, and wiping one&#8217;s hands against them. The Prophet (peace be on him) did not touch any part of K&#8217;abah except the Black Stone and the Yemeni Corner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Saying specific formulas of supplications reserved for each circuit. The Prophet (peace be on him) did not specify any supplications except to say &#8220;Allahu <i>akbar&#8221; </i><i>when when </i>he reached the Black Stone and, at the end of each circuit between the Yamani Corner and the Black Stone, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;Rabbana, </i>atina&#8217; <i>fid-dunya hasanatan wa fil-akhirati hasana wa qina adhaban-nar. &#8221;<br>
</i></b>(Our Lord, give us good in this world and good in the Hereafter and save us from the punishment of the Fire.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Raising one&#8217;s voice above the voices of others; whether in following or leading the tawaf as it causes confusion among the worshippers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Struggling to pray at the Station of lbraheem. This is contrary to the <i>sunnah, </i>besides being injurious to other worshippers. it is sufficient to pray the two <i>rak&#8217;ats of tawaf </i>after completing one&#8217;s tawaf anywhere within the Sacred Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Third: Errors Related to Sa&#8217;ye</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When climbing upon Safa and Marwah, some pilgrims face the K&#8217;abah and gesticulate toward it with their hand while saying <i>&#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221; </i>as if they were saying <i>takbir for </i>salat salat. This gesticulating is an error because the Prophet (peace be on him) raised his palms only for supplication. Here you may glorify and magnify Allah the Most High, supplicating Him in any words you wish while facing the direction of the K&#8217;abah. It is preferable to recite the <i>dhikr</i> which the Prophet (peace be on him) recited at Safa and Marwah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Accelerating one&#8217;s pace throughout the entire distance between the two hills. The <i>sunnah </i>is to accelerate one&#8217;s pace only between the two green posts, while walking at normal pace the remainder of the way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Fourth: Errors Related to &#8216;Arafat</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Some pilgrims camp outside the boundaries of &#8216;Arafat and remain there until the sun has set; then they depart for Muzdalifah without standing at &#8216;Arafat properly. This is a serious error which invalidates their hajj since standing in Arafat is the essence of <i>haji, </i>and it is obligatory to be within its boundaries and not outside them, if it is not easy to do that, they may enter before sunset and remain there until sunset. It is quite acceptable to stand in Arafat during the night of sacrifice in particular.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Departing from &#8216;Arafat before the sun has set is not permissible, because the messenger of Allah (peace be on him) stayed at &#8216;Arafat until the sun had set completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Struggling through crowds in order to climb Mount &#8216;Arafat is not permissible, because it causes much harm and injury to others. The entire Plain of &#8216;Arafat is a place of standing, and neither climbing Mount &#8216;Arafat nor making <i>salah </i>there has been recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Making supplications facing Mount &#8216;Arafat is incorrect because the <i>sunnah </i>is to face <i>qiblah while </i>making supplication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Making heaps of earth or pebbles: during the day of &#8216;Arafat, at particular places, by some people, has no bases in the <i>Shariah of </i>Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Fifth: Errors Related to Muzdalifah</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some pilgrims start collecting <i>pebbles to </i>throw at the Stone Pillars in Mina as soon as they arrive in Muzdalifah prior to praying the <i>Maghrib and </i>&#8216;lsha prayers. This is not correct. Nor is the practice that ail the pebbles must be collected at Muzdalifah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The correct position is that the pebbles can be collected anywhere within the boundaries of al-Haram (the territory or precincts of Makkah ). It is known that the Prophet (peace be on him) did not ask that the pebbles for Jamratul Aqabah be picked up for him from Muzdalifa. They were picked up for him, in the Morning, after leaving Muzdalifa and on entering Mina. The rest of the pebbles were picked up for him, from Mina too. Some pilgrims wash the pebbles, but this is not recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#993300;">Error Related to Throwing the Pebbles</span><i><br>
</i></b><br>
1. Some pilgrims are under the impression that when they are throwing pebbles at the Stone Pillars, they are actually throwing them at <i>shayateen (devils): </i>hence they hurl them with rage and force. However, the throwing of the pebbles has been merely prescribed as a means of remembering Allah the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Some people throw big stones, shoes or pieces of wood. This is an excess in matters of religion which the Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited, what is allowed is to throw pebbles the size of good beans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Crowding and fighting with others at the Pillars while throwing the pebbles is not permissible. What is prescribed is to be gentle and to throw the pebbles without hurting anyone as much as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Throwing all the pebbles at one time is an error. Scholars have said that this would be counted as only one throw. The <i>Shari&#8217;ah prescribes </i>throwing the pebbles one by one, saying <b><i>&#8220;Allahu akbar&#8221; </i></b>at each separate throw.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Appointing a proxy to throw the pebbles, simply due to fear of the crowds or of hardship, while one is capable of doing it himself. Only sick or weak individuals are permitted to have a proxy for this act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Seventh: Errors Related to the Farewell Tawaf (Tawaf -al- Wida)</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. On the day of their departure, some pilgrims go.to Makkah to perform their Farewell Tawaf before throwing the pebbles at the Pillars. Then they return to Mina to throw the pebbles, and depart from Mina for their respective countries. Thus their final rite becomes that of throwing the pebbles at the Pillars and not of the tawaf of K&#8217;abah. This is an error as the Prophet (peace be on him) said, No one should depart without his last visit being to the House (K&#8217;abah) &#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the Farewell Tawaf must take place after one has completed all the rites of hajj (and before starling his journey for home). After this tawaf one should not stay in Makkah except during the time it takes to prepare to depart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. After finishing the Farewell <i>Tawaf, </i>some people walk backwards, facing the K&#8217;abah, as they exit from the Sacred Mosque, under the impression that this is a veneration of the K&#8217;abah. This act is an innovation <i>(bid&#8217;a) </i>in the religion and is without any basis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. After finishing the Farewell <i>Tawaf, </i>some pilgrims halt at the door of the Sacred Mosque to make supplications. This is also an innovation with no basis in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah of </i>Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Eighth: Errors Related to the visit of the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Touching and wiping one&#8217;s hands on the walls and iron grilles, tying threads to the gratings, and other acts of this sort while visiting the grave of the Prophet (may peace and blessings of Allah be on him) in order to receive blessings <i>(barakah) </i>are an innovation (bid&#8217;a). Blessings come from following what Allah and His Messenger (peace be on him) have prescribed, and not from following innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Going to the caves of Mount Uhud or to the caves of Hira or Thaur near Makkah and hanging pieces of cloth or making supplications there have not been prescribed by Allah. All these are unnecessary hardships, innovations in the religion, and are without any basis in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Likewise, visiting certain sites under the impression that these constitute &#8220;relics&#8221; of the Prophet (peace be on him), as for example the place where his camel sat, the Well of &#8216;Uthman or the Well of the Ring, and gathering soil from these places to obtain &#8220;blessings&#8221;, are all innovations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Calling upon the dead while visiting the graves at the Baqi&#8217; Cemetery or the graves of the martyrs of Uhud, and throwing coins in order to seek the blessings of the place or of the people buried there, is a grievous error indeed. it is <i>shirk </i>(ascribing partners to Allah the Most High), as has been pointed out by scholars. It is clear from the Book of Allah and the <i>sunnah </i>of His Messenger (peace be on him) that all forms of worship are for Allah alone. It is not permissible to call upon, or to offer sacrifice, give vow or any other form of <i>ibadah </i>(worship) except for Allah alone. Allah the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b><i>&#8220;and they were commanded nothing except to worship Allah (only), purifying the religion for Him alone,&#8221;</i></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>&#8220;<strong>Verily, the places of worship are for Allah (alone), so do not call on anyone else apart from Allah</strong>.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah, the Most High, to improve the condition of the Muslims and to give them understanding of the religion. and to turn all of us away from errors and deviations Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Responding.<b> </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>WHAT IS REQUIRED OF THE PILGRIMS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To repent sincerely of all sins, and to spend on the hajj or &#8216;umrah out of his lawful earnings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To guard one&#8217;s tongue from lying, backbiting and slandering.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3, To purify the intention to perform <i>hajj </i>or &#8216;<em>umrah</em> solely to seek the pleasure of Allah the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To learn what actions are prescribed&#8217;by the Shari&#8217;ah or hajj and &#8216;umrah, and in the event of any difficulty or problem to ask those who know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. When the pilgrim arrives at al-miqat (station of ihram) he is free to choose one of the three types of hajj (ifrad, tamatt&#8217;u or qiran). Tamatt&#8217;u is preferable for a person who has not brought his sacrificial animal with him, while qiran is preferable for one who has his animal with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. If the person entering ihram is afraid he may not be able to complete all the rites because of sickness or fear, he should make the condition: &#8220;I will return to the normal state in case I am obliged to.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The hajj of children is valid, but it does not fulfill their lslamic obligation of <i>hajj.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. During the state of ihram, one may take bath or wash his head or scratch it if need be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. A woman may veil her face with her headcovering if she fears that men are looking at her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Many women wear a headband under the veil to keep it away from the face. This action has no basis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. It is permissible to wash the ihram garments and to wear them again, or to change into other ihram garments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. If, during the state of ihram, one should wear a sewn garment, cover his head, or use scent due to forgetfulness or ignorance, no expiation (penalty or redemptive offering) is required of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. If one is performing hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u or &#8216;umrah, he should stop reciting <i>talbiyyah upon </i>arriving at the K&#8217;abah before beginning his tawaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Walking with quick, short steps and baring the right shoulder is not permissible during tawaf except during the first three circuits of the Tawaf of Arrival (tawaf <i>al-qudum</i><i>). </i>This<i> </i>applies to men only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. If the pilgrim forgets how many circuits he has performed, i.e., whether three or four, he should count them as three (that is, the lesser of the two numbers). The same procedure is to be followed for sa&#8217;ye.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. In case of large crowds, there is no harm in performing the circuits beyond the Station of lbraheem or even further beyond, as the whole of the Sacred Mosque is a place of tawaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. It is prohibited for a woman to make tawaf showing her adornments, using perfume, or not covering properly what the <i>Shari&#8217;ah </i>requires her to be covered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. If a woman&#8217;s menses begins or she gives birth after entering into ihram, it is not permissible for her to make tawaf until the flow of blood ceases and she is cleansed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. A woman may wear any dress for ihram as long as it does not resemble men&#8217;s clothing, show her adornments, or cause temptation to men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. To verbalize the intentions for acts of worship other than the hajj or &#8216;umrah is an innovation <i>(bid&#8217;a), and </i>to say it aloud is even more incorrect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. If a Muslim has the intention of making <i>hajj or </i>&#8216;<em>umrah</em>, it is forbidden for him to pass by the appointed Station of lhrem (al- miqat) without entering into ihram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. If the pilgrim for <i>hajj or </i>&#8216;<em>umrah</em> is arriving by air, he enters into ihram on the plane when he passes parallel to the Station of ihram on his route. He is to prepare himself, for entering into ihram during the flight before boarding the plane.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. If one resides in Makkah, or between Makkah and the Stations of <i>Ihram </i>he need not go anywhere to take <i>ihram. </i>In this case, he is to take his <i>ihram </i>for either <i>hajj </i>or <i>&#8216;umrah </i>at his place of residence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. In order to increase the number of their <i>&#8216;umrahs, </i>some people go to al-Tan&#8217;im or al-J&#8217;iranah after the <i>hajj </i>and subsequently return for <i>&#8216;umrah. No </i>support for this practice exists in the <i>Shari&#8217;ah.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.25. The pilgrim who is performing <i>hajj al-tamatt&#8217;u </i>re-enters <i>ihram</i> on the 8th of Dhul-Hijjah at the place in which he is staying in Makkah. It is not necessary for him to take <i>ihram </i>from any specified place within Makkah (such as al-Mizab), as many people do, nor is there any Farewell <i>Tawaf </i>for going out of Makkah at this time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. It is preferable to go to &#8216;Arafat from Mina on the 9th of Dhul- Hijjah after the sun has risen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. It is not permissible to depart from &#8216;Arafat on the 9th of Dhul- Hijjah before the sun has set. When the pilgrim departs after sunset, he should do so with ease and dignity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28, The <i>Maghrib </i>and <i>&#8216;Isha </i>prayers are to be performed after arriving at Muzdalifah, whether at the time of <i>Maghrib </i>or during the period of <i>&#8216;lsha.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. It is permissible to gather the pebbles for stoning the Pillars from any place within the boundaries of Makkah <i>(al-Haram), </i>not necessarily from Muzdalifah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. It is not recommended to wash the pebbles. No report exists to the effect that the Prophet (peace be on him) or his Companions ever did this. Nor are the used pebbles to be used again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. It is permissible for women, children and weak individuals to proceed to Mina at the end of the night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32, When the pilgrim arrives in Mina on the Day of &#8216;Eid (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah), he should stop reciting <i>talbiyyah. </i>The pebbles are to be thrown successively, one by one, at the Stone Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. It is not required that the pebbles remain where they are thrown; it is only necessary that they be thrown at the Pillar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. According to the opinion of scholars, the period of sacrifice extends to the sunset of the third day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. Tawaf <i>al-ifadah or al-ziyarah </i>on the day of &#8216;Eid (the 10th of Dhul-Hijjah) is an essential part of the <i>hajj </i>and <i>hajj </i>is not complete without it. However, it is permissible to delay it until the end of the stay in Mina.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. The person making qiran between <i>hajj </i>and <i>&#8216;umrah </i>offers one <i>Sa,ye </i>only. The same is true in the case of ifrad, if the person keeps his <i>ihram </i>until the day of <i>an-Nahr.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. On the Day of Sacrifice, it is preferable that the pilgrims do things in the following order: begins by throwing pebbles at the Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah; then Offers his sacrifice; then shaves or clips his hair, he then makes tawaf of the K&#8217;abah followed by sa&#8217;ye Changing this order is, however, permissible<b>.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. Returning to full normal state is attained after one has done the following: (a) thrown the pebbles at the Pillar of &#8216;Aqabah; (b) shaved his head or clipped some of his hair; (c) done tawaf al-ifada with sa&#8217;ye.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. If the pilgrim decides to shorten his stay in Mina, it is necessary that he departs from Mina before the sunset.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. For a child who cannot do the throwing of pebbles, his guardian throws on his behalf after throwing his own pebbles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41. A person who is not capable of going to the throwing due to old age, illness or pregnancy it is permitted to appoint someone else (his proxy) to do the throwing on his or her behalf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42. The proxy first throws his own pebbles and thereafter, without leaving the place, throws the pebbles on behalf of the person whom he represents at each of the three Pillars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43. Except for the residents of the Sacred Mosque, it is obligatory on anyone who is doing <i>hajj a</i> l-tamatt&#8217;u or hajj al-qiran to sacrifice a sheep or to share in the seventh part of a camel or a cow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44. If the pilgrim is unable to make this sacrifice, he must fast three days during the <i>hajj </i>and seven days after returning home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45. It is preferable that these three days of fasting be completed before the Day of &#8216;Arafat so that he is not fasting on that day, or otherwise that he fast on the 11 th, 12th and 13th of Dhul-Hijjah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46. It is permissible to fast these three days either consecutively or separately, and the same applies to the seven days of fasting at home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47. The Farewell <i>Tawaf (tawaf al-wida&#8217;) is </i>obligatory for every pilgrim excepting menstruating or post-partum women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48. To visit the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque in Madinah is a <i>sunnah, </i>whether it is done before the <i>haii </i>or after it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49. When you enter the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque, it is <i>sunnah </i>to pray two <i>rak&#8217;ats </i>of tahiyyat <i>al-masjid </i><i>(the (the </i>salah of greeting the mosque). Although you can perform this salah anywhere in the Mosque, it is preferable to perform it in the Rawdah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50. Visiting the graves of the Prophet (peace be on him) and others is allowed for Males only, and not for females, so that they would not have to travel for such a visit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">51. Rubbing and wiping one&#8217;s hands against the walls of the chamber containing the Prophet&#8217;s tomb, kissing it, or doing circuits around it are all innovations which are prohibited. Such things were not done by our upright ancestors. in particular, making <i>tawaf </i>around the chamber <i>is shirk </i>(ascribing partners to Allah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">52. it is also shirk to call upon the Prophet (peace be upon him) for the fulfilment of a need or to remove a grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">53. The Prophet&#8217;s life in his grave is in the state at <i>barzakh </i>(the state of existence between death and resurrection on the Day of Judgement) and is in no way similar to his life on earth before his death. The nature and reality of the life of <i>barzakh is </i>known only to Allah the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">54. People who stand in front of the Prophet&#8217;s grave, raising their hands and making supplications, are doing something alien to Islam. This is an innovation in the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">55. Visiting the grave of the Prophet (peace be on him) is neither obligatory nor a condition for the completion of the <i>hajj, </i>as some people believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">56. The <i>hadiths </i>cited by some people prescribing visitation of the Prophet&#8217;s grave either have weak authority or are fabricated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some Supplications Which May Be Recited At &#8216;Arafat, at The Sacred Sites, and at Other Places Of Supplication</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allah! You hear my words, You behold my situation, You know what is open and what is hidden within me; nothing is hidden from You. It is me alone who is in need, a humble seeker of Your forgiveness. I beseech You with humility in my heart, with trembling and fear, in prostration and utter helplessness. O Allah! Grant me soundness of belief, goodness of character, forgiveness of my sins, and Your eternal pleasure in the Hereafter.</p>
