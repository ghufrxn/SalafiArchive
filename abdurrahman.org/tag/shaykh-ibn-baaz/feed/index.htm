<p>The Prophet (ﷺ) stated, </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>“Ahead of you are days of patience, when holding onto the religion will be like holding onto hot coals, and whomsoever holds onto His religion in that time, then his reward will be the reward of fifty men.” The Companions said, “O Messenger of Allah, fifty times the worth of their reward?” He said, “Rather fifty from you.”</strong> </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Collected by Abu Dawood, At-Tirmidhi, Ibn Mājah, Al-Hākim who declared it authentic, Adh-Dhahabi agreed and Al-Albāni declared it Saheeh in As-Saheehah (no. 494).</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Difference between Kufr and Shirk</strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A Muslim sister N. S. `A from Riyadh says: What is the difference between Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)? Please, advise. May Allah reward you!</span></strong></p>



<p><strong><span style="color:#808080;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Kufr</strong> </span>is the denial and concealment of the Truth such as those who deny the obligation of Salah, Zakah, Sawm, Hajj in case of being financially and physically able, and dutifulness to one&#8217;s parents, and so on.&nbsp;It is also like those who deny the prohibition of Zina (premarital sexual intercourse and/or adultery), consuming Khamr (intoxicants), and disobeying one’s parents.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shirk</span> </strong>is to devote the acts of worship to anything beside Allah (Exalted be He) such as those who seek the help of the dead, the absent, the Jinn, idols, the stars, and so on or those who offer sacrifices or make vows to them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A Kafir (disbeliever) may be called a Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and vice versa. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says,</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allâh, any other ilâh (god), of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! Al­Kâfirûn (the disbelievers in Allâh and in the Oneness of Allâh, polytheists, pagans, idolaters) will not be successful.</span></strong>&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Allah (may He be Praised) also says, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode.&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In Surah Fatir, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Such is Allâh, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmîr (the thin membrane over the date­stone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص) like Him Who is the All­Knower (of everything).&#8221;</span> </strong>Here, Allah (Exalted be He) names their call upon things other than Him as Shirk and in Surah Al­Mu&#8217;minun, Allah (Exalted be He) names it Kufr.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In Surah Al­Tawbah, Allah (Glorified be He) says, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;They (the disbelievers, the Jews and the Christians) want to extinguish Allâh’s Light (with which Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص has been sent ­ Islâmic Monotheism) with their mouths, but Allâh will not allow except that His Light should be perfected even though the Kâfirûn (disbelievers) hate (it). It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islâm), to make it superior over all religions even though the Mushrikûn (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) hate (it).&#8221;</strong></span> Here, Allah (Exalted be He) calls the disbelievers as Kuffar and Mushriks. This indicates that a Kafir may be called a Mushrik and vise versa. There are many Ayahs and Hadith that stress the same meaning.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, between a man and Shirk and Kufr is the negligence of prayer.</strong></span>&#8221; (Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir Ibn `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them).He (peace be upon him) also said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The covenant that distinguishes between us and them (the hypocrites) is Salah. Anyone who abandons it is a Kafir.</strong></span>&#8221; (Related by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Al­Tirmidhy, Al­Nasa&#8217;y, and Ibn Majah with a Sahih chain of transmission on the authority of Buraydah ibn Al­Hasib, may Allah be pleased with him).May Allah grant us success!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Explanation of Allah’s Saying: &#8220;Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Allah (Exalted be He) says in His Noble Book (what means): <em>&#8220;Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire&#8221;</em>. What is meant by hypocrisy and hypocrites in this Ayah (Qur’anic verse)? Please clarify their meaning.</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hypocrites are those who make a false pretense of Islam, when they are professing otherwise. They claim to be Muslims, although deep down they disbelieve in Allah and belie the Messenger (peace be upon him). These are the hypocrites who are so called because they show Islam, while hiding Kufr (disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And of mankind, there are some </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(hypocrites) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">who say: &#8220;We believe in Allâh and the Last Day&#8221; while in fact they believe not. They </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(think to)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> deceive Allâh and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves, and perceive </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(it)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> not! In their hearts is a disease </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(of doubt and hypocrisy) </span><span style="color:#008000;">(namely doubt and suspicion) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and Allâh has increased their disease. A painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This theme is continued in the Ayahs following them in Surah Al­Baqarah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the hypocrites who disbelieve in Allah and belie His Messengers (peace be upon them). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allâh, but it is He Who deceives them. And when they stand up for As­Salât </strong>(the prayer)<strong>, they stand with laziness and to be seen of men, and they do not remember Allâh but little. </strong>(They are) <strong>swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those.</strong></span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that they vacillate between the Kafirs (disbelievers) and the Muslims; at times they support the Kafirs when they prevail and achieve victory and at other times they support the believers when they prevail and achieve victory. They are not steadfast; their Din (religion) is not constant, and their Iman (Faith) is not solid. They waver between the state of Kufr and the state of Iman, and between the Kafirs and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) has disclosed their Kufr in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allâh and in His Messenger </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and that they came not to As­Salât </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the prayer) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">except in a lazy state, and that they offer not contributions but unwillingly. So let not their wealth nor their children amaze you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad</span><span style="color:#008000;">sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">; in reality Allâh’s Plan is to punish them with these things in the life of this world, and that their souls shall depart </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(die) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">while they are disbelievers.</span></strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the hypocrites. We ask Allah to grant us safety and protection.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>33 &#8211; Ruling on raising one&#8217;s hands and rubbing one&#8217;s face after supererogatory Prayer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on raising one&#8217;s hand and rubbing one&#8217;s face after offering Tahiyyat-ul-Masjid (two-unit-Prayer to greet the mosque), optional Prayer and Al-Sunan Al-Rawatib (supererogatory prayer that was stressed and regularly performed by the Prophet)?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Raising one&#8217;s hands is one of the ways to have supplications answered. It is reported in a Prophetic Hadith that raising one&#8217;s hands is a way to have supplications answered. So, it is permissible for a Muslim to raise his hands after offering supererogatory prayer or at other times; however, he should not keep doing so, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) would not keep doing so all the time, but he may peace be upon him) sometimes did it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for obligatory prayer</strong>, neither the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor the Companions did it, but they would sometimes do it <strong>after supererogatory Prayer</strong> according to the religious evidence permitting raising one&#8217;s hands on supplicating to Allah when it is done from time to time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <strong>rubbing one&#8217;s face</strong> after supplicating to Allah (Exalted be He), nothing has been reported about it in authentic Prophetic Hadiths. However, some weak Hadiths allow it, so the Muslim scholars see that such weak Hadiths support one another and authenticate one another. Thus, there is nothing wrong if a Muslim rubs the face after supplicating to Allah (Exalted be He), but it is better not to do it, because no authentic Hadith reported this act, i.e. rubbing one&#8217;s face after supplicating.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: </strong>What is the difference between<strong> Ittiba&#8221; </strong>(following one&#8217;s traditions; imitation) and <strong>Al Ibtidah </strong>(innovation)</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">?</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Ittiba&#8217; is what we are required to do according to the Shari&#8217;ah (Islamic law), i.e. following what the Prophet (peace be upon him) has brought of orders and prohibitions. It is said &#8220;We should follow&#8221; because Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (the Qur&#8217;an and Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s Sunnah)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and follow not any Auliya&#8217;</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (protectors and helpers who order you to associate partners in worship with Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, besides Him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">: &#8220;O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allâh &#8211; to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(none has the right to be worshipped but He)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. It is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allâh and His Messenger</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, the Prophet who can neither read nor write </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e. Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, who believes in Allâh and His Words [(this Qur&#8217;ân), the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">Gospel)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and also Allâh&#8217;s Word: &#8220;Be!&#8221; &#8211; and he was, i.e. &#8216;Isa </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Jesus)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> son of Maryam </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Mary)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and follow him so that you may be quided.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are ordered to follow the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Qur&#8217;an. Holding on to what has been revealed by Allah in the Qur&#8217;an and what the Prophet (peace be upon him) has said or done is Ittiba. It is to follow the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in what he ordered or prohibited. This is Ittiba, which is Wajib <em>(</em>obligatory) in matters which we are obliged to do, and it is Mustahab (desirable) in matters which we are desired to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ibtida&#8217;, it is innovation of something in the religion which Allah has not permitted, for example: worship in a way that Allah has not made lawful. This is called Ibtida&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: (&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours </strong>(Islam)<strong> that is not part of it will have it rejected</strong></span>.&#8221;) and he also said: (<strong><span style="color:#000000;">The most evil of matters are those which are newly introduced in religion</span></strong>), and every Bid&#8217;ah is a Dalalah (deviation from what is right).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person was to perform more than five Prayers and said they would perform six Prayers, increasing one Prayer at any time of the day, is a Batil (null/void) and Bid&#8217;ah. It is prohibited to perform or to invite people to perform it with the intention that it is a Fard (obligatory, based on a definitive text). Or if someone said the two Sajdahs (prostrations) are not enough, lets make a third Sajdah in every Rak&#8217;ah (unit of Salah); this is Bid&#8217;ah, which if purposely done, will make the Prayer Batil. Likewise if a person decides to perform a second Ruku&#8217; (bowing) in Prayer, this is Bid&#8217;ah except for the eclipse Prayer. Also if someone says: lets allocate a night for worship and we shall pray ten or twenty Rak ahs on the Thursday or Friday night every week, this is Bid&#8217;ah for it is not something which Allah prescribed, as is the night of the Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him) birthday, or the night of the birth of Fatimah, Al-Husayn, Al Badawy, Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, or &#8216;Umar, it is Bid&#8217;ah and the celebration where they pray, talk, perform Dhikr; this is all Bid&#8217;ah because neither Allah nor the Prophet made it lawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Ibtida&#8217; is to innovate a worship which Allah did not prescribe, whether it is a verbal or practical; all this is Bid&#8217;ah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has not prescribed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of such Bid&#8217;ah is the construction domes and Masjids (mosques) over the graves. People think that this is a way to get closer to Allah, and it is from the Din (religion). Rather it is Bid&#8217;ah because the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade construction over graves, because this could lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). Of such Shirk acts are to touch the graves with the intention of getting closer to Allah. This is Bid&#8217;ah and the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade building over the graves or plastering them, because this could lead to Shirk. This is also true for those who invoke the dead say &#8220;I invoke You (Allah) by (the intercession of) the dead of the graves&#8221;, &#8220;I invoke You (Allah) with the honor or sake of the Prophet&#8221;, or &#8220;with the honor or sake of the righteous people&#8221;; all this is Bid&#8217;ah. But if someone says: I invoke You (Allah) with my love for You, or with my belief in Your Messenger or with Your Noble Names; this is acceptable and lawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bid&#8217;ah is what people have innovated in the religion and not sanctioned by Allah and His Prophet. Ittiba&#8217; is to follow the approach prescribed by Allah to His servants, and follow in the footsteps of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Necessity of approaching Allah with Tawbah and supplication in adversity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Abdul­‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdullah ibn Baz to every Muslim who reads this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah help us remember Him and take warnings and lessons from the destinies unfolding before our eyes and lead us to sincere Tawbah (repentance to Allah) from all sins and misdeeds. Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As­salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) wills with His Deep Wisdom, absolute Proof, and all­ Encompassing Knowledge to test His Servants with prosperity and adversity, poverty and affluence, blessings and calamities, to try their patience and thankfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Anyone who is patient at the time of adversity, thankful at the time of prosperity, humbles themselves and supplicates to Allah upon facing hardships, acknowledges their sins and shortcomings, and asks Allah for His Mercy and Forgiveness, has succeeded and will be granted the blessed end. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) revealed in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Alif­ Lâm ­Mîm.</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur’ân, and none but Allâh (Alone) knows their meanings.]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: &#8220;We believe,&#8221; and will not be tested. And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allâh will certainly make </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(it)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> known </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the truth of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> those who are true, and will certainly make </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(it) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">known </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the falsehood of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> those who are liars, </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(although Allâh knows all that before putting them to test)</span><strong>. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fitnah (trial) mentioned in this Ayah (Qur’anic verse) means the test of faith that makes evident the truthful from the liar, the patient and the thankful, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We have made some of you as a trial for others: will you have patience? And your Lord is Ever All­ Seer (of everything)</span></strong>&#8220;. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) further says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good. And to Us you will be returned.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We tried them with good </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(blessings) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and evil </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(calamities)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> in order that they might turn</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (to Allâh’s Obedience)</span>&#8220;. The good refers here to the blessings of fertility, prosperity, good health, honor, victory over enemies, and the like, while the evil here are adversities, such as diseases, domination of the enemy, earthquakes, hurricanes, storms, torrential destructive floods, and the like. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Evil </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(sins and disobedience to Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> has appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of men have earned </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by oppression and evil deeds)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, that He</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by repenting to Allâh, and begging His Pardon)</span>&#8220;. This means that Allah (may He be Praised) predestined the good and the evil and the occurrence of corruption for people to return to Al-­Haqq (the Truth), to hurry and make Tawbah from what Allah has forbidden them, and hasten to the obedience of Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kufr (disbelief) and sins are the cause of all afflictions and evil in this world and the Hereafter, while tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and Iman (belief) in Him and His Messengers, obedience to Him and His Messengers, holding fast to His Shari‘ah (Islamic law), Da‘wah (calling) people to it, and refuting those who oppose it, are the causes of all good in this world and in the Hereafter. Perseverance on these principles and enjoining and cooperating in them bring honor in this world and the Hereafter, and salvation from every evil and protection from every Fitnah (trial). Allah (may He be Praised) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! If you help </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in the cause of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm. And He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(may He be Praised) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">says: Verily, Allâh will help those who help His </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Cause)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. Truly, Allâh is All ­Strong, All ­Mighty</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span>. Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) enjoin Iqamat­ as­Salât [i.e. to perform the five compulsory congregational Salât (prayers) (the males in mosques)], to pay the Zakât and they enjoin Al­Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid Al­ Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islâm has forbidden) [i.e. they make the Qur’ân as the law of their country in all the spheres of life]. And with Allâh rests the end of (all) matters (of creatures). He (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieves after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh). </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwâ (piety), certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth, but they belied (the Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what they used to earn (polytheism and crimes).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Praised) explains in many Ayahs that the afflictions and exemplary punishments that befell the preceding nations, such as floods, devastating winds, the mighty shriek, and being swallowed up by the earth, and the like, were nothing more than the result of their Kufr and sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:<strong><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;So We punished each (of them) for his sins; of them were some on whom We sent Hâsib (a violent wind with shower of stones) [as on the people of Lût (Lot)], and of them were some who were overtaken by As­-Saihah [torment ­ awful cry. (as Thamûd or Shu‘aib’s people)], and of them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow [as Qârûn (Korah)], and of them were some whom We drowned [as the people of Nûh (Noah), or Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his people]. It was not Allâh Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves.&#8221; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised and Exalted) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much.&#8221;</span></strong> (See the Qur’ân Verse 35:45).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah orders His Servants to turn to Him in sincere Tawbah (repentance to Allah) and supplicate to Him at the time of adversity, as He (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe! Turn to Allâh with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And all of you beg Allâh to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful He (may He be Praised) &#8220;</span></strong> also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you (O Muhammad ىلص ملـسو هـيلع اللها). And We seized them with extreme poverty (or loss in wealth) and loss in health (with calamities) so that they might humble themselves (believe with humility). When Our Torment reached them, why then did they not humble themselves (believe with humility)? But their hearts became hardened, and Shaitân (Satan) made fair­ seeming to them that which they used to do.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this glorious Ayah, Allah urges His Slaves and awakens in them the desire that, when they face adversities, such as illness, wounds, fighting, earthquakes, winds, storms, and other tribulations, they should humble themselves to Him in need of Him and ask for His Help. This is the meaning of Allah’s Saying: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">When Our Torment reached them, why then did they not humble themselves (believe with humility)?</span></strong>&#8221; It asks why they (the preceding nations) did not turn to Allah humbly when they were inflicted with torment. Allah then tells that their hard­ heartedness and the handiwork of Satan, making evil deeds pleasing to them, prevented them from Tawbah, supplication, and beseeching forgiveness. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But their hearts became hardened, and Shaitân (Satan) made fair­ seeming to them that which they used to do.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported that the Rightly ­Guided Caliph, Amir Al ­Mu’minin (Commander of the Believers), ‘Umar ibn ‘Abdul­‘Aziz (may Allah be merciful to him), when there was an earthquake during his era, wrote to his agents in the different countries and ordered them to tell the Muslims to make Tawbah to Allah, humble themselves to Him, and seek His Forgiveness from their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All you Muslims know the different types of Fitan (trials) and calamities that prevail in our time, among which is the that the Kafirs have power over the Muslims in Afghanistan, the Philippines, India, Palestine, Lebanon, Ethiopia, and other countries. There have also been earthquakes in Yemen and many countries; devastating floods, and violent hurricanes that have destroyed homes, trees, ships, and other properties; avalanches that have brought about incalculable harm; and famines and droughts in a multitude of countries. All this and much more are the different types of punishment that Allah afflicts upon His Servants due to their Kufr and misdeeds, deviation from His Obedience, zeal for this world and its transient pleasures, and turning away from the Hereafter and failing to prepare for it; except those to whom Allah has shown His Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that all such adversities obligate Allah’s Servants to hasten to make sincere Tawbah to Him (may He be Praised) from all that He prohibited them from, to return to His Obedience, to rule according to the Shari‘ah (Islamic law), to cooperate in righteousness and piety, and advise one another to adhere to the truth and have patience. The moment the Servants repent to their Lord, humble themselves to Him, and hasten to do what pleases Him: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Help you one another in Al­Birr and At­Taqwâ (virtue, righteousness and piety)</span></strong> and enjoin one another to do good and forbid one another from evil, Allah will set their affairs aright and ward off the evil of their enemies, grant them authority in the land, give them victory over their enemies, bestow upon them His Blessings, and protect them from His Punishment. Allah, the Truest Speaker, says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">and (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them)&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors. And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order, and invoke Him with fear and hope. Surely, Allâh’s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good­ doers&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(commanding you)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">: &#8220;Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, that He may grant you good enjoyment, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding Grace to every owner of grace (i.e. the one who helps and serves the needy and deserving, physically and with his wealth, and even with good words). But if you turn away, then I fear for you the torment of a Great Day </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e. the Day of Resurrection)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practice their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided)&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) further says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al­Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al­Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden); they perform As­Salât (Iqâmat­as­Salât), and give the Zakât, and obey Allâh and His Messenger. Allâh will have His Mercy on them. Surely Allâh is All­ Mighty, All­ Wise&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) clarifies in these Ayahs that His Mercy, Benevolence, Protection, and all His other Blessings are granted in full and shall continue to be given in the Hereafter to those who fear Him, believe in Him, obey His Messengers, hold fast to His Shar‘iah (Islamic Law), and make Tawbah to Him from their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But for those who shun His Obedience, are too proud to fulfill the Rights owed to Him, and persist in their Kufr and disobedience, Allah (may He be Praised) threatens them with different punishments in this life and the Hereafter, and shall expedite the share of punishment which He has allotted for them (in this world. ed.), as His wisdom dictates, for them to be an example and warning to others. Allah (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them (in punishment), and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows. So the root of the people who did wrong was cut off. And all the praises and thanks are to Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinn, and all that exists).&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Muslims! Call yourselves to account for your deeds, make Tawbah to your Lord, and seek His Forgiveness. Hasten to obedience and be on your guard against disobedience, and cooperate in righteousness and piety. Do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good. Be just; indeed, Allah loves those who act justly. Make provision of righteous acts before death befalls you. Show mercy to the weak, help the poor, increase your Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah), ask for His Forgiveness, enjoin that which is good and forbid that which is evil that you may receive mercy. Take admonition from what happened to the preceding nations due to their sins and misdeeds. Indeed, Allah accepts the Tawbah of the penitent, shows mercy to the doers of good, and grants a blessed end to the pious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Praised) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for Al-­Muttaqûn (the pious) And He (Exalted be He) says: Truly, Allâh is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him), and those who are Muhsinûn (good­doers)</span></strong>. (See the footenote of V.9:120).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah with His Most Beautiful Names and Most High Attributes to show mercy to the Muslims, grant them understanding of the Din (religion), give them victory over His and their enemies among the Kafirs and hypocrites, afflicting them with His Wrath that never will be turned back from the wrongdoers. He is the Guardian and the One Who is Capable of doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions, and those who follow them in righteousness until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As­salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q3: What is the ruling on amulets consisting of the Qur’an and other things? </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Amulets that consist of other than the Qur’an such as bones, talismans, cowrie shells, wolf’s hair and the like are all evil and Haram (prohibited) by the Nas (Islamic text from the Qur’an or the Sunnah)</strong></span>. It is not permissible to hang them on anybody or anything, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Anyone who wears an amulet, may Allah not fulfill it (i.e., their purpose) for them, and whoever wears a cowrie shell, may Allah not give them peace.” And in another narration, he (peace be upon him) said, “Anyone who wears an amulet has committed Shirk (associated others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if amulets consist of the Qur’an or well­known good supplications, this is a controversial matter among the scholars. Some say that such amulets are permissible. This opinion was reported from a group of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) who likened it to recitation (of some Qur’anic Ayahs and supplications) over sick people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others say that it is not permissible. This opinion is supported by ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud and Hudhaifah (may Allah be pleased with them both). A group of the Salaf and the righteous successors said it is not permissible to tie amulets even if they are from the Qur’an in accordance with the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>principle of Sadd­ul­Dhara’i (blocking the means leading to sins)</strong> </span>and to forestall acts of Shirk and to act upon the general meaning of the Hadiths. This is because the Hadiths that prohibit amulets are general and make no exception. Muslims should abide by the general ruling. Therefore, it is basically not permissible to use any kind of amulets in order not to permit people to use some other types of amulets, thus leading to confusing matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to prohibit all types of amulets and this is the soundest opinion for the obvious evidence supporting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If we permit the use of amulets made from the Qur’an and good supplications, it will open the door for people to wear any form of amulets they like</strong></span>. Then, if they are reproved for what they do, they will say that they are amulets consisting of the Qur’an or good supplications. Consequently, the door will be opened, the hole will expand and all types of amulets (whether from the Qur’an or anything else) will be worn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is another reason for their prohibition, which is the fact that people may enter the bathroom and other unclean places while wearing them</strong></span>. It is well­known that the Words of Allah (the Qur’an) are too sacred to be in such places and it is not appropriate to take them into bathrooms.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah Alone! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are repeated questions about some who claim that Allah is incarnate among His creation and mingles with them. <strong><span style="color:#993300;">They claim that</span> </strong>this is the meaning of the general Ma`iyyah (association or being with). They take as evidence the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse): &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> were not on the western side</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (of the Mount)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span></strong> and:  &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">You were not with them, when they cast lots with their pens as to which of them should be charged with the care of Maryam </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Mary)</span>; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">nor were you with them when they disputed&#8221;</span></strong>. They claim that the two Ayahs denote that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) was not with them, but Allah was there in His Self ­Entity, as he exists everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since those people misunderstand the whole point and made a big mistake, opposing the true `Aqidah (creed) as shown in the Holy Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah and as adopted by the Salaf (righteous predecessors) of the Muslim nation, I think I should show the right opinion on such a false belief and what seems to be confusing about this point pertaining to Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Exalted and Glorified) can be described only with the Names and Attributes with which He has described Himself and the Names and Attributes with which His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) described Him, which suit His Majesty without Takyif (questioning Allah&#8217;s Attributes), Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation), Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), or Ta`til (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes). This is because Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All­ Hearer, the All­ Seer&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As stated in the Holy Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah and unanimously agreed upon by the Salaf of the Muslim nation, Allah (Glorified be He) is above His creatures and is seated on His Throne in a manner that suits His Majesty, unlike the seating of His creation. Allah (Exalted be He) is among His creatures with His knowledge and nothing is concealed about them from Him. This is what has been proven by the Holy Qur&#8217;an with its rhetoric Ayahs and by the Prophetic Sunnah with its direct authentic Hadiths.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>There are many Qur&#8217;anic proofs</strong></span> that Allah exists in the heavens above His creatures and is seated on His Throne. Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">To Him ascend </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(all)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it (i.e. the goodly words are not accepted by Allâh unless and until they are followed by good deeds) ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I will take you and raise you to Myself ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The angels and the Rûh</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [Jibrîl (Gabriel)]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> ascend to Him ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Istawâ)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> rose over the Throne </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in a manner that suits His Majesty)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. The Most Gracious </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">! ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, will not cause the earth to sink with you Or do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, will not send against you a violent whirlwind? ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Gracious </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> rose over </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Istawâ)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Mighty)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Throne </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in a manner that suits His Majesty)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. and: O Hâmân! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways The ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the Ilâh </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(God)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> of Mûsâ </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Moses)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">: But verily, I think him to be a liar.</span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for the proofs from the Prophetic Sunnah</span></strong>, there are uncountable numbers of Sahih (authentic) and Hasan (good) Hadiths, such as: the Hadith about the Prophet&#8217;s Mi`raj (Ascension to the heavens) to his Lord and the Hadith about the Ruqyah (reciting Qur&#8217;an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing) which was reported by Abu Dawud and others: &#8220;<strong>Our Lord is Allah Who is in the heaven; Holy is Your Name, Your command reigns supreme in the heaven and the earth</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Hadith about the mountain goats, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span><strong>..and the Throne is above this; Allah is above the Throne; and He knows your states</strong><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span>. (Related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and others)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an authentic Hadith he (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said to the bonds woman: &#8220;Where is Allah?&#8221; She replied: &#8220;In the heaven.&#8221; He (peace be upon him) asked her: &#8220;Who am I?&#8221; She replied: &#8220;You are the Messenger of Allah.&#8221; Then he (peace be upon him) said to her master: &#8220;Release her for she is a believer.&#8221; (Related by Muslim in his Sahih book of Hadith)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other Hadiths that were authentically reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) stating that Allah&#8217;s Messenger said that Allah is above His Throne and that He is above the heavens, as naturally known by all nations, Arabs and non­-Arabs both in the pre­Islamic period and under Islam, except those whom Satan has allured. Also, there are hundreds or thousands of statements by the Salaf on the same topic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing in the Holy Qur&#8217;an, the Prophetic Sunnah or the statements of the Salaf, neither from among the Prophet&#8217;s Companions nor those who followed their guidance or the Imams who lived in the age of allurement and difference, that opposes what has been mentioned above whether explicitly or implicitly. None of them ever said that Allah is not above the heavens, not above the Throne, not exist anywhere in His Self ­Entity, all places are the same to Him, or not exist in the world nor outside it, not permissible to use your fingers, etc. to point at Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contrarily, it was authentically reported in the Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir Ibn `Abdullah that on concluding a famous sermon by Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) on the Day of `Arafat in the biggest gathering attended by Allah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam), he said: &#8220;<strong>Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you, haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you</strong>.&#8221; They said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then He (peace be upon him) raised his finger to the sky and pointed at the people and said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span><strong>O Allah! Bear witness to this</strong>.&#8221; There are many similar Hadiths on this point.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also discussed by Shaykh­ul ­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and others who were well ­versed in such matters (see Al ­Fatawa, v., p. 14).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Generally, the corrupt belief adopted by the impairing <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Jahmiyyah</span> </strong>(a deviant Islamic sect denying some Attributes of Allah, claiming they are ascribed to people and cannot be ascribed to Allah) and those following them from among the people who introduced innovations to the religion is one of the most wicked and harmful beliefs. It detracts from Allah&#8217;s Majesty ­ we seek refuge in Allah from our hearts&#8217; deviation from the right path! There are many pieces of evidence of such misleading and corrupt beliefs. There can be no doubt that a sound mind and upright natural disposition deny such corrupt beliefs. Besides, there is hard legal evidence that denies such corrupt beliefs. Regarding the practice of taking the above ­mentioned Ayahs as evidence to support their corrupt belief, it is a wicked practice, as they claim that Allah was incarnate in the earth beside Mount Sinai, taking as evidence the Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs on such an event. May Allah be Glorified and High from their grave falsehood!</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those claiming Allah is incarnate among His creation do not know that Ma`iyyah is of two types; general and private.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examples of the <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>private Ma`iyyah</strong></span> are the Ayahs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Truly, Allâh is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him), and those who are Muhsinûn (good­doers)&#8221;</strong></span>. See the footenote of V.9:120). ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allâh is with us&#8221;</span></strong>. and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I am with you both, hearing and seeing&#8221;</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are similar Ayahs on the private Ma`iyyah that Allah (Exalted be He) is with His prophets and pious believing servants through support, help, guidance and care. This is confirmed by Allah (Glorified be He) in a Qudsi Hadith related by His Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>My slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing Nawafil (praying or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) until I love him, so I become his sense of hearing with which he hears; his sense of sight with which he sees; his hand with which he grips; and his leg with which he walks&#8221;</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this does not mean that Allah becomes a servant&#8217;s extremities ­ may Allah be Glorified and High from such meaning! Conversely, it denotes that Allah becomes with a servant through support and guidance, as explained in another narration of the Qudsi Hadith mentioned above:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>With Me he hears, with Me he sees, with Me he grips, and with Me he walks</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the second narration Allah explains the meaning of His saying, &#8220;<strong>I become his sense of hearing, etc.<span style="color:#000000;">,</span></strong>&#8221; which implies Allah&#8217;s guidance to and support of His servants and protecting them from committing what displeases Him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <strong><span style="color:#993300;">general Ma`iyyah</span></strong>, it means perfect knowledge. Such a type of Ma`iyyah is mentioned in many Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is no Najwâ </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(secret counsel)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> of three but He is their fourth </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, nor of five but He is their sixth </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, nor of less than that or more but He is with them </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> wheresoever they may be&#8221;</span></strong>. ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He is with you (</strong>by His Knowledge)<strong> wheresoever you may be&#8221;</strong></span>. ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then surely, We shall narrate unto them (</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">their whole story) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">with knowledge, and indeed We have not been absent</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Neither you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur’ân, ­ nor you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(mankind)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> do any deed </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(good or evil)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> but We are Witness thereof, when you are doing i</span></strong>t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many similar Ayahs on such a type of Ma`iyyah. Allah (Glorified be He) is seated on His Throne in a manner that suits His Perfection and Majesty. Also, He is All ­Knowing of His creation and a Witness over them wherever they exist; on land or in the sea, by night or by day, at their homes or in the open desert. All are equal with regard to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge, as He surrounds them all in His Knowledge and they all are under His Sight and Hearing that He hears their speech, sees them wherever they are, and knows their secrets and private counsel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">No doubt! They did fold up their breasts, that they may hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Verily, He is the All ­Knower of the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(innermost secrets) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">of the breasts.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah (Exalted be He) says:<strong><span style="color:#008000;"> It is the same </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(to Him)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> whether any of you conceal his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">that you may know that Allâh has power over all things, and that Allâh surrounds all things in </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(His)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Knowledge. There is no god or lord but Allah</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) begins the Ayahs on general Ma`iyyah with knowledge and finishes them with knowledge so that His servants may know that Allah is All ­Knowing of their affairs, not that He is incarnate among them in their dwellings, etc. Allah is Exalted above such falsehoods.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">The falsehood that the general Ma`iyyah means that Allah is incarnate among His creation is adopted by those believing in incarnation</span>. They claim that Allah exists everywhere in His Self­ Entity and that He is Exalted above being seated on His Throne and existing in the heavens over His creation. They never exalt Him above being existent in the dirtiest places ­may Allah disgrace them all!</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Great scholars from among the Salaf fought such falsehoods such as Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, `Abdullah Ibn Al­Mubarak, Ishaq Ibn Rahawayh, Abu Hanifah Al­Nu`man and others. Similarly, scholars from among the Imams of Guidance did the same such as Shaykh­ul ­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, the great scholar Ibn Al­Qayyim, Al­ Hafiz Ibn Kathir and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since this point has been clear, the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you (by His Knowledge)</span></strong> and similar Ayahs do not denote that Allah is incarnate among His creation, neither explicitly nor implicitly. The preposition &#8220;with&#8221; in these Ayahs does not mean this at all, but it only denotes Ma`iyyah and association. Such Ma`iyyah has a different meaning in each situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As said by Abu `Umar Al­ Tallamanky (may Allah be merciful with him), Muslims from among Ahl­ul­Sunnah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) unanimously agree that the meaning of the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be</span></strong>. and similar Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs is that Allah is with His creation by His knowledge and that He, may He be Exalted, is established on His Throne above the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, great scholars and Imams from among the Salaf were of the opinion that Allah is established on His Throne above the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Nasr Al­Sijzy said our great Imams, such as Sufyan Al­Thawriy, Malik, Hammad Ibn Salamah, Hammad Ibn Zayd, Sufyan Ibn `Uyaynah, Al­Fudayl, Ibn Al­Mubarak, Ahmad, and Ishaq unanimously agree that Allah (Glorified be He) is established on His Throne by His Self­ Entity and everywhere by His Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu `Umar Ibn `Abdul­Bar said: &#8220;Great scholars from among Sahabah (Prophet&#8217;s Companions) and Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) known for Ta&#8217;wil (allegorical interpretation) were of the opinion that the Ta&#8217;wil of the Ayah: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is no Najwâ (secret counsel) of three but He is their fourth</strong></span> (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven) is that Allah is seated on His Throne above the heavens in His Self­ Entity and that He exists everywhere by His Knowledge. It is worth mentioning that no notable scholar opposed their opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al­ Hafizh Ibn Kathir (may Allah be Merciful with him) said, &#8220;The Ayah: &#8216;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by His Knowledge) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">wheresoever you may be. And Allâh is the All ­Seer of what you do&#8217;</span></strong>. means that Allah is a witness of our deeds wherever and whenever we exist; on land or in the sea, by night or by day, in our homes or in the open desert, as we are all equal with regard to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge because He surrounds us all with His Knowledge. We are all under His Sight and Hearing that He hears our talk and sees us wherever we are, and knows our secrets and private counsels. Allay (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">No doubt! They did fold up their breasts, that they may hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Verily, He is the All ­Knower of the (</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">innermost secrets) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">of the breasts</span></strong>. Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceal his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day. There is no God or lord but Him</span></strong>. Regarding the Tafsir (explanation) of the Ayah quoted from Surah Al­Mujadalah in which Allah says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is no Najwâ (secret counsel) of three he said that there are no three persons with a secret but He is their fourth (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven), nor of five but He is their sixth (with His Knowledge), nor of less than that or more but He is with them (with His Knowledge) wheresoever they may be&#8221;</span></strong>. that He is All­Knowing of their affairs, hearing their talk and knowing their secrets and private counsels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah&#8217;s messengers write down people&#8217;s private counsels though Allah is All­ Knowing of such private counsels and hears them. Allah (Glorified be He) says: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Know they not that Allâh knows their secret ideas, and their Najwa (secret counsels), and that Allâh is the All­ Knower of things unseen&#8221;</strong></span>. and: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel? (Yes We do) and Our messengers (appointed angels in charge of mankind) are by them, to record&#8221;</span></strong>. As said, many scholars reported consensus over the meaning of this Ayah is that Allah exists among His creation by His Knowledge. There can be no doubt with regard to this point. In addition, His hearing as well as His Knowledge encompasses them. Moreover, they are under His Sight, as He (Exalted be He) is All­ Knowing of the affairs of His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There can be no doubt that the statements of the Salaf about such a point are too many to be counted. Therefore, the belief that Allah is incarnate among His creation, the claim that Allah exists among His creation in His Self­ Entity according to the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(</span><span style="color:#008000;">by His Knowledge)</span> and that it is not permissible to point at Him are totally wrong and false as shown from the many direct proofs mentioned here and the consensus of Muslim scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, it becomes clear that those who say that Allah is incarnate among His creation and those who follow them are not right at all. Rather, they ascribe to Allah what does not suit His Majesty. In addition, they give the Ayahs on Ma`iyyah explanations that are different from those given by great scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah protect us from disgrace and from ascribing to Allah that which does not suit Him, out of ignorance! We ask Allah (Glorified be He) to make us adhere to the right path, as only He is Able to do all things! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>37- Merits of learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A questioner from Hadhramaut is asking about &#8216;Aqidah (creed): Your Eminence, is learning the Attributes of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Wajib (obligatory) or Mustahab (desirable)? Does learning these Attributes make any difference? What is the ruling on those who believe that it is not Wajib to learn the Attributes because this might entangle one into asking why and what? What are the books you recommend in this regard?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes from the Noble Qur&#8217;an and the purified Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) is <strong>one of the best acts of worship that brings us nearer to Allah</strong>. Learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes <strong>helps one to glorify, praise and call on Allah by His Names and Attributes</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allâh, so call on Him by them)&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that we should know Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes and use them while calling on Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah has ninety-nine Names; anyone who learns them will be admitted to Jannah (Paradise).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p>This Hadith indicates that Allah is Witr (&#8216;Odd&#8217;, i.e. He is one) and He loves odd numbers.  It also indicates that scholars and believers should learn the Names and Attributes of Allah to invoke and praise Him and act upon them so that they enter Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A believer should know that to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) belongs all Magnificent Names and that He has no peer, equal or rival. He is Perfect in His Essence, His Names, His Attributes and His Deeds and none is comparable to Him. Allah (Glorified be He) says: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</span></strong>.) None of Allah&#8217;s Attributes such as His Mercy, Highness, Istiwa&#8217; (Allah&#8217;s rising over the Throne in a manner that befits Him), Wrath , Laughter etc, is similar to ours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">As for the books we recommend in this regard,</span> </strong>the Noble Qur&#8217;an is the greatest Book. We advise you and all Muslims to adhere to it and recite it frequently because it is the Book of Allah which contains light and guidance. Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, this Qur&#8217;ân guides to that which is most just and right</strong>&#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing.&#8221;</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(This is) a Book (the Qur&#8217;an) which we have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember</strong></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they not then think deeply in the Qur&#8217;ân, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?)&#8221;</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We advise all Muslims to frequently recite, ponder over, and memorize the entire Qur&#8217;an or parts thereof. It is the Book of Allah and the source of light and guidance. It calls for adopting good morals, performing righteous deeds, following that which Allah has enjoined, and avoiding that which He has forbidden. It contains the stories of the prophets, messengers, and the righteous so that people may follow in their footsteps and the stories of the wrongdoers, so people may avoid their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also recommend those who are versed to read the books of Hadith such as the Two Sahihs (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) and the four Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) books (of Imams Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, Al-Nasa&#8217;y and Ibn Majah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, we recommend novices to read the abridged versions of these books which can be easily memorized, such as, Bulugh Al-Maram by Al-Hafidh ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani, Kitab Al-Tawhid, Thalathat Al-Usul, Al Qawa&#8217;id Al &#8216;Arba&#8217;, and Kashf Al-Shubuhat by Shaykh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah be merciful to him), Al-`Aqidah Al-Wasatiyyah by Shaykh Al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah, and Umdat Al-Hadith by Shaykh Al-Hafidh Abdul Ghani Al-Maqdisi. These are some important books which should be read and studied because they are useful.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Slaughtering animals upon building houses</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Q: In our residential area, people are accustomed to slaughtering an animal upon starting or finishing the construction of a house. Neighbors and relatives are invited on this occasion. What is Your Eminence&#8217;s opinion about this practice? Is there any recommendable act to be performed before going to live in a new house? Benefit us may Allah reward you well!</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 2; Page No. 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This practice needs to be clarified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If by slaughtering the animal the owners of the house seek to protect themselves from jinn or ensure that the house is safe to live in or any similar issue, this practice will be considered an act of <strong>Bid&#8217;ah</strong> (innovation in religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the slaughter is offered for the sake of the jinn, then it will be considered an act of <strong>major Shirk</strong> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) as it involves offering an act of Ibadah (worship) to someone other than Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if by doing this, one intends <strong>to show gratitude to Allah&#8217;s Blessings</strong> for reaching the roof or completion of construction works there is nothing wrong with this and with inviting the relatives and neighbors. This is the custom of many people who offer thanks to Allah due to Him helping them construct a house of their own instead of renting a house to live in. There is nothing wrong in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the <strong>intention</strong> behind this is to protect oneself from jinn or to fulfill any other non-Islamic purpose, then this practice is impermissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This practice will be valid only if the intention is to show gratitude to Allah for enabling one to construct a house of their own. This practice is similar to being hospitable to one&#8217;s relatives and neighbors.This is also similar to holding a <strong>marriage banquet</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A similar practice is performed when people <strong>return from travel</strong> when animals are sacrificed and relatives are entertained. It was the Prophet&#8217;s (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wasallam</em>) regular practice that upon returning from a journey he would slaughter a camel and invite people to dine with him.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>32- Description of the relationship between the mind and the soul</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Human beings have both minds and souls. Can the soul oppose or agree with the mind? Is there a relationship between both the soul and the mind? Or does each of them operate independently?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mind and the soul are one entity. The mind thinks, considers and contemplates through the soul. If the soul departs the body, every other thing stops to be. While the soul is in the body, the mind thinks and distinguishes between good and evil, as the mind operates through the soul. Therefore, one can think, consider, plan, and decide as long as his soul resides in his body. When it is gone, one cannot think anymore.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>7- Ruling on offering supererogatory Salah (Prayer) fifteen minutes before Zhuhr (Noon) Prayer?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A sister from Riyadh asks: What is the ruling on offering supererogatory Salah (Prayer) fifteen or ten minutes before Zhuhr (Noon) Prayer? Please, clarify this matter, for a fellow Muslim sister told me that it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah at this time. May Allah reward you with the best.</span> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baaz (rahimahullah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for a Muslim to offer supererogatory Salah before Zhuhr when the sun is straight overhead, as this is included among the periods during which it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah. It is authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There are three hours at which the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) forbade us to pray or bury our dead: when the sun begins to rise until it is fully up, when the sun is at its height at midday until it has passed the meridian, and when the sun inclines to setting until it sets.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that shortly before noon no Salah should be offered. This is not a long period; rather, it is only the period when the sun reaches the meridian, the highest point reached by the sun when it is directly overhead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 11; Page No. 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During this time, it is impermissible to offer Salah until its passes the meridian, i.e. until the Adhan (call) to Zhuhr Prayer is announced. After this time, a person may offer Salah as much as they like. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Thus, it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah until the sun passes the meridian, a relatively short period; it is almost fifteen or twenty minutes before noon. However, it is better to be on the safe side and stop offering supererogatory Salah thirty minutes before noon</span></strong>.</span> After the sun passes the meridian, the time of impermissibility ends up to the &#8216;Asr (Afternoon) Prayer.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">31-Ruling on making Du&#8217;a&#8217; the dead</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on those who make Du&#8217;a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead are Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). If they make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to the dead, idols, trees, stones, angels or jinn, they will be regarded as Kafirs (disbelievers) as making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to all these leads to one thing; namely, Kufr (disbelief that takes the Muslim out of Islam),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing that can be excluded from this ruling which is seeking help from his fellow Muslim brother or non-Muslim like buying a commodity from a non-Muslim, asking him to build a shop or mend a car while the person while he is alive. This case is considered to be exceptional and is not a kind of Shirk. It is similar to what Allah (Exalted be He) mentions in the story of Musa (Moses): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(The man of his own) party asked him for help against his foe)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one asks his fellow Muslim brother or the non-Muslim, who is present, to do something for him like building a house, mending the car, or plowing the land in return for something, or they agree upon doing something that is legally permitted, there will be nothing wrong as all these things are normal and can be done by human beings who are alive and present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) is making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to those who are not present and cannot hear him, the dead or a living person whom he thinks to be supernatural and has a mysterious power. This understanding leads him to think that if he makes Du&#8217;a&#8217; to this person for forgiveness and admittance to paradise, he will be able to do this because of something secret about this person. This is Munkar even if the person who is invoked besides Allah (Exalted be He) is living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Sufis who worship their Shaykhs and their senior and prestigious persons who are dead. They ask them for help and make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to them to cure the sick. All these things are considered to be major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) <strong>even if the person whom they make Du`a&#8217; to is alive because they ask him something beyond his abilities</strong>. This behavior differs from asking a person to lend you something, build a house for you, cultivate some land, mend a car, bring your belongings from the car, and so on. All these things are normal and contain there is nothing wrong in them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">23- Sincerity in dedicating one&#8217;s deeds to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Q: Sister M. H. from Makkah Al-Mukarramah asks: What is the correct way to sincerely dedicate one&#8217;s deeds to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He)? How can deeds be done sincerely for His sake?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808080;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baaz (rahimahullah):</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To act sincerely, a person must turn to Allah (Exalted be He) and have an attentive heart. A person should perform all deeds such as Salah (Prayer), Sawm (Fast), Sadaqah (voluntary charity), Hajj (Major Pilgrimage), Umrah (Minor Pilgrimage), and so on, seeking the Pleasure of Allah, salvation from the Hellfire, and attainment of Allah&#8217;s Mercy and Forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sincerity is to seek the Pleasure of Allah (Exalted be He), to draw close to Him, to hope for His Mercy, to have one&#8217;s deeds accepted, to be saved from Hellfire, and to be admitted to Jannah (Paradise), not for the purposes of Riya&#8217; (showing-off) or enhancement of one&#8217;s reputation. A believer should perform deeds for the sake of Allah (Exalted be He) in order to attain salvation in the Hereafter, to be saved from the Hellfire, and to be granted absolution. Hence, every believer, male and female, should dedicate all their deeds to Allah seeking His Pleasure so that Allah may accept their deeds.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q 7: I have a relative who frequently swears by Allah whether he is truthful or not. What is the religious ruling on such an act?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (<em>rahimahullaah)</em>:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should be advised and told to abstain from swearing frequently, even if he is truthful, for Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much)</strong></span>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Three persons whom Allah shall neither speak to on the Day of Resurrection, nor look at, nor purify, and they shall have a painful torment: a white-haired adulterer, an arrogant poor person, and a man who made Allah as his merchandise: he does not buy except by swearing (by Allah) and he does not sell except by swearing.”</strong></span> &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Arabs used to be praised for taking oaths rarely. A poet said about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Whoever does not swear so much, can keep his oath</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>If he takes an oath he will fulfills it</strong></span></p>
<p>Aliyah in Arabic means oath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is prescribed for a Mu’min (believer) to swear rarely even if they are truthful</strong>. Swearing frequently may lead them to tell lies. It is well known that telling lies is Haram (prohibited); but it is much more prohibited when it is combined with swearing oaths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nevertheless, if there is a demanding situation or a probable benefit calling a Muslim to swear untruthfully, it will be permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been authentically reported from the Hadith of Umm Kulthum bint Uqbah ibn Abu Mu&#8217;it (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Not a liar the one who tries to reconcile between people and so narrates something good or says something good</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Kulthum bint‘ Uqbah (may Allah be pleased with her) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I have never heard him (the Prophet, peace be upon him) permit anything of what people call ‘lying’, except in three cases: war, reconciliation between people, and man’s talk to his wife and woman’s talk to her husband.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Related by Muslim in the Sahih [Authentic Hadith Book])</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a Muslim, in an attempt to reconcile between people, says, &#8220;I swear by Allah that your companions desire reconciliation with you, they like to be on good terms with you and want such and such&#8221;, then he goes to the other party and tells them the same words, intending good and hoping to achieve reconciliation, this is permissible according to the above-mentioned Hadith. The same is when a Muslim sees that a person wants to kill another one unjustly or wants to commit an unjust act against him. So, he says: &#8220;By Allah, he is my brother&#8221; in order to save him from such an oppressor who wants to kill him or beat him without any right, and he is sure that by saying: &#8220;this is my brother&#8221; the oppressor will leave the other person out of respect for him. In such a case, a Muslim should do this for the sake of saving his brother from oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basic ruling concerning false oaths is that they are forbidden and prohibited, unless they are meant for a serious benefit graver than lying, such as the three examples mentioned in the previous Hadith.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1- Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Is it true that some Muslims will enter Jannah (Paradise) without being called to account?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Yes, it is true, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(<strong>&#8220;All the nations were shown to me, and I saw a prophet accompanied by a small group of his followers, another with two or three people of his followers and a third not accompanied by any follower.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the end of the Hadith, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Among my Ummah there are seventy thousand who would enter Jannah without being brought to account or being punished.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) asked who these people were, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah (recitation for healing or protection); they are those who do not get themselves cauterized; and they are those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith implies that the Mu&#8217;min (believer), who continues obeying Allah&#8217;s commands and avoiding His prohibitions until death, will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds and without suffering punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Falling under this category are the Mu&#8217;mins who do not ask others to recite Ruqyah over them. There is nothing wrong, however, if they themselves are accustomed to reciting Ruqyahs over other Muslims. This is because one who recites Ruqyah basically does a good deed by asking Allah (Exalted be He) to cure the illness of the person for whom they recite the Ruqyah. This is based on the authentic Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Whosoever among you is able to benefit his fellow believer, let him do so.)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Istirqa</strong></span>&#8216; means to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. For example, you may ask a person to recite Rygyah for you. It is better not to ask others for Ruqyah unless one happens to be suffering from an ailment, In this case, it is not wrong to ask others to recite Ruqyah. It has been reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) asked Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) saying: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Seek healing through asking for Ruqyah</span></strong>) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered her to treat herself by means of asking others for Ruqyah, He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to recite Ruqyah to the children of Jafar when they were under the influence of the evil eye. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is no Ruqyah (reciting Qur&#8217;an and supplicating over the sick seeking healing) better than that which is said as a treatment for an evil eye or (a sting of) a venomous animal</strong></span>.&#8221; It is not wrong to seek treatment by means of Istirqa’ when necessary. However, it is better not to resort to such means if it is possible to cure oneself by means of some other kind of medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also better not to treat oneself by means of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>cauterization</strong> </span>if another means of treatment is available. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The best of all remedies are three; cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I hate to be cauterized.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version it states: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">..and I forbid my Ummah (nation) from cauterization.</span></strong>) This denotes that cauterization should be used as a last resort when all other means prove unsuccessful. It is better to seek treatment by other means if possible. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah. However, cauterization may only be resorted to when necessary. It is, however, better to apply another means of treatment like drinking honey, cupping, or reciting the Qur&#8217;an, The Prophet&#8217;s (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) statement: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are those who do not seek Ruqyah; they are those who do not get themselves cauterized&#8230;</strong></span>) does not denote that seeking Ruqyah or cauterization are prohibited; rather, it denotes that one may resort to other means of treatment in preference to these kinds. However, if one is forced by necessity to seek Ruqyah or cauterization, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“T<strong><span style="color:#008000;">hey are these who do not believe in bad omens</span></strong>&#8220;: Believing in the occurrence of evil omens, a custom practiced by the pre-Islamic Arabs, constitutes an act of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the characteristics of the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account is that they avoid the prohibited practice of believing in bad omens and the reprehensible practice of seeking Ruqyah and cauterization when there is no need for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>,&#8221; means that such Muslims avoid these things because they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He) and seek to attain His Pleasure. The statement implies that they steadfastly obedient to Allah (Exalted be He) and they avoid not only what He has declared as prohibited but also some of what He has declared as permissible if there is something better than it. By doing so, they hope for Allah&#8217;s Reward and fear His Punishment. They draw near to Him through doing deeds that He loves and do so with their hearts filled with trust and confidence in Him (Glorified and Exalted be He),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another similar Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand&#8230;)</span></strong> According to another Hadith: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allah promised to increase the number by as many as three Handfuls added by my Lord, Glorified be He.</span></strong>) This increase in number is known to none but Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize, every upright Mu&#8217;min who avoids Allah&#8217;s Prohibitions and does not allow themselves to go beyond the limits set by Allah (Exalted be He) will be counted among the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without Allah calling them to account or consigning them to punishment.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment. When the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) inquired about their characteristics, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told them that they are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omen. We ask Your Eminence to clarify these characteristics so that we may develop them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that <strong><span style="color:#008000;">seventy thousand people of his Ummah (nation) will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment.</span></strong> In another Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand.,.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was asked about their characteristics, he said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah from others, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith refers to pious and faithful Muslims who adhere steadfastly to Allah&#8217;s Din (religion), those who worship Allah Alone, those who fulfill their religious duties, those who avoid His Prohibitions and strive hard to do good to the point that they decline to do what is permissible, yet undesirable, like seeking Ruqyah and cauterization. This perfects their Iman (faith). They do not ask others to make Ruqyah for them nor do they get themselves cauterized. It is better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization unless under necessity. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah when they were under the influence of the evil eye. This indicates that seeking Ruqyah is permissible only when necessary. However, it is better not to treat oneself by means of Istirqa&#8217; or cauterization if another means of treatment is available, Some of the Sahabah were treated by means of cauterization. Khabbab ibn Al-Arat and other Sahabah were also treated by means of cauterization, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have used cauterization as a means of treating the sickness of some of his Sahabah. Having oneself cauterized does not necessarily mean that one will not be counted among the seventy thousand people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds. However, one of their good characteristics includes their uprightness, truly obeying Allah (Exalted be He) and avoiding disobedience to Him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the meaning of the following Hadith: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) once asked his Sahabah: &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; They asked him about those people who will enter Jannah without being called to account. Whereupon the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This has been reported in the Hadith about the seventy thousand Muslims who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told his Sahabah that his Ummah were displayed before him. Among them were seventy thousand people who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment, Some people said; &#8220;The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) may be referring to those who were born Muslims.&#8221; Others said: &#8220;He may be referring to those who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) during the early days of Islam and did not associate any partners with Allah.&#8221; When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) entered upon them, he asked them about the topic they were discussing, When they told him that they were inquiring about the Muslims who will enter Jannah without being judged, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said; (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to the characteristics mentioned in the above Hadith, they also fear Allah, believe in Him and hold steadfastly to His Din (religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not get themselves cauterized</span></strong>&#8221; means that they do not resort to cauterization when they are ill. Another great characteristic is that they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He), However, it is permissible to treat sickness by means of cauterization or seeking Ruqyah as the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have permitted them both. He permitted “Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also permitted the mother of Ja ‘far&#8217;s children to treat them by means of seeking Ruqyah. However, if another means of treatment is available, then it will be better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I do not like to be cauterized</span></strong>. )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Believing in bad omens is prohibited because it leads to pessimism. There is a narration from Imam Muslim that states: &#8220;They do not recite Ruqyah to others,&#8221; but its status has been classified as weak. Some narrators have mistaken seeking Ruqyah for Ruqyah. There is nothing wrong if the Muslim recites Ruqyah for his fellow Muslim, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing wrong with Ruqyahs as long as they do not contain formulas that bear the meaning of Shirk</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have recited Ruqyah to his Sahabah, “Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) is also reported to have recited Ruqyah over the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) when he fell sick. The Sahabah are also on reported to have recited Ruqyah to each other. There is nothing wrong with reciting Ruqyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is better not to seek Ruqyah unless there is a necessity. This is based on the fact that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered Aishah saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over you.</strong></span>&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) also said to the mother of the children of Ja ‘far &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over them (her children).</span></strong>&#8221; There is nothing wrong to ask someone saying: “<strong>O so and so, recite the Qur&#8217;an over me so that Allah may cure my sickness. May Allah reward you greatly</strong>.&#8221; There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is need for that.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Who are the people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds? Are they those who do not recite Ruqyah for themselves nor for others? Kindly explain this to us. May Allah reward you with the best.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Those who follow Allah&#8217;s Din, fulfill His religious duties, and avoid His Prohibitions are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account or suffering punishment. Among them are the seventy thousand who do not seek Ruqyah, have themselves cauterized or believe in bad omens, but put their trust in Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also do not believe in bad omens because believing in them is prohibited. Moreover, they prefer to avoid cauterization as a form of treatment, This is because the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said that these are among the characteristics of the seventy thousand (who will enter Paradise without being called to account). It would be better to use another form of treatment instead of cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey, yet I do not like to be cauterized, ) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah, Therefore, it is better not to treat oneself by means of cauterization, especially when another means of treatment is available. If no other means is available, then there is nothing wrong to resort to this. That does not necessarily mean that they will not be accounted among the seventy thousand. This is because the seventy thousand are those who adhere to the Din of Allah, avoid His Prohibitions, and fulfill the duties He prescribed. Among their good characteristics is that they do not seek Ruqyah. However, seeking Ruqyah does not necessarily mean that they will not be included among the seventy thousand. Seeking Ruqyah is to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. There is nothing wrong to ask for Ruqyah if there is need for that. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah, He also ordered the mother of the children of Ja far to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah, so there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is a need for that. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three things: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey.) This Hadith denotes that though it is permissible to seek treatment by means of cauterization, it is preferable not to resort to it, especially when some other sort of medicine is available.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">7- The most authentic books on “Aqidah</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Q: Please guide me to the most authentic book on true Islamic Aqidah (creed)! May Allah grant you success!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A: The most authentic, noblest and greatest book dealing with the subject of Aqidah and other subjects is <strong>the Glorious Qur&#8217;an</strong>. It contains the most truthful speech. </span><span style="color:#000000;">No falsehood can approach it from before or behind it. It is a revelation from Allah, the All-Wise, the Praiseworthy. I advise the inquirer and all Muslims to hold fast to the Qur&#8217;an and to give it due attention by reciting it often, reflecting on its meanings and trying hard to memorize as many chapters of it as possible. It is the Greatest Book which Allah has sent down to His servants so that they may memorize it, follow its teachings and act upon it. It contains plain truths and clear guidance. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states, «<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, this Qur’an guides to that which is most just and right</strong></span>» </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He (Glorified be He) also says,« <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>it is an honourable well-fortified respected Book (because it is Allah’s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption)</strong></span>» «<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it: (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allah azza wa jal)</strong></span></span>».<span style="color:#000000;"> and: «<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur’an) as an exposition of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and glad tidings for those who have submitted themselves (to Allah as Muslims)</span></strong>.»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I thus advise the inquirer to care for this Great Book, recite it frequently, ponder over its meanings, study it together with colleaques and fellows, and refer to reliable books of Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an), such as the book entitled <strong>&#8220;Adwa&#8217; Al-Bayan&#8221;</strong> for Al-Baghawy, <strong>Tafsir Ibn Kathir </strong>(may Allah be merciful to them all), and the like. They may also refer to commentaries of other Mufassirs (exegetes of the Qur&#8217;an) who clarified the meanings of the Ayahs of the Qur&#8217;an, citing related Hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I advise you my fellow brother to study the Book of Allah and to pay due concern to the <strong>Sunnah</strong> (whatever reported from the Prophet) of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), which contains guidance and light. You may refer to such books as <strong>Sahih Al-Bukhari</strong>, <strong>Sahih Muslim</strong> and the remaining four collections of Hadith (<strong>Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, Al-Nasa&#8217;i, and Ibn Majah</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There are also many other books which </span><span style="color:#000000;">explain the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him), including the <strong>Muwatta&#8217; of Imam Malik</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), the <strong>Sunan of Al-Darimi</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), the <strong>Sahih of Ibn Khuzaymah</strong>, the <strong>Sahih of Ibn Hibban</strong>, <strong>Al-Hakim</strong> and other books which are very beneficial. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">If you have some knowledge of Hadith, you will be able to differentiate between authentic and false Hadiths cited in the books referred to above. The Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) are an exception to this. The Muslim Ummah (community) has unanimously agreed on the authenticity of all the Hadiths compiled in them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">You are also advised to follow in the footsteps of the righteous scholars of Hadith. The Two Sahih Books of Hadith have gained the credibility of AhI-ul- Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream). The Muslim Ummah has also acknowledged them as authentic. Therefore, you must adhere to them tenaciously. You must also hold fast to the Book of Allah, the remaining four books of Sunan and the books we just mentioned. Scholars of Hadith have pointed out weak Hadiths and have given reasons for their weakness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">As for books on the topic of “Aqidah, they are many. One of the best books in this regard is the <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221; by Ibn Khuzaymah</strong>, <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Sunnah&#8221; by *Abdullah Ibn Ahmad Ibn Hanbal</strong>, <strong>&#8220;Minhaj Al-Sunnah&#8221;, by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>, which refutes the claims of the Mutazilites, and <strong>&#8220;Zad Al-Ma‘ad&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong>, knowing that the latter is very good reference in the field of “Aqidah and rulings of Shariah (Islamic Law). Other books include <strong>&#8220;Ijtima Al-Juyush Al-Islamiyyah&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> which refutes the claims of innovators in religious matters, &#8220;<strong>Al-Sawa ‘iq Al-Mursalah&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong>, which also involves refutation of the claims of innovators in religious matters, and <strong>&#8220;Al- Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah&#8221; by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>. This is a concise book which involves great benefit to Muslims. It is in line with the guidance of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah, and Shaykh- ul-Islam advised all Muslims, particularly seekers of knowledge, to memorize it, as it contains clear illustration of the doctrine of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah. Shaykh-ul-Islam also authored a book entitled <strong>&#8220;Al-Risalah Al-Hamawiyyah&#8221;</strong> which answers questions posed by the people of Hamah </span><span style="color:#000000;">concerning proper understanding of Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes, and other questions related to Aqidah. Upon visiting the people of Tadmur, he also wrote an epistle which he entiteled <strong>&#8220;Al-Risalah Al-Tadmuriyyah&#8221;.</strong> It is a great piece which clarifies sound Aqidah. There is also a book entitled &#8220;<strong>Al- Aqidah Al-Tahawiyyah&#8221; by Imam Al- Izz</strong>. It is wonderfully written. There is also another book called <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221; written by Shaykh-ul-Islam Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), which is a valuable book. He also wrote <strong>“At-Thatlathat Al-Usul&#8221;</strong>. He also wrote a short treatise on Aqidah. Another book called <strong>&#8220;Fat-h Al-Majid Sharh Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221;</strong> was written by his grandson Shaykh ‘Abdul-Rahman Ibn Hasan Ibn Al-Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab. It is a great and useful book. The book was annotated by Shaykh Sulayman Ibn ‘Abdullah Ibn Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab. He titled it &#8220;<strong>Taysir Al- Aziz Al-Hamid li-Sharh Kitab Al-Tawhid</strong>&#8220;. It is also a great and useful book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I advise all Muslims to refer to and benefit from these and other beneficial books on the subject of Aqidah. I again stress the fact that the Qur&#8217;an is the greatest, noblest and most truthful of all books. It is the greatest remedy for those who seek healing for their souls. The Salaf (righteous predecessors) did not have any other book except the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). The Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) and the Tabi‘un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) had only the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and the Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and they were sufficient for them. They contain every type of guidance. However, there is nothing wrong in referring to the books of well known and reliable scholars as has been mentioned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There is no harm in making use of their writings, benefiting from them or calling other people to benefit from them. Some people may not trust their own understanding of the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah, and when they refer to books written by reliable scholars and such references happen to be in conformity with their understanding, their knowledge is further enhanced and their hearts are set at ease. Allah alone grants success.</span></p>

<p>(Part No. 6; Page No. 147)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>From among the helping means is to sleep early after ‘Isha’ (Night) Prayer. One should sleep early and should not stay up late and set the alarm to wake up an hour before the Adhan (call to Prayer) in order to benefit and profit from this blessed time. One can also ask their household members to wake them up for Fajr Prayer. The point is that one has to make use of all possible means along with asking Allah for help and success.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 4; Page No. 17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4- Observing causes does not contradict Tawakkul</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The questioner asks: “I recite many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) that talk about Tawakkul (putting one’s trust in Allah). How can we observe Tawakkul in our life? I hope you will give me examples of that.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Tawakkul is one of the duties of the believers. Allah (Glorified be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and put your trust in Allah if you are believers indeed</strong></span>.) , (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him</span></strong>.) and, (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and in Allah (Alone) let those who trust, put their trust.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawakkul is one of the acts of worships and obligations upon Muslims. It means entrusting all affairs with Allah (may he be Exalted) and depending upon Him in everything. It also means putting one&#8217;s trust in Allah along with observing the causes. One should believe that Allah is the Causer of causes and the Disposer of all affairs and that everything rests in Allah&#8217;s Hands (Glorified and Exalted be He). One should also believe that no one can hinder what Allah gives and no one can give what Allah hinders and that Allah is the benefit Giver and the harm Inflicting, and the Supreme Giver and the Preventer. But, at the same time, one should follow legal causes that can bring him benefit by eating when he is hungry, drinking when he is thirst, marrying, earning lawful provision through selling and buying and other things. One should not neglect observing causes and put his trust in Allah along with believing that nothing happens to him except what is predestined by Allah (Exalted be He) and that he will not succeed without Allah&#8217;s support and help. Therefore, one should observe causes and put his trust in Allah and rely upon Him alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 4; Page No. 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should treat the patient while putting his trust in Allah as He is the One Who brings cure. You should follow the causes by seeing a physician, carrying out his instructions, having medicine, Cauterization, dietary or the like. You should sell and buy while putting trust in Allah and believing that nothing will occur except what Allah predestines for you. You can rent your estates in order to receive their due revenues, irrigate your farm, give your animals to drink and eat in order to gain their benefits while depending upon Allah in all these things. This means that one should observe the causes in everything while putting his trust in Allah and believing that He is the Causer of causes, Disposer of all affairs, benefit Giver, harm Inflicting, the Supreme Giver and the Preventer. One should only observe the causes that are ordained for him. You travel for performing Hajj (Pilgrimage), Umrah (Lesser Pilgrimage) or for trading while observing causes and believing that Allah is the Causer of causes and He is the Only One Who can make you reach your destination, support you in performing rites of Hajj and help you to achieve your goals in trade, return from your journey, and so on.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">20- The wisdom of creating the universe</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: It has become quite common knowledge that this world came into existence only for the sake of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and that had it not been for his sake, it would not have come into existence. I hope that our grand Shaykh will answer this question and mention related evidence. May Allah reward you richly.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This claim is adopted by some common people who lack proper understanding of the purpose of life. Some people say that the world was created for the sake of Muhammad. They say that were it not for Muhammad (peace be upon him), neither the world nor the people living in it would have been created. This is a false and groundless claim which is based on corrupt understanding. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allah (Exalted be He) created the world so that people would know Him, realize His existence and worship Him Alone (Glorified and Exalted be He)</strong></span>. He created the world and human beings so that His Names and Attributes, His Graciousness and Knowledge would be known and so that He Alone would be obeyed and worshipped with no partner. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">He did not create this world for the sake of Muhammad, Nuh (Noah), Musa (Moses), Isa (Jesus) or any other prophet</span></strong>. Rather, Allah (Exalted be He) created the universe so that He Alone would be worshiped with no partner or associate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)</span><span style="color:#008000;">. )</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) states that He created mankind so that they would worship Him and not for the sake of Muhammad (peace be upon him), Being one of the prophets, Muhammad (peace be upon him) was also created to worship His Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) states, (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e, death).</span> </strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Surah Al-Talaq, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is Allah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e. seven). His Command descends between them (heavens and earth), that you may know that Allah has power over all things, and that Allah surrounds all things in (His) Knowledge</span></strong>. )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says,(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose!</span> </strong>}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) created mankind so that He would be worshipped, obeyed, glorified and so that people may know that He has power over all things and that He disposes of all affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the questioner must realize that the things which he heard are void and groundless. It was not for the sake of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) nor for the sake of any other messenger that Allah (Exalted be He) created the jinn, mankind, the heavens, the earth or other objects. Rather, Allah (Exalted be He) created life and mankind so that He will be worshipped Alone without any partner and that His Names and Attributes are known to everyone. This is the truth of the matter as is indicated by many proofs. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">This is by no means in contradiction with the fact that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the best and most honorable of men, the last and final Prophet, and the master of the children of Adam</span></strong>. It must be known that Allah (Exalted be He) created him for the purpose of worshipping Him, which is the very purpose for which all mankind was created. Again, Allah (Exalted be He) did not create people for the sake of Muhammad (peace be upon him). At the same time, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the best of all people. Therefore, you must understand this and convey it to others because this matter is very important.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some &#8216;so-called&#8217; scholars and uneducated extremists have misunderstood this matter and this may confuse common Muslims. On the contrary, people of knowledge and far-reaching insight know very well that these are but false claims and that Allah (Glorified be He) created mankind for the purpose of worshipping Him Alone and that they may come to know about His Names and Attributes, like the All-Wise, the All-Knowing, the Hearer, the Answerer of supplications, the One Who has Power overall things, and the One Whose Being, Names and Attributes and Actions are perfect.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1- Definition of Islam</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Please, illustrate to me the meaning of Islam.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>Islam</strong> means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>total submission to Allah (Exalted be He) through belief in His Oneness, and showing subservient and servile obedience to Him</strong></span>. This is the meaning of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic root word ‘<strong>Aslama</strong>&#8216; means to show submission and surrender to someone and obey his commands. Accordingly, Islam means surrender and submission to Allah&#8217;s Will by means of believing in His Oneness, being devoted to Him, obeying His commandments and abandoning what He has prohibited. Such is Islam, about which Allah (Exalted be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam</strong></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides, a Muslims are thus called as they show complete submission to Allah and obey Him, abiding by His Commandments and refraining from what He has prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is also a name for <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>all the Commandments of Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him)</strong></span>, including Salah (Prayer), Sawm (fast), Zakah (obligatory charity), Hajj (pilgrimage), faith and so on. Such categories fall under Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this regard, Allah (Exalted be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion</b></span></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers</strong></span>, )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, a Muslim is a person who submits himself to Allah (Exalted be He) as far as words, practical behavior and belief are concerned. In other words, Islam stands for total submission to and abidance by His Commandments in all aspects of life.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Answered by the Noble Scholar and Muftee<br />
Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdullaah bin Baaz<br />
From <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/translations/al-istiqaamah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Al-Istiqaamah</strong></a> Magazine, Issue No. 1, Dhul-Hijjah 1416H / May 1996CE.</p>
<h3 id="h1-q1-wearing-clothes-made-from-animal-skin" style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q1: Wearing clothes made from animal skin</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: An argument arose between myself and some brothers concerning clothes that are made from animal skin. Some of the brothers were of the opinion that such clothing were normally made from the skin of pigs. If this is the case, then what is your opinion about such items of clothing? Are such items of clothing permitted for us to wear? In some books &#8211; such as <em>Al-Halal wa&#8217;l-Haram</em> of Al-Qardawi, and also <em>Ad-Din &#8216;ala Madhahibu&#8217;l-Arba&#8217;ah</em> &#8211; this particular issue has been discussed and the various differing opinions stated, but such books did not however clarify the issue.</span> <span style="color:#808080;"> [Question and answer taken from <em>Al-Fatawa</em> (1/222) of <em>Shaykh</em> Ibn Baz]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: It is established from the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> that he said: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>If the skin is tanned, then it is purified</strong>.&#8221;</span> [Related by Muslim (1/191) from Ibn &#8216;Abbas <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Scholars have differed concerning this: Does this <em>hadith </em>cover all types of tanned skins, or is it particular to the tanned skin of those animals whose slaughtered meat is lawful? There is no doubt that the tanned skin of those animals whose slaughtered meat is lawful, such as the skin of camels, cows and sheep, are <em>tahir</em> (pure) and are <em>ja&#8217;iz</em> (permissible) to use for all types of clothing &#8211; according to the most correct saying from the People of Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, as for the skin of pigs, dogs and their like &#8211; whose slaughtered meat is not lawful &#8211; then the People of Knowledge have differed as to whether tanning purifies their skin or not. So cautiousness dictates avoiding their usage &#8211; acting upon the saying of the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>Whosoever avoids the doubtful matters safeguards his Religion and his honour</strong>.&#8221;</span> [Related by Al-Bukhari (1/126) and Muslim (no. 1599) from An-Nu&#8217;man ibn Bashir <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>.] And also his <em>&#8216;alayhis-salatu was-salam</em>&#8216;s saying: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>Leave that which makes you doubt, for that which does not make you doubt</strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Sahih</em>: Related by Ahmad (1/200), An-Nasa&#8217;i (8/327-328) and At-Tirmidhi (no. 2637), who authenticated it, from the narration of Al-Hasan ibn &#8216;Ali <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhuma</em>.]</p>
<h3 id="h2-q2-revealing-the-awrah-during-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q2: Revealing the <em>awrah</em> during prayer</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: Sometimes whilst praying &#8211; especially during <em>ruku&#8217;</em> (bowing) and <em>sujud</em> (prostration) &#8211; part of the <em>awrah</em> (private parts) of a person becomes exposed due to his wearing trousers. So what is the ruling concerning the wearing of trousers whilst praying?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: If the man&#8217;s trousers cover what is between his navel and his knees and are loose fitting, wide and baggy, then it fulfills the condition for the correctness of the Prayer. However, what is more preferable is to wear a <em>qamis</em> (long shirt) &#8211; which reaches half-way down to the shins, or just above the anklebone &#8211; over the trousers. This is a more complete form of covering the <em>awrah</em>. Likewise, Prayer in an <em>izar</em> (a loose lower garment) is more preferable than Prayer in a pair of trousers without a long shirt &#8211; since the <em>izar</em> far better covers the <em>awrah</em> than a pair of trousers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<em>Al-Fatawa</em> (1/68-69)]</p>
<h3 id="h3-q3-poor-treatment-of-one-s-spouse" style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q3: Poor treatment of one&#8217;s spouse</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: Even though my husband &#8211; <em>may Allah forgive him</em> &#8211; is a person of good character and fears Allah, yet he does not treat me with kindness. He is always moody, frowning and troubled at heart &#8211; and he often says that I am the cause of this. However, Allah knows &#8211; <em>and all praise is for Allah</em> &#8211; that I do fulfill his rights and try to bring to him tranquility and peace of mind and I try to stay clear of all that which displeases him, whilst patiently bearing his excesses against me. Every time I ask him about something, or speak about a particular matter, he becomes angry and says that my speech is stupidity &#8211; even though I know that he is perfectly happy in the company of his friends and associates. However, when it concerns me, then he does not treat me in the same manner, nor with the same feeling. This causes me great hurt and anger and I have often considered leaving the house. I have &#8211; <em>and all praise is for Allah</em> &#8211; been educated to a good level and fulfill that which Allah has obligated me with. O noble <em>Shaykh</em>! If I leave the house with my children, try to educate them and live my own life, will I be sinful in doing so? Or should I continue to live in my present circumstance, abstain from speaking and continue patiently bearing these difficulties? Please advise me as to what I should do &#8211; <em>and may Allah reward you with goodness</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: There is no doubt that it is obligatory for the husband and wife to live together in a kind and sociable manner. There should be good manners and treatment between them, along with affection and pleasant behaviour &#8211; <em>as Allah the Mighty and Majestic</em> &#8211; says: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And live with them in honour and in kindness</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 4:19]. And His &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em>&#8216;s &#8211; saying: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the wives have rights over the husbands &#8211; similar to those of the husbands over them &#8211; in that which is reasonable. But men have a degree over them</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 2:228].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>Righteousness is good character.</strong>&#8220;</span> [Related by Muslim (4/1980) from An-Nawwas ibn Sam&#8217;an <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu]</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>&#8216;alayhis-salatu wa&#8217;s-salam</em> said: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>Do not consider any good action as insignificant &#8211; even if it is meeting your brother with a cheerful face</strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Sahih</em>: Related by Ahmad (5/63) and it was authenticated by Al-Albani in <em>As-Sahihah</em> (no. 1352)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>also said: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>The most perfect of Believers in &#8216;iman (faith) is the one with the best character. And the best of you are those that are best to their womenfolk, and I am the best amonqst you to my family.</strong>&#8220;</span>[Related by At-Tirmidhi (1/217-218) who said: &#8220;The <em>hadith</em> is <em>Hasan Sahih</em>.&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are besides these many other <em>ahadith</em> which are a general proof for the encouragement of good character, cheerful meeting and good companionship between Muslims. If this is the general case between Muslims, then good treatment between husband and wife and relatives is even more important.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have done well in patiently persevering and bearing the ill treatment and bad character from your husband. However, I advise you to have even greater patience and not to leave the house, and if Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High</em> &#8211; wills, there will be a great deal of good in this and a praiseworthy end for You. Allah &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em> &#8211; said: <span class="quran">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Patiently persevere! Indeed Allah is with those who patiently persevere</span></strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 6:46]. And His &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em>&#8216;s &#8211; saying: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Indeed whosoever fears Allah, obeys Him, turns away from disobedience and patiently perseveres, then Allah does not cause the rewards of the doers of good to be lost</strong></span>.&#8221;</span>[<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 12:90]. And His &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em>&#8216;s &#8211; saying: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Only those who patiently persevere shall receive their reward in full without reckoning</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 39:10]. And His &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em>&#8216;s &#8211; saying, <span class="quran">&#8220;S<strong><span style="color:#008000;">o patiently persevere! Indeed, the end will be good for those who are pious</span></strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 11:49].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this does not prevent you from speaking to your husband with such words, and behaving with him in such a manner, that will soften his heart &#8211; and lead to him being pleased with you and fulfilling your rights of companionship. And as long as he is fulfilling the main and important obligations towards you, then try not to ask him for any worldly need, until his heart is opened and his chest is expanded in accepting your request and fulfilling your needs; in this way &#8211; if Allah wills your ending will be a praiseworthy one. May Allah grant you increase in all that is good, and that the condition of your husband improves, and that he is guided to good character, kindness in companionship and to fulfilling the rights that are due upon him. Indeed Allah is the best of those who are asked, and only He guides to the path that is straight.</p>

<h3 id="h4-q4-using-a-newspaper-as-a-dining-spread" style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q4: Using a newspaper as a dining spread</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: Is it permissible to use a newspaper as a dining spread to eat upon it. If it is not permissible, then what should be done after reading it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: It is not permissible to use a newspaper which contains Qur&#8217;anic verses, or the remembrance of Allah, as a dining spread. Nor is it permissible to make envelopes out of such material, nor to utilize it in any other manner which is disrespectful and insulting to it. If the situation is as we have mentioned, then such papers containing Qur&#8217;anic material should either be stored away in an appropriate place, or burnt, or buried in clean ground.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[<em>Al-Fatawa</em> (1/242)]</span></p>
<h3 id="h5-q5-sincere-repentance" style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q5: Sincere repentance</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: I am a young man, nineteen years of age, and have involved myself in a great deal of sin. Even to the extent that I do not pray most of my Prayers in the mosque, and I have never completely fasted the month of Ramadhan in my entire life. Besides these, I have committed other sins as well. I have vowed to repent many times before, however, after doing so I lapse back into these same sins. The youths of my area are just as bad, as are the friends that I associate with. And Allah knows that I have transgressed against myself and that whenever I repent, I return back to the same sins. I hope that you may direct me to a path that will bring me closer to my Lord and distance ms from these evil actions of mine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Allah &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em> &#8211; says: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say O My Slaves who have transgressed against their own souls! Do not despair of Allah&#8217;s mercy. Indeed Allah forgives all sins. Truly He is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 39:53]. There is a consensus from the Scholars that this noble <em>ayah</em> (verse) was revealed for the <em>ta&#8217;ibin</em> (those who repent). So whoever sincerely repents from his sins, then Allah will forgive him all his sins, as occurs in the saying of Allah &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em>: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who Believe! Turn to Allah in sincere repentance. Perhaps your Lord may remove from you your sins and admit you into Paradise beneath which rivers flow</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 66:8]. So in this <em>ayah</em> (verse), Allah has made the removal of sins and entry into Paradise dependent upon sincere repentance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And sincere repentance is conditional upon:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">[i] abandoning the sin and keeping away from it,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">[ii] having regret and remorse for committing the sin,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">[iii] truly intending not to commit the sin again,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">[iv] remembering the greatness of Allah and hoping for His reward, whilst fearing His punishment.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Another condition for sincere repentance is that if due to transgression, the wealth or property of someone has been stolen or usurped, then it must be returned, or forgiveness must be sought from the one whose wealth, blood or honour has been taken. However, if the honour of a person has been violated and the situation is such that it is not possible to seek that person&#8217;s forgiveness, then plenty of <em>du&#8217;a</em> (supplication) should be made for his welfare and he should be spoken good of in those places where he had previously been backbitten, since good deeds wipe away bad ones.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em> &#8211; said: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Turn you all in repentance to Allah, O Believers, in order that you may be successful</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 24:31]. So in this <em>ayah </em>(verse) Allah &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em> &#8211; linked success with <em>tawbah</em> (repentance) and points to the fact that the repentant person will reach success and happiness, and if such a person were to follow up this repentance with <em>&#8216;iman</em> (faith) and doing righteous actions, then Allah would efface his evil actions and change them to good actions, as Allah &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em> &#8211; says, after mentioning the sins of <em>Shirk</em> (directing worship that is due only for Allah, to other than Allah), taking a life without just cause and fornication and adultery: <span class="quran">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever does this, will receive the punishment. The punishment will be doubled for him on the Day of Judgement and he will live therein in disgrace. Except for those who repent, have <em>&#8216;iman</em> (faith) and do righteous actions. For them Allah will change their evil deeds into good ones, and Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful</span></strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 25:68-70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the causes of <em>tawbah</em> (repentance) are humility and submissiveness to Allah &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em> &#8211; and imploring Him for guidance &#8211; realising that acceptance of one&#8217;s repentance is indeed another favour from Allah. Thus, Allah &#8211; <em>the Most Perfect</em> &#8211; said: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Call upon Me and I will respond to your supplication</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 40:60]. And He &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em> &#8211; said: <span class="quran">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when My servant asks you concerning Me, say to them that I am indeed near. And I respond to the supplication of the one who supplicates to Me</span></strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 2:186].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from the causes of <em>tawbah</em> is choosing good companionship and friendship, and following them in righteous conduct, whilst staying clear of bad companionship. It is authentically related from Allah&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> that he said: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>A person is upon the religion of his friend, so let one of you look to whom he keeps as a friend</strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Hasan</em>: Related by Abu Dawud (no. 4812) and others, from Abu Hurayrah <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>. <em>Imam</em> An-Nawawi authenticated it in <em>Riyadh as-Salihin</em> (no. 174).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> also said: <span class="hadith">&#8220;<strong>The example of good companion and a bad companion is like that of a seller of musk and the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows. As for the seller of musk, then either he will grant you some, or you buy some from him, or at the very least you enjoy a pleasant smell from him. As for the one who blows the blacksmith&#8217;s bellows, then either he will burn your clothes, or you will get an offensive smell from him</strong>.&#8221;</span> [Related by Al-Bukhari (4/323) and Muslim (no. 2628), from Abu Musa al-Ash&#8217;ari <em>radhiallahu &#8216;anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<em>Al-Fatawa</em> (1/251-253).]</p>
<h3 id="h6-q6-splitting-into-groups-within-the-muslims" style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q6: Splitting into groups within the Muslims</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q]: What is the obligation upon the Muslim Scholars with regard to the large number of <em>jam&#8217;iyyat</em> (societies) and <em>jama&#8217;at</em> (groups) in many of the Islamic lands and elsewhere, and with regard to the differences that exist between them, to the point that each group declares the others to be misguided. Do you not hold that it is fitting to enter into explaining the like of this matter and to clarify the truth concerning their differences, for fear that these differences will increase and lead to evil consequences for the Muslims?.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Our Prophet <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> made clear to us a single way which is obligatory upon the Muslims to follow and traverse, and that is Allah&#8217;s Straight Path and the methodology of His upright religion. Allah &#8211; <em>the Most High</em> &#8211; said: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious.</strong></span>&#8220;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 6:153]. Just as the Lord of Might and Majesty warned the <em>Ummah</em> (nation) of Muhammad <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> against splitting and disunity, since that is one of the greatest causes of failure and of the enemy taking control, as occurs ill the saying of Allah &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em>&#8216;s <span class="quran">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allah and do not be divided</span></strong>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 3:101]. And His &#8211; <em>the Most High</em>&#8216;s &#8211; saying: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nuh, and that which We revealed to you, and that which We ordained for Ibrahim, Musa and &#8216;Isa <em>&#8216;alayhimus-salam</em>, saying: that you should establish the religion by doing that which you are ordered with, and make no divisions in it. Intolerable for the Pagans is that to which you call them</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 42:13]. So this is a Divine call to unity and for hearts to be harmonized. And in any Islamic land, if there are many groups for the purpose of good, aid, co-operating in righteousness and piety between the Muslims &#8211; without their being differences between the desires of the companions and followers &#8211; then this is good, is a blessing, and produces great benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if each of them declare the others to be misguided and attack their actions, then this harm is very great and its evil consequences very serious. Then what is obligatory upon the Muslims is to clarify the true states of affairs and to discuss with each group and to sincerely advise all of them that they should proceed upon the way laid down by Allah for His servants, and upon that which our Prophet Muhammad <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em> called to. Then those who ignore this, or continue in their stubbornness, due to personal benefit or goal &#8211; known only to Allah &#8211; then what is obligatory upon those who know the reality is to make this known about them and to warn against them, so that the people may avoid their path, and that those who do not know the reality of their affair may not fall into it and be led astray, and that they are not turned away from the Straight Path which Allah ordered that we follow, as occurs in His &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em>&#8216;s &#8211; saving: <span class="quran">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And this is My Straight Path, so follow it and do not follow other paths that will separate you from His Path. This has He ordained for you, that you may become pious</strong></span>.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 6:153]. And from that which there is no doubt about is that the multitude of sects and groups in the Islamic society is, firstly something desired by Shaytan, and secondly something desired by the enemies of Islam from amongst mankind. Since agreement and unification of the Muslims, and their being aware of the dangers which threaten them and their <em>&#8216;aqidah</em> (beliefs), will make them active in refuting and rebutting it, and acting in a unified manner for the benefit of the Muslims &#8211; thus repelling the danger from their religion, their lands and their brothers. And this is something which the enemies &#8211; from amongst mankind and jinn &#8211; are not pleased with. Therefore they are very eager to split-up the Muslims, destroy their unity and to sow the seeds of enmity and discord between them. We ask Allah that He unites the Muslims upon the truth and that He removes from their society every type of misguidance and every cause of discord. Indeed He is the One Who is able to do that, and He is the One having full power over it.</p>

<strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is the requirement for offering the fixed Sunnah prayers removed during travel, and (if so) what is the evidence for this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prescribed for one to leave the fixed Sunnah prayers during travel, except <em>Witr</em> and the Sunnah of <em>Fajr</em>. It has been authentically reported from the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) in the Hadith of Ibn Umar and others, that the Prophet would not pray the fixed Sunnah prayers while travelling, except <em>Witr</em> and the Sunnah of <em>Fajr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the supererogatory prayer, they are prescribed during travel and while one is resident, and likewise the prayers for whose performance there is a reason, such as the Sunnah of <em>Wudhu</em>, <em>Tawaf</em>, <em>Adh-Dhuha</em>, and <em>Tahajjud</em> prayer at night, based upon <em>Hadiths</em> which have been narrated to that effect. And Allaah is the Granter of success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The correct opinion is that <strong>nutritive injections break the Sawm if taken deliberately</strong>. However, this does not apply to ordinary injections which are solely medical. May Allah grant us success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q 11: What is the ruling on having injection during the daytime in Ramadan, whether for nutrition or treatment?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is permissible for a person observing Sawm (Fast) to be treated by injections, whether intravenous or intramuscular, during the day in Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not permissible to have nutritive injections</strong></span>, as they come under the same ruling as having food and drinks.Thus, taking them is considered a trick to break Sawm in Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is possible to have the intravenous or intramuscular injections during the night, it will be better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the proper manner of announcing Adhan (call to Prayer)?<br />
What is your opinion concerning the additions people use after the Adhan?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The proper manner of announcing the Adhan is the way taught by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to his followers. Bilal (رضي الله عنه) used to announce the Adhan in the presence of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) till the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) died. He used to announce the Adhan during the Makkan period and at Al-Madinah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Adhan that we announce today which consists of fifteen phrases:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>ٱللهُ أَكْبَر ٱللهُ أَكْبَر<br />
Allah-u-Akbar, Allah-u-Akbar,<br />
Allah-u-Akbar, Allah-u-Akbar</strong><br />
(Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest.<br />
Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله, أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله<br />
Ashhadu An La Ilaha Illa Allah,<br />
Ashhadu An La Ilaha Illa Allah</strong><br />
(I bear witness that there is no god but Allah.<br />
I bear witness that there is no god but Allah);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ ٱلله, أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ ٱلله<br />
Ashhadu Anna Muhammad-an Rasul-ul-llah,<br />
Ashhadu Anna Muhammad-an Rasul-ul-llah</strong><br />
(I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.<br />
I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلصَّلَوَة, حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلصَّلَوَة<br />
Hayy `Ala as-Salah, Hayy `Ala as-Salah</strong><br />
(Come to Prayer. Come to Prayer);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلْفَلَاح, حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلْفَلَاح<br />
Hayy `Ala al-Falah, Hayy `Ala al-Falah</strong><br />
(Come to success. Come to success);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>ٱللهُ أَكْبَر, ٱللهُ أَكْبَر<br />
Allah-u-Akbar, Allah-u-Akbar</strong><br />
(Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله<br />
La ilaha illa Allah</strong><br />
(There is none worthy of worship but Allah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Adhan that Bilal used to announce in the presence of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) till he died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in Fajr (Dawn) Prayer, he added:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">ٱلصَّلَوةُ خَيْرٌ مِن النَّوم<br />
<strong>As-Salatu Khayr-un Mina an-Nawm</strong><br />
(Salah is better than sleeping),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">twice after his saying: Hayy `Ala al-Falah (Come to success), and before saying: Allah-u-Akbar (Allah is the Greatest).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what some people used to add as:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">حَيَّ عَلَى خَيْرٌ الْعَمَل<br />
Hayy `Ala Khayr al-`Amal<br />
(Come to best of deed),</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">or</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ عَلِيًّا وَلِي ٱلله<br />
Ashhadu Anna `Aly-an Waliy-ul-llah<br />
(I bear witness that `Aly is the Waliy of Allah),</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">is an <span style="color:#ff0000;">evil deed and Bid`ah (innovation in religion) introduced by Shi`ah (Shi&#8217;ites)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible, neither, to offer peace and blessings upon the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) audibly directly after the Adhan. This is a Bid`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is commendable for a Muslim, after announcing the Adhan, to ask Allah to bestow peace and blessings upon the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). Then say:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ هَذِهِ الدَّعْوَةِ التَّامَّةِ، وَالصَّلَاةِ الْقَائِمَةِ، آتِ مُحَمَّداً الْوَسِيلَةَ وَالْفَضِيلَةَ، وَابْعَثْهُ مَقَاماً مَحْمُوداً الَّذِي وَعَدْتَهُ</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;O Allah! Lord of this perfect call (perfect by not ascribing partners to You) and of the prayer which is going to be established, give Muhammad the right of intercession and illustriousness, and raise him to the best and the highest place in Paradise which You promised. Surely, You do not renege Your promise.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doing so is commendable for every Muslim whether male or female after the Adhan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is commendable also for the Mu&#8217;adhin (caller to Prayer), as any other person, to offer peace and blessings upon the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) after announcing Adhan. He should also recite: &#8220;O Allah! Lord of this perfect call and of the regular prayer which is going to be established, give Muhammad the right of intercession and illustriousness, and raise him to the best and the highest place in Paradise that You promised.&#8221; <span style="color:#ff0000;">But he should not say these words in a loud voice like the Adhan</span>. This is because the Adhan ends with saying: La ilaha illa Allah (There is no god but Allah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for the Mu&#8217;adhin to raise his voice in order to let others to hear and follow him. It was authentically reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;When you hear the Mu&#8217;adhin, repeat what he says, then invoke blessings on me, for everyone who invokes blessings on me will receive them tenfold from Allah; then beg from Allah Al-Wasilah for me, which is a rank in Paradise fitting for only one of Allah&#8217;s servants, and I hope that I will be that one. If anyone who asks that I be given the Al-Wasilah, he will be assured of my intercession.&#8221;<strong>  </strong></span>[#01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is was stated by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). (Related by Muslim in his Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (رضي الله عنه)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a Sunnah for both Mu&#8217;adhin and listener, whether male or female, everywhere after announcing the Adhan. All are to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;<strong>O Allah, bestow peace and blessings upon Muhammad</strong>!&#8221; or</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;<strong>O Allah, bestow peace and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and Companions</strong>!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">in a tone that differs from the Adhan&#8217;s and in a lower voice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should say: &#8220;O Allah! Lord of this perfect call and of the Prayer which is going to be established, grant Muhammad Al-Wasilah and illustriousness, and raise him to the best and the highest place (in Paradise) that You promised.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in Al-Bukhari&#8217;s Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir ibn Abdullah Al-Ansary that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Whoever says upon hearing the Adhan: &#8216;O Allah, Lord of this perfect call and of the established Prayer (Salah), grant Muhammad the Al-Wasilah and superiority, and raise him up to the praiseworthy position which You have promised&#8217;, <strong>it becomes incumbent upon me to intercede for him on the Day of Resurrection</strong>.&#8221;  </span>[#02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the Hadith reported from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). Al-Bayhaqy reported this addition:  &#8220;You do not break Your promise.&#8221;  with a Hasan chain of narrators. This is what is legally permitted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">As for increasing the Adhan by saying: &#8220;Come to the best deed&#8221;, &#8220;I bear witness that `Aly is the Waliy of Allah&#8221; or any other phrases is an evil deed and Bid`ah (innovation in Islam) that has no basis in Islam as mentioned earlier. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stated:  &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;">Whoever performs any act for which there is no sanction from our behalf, it is to be rejected</span>.&#8221; [#03] (Related by Muslim in his Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported also by Muslim in his Sahih on the authority of Jabir (رضي الله عنه) that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)  used to say during the Friday sermon: &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;">The best speech is embodied in the Book of Allah, and the best of guidance is the guidance given by Muhammad. And the most evil affairs are their innovations and every innovation is misguidance</span>.&#8221; [#04]  There are many Hadiths in this regard. Allah is the One Who grants success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><b>1330H-1420H: Imaam ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin Baaz</b></p>
<p>Author : BinBaz.Org.sa<br />
Source: BinBaz.Org.Sa [Abridged and with Additions]<br />
Produced By: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Name and Lineage:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was the noble and exemplary scholar, ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan bin Muhammad bin ‘Abdillaah Aali Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him. Baaz was a family that had deep roots in knowledge. business, and agriculture. They were known for their virtues and character. Shaikh Sulaymaan bin Hamdaan, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his book on the biographies of the Hanbalee scholars: “Their origin was in Madeenah, then one of their ancestors moved to Dur’eeyah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Birth and Early Youth:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in Riyadh, the capital city of Najd on the 12th of Dhul-Hijjah, 1330H. This is where he spent his childhood, adolescence and early adult years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz was raised in an environment engrossed in knowledge, since Riyadh at that time was filled with scholars and people of guidance. It was also a place of security and peace since King ‘Abdul-‘Azeez had re-conquered it and established justice there based on the laws of Islaam. This was after Riyadh had been a place of endless turmoil and instability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz first started by learning the Qur’aan as was the custom of the Salaf, who would memorize and master the Qur’aan before moving on to other subjects. So he memorized the entire Qur’aan by heart before reaching the age of puberty. He then went on to study at the hands of the scholars in his area.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also important to note that his mother, may Allaah have mercy on her, played a large role in his path towards knowledge, since she would be the one who would constantly encourage and incite him towards acquiring knowledge, as he stated towards the end of one of his lectures, “My journey with the writers”, in which he discussed some examples of his life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz had sight for the first part of his life. Then due to Allaah’s infinite wisdom, He willed that the Imaam’s sight weaken due to an eye disease in 1346H, which eventually lead to him completely losing his eyesight in 1350H when he was close to twenty years of age. However, this did not prevent him from his perseverance and diligence in seeking knowledge, which he continued to do and excel in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remarkably, losing his eyesight was a means of benefit for Imaam Ibn Baaz, since he was able to achieve several advantages of which we will mention four, as an example and not to limit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. Reward from Allaah:</b> Imaam Al-Bukhaaree reported in his Saheeh a hadeeth qudsee, in which Allaah said: <b>“If my servant is tested with losing his two beloved (eyes), I will substitute them with Paradise.”</b>[Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: no. 5653]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. Strong Memorization:</b> Imaam Ibn Baaz was the Haafidh (Memorizer) of this era when it came to Knowledge of Hadeeth. If you were to ask him on a hadeeth found in the Six Collections of Hadeeth or other collections such as the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad, you would find him well versed in the hadeeth’s chain of narration, textual wording, the scholars who spoke on it, its narrators and its explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3. Lack of Interest in Worldly Splendors:</b> Imaam Ibn Baaz refrained from chasing after the pleasures of the worldly life, living an abstentious and humble lifestyle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4. High Determination:</b> Losing sight, only made Imaam Ibn Baaz more determined and perseverant in his quest for seeking and acquiring knowledge, to the point that he became one of the senior scholars, known throughout the world. Allaah indeed replaced the light in his eyes with light in his heart, love for knowledge, and following of the Prophet’s Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Teachers:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After memorizing the Qur’aan, Imaam Ibn Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him, went on to study the other Islaamic sciences under many of the scholars of Riyadh, the most prominent of whom were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Lateef Aali Shaikh, the great-great grandson of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab,<br />
2. Shaikh Saalih bin ‘Abdil-‘Azeez Aali Shaikh, the great-great grandson of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab and the Chief Judge of Riyadh,<br />
3. Shaikh Sa’ad bin Hamad Al-‘Ateeq, Judge of Riyadh,<br />
4. Shaikh Hamad bin Faaris, Vice-Chancellor of the Treasury of Riyadh,<br />
5. Shaikh Sa’ad Waqqaas Al-Bukhaaree, from the scholars of Makkah whom he learned the science of Tajweed from in 1355H,<br />
6. Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh, former Chief Muftee of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He attended his study circles for about ten years, learning all of the Islamic sciences from him, from 1347H to 1357H, when his teacher nominated him to be a judge. May Allah have mercy on all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Educational Life:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Imaam Ibn Baaz was selected for being the Judge of the Kharj district, he accepted it unwillingly since he had no desire or love for position. But it was due to the encouragement of his teacher, Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh, and the order of King ‘Abdul-‘Azeez that he took up the position. So he went to ad-Dalam, the capital city of the Kharj district at that time, and the people greeted him warmly. As soon as he got out of the car that transported him there, he ascended the Central Mosque and prayed two rak’at, in accordance with the Sunnah. Then he rested for a while in the presence of the Ameer of ad-Dalam at that time, Naasir bin Sulaymaan al-Huqbaanee, may Allaah have mercy on him. Thereafter the people gathered around him and so he gave them a profound admonition. From the things he told them was that he had no desire to be the Judge of their district but that he was ordered and so he must obey the leader.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As soon as he commenced working at his position, Allaah brought much good through his hands and he judged the people with justice and kindness. He served in this position for a little over fourteen years. During this time, the Kharj district became a place of good and uprightness. Imaam Ibn Baaz would attribute this success to the good hearts of the people and their high esteem for virtue and justice. Because the courts were in ad-Dalam, he lived there in the Judge’s Residence given to him by Imaam ‘Abdullaah bin Faysal bin Turkee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz was well known throughout the Muslim world for his religious verdicts (<i>fataawaa</i>) and his beneficial books. He would preside over committees for educational seminars in Saudi Arabia, and give various lectures over the telephone to Muslims outside of the Kingdom. He would also answer the questions of the people over the radio and during the blessed times of Hajj and Ramadaan. And his words would appear in Muslim newspapers, magazines, and articles throughout the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Books and Treatises:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though the Imaam was pressed for time as a result of his duties and role in giving da’wah and educating, he still made time to write books and treatises that addressed important issues, which the Muslims were in need of knowledge of. Amongst his most famous works were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Obligation of Following the Sunnah<br />
2. The Ideological Attack<br />
3. The Life and Call of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab<br />
4. Three Treatises on the Prayer<br />
5. The Correct Belief and what Opposes It<br />
6. Important Lessons for the Muslim Ummah<br />
7. A Criticism of Arab Nationalism<br />
8. The Dangers of Tabarruj<br />
9. Two Essays on Fasting and Zakaat<br />
10. The Ruling on Pictures<br />
11. The Ruling on Celebrating the Prophet’s Birthday<br />
12. A Warning against Innovations</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many more books, which can be read and printed at the Imaam’s official web site binbaz.org.sa. This was in addition to his many fataawaa (religious verdicts) that were collected, compiled and published, which range in numerous volumes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Educational and Religious Positions:</b><br />
1. He served as a Judge in the Kharj District of Saudi Arabia for fourteen years from 1357H to 1371H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He taught at the Educational Institute of Riyadh in 1372H and in the College of Sharee’ah after its inception in 1373H, covering the subjects of Fiqh, Tawheed and Hadeeth. He remained in this teaching position for nine years until 1380H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. In 1381H, he was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the Islamic University of Madeenah, where he served until 1390H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. He was then appointed as the Chancellor of the Islamic University of Madeenah in 1390H, after its former Chancellor, Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh died in Ramadaan of 1389H. He remained in this position until 1395H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. In 10/14/1395H, the King ordered that Imaam Ibn Baaz be appointed as Head of the Council for Islamic Research, Verdicts, Da’wah and Guidance. He held this position until 1414H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. In 1/20/1414H, the King appointed Imaam Ibn Baaz as the Chief Muftee of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He held this position along with being the Head of the Council of Senior Scholars and the Head of the Committee for Islamic Research and Verdicts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>He also held the following positions:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Head of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Verdicts,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. President and Member of the Founding Committee for the Muslim World League,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. President of the higher World League Council,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. President of the World Supreme Council for Mosques,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. President of the Islamic Fiqh Assembly in Makkah, which is under the Muslim World League,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Member of the Higher Council of the Islamic University of Madeenah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Member of the Supreme Committee for Islamic Propagation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Students:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him, had numerous students that would attend his classes and study circles. The most famous and distinguished among them were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen, former member of the Council of Senior Scholars, may Allaah have mercy on him,<br />
2. ‘Abdullaah bin Hasan Al-Qu’ood, current member of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Fataawaa and of the Council of Senior Scholars,<br />
3. ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Ghudayyaan, current member of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Fataawaa and of the Council of Senior Scholars,<br />
4. ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad, former Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor of the Islamic University of Madeenah,<br />
5. Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, current member of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Fataawaa and of the Council of Senior Scholars,<br />
6. Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee,<br />
7. ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah Ar-Raajihee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Physical Attributes and Appearance:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, was of medium build, and neither tall nor short. He had a round face and was of a golden-brown color. He had a curved nose and a beard that was short on the cheeks but thick below the chin. His beard used to be black, but when too many white hairs started showing, he dyed it with henna. Indeed, his description resembled that of many of the scholars before him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a beautiful appearance. He would always try to wear white garments, and would love wide clothes, and thawbs that would reach the middle of his shin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Humility and Piety:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imaam knew his own worth and so he would be very humble before Allaah. So he would treat the people in a kind manner, with gentleness and mercy. He would not transgress over anyone or show arrogance to anyone. He would not give a false impression of grandness nor would he get up to the leave when in the company of the poor and needy, or refrain from walking and intermingling with them. He would also never turn away from listening to the advice of those who were below him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also showed his humbleness was that he would answer the invitation of his students and close friends to come to their wedding gatherings. He would always arrive early and ask one of the brothers to recite some <i>ayaat</i> from the Qur’aan, which he would then go on to explain to everyone present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Death:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz passed away on Thursday, the 27th of Muharram, 1420H (5/13/1999), due to heart failure. He was 89 years old at the time. Millions of people throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia gathered to witness his funeral prayer and he was buried in the ‘Adl Cemetery in Makkah. Muslims throughout the world mourned his loss and it was only a few months later that the Muslim world would lose another great scholar, Imaam Al-Albaanee, may Allaah have mercy on them both.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#993300;">[A question asked by a fellow Muslim, and His Eminence replied on 9/2/1415 A.H., no. Sh/1179]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To His Eminence, Shaykh `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, the Grand Mufty (Islamic scholar qualified to issue legal opinions) of Saudi Arabia, may Allah protect him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As you know, this year the 9th of Muharram was on Saturday, and the 10th was on Sunday, according to the Makkan calendar. Acting upon the Hadith that states: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If I live until next year, I will perform Sawm (Fasting) on the 9th and 10th (of Muharram) </strong>[1]</span> I performed Sawm on Saturday and Sunday. However, one of my Muslim brothers objected to my Sawm on Saturday, and told me that it is forbidden to perform a voluntary Sawm on Saturdays, based on a Hadith, which he said its meaning and not its text. Due to my desire for clarifying this matter, and acting upon the Words of Allah (Exalted be He): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So ask the people of the Scripture, if you do not know</strong></span>. [2] I would like Your Eminence to clarify this ambiguity, mentioning the Hadith and the degree of its authenticity, and advise me on this matter. May Allah protect you. [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Wa `alaykum as-salam warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you too).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith he mentioned is well-known and included in: &#8220;Bulugh Al-Maram&#8221;, in the Chapter on Sawm. However, it is a Hadith Da`if (a Hadith that fails to reach the status of Hasan, due to a weakness in the chain of narration or one of the narrators) and Shadh (a Hadith narrated by a trustworthy narrator, not in line with the narration of other trustworthy narrators in terms of wording, chain of narrators, or both), and contradicts the Hadith Sahih (Hadith that have been transmitted by people known for their uprightness and exactitude; free from eccentricity and blemish) such as the next one in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do not perform Sawm on Fridays, unless you perform Sawm on the day before it or the day after it. </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">[4]</span> It is known that the day that follows Friday is Saturday. Also, the Hadith, which is mentioned in the Two Sahih Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to perform Sawm on Saturdays and Sundays, saying: “They are feast days for the Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), and I like to do the opposite of them</strong></span>. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths that carry the same meaning, and they all show the permissibility of voluntary Sawm on Saturday.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. A<span style="font-size:1rem;">s-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.</span></p>

<p><em>Posted with kind permission from <strong>Dawud Burbank</strong> rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Commentary from Shaykh Ibn Baz : ( from </strong><a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=94&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14"><strong>alifta.net</strong></a>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This restriction should be considered. A disbeliever embraces Islam on the pronunciation of the Two Shahadahs (Testimonies of Faith) if he has not already pronounced them. If he has already pronounced them, he re-embraces Islam by Tawbah (repentance to Allah) for the cause for his disbelief. He may get out of the fold of Islam for many reasons other than ingratitude, as indicated by scholars in the Chapter on the Ruling on the Murtad (Apostate). Such causes include blasphemy against Islam or the Prophet, peace be upon him, or making a mockery of Allah, His Messenger, Book, or anything of His Shar` (Law) for Allah, Exalted be He, says: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say, &#8216;Is it Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?&#8217; Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after you had believed.</em></span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the causes for disbelief is idolatry, supplicating to the dead, making Istighathah (beseeching for help) to them and the like, for this contradicts the testimony of &#8220;There is none worthy of Worship except Allah,&#8221; which indicates that worship is an exclusive right of Allah Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other causes for disbelief are making Du`a&#8217; (supplication), Istighathah, Ruku` (bowing), Sujud (Prostration), slaughtering, making a vow, and the like to something other than Allah. He who does any of these things to something other than Allah, including idols, angels, Jinn (creatures created from fire), the dead, and other creatures, commits Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and does not act upon the testimony of &#8220;There is none worthy of Worship except Allah&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All such acts bring one out of the fold of Islam, according to the Ijma` (consensus of scholars) of the scholars. These are not merely acts of ingratitude. The evidence for this is derived from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet. There are many other acts that cause a Muslim to be declared a disbeliever and they are not then merely acts of ingratitude. Such acts are cited by the scholars in the Chapter on the Ruling on the Murtad. So you can refer to them. May Allah grant us success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Book on Talaq</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">125- Talaq which complies with the Sunnah and ruling on uttering the divorce three times in one session or in case of anger</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz to the respected brother; may Allah grant you success! Amen.<br />
As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kindly be informed that I have read your letter which contains some questions. They are answered as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 1: What is the prescribed way of Talaq (divorce pronounced by a husband) in the light of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The prescribed way is that the husband declares the divorce one time when his wife is pregnant or in a state of purity and he has not engaged in any sexual relations with her. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#339966;"><em>O Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)! When you divorce women, divorce them at their ‘Iddah (prescribed periods)</em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) on the authority of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) that the latter divorced his wife when she was menstruating. `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) about his son’s action to which he replied: Command him to take her back, and keep her till she is purified, then has another period, then is purified. If he wishes he may keep her and if he wishes he may divorce her before having sexual intercourse, for that is the `Iddah (woman&#8217;s prescribed waiting period after divorce or widowhood) which Allah commanded for the divorce of a woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another report narrated by Muslim from the Prophet (peace be upon him) reads: Then he can divorce her when she is pure (not menstruating) or pregnant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 2: Is declaring Talaq three times in the same session regarded as one divorce or three divorces?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Three divorces uttered at the same time is only to be counted as one according to the soundest view of scholars. It was authentically reported in Sahih Muslim on the authority of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that the (pronouncement) of three divorces during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) and that of Abu Bakr and for two years of the caliphate of `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) was deemed as one time of divorce. Then, `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, &#8220;People hasten in a matter in which they are required to observe respite. So, it is recommended to impose it upon them,&#8221; and he imposed it upon them. It is evident that the divorce in this way is counted as a threefold divorce according to Ijtihad (juristic effort to infer expert legal rulings) made by `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). Yet, it is better to follow the authentic Sunnah than following Ijtihad made by `Umar or others for the benefit of the Muslims. This is supported by the report narrated by Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his Musnad through an authentic Sanad (chain of narrators) from Ibn `Abbas that Abu Rukanah made three pronouncements of divorce and later regretted. So, he went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) who returned his wife to him, and said: It is one divorce.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 3: In a state of rage, a husband said to his wife: &#8220;I divorce you thrice.&#8221; He later regretted and wants to take her back.What is the ruling on this act?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: According to the most correct opinion of scholars, <strong>Talaq is not effected if it is declared &#8211; once or thrice &#8211; in a fit of anger.</strong> They have to prove the claim that the apparent state which caused divorce is true. On the other hand, when anger is so intense that a person is no longer aware of what he is doing or saying, the divorce is not effected according to Ijma` (consensus of scholars). In this case, he is like one who is insane and one who has lost all power of reason due to unintentional drunkenness. Uttering divorce in a state of intentional drunkenness does not become effective due to loss of reason. `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) issued a Fatwa that supported this view and it was followed by a group of people of knowledge, because it was based on Shar`y (Islamically lawful) evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to guide all Muslims to understanding the religion and holding fast to it, for He is the One Who is capable to do so. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I have received your noble letter, may Allah be pleased with you. I have also reviewed the enclosed documents on the properties of the copper bracelet recently made to cure rheumatism. I have considered the whole matter more than once and discussed it with a number of university lecturers. We exchanged opinions on the juristic ruling on the copper bracelet in question, but there were different opinions on the matter; some regard it permissible as it has properties of curing rheumatism, whereas others see that it is better not to wear it, on the ground that wearing it is like the practice of the people of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance), who used to wear copper amulets and bracelets, thinking that they were a cure for many diseases and a reason for the safety of the person wearing them against envy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who wears an amulet, Allah will not fulfill their need, and anyone who wears a seashell, Allah will not give them peace</span>. [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another narration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who hangs an amulet has committed Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). </span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imran ibn Al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) also narrated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) saw a man with a brass bracelet on his hand. He (peace be upon him) asked him, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; The man replied, &#8216;A protection from weakness.&#8217; He (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;Cast it off, for verily it will only increase your weakness; and if you die wearing it, you will never succeed.&#8217; </span>[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another Hadith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) in one of his journeys sent a messenger to check the camels of the caravan, and ordered the cutting of all string necklaces hung around the necks of the camels which were thought by the people of Jahiliyyah to benefit and protect their camels. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Hadiths and others show that a Muslim must not wear amulets, bracelets, strings, bones, beads or other things that are used by some people to prevent or remove evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In my opinion, it is better not to wear or use this copper bracelet to block any means to Shirk, and to not let the heart be attached to such things, and to direct Muslims with their hearts toward Allah Alone trustingly and confidently, and to restrict oneself to lawful means that are indisputably permissible. Surely, what Allah has made lawful and accessible is sufficient and dispenses with any need for what is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who guards themselves against doubtful matters keeps their religion and honor blameless, and anyone who indulges in doubtful matters indulges in unlawful matters, just as a shepherd who pastures his animals around a sanctuary will soon (transgress upon it and) pasture them in it. </span>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Leave what causes you doubt and turn to what does not cause you doubt. </span>[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Undoubtedly, wearing a copper bracelet is similar to what was practiced by the people of Jahiliyyah. Wearing it constitutes either a prohibited matter of Shirk or a means leading to Shirk or at least a doubtful matter.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is better for a Muslim not to wear it and resort to lawful medical treatment. This is the opinion that seems correct to a group of scholars, shaykhs, and myself as well with regard to this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah (Exalted be He) to guide you and us to what pleases Him, grant us good understanding of His Religion, and protect us against all that opposes His Laws. Indeed, He is Able to do all things. May Allah safeguard you. As-salamu `alaykum.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>From the ideologies of disbelief that contradict the authentic Creed and oppose what the messengers came with is:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What the <strong>atheists</strong> of this era believe in, such as the followers of <strong>Marx</strong>, <strong>Lenin</strong> and others who call to atheism and disbelief, regardless of whether they call that <strong>socialism</strong>, <strong>communism</strong>, <strong>ba’athism</strong> or any other name, for indeed from the base principles of these atheists is the belief that there is no god and that life is only (based on) matter. And from their principles is to reject the Day of Final Return, Paradise, Hellfire, and to disbelieve in all of the religions. Whoever examines their books and studies what beliefs they were upon will come to know that with full certainty. No doubt this belief is in contradiction to all of the heavenly revealed religions and leads its followers to the worst of fates in this world and the Hereafter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Q: What is the opinion of your Eminence regarding the opinion of the one who says that Sawm in the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah is Bid`ah (innovation in religion)?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is an ignorant person who should be taught.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (peace be upon him)ordered that good deed should be done in them and fasting is one of the good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are no days during which the righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these ten days (i.e. The first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah)</strong></span>.&#8221; They asked him: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Messenger of Allah, not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah?</strong></span>&#8221; He (peace be upon him) replied: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah, except in case one goes forth with his life and his property and does not return with either of it.&#8221;</span></strong> Narrated by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih Book of Hadith. [1]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Though it is not certain whether the Prophet (peace be upon him) fasted them or not, yet it should be relied on what the Prophet said because saying is much more significant than practice. When saying is accompanied by practice, this will affirm the Sunnah. The Sunnah of the Prophet are divided into saying, practice, and approving. Though each of them forms the Sunnah, the saying is the most significant and strong of them. Then, the practice comes next and then approval follows.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are no days during which the righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these days</strong></span>.&#8221; [2] By these days the Prophet means the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. Thus, if one fasts or gives to charity during them, one will be doing a great good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is ordained during these days also to recite Takbir (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;), Tahmid (saying: &#8220;Al-hamdu lillah [All praise is due to Allah]&#8221;), and Tahlil (saying: &#8220;La ilaha illa Allah [There is no god except Allah]&#8221;) because he (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;There are no days that are greater before Allah or in which good deeds are more beloved to Him than these ten days, so recite a great deal of Tahlil, Takbir, and Tahmid during them</strong></span>.&#8221;[3]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q1: In this country, car insurance is mandatory by law. If a one has a car accident, is it permissible to submit a claim for the car repairs on the insurance?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If it is compulsory and a person has no choice, they should not take more than what they paid because this is a form of gambling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if a person pays ten thousands to an insurance company, they should only take ten thousands only and if they pay four thousands, they should take four thousands only; for it is not permissible to accept any profit. If one receives an additional amount it should given it in charity.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 &#8211; Reading Star Signs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Salih Alaa ash &#8211; Shaykh -hafidhullaah- said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Whoever reads the page which contains star signs and he knows the star sign of when he was born, or he knows that star sign which is significant for him, and he reads the comments mentioned in that star sign then it is as if he has asked a soothsayer/fortune teller. So his prayer would not be accepted for forty days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he attests to it and believes in that star sign then he has disbelieved in that which was revealed to Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- . . .&#8217; (the Shaykh continues saying: ) &#8216;and if he brings home newspapers which contain these type of things then it is as if he brought a soothsayer / fortune teller into his house.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Tamheed Sharh Kitaab al Tawheed p. 349 ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2 &#8211; Watching Magical Acrobatic Stunts &amp; Circus Antics </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzaan -hafidhullaah- said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;It is not permissible to use magic in the form of acrobatic stunts or circus antics or anything similar to that. Like the one who pulls a car with his hair, or a car is driven over him and does not harm him. . . . . all of this is magical imagery, so it is not allowed to perform it or to be happy with it, nor to attract your friends to do this in front of Muslims. Because it is clear evil, it is obligatory to reject and terminate it and to cleanse the Muslim lands of it . . . if those who go to see magic in the form of acrobatic stunts even though they are not pleased with going to see them, they have carried out something which is prohibited and they are sinful for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If they are pleased with this and they know that this is done by magic then they have fallen into disbelief because of it.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Daroos fee sharh Nawaqid al Islaam p. 152-156]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 &#8211; Wearing an Engagement Ring</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This enters under the saying of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;Indeed incantations, amulets and Tiwalah [1] (a form of magic) are Shirk.&#8217;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Ahmad and Abu Dawood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Uthaymeen -rahimullaah &#8211; gave the example that an engagement ring is a Tiwalah and he explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If the people believe that it can benefit or harm, then with this intention it is from the minor Shirk, and even if this intention is not there &#8211; and this is highly unlikely that he does not have this intention &#8211; it is resemblance of the Christians since it is taken from them.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Al-Qawl al-Mufeed ala Kitaab al Tawheed 1 /228-229]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4 &#8211; Wearing Brass Bracelets to Battle Against Rheumatism</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh AbdulAziz Ibn Baz &#8211; rahimullaah &#8211; said regarding these type of bracelets after having exhausted all the evidences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The opinion which I hold in this issue is leaving these previously mentioned bracelets and not to use them; this is to block the path leading to Shirk, to terminate the aspect of any Fitnah with these bracelets and to incline to them, also that souls become attached to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in having the incentive in turning the Muslim with his heart to Allaah -Subhanahu- and to have trust in Him, and reliance on Him sufficing with the means which are in accordance with the Sharia&#8217; and their allowance is well known with committing Shirk.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Majmoo&#8217; Fatawa ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz vol.1 p.207]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>How to fight the Eastern and Western cultural invasion [1]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the gravest danger that Muslim societies are facing nowadays is the so-called cultural invasion with its different weapons, including all media means, printed and broadcast alike. Invaders have realized in the modern age that the old ways have become ineffective. Nations fight courageously to defend their religion, homelands and their heritage. Usurping by violence and terrorism is an inherently refused concept, especially in modern times after the spread of awareness among the people. The world has become like a small village and many organizations were established to defend the rights of nations, refuse political invasion, and claim the right to self-determination. Every nation has the right to have sovereignty over its own territory, invest its resources, and rule its territories according to its own standards. Nations also adopt different beliefs, creeds and ruling systems, which made invaders leave these countries after fierce, bloody wars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, before leaving those countries, the invaders thought of many ways and prepared many plots based on thorough investigation, full awareness of the aims and effectiveness of those plans, and the ways that should be followed to accomplish them. Their aims revolved around designing highly deceiving curriculums of weak ties with religion, focusing on spreading their culture and instilling in the souls of most of the people the admiration of their material achievements in different aspects of life. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When people, especially teenagers and young students, are impressed by this superficial brilliant achievements and inventions in the world, some of them who are totally impressed choose to complete their education in European and American universities</strong></span>. There they are surrounded with doubts and sorts of lusts systematically presented by orientalists and atheists, using well-organized, perverted, cunning schemes, where they face the Western lifestyle with all its corruption, dissolution and obscenity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rarely does a person remain safe from these weapons, being accompanied with enticement and lack of religion or authority. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>After completing their study and returning to their countries, those people assume important posts and become agents for the colonialists and apply their demands and implement their plots precisely, even with harsher means than those used by the colonialists themselves</strong></span>. This has taken place, indeed, in many countries that were occupied by invaders. The way to safety from this danger lies in establishing universities and institutes in different specializations, in order to limit the missions abroad and teach all forms of knowledge in all universities and institutes. This should be accompanied with paying attention to Islamic subjects and culture, in order to keep the `Aqidah (creed) of the students intact, and protect their morals and future, so that they take part in building their society on a Shari`ah (Islamic law) basis and according to the needs of the Islamic Ummah (nation). We should restrict educational missions abroad to certain forms of knowledge that are not available at home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah guide us to all what benefits the people and the countries, and protects the Muslims against anything that might harm them in their `Aqidah and morals. He is the Most Generous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, <strong>we need to take more care of curricula, add a perfect Islamic touch to them, and establish more scientific institutions to help the people study at home instead of traveling abroad</strong>. <strong>We should also choose teachers and managers perfectly; all of them should be of good morals, sound `Aqidah, reputation, jealousy on Islam, power and honesty.</strong> Whoever enjoys these traits is guaranteed and will most probably do their best to explain information to the students in a correct way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if it is a necessity to send some students to learn abroad due to the lack of some professional institutions, especially in the field of industry, an objective committee should be formed to choose the most suitable students in terms of religion and morals and who are well-versed in Islamic culture and have an Islamic spirit. The committee can also choose a knowledgeable, righteous supervisor, who is active in practicing Da`wah (calling to Islam), to accompany the mission, practices Da`wah there, supervises and guides the students, and refutes any doubts they may come across.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They should be given even a short course before traveling to be aware of all the problems they might encounter abroad</strong>, and clarify the Shari`ah viewpoint and wisdom behind such issues according to the Qur&#8217;an, the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet), and the opinions of scholars. This includes, for instance, the rulings on slavery, polygyny in general, polygyny of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in particular, Talaq (divorce pronounced by a husband), the wisdom behind both offensive and defensive Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah), and such doubts that are mentioned by the enemies of Allah to Muslim youths, so that they would be fully ready to refute any such issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for facing the invasion of print and broadcast media, which have afflicted the Muslim Ummah in the modern age and have come to occupy most of the time of Muslims in spite of the deadly poison and the misleading promotion they usually contain, it is one of the most important tasks to protect Islam and the Islamic culture from its evil plotting. We should make sure that the Du`ah (callers to Islam) dedicate themselves to writing useful researches, periodicals and articles; practicing Da`wah, replying to different forms of cultural invasion and exposing their falsehood. The enemies have dedicated all their resources and potentials, founded many organizations and applied different means to deceive Muslims. Their misconceptions should be refuted and Islamic `Aqidah, legislation, rulings and morals should be clarified and explained in a nice, attractive way using suitable modern ways; wisdom and good discourse of preaching, arguing in a gentle way via all mass media as much as possible. Islam is the perfect religion that encompasses all goodness, guarantees happiness to all people, good progress, sound development, peace, security, prosperous life and winning in this world and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims are afflicted by all this as they do not stick to their religion as they should have, with most of the people not understanding its reality, because of being not interested; ignorant of it; negligent of many scholars in clarifying its advantages, wisdoms and secrets; lack of honesty and patience in inviting others to it; and not bearing harm and using the modern ways. Thus, discrepancy took place. Most of the people have become ignorant of the Islamic rulings. They have become deluded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that the last generation of this Ummah will not succeed except with what brought success to the first generation &#8211; that is, to follow the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) to these idolaters (pagan Arabs) of your folk:] </strong><strong>Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord (the Qur’ân and Prophet Muhammad’s Sunnah), and follow not any Auliyâ’ (protectors and helpers who order you to associate partners in worship with Allâh), besides Him (Allâh). Little do you remember! </strong>[Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And verily, this </strong>(i.e. Allâh’s Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses 151 and 152)<strong> is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqûn </strong>(the pious &#8211; see V.2:2)<strong>.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>And this is a blessed Book (the Qur’ân) which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allâh (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you may receive mercy (i.e. be saved from the torment of Hell). </strong>[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), Who is the Most Truthful, has promised us a great victory and successful outcome in return for this in His Statement: &#8230;and<strong> (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them). </strong>[Surah Al­Rum, 30: 47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaqûn [the pious &#8211; See V.2:2], not the least harm will their cunning do to you. Surely, Allâh surrounds all that they do. </strong>[Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 120]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieves after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).</strong>[Surah Al-Nur, 24: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm</strong>.[Surah Muhammad, 47: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) in this regard. When the Salaf (righteous predecessors) applied these noble Ayahs, whether in words, actions, or beliefs, Allah granted them victory over their enemies, made them rulers of the world, spread justice through them, and made them leaders of the Ummah and Imams of guidance. When the latter generations faltered in this (Allah&#8217;s Orders) their conditions declined, according to Allah&#8217;s Statement: <strong>Verily, Allâh will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allâh).</strong>[Surah Al-Ra`d, 13: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah make the Muslims, whether people or governments, return to their faith in a proper way; grant them comprehension of it, cause them to apply it, make them unanimous on Al-Haqq (the Truth), guide them to cooperation in righteousness and piety, and enjoining each other to Al-Haqq and persevering upon it. He is the All-Hearing, Ever Near. May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

<h3 id="h1-introduction" style="text-align:justify;">Introduction</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah, we praise Him, and seek His help and forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah, the Most High, from the evils of our own selves and from our wicked deeds. Whomsoever has been guided by Allah, none can misguide him, and whomsoever has been misguided by Allah, none can guide him. I bear witness that there is no true god worthy of being worshipped except Allah, alone, without partner or associate. I further bear witness that Muhammad is His true slave and Messenger. May Allah, the Exalted, bestow His peace and blessings on the final Prophet Muhammad, upon his good and pure family, and upon all of his noble companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="quran">&#8220;O you who believe! Fear Allah (by doing all that He ordered and abstaining from all that He has forbidden) as He should be feared, and die not except in the state of Islam (as Muslims with complete submission to Allah).&#8221;</span></strong></span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 3:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="quran">&#8220;O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (&#8216;Adam) and from him He created his wife, and from them both He created many men and women; and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and (do no cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allah is ever an All Watcher over you.&#8221;</span></strong></span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 4:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="quran">&#8220;O you who believe!

The worst of evils are innovations (foreign to the true teachings of Islam), and every innovated matter (in religion) is a <em>bid&#8217;ah</em>, and every <em>bid&#8217;ah</em> is a misguidance, and every mean of misguidance is in the Fire of Hell.</p>

<h3 id="h2-the-first-lesson-memorise-the-small-chapters-of-the-qur-an" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The First Lesson &#8211; Memorise the Small Chapters of the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Memorizing the opening <em>surah</em> (chapter) of the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em>, <em>al-Fatihah</em> (the Opening) and some short passages and chapters from No. 99 (<em>az-Zalzalah</em>) to 114 (<em>an-Nas</em>). Every Muslim must make an effort to memorize, recite and understand passages and/or chapters from the Noble <em>Qur&#8217;an</em>.</p>
<h3 id="h3-the-second-lesson-the-conditions-of-the-shahadah" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Second Lesson &#8211; The Conditions of the <em>Shahadah</em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing the meaning and the conditions of the declaration of <em>ash-shahadatan</em> that, &#8220;There is no true God except Allah, and that Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, is the Messenger of Allah&#8221;. The phrase that &#8220;there is no true God&#8221; negates anything or anyone that is being worshipped other than Allah, and the phrase, &#8220;except Allah&#8221;, confirms that all forms of worship, submission and adoration must be for Allah Alone, without setting up rivals with Him. The conditions needed to fulfill the meaning of <em>ash-shahadatan</em> are:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Knowledge about what it means;</li>
<li>Certainty about its meaning which dispels doubts and suspicions;</li>
<li>Sincerity that purifies its declarer from any form of <em>shirk</em> (association);</li>
<li>Honesty which negates hypocrisy;</li>
<li>Love and attachment to the declaration of <em>ash-shahadatan</em>, which leads to the dispel of uneasiness, dislike, or hate to what it implies;</li>
<li>Adherance &#8211; conducting what Allah has decreed regarding His worship;</li>
<li>Accepting to obey Allah by this declaration; and</li>
<li>Dissociating from anything or anyone being worshipped other than Allah.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h4-the-third-lesson-the-six-fundamentals-of-faith" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Third Lesson &#8211; The Six Fundamentals of Faith</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The six fundamental articles of faith are:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Believing in Allah (His Oneness);</li>
<li>His Angels;</li>
<li>All of His Messengers;</li>
<li>All of His Scriptures (in their original and unaltered forms);</li>
<li>In the Last Day (of Judgment); and</li>
<li>Fate and Divine Decree (whether good or bad), which Allah Has measured and ordained according to His previous Knowledge and as deemed suitable by His Wisdom.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h5-the-fourth-lesson-what-is-tawhid-and-shirk" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Fourth Lesson &#8211; What is <em>Tawhid</em> and <em>Shirk</em>?</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tawhid</em> (Faith in the Unity of Allah) is divided into three articles:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Believing in the Oneness of Allah in the sense of His being the only Creator, Preserver, Nourisher, etc. This belief is called <em>tawhid ar-rububiyah</em>;</li>
<li>Acknowledging that Allah Alone is the One and Only true God who deserves to be worshipped and thus abstaining from worshipping any other being or thing. This belief is called <em>tawhid al-uluhiyah</em>; and</li>
<li>Having faith and belief in the Oneness of Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes. This belief is called <em>tawhid al-asma was-sifat</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>shirk</em> (associating anything or anyone in worship with Allah), it is divided into three types:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Major <em>shirk</em> (<em>ash-shirk al-akbar</em>) which Allah does not forgive. Allah says regarding <em>shirk</em>:<span class="quran">&#8220;But if they had joined in worship others with Allah, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 6: 88]<span class="quran">&#8220;It is not for the <em>mushrikin</em> (polytheists) to maintain the Mosques of Allah (i.e. to pray and worship Allah therein, to looking after their cleanness and their building, etc.), while they witness against their ownselves of disbelief. The works of such bear no fruit, and in fire shall they dwell.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 9:17]The one who associate others with Allah and dies on this <em>shirk</em> will not be forgiven and<em>Jannah</em> (Paradise) is forbidden to him, as Allah, <em>Most Mighty and Honored</em>, says:<span class="quran">&#8220;Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him in worship, but He forgives anything else, to whom He pleases; and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em>4:48]<span class="quran">&#8220;Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, then Allah has forbidden the <em>Jannah</em> for him.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 5:72]Asking the dead or idols for help, slaughtering for them and making vows for them are examples of this <em>shirk</em>.</li>
<li>Minor <em>shirk</em> (<em>ash-shirk al-asgar</em>) which is stated in the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> or in the Prophet&#8217;s tradition but is not the same as major <em>shirk</em>. <em>Riya</em> (showing off) and swearing by other than Allah are examples of this kind of <em>shirk</em>. Prophet Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, said:<span class="hadith">&#8220;Of which I fear for you the most is minor shirk.&#8221;</span> When he was asked what was it, he said, <span class="hadith">&#8220;Riya.&#8221;</span>He, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, also said, <span class="hadith">&#8220;He who swears by anything other than Allah commits minor <em>shirk</em>.&#8221;</span>The Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, also warned, <span class="hadith">&#8220;Do not say, &#8216;Had Allah and such and such (person) willed&#8217;, but say, &#8216;Had Allah then such and such (person) willed.&#8217; &#8220;</span>. This kind of <em>shirk</em> does not necessarily lead to disbelief from Islam or an eternal stay in Hell. It negates, however, the completeness of faith.</li>
<li>Hidden <em>shirk</em>. Prophet Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, explained, <span class="hadith">&#8220;Shall I not tell you of which I fear for you more than I fear of the Antichrist?&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;Yes, O Messenger of Allah&#8221;, and he said, <span class="hadith">&#8220;Hidden shirk, where one beautifies his way of praying only because another one is looking at him.&#8221;</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Alternatively, <em>shirk</em> could be divided into two kinds &#8211; major and minor. In this case, the hidden<em>shirk</em> encompasses both the major and minor kinds depending upon the act committed. It is major if it is the same as the <em>shirk</em> of the hypocrites who hide their false beliefs while showing off Islam out of fear. It is minor if it is the same as <em>riya</em>.</p>
<h3 id="h6-the-fifth-lesson-the-five-pillars-of-islam" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Fifth Lesson &#8211; The Five Pillars of Islam</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The five pillars of Islam are <em>ash-shahadatan</em> (bearing witness that there is none worthy of being worshipped except Allah and that Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, is His Messenger), establishing prayers, paying the alms (<em>zakah</em>), fasting the month of <em>Ramadhan</em>, and performing pilgrimage (<em>Hajj</em>) if one can afford it.</p>
<h3 id="h7-the-sixth-lesson-the-nine-conditions-of-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Sixth Lesson &#8211; The Nine Conditions of Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The nine conditions of prayers are Islam, sanity, maturity, performing the ablution (<em>wudu</em>), cleanliness from impurities (on the body, clothes, and place of prayer), dressing properly, having the intention of prayers, facing the right direction of <em>qiblah</em> (direction of the <em>Ka&#8217;bah</em> at Makkah), and the praying at the proper time.</p>
<h3 id="h8-the-seventh-lesson-the-basic-elements-of-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Seventh Lesson &#8211; The Basic Elements of Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourteen basic elements (<em>arkan</em>) of prayers are standing (if one is able), saying <em>allahu akbar</em>(Allah is the Greatest), reading the opening <em>surah</em> of the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> (<em>al-Fatihah</em>), lowering the head and back down at the right angle (<em>ruku&#8217;</em>), resuming the initial standing position, prostrating with the toes of both feet, both knees, both hands and the forehead touching the ground (<em>sujud</em>), rising in a sitting position, a short rest in a sitting posture between the two prostrations, tranquility in all actions, performing the basic elements of prayer in order, the last <em>tashahud</em> (the second part), sitting for the last <em>tashahud</em>, exalting the Prophet Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, and turning the face to the right side and to the left one saying <em>as-salamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullah</em> (peace and mercy of Allah be upon you) one time on each side.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Note: <em>Salah</em> is invalid if any of the above is missing.)</p>
<h3 id="h9-the-eighth-lesson-the-obligatory-acts-of-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Eighth Lesson &#8211; The Obligatory Acts of Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eight obligatory acts of the prayer are all the occasions of saying <em>allahu akbar</em> other than<em>takbirat al-ihram</em> (which is basic); saying <em>samiallahuliman hamidah</em> (Allah accepts any who are thankful to Him) by the <em>Imam</em> as well as the one who is praying alone, and saying <em>rabbana wa laka al-hamd</em> (Our Lord, praise be to You) for both the <em>Imam</em> and the individual; saying <em>subhana rabbi al-athim</em> (Glory to my Lord, the Most Great) in <em>ruku</em>; saying <em>subhana rabbi al-a&#8217;la</em> (Glory to my Lord, the Most High) in <em>sujud</em>; saying <em>rabighfirli</em> (Oh my Lord, grant forgiveness to me) between the two prostrations; the first part (<em>at-tashahud al-awwal</em>); and sitting for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Note: if any of the above is missing, the Muslim needs to make <em>sujud al-sahw</em>).</p>
<h3 id="h10-the-ninth-lesson-the-contents-of-at-tashahud" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Ninth Lesson &#8211; The Contents of <em>At-Tashahud</em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing the contents of <em>at-tashahud</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First Part: <em>&#8220;At-tahiyyato lillahi was-salawatu wat-tayyibat. As-salamu alayka ayyuha an-nabi warahmatullahi wa barakatuh, as-salamu alayna wa ala ibadillahi as-salihin, ashadu an la ilaha illallah, wa ashadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Greetings, prayers ant the good things of life belong to Allah . Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the Mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peace be upon us all and on the righteous servants of Allah. I bear witness that there is no true God worthy of worship but Allah alone, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His true slave and Messenger.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second Part: <em>&#8220;Allahumma salli ala muhammad wa ala ali muhammad kama sallayta ala ibrahima wa ala ali ibrahim. Wa barik ala muhammad wa ala ali muhammad, kama barakta ala ibrahima wa ala ali ibrahim, innaka hamidon majid.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Oh Allah! Exalt Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as you did exalt Ibrahim (Abraham) and the family of Abraham. And bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as you did bless Abraham and the people of Abraham, verily You are the Most Praised, The Most Glorious.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the reciting of the <em>tashahud</em>, the slave asks Allah&#8217;s protection from the torment of Hell, the torment of the grave, the trials in life-time and after death, and from the impostor Anti-Christ. After that he may supplicate and ask Allah whatever he wishes, especially the type of invocation said by the Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="hadith">&#8220;O Allah help me to perform remembrance of You and to give all due thanks to You and allow me to worship you in the good way (i.e. as ordained by Allah and His Messenger). O Allah I have inflicted a great deal of wrong upon myself and there is none other than You who can offer forgiveness. Grant me forgiveness from You and grant me your Mercy. You are the All-Merciful, The Oft Forgiving.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3 id="h11-the-tenth-lesson-the-sunan-acts-of-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Tenth Lesson &#8211; The <em>Sunan </em>Acts of Prayer</span></h3>

<li>Reciting another passage from the Holy <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> after the opening <em>surah</em> of <em>al-Fatihah</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h12-the-eleventh-lesson-invalidation-of-the-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Eleventh Lesson &#8211; Invalidation of the Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any prayer is invalid and nullified if any of the following acts are committed &#8211; Intentional talking, laughing, eating, drinking, uncovering the parts of the body of which are not allowed to be uncovered during prayer, excessive alteration in the direction towards the <em>qiblah</em>, excessive moving outside the regular acts and movements of prayer, without a proper reason and nullifying the ablution.</p>
<h3 id="h13-the-twelfth-lesson-the-conditions-for-ablution" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Twelfth Lesson &#8211; The Conditions for Ablution</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ten conditions for performing ablution are:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Islam;</li>
<li>Sanity;</li>
<li>Maturity;</li>
<li>Intention;</li>
<li>&#8230; its continuity (i.e. the person should not intend to discontinue his ablution before its completion);</li>
<li>If one performs <em>istinja&#8217;</em> (cleaning the areas of natural discharges with water) or with stones, tissues, leaves etc. (<em>istijmar</em>) before ablution;</li>
<li>Water must be pure and <em>mubah</em> (i.e. it is not stolen or taken by force);</li>
<li>The removal of all things that prevent water from reaching the parts of ablution such as mud;</li>
<li>Those who continually lose their ablution (for example due to release of gas, urine, or any reason that nullifies ablution), must make prior to prayers; and</li>
<li>Causes that requires ablution (e.g. urine, eating camel meat, sleep, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h14-the-thirteenth-lesson-the-obligatory-elements-of-ablution" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Thirteenth Lesson &#8211; The Obligatory Elements of Ablution</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The obligatory elements of ablution are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Washing the face, including rinsing out the mouth with water and cleansing the nostrils of the nose;</li>
<li>Washing the two hands up to and including the elbows;</li>
<li>Wiping the whole head including the two ears;</li>
<li>Washing the two feet including the heels; and</li>
<li>Doing the ablution in the prescribed sequence, without delays.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h15-the-fourteenth-lesson-the-six-nullifying-acts-of-ablution" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Fourteenth Lesson &#8211; The Six Nullifying Acts of Ablution</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The six nullifying acts of the ablution are:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Natural excretion, such as urine, feaces, gas, etc.;</li>
<li>Any unclean substance excessively discharged from the body;</li>
<li>Losing one&#8217;s reason due to sleep, loss of consciousness or otherwise;</li>
<li>Eating camel meat (because the Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, ordered so);</li>
<li>Rejection of Islam; and</li>
<li>Touching the sexual organs with hand (without any barrier: clothes and so on).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Notice: Washing the dead does not nullify the ablution except for that the washer&#8217;s hand touches (without any barrier) the sexual organs. Kissing women with or without desire does not nullify ablution because the Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, once kissed one of his wives and prayed without performing ablution. This holds as long as there is no associated sexual excretions (e.g. semen). As for the saying of Allah, Most Glorified:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran">&#8221; &#8230; or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) &#8230; &#8220;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 4: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The contact with women is the involvement in a full sexual relation as related by Ibn Abbas (companion) and others, and it is the correct opinion.</p>
<h3 id="h16-the-fifteenth-lesson-recommend-morals" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Fifteenth Lesson &#8211; Recommend Morals</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The recommended morals for every Muslim are truthfulness, honesty, abstinence, modesty, courage, generosity, loyalty, refraining from everything that Allah had made unlawful, being a good neighbor, helping the needy, and other morals stated either in the Holy <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> or in the Prophet&#8217;s, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, tradition.</p>
<h3 id="h17-the-sixteenth-lesson-islamic-decencies" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Sixteenth Lesson &#8211; Islamic Decencies</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islamic decencies &#8211; greeting, cheerfulness, eating and drinking with the right hand, adhering to the Islamic conduct in entering and leaving homes and mosques and while traveling, dealing kindly with parents, relatives, neighbors, the old man and the young; congratulating, lamenting, and other Islamic ethics.</p>
<h3 id="h18-the-seventeenth-lesson-warning-others" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Seventeenth Lesson &#8211; Warning Others</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Warning against <em>shirk</em> (association) and against other wrongdoing such as witchcraft, murdering, taking the money of the orphan, dealing with interest (<em>riba</em>), escaping on the day of<em>Jihad</em> (war), speaking evil of faithful women, disobeying parents, breaking up with one&#8217;s relatives, false witnessing, harming neighbors, committing outrage upon others, and other warnings as declared by Allah and His messenger, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<h3 id="h19-the-eighteenth-lesson-the-funeral-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Eighteenth Lesson &#8211; The Funeral Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Washing the dead body and performing the funeral prayer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) Washing the dead:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a Muslim is confirmed dead his eyes must be closed and his jaws brought together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When washing the dead body, the whole body beginning with the exposed parts of ablution must be washed. The abdomen is gently squeezed and followed by washing of the anus and the sexual organs using a wet piece of cloth. Normal ablution will then be performed. The body is washed starting with the head and beard using water mixed with the leaves of<em>sidr</em> (lote tree, if available). The right side must be washed before the left side and the body must be washed three times. Each time the abdomen is squeezed as above. The mustache and the nails are clipped, and when the body is clean, it is wrapped in three white cotton sheets covering all parts of the body and perfumed with incense. If the body is still unclean, ablution must be extended to 5-7 times after which the body is dried with a clean cloth. Men&#8217;s hair should not be combed while that of a woman is to be braided into three chains and left hanging down behind her (as done to the Prophet&#8217;s daughter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is preferred to shroud men with three white sheets without a gown or <em>amamah</em> (head cover); children in one up to three sheets and women in five sheets, these sheets are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Dir&#8217;</em>: a loose outer garment with sleeves slit in front.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Khimar</em>: covering head and face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Izar</em>: a sheet wrapped around the waist, and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two overall wrapping sheets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Young girls can be wrapped with a gown and two sheets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who has the most right to wash the dead body of a man is his chosen guardian (if any) then his father, his grandfather, then the closest of his relatives. The woman is best washed by her chosen female then the mother, the grandmother, then the closest one of her female relatives. The husband can wash the body of his wife and vice versa because Abu Bakr, <em>may Allah be pleased with him</em>, was washed by his wife; and Ali ibn Abi Talib, <em>may Allah be pleased with him</em>, washed his wife, Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet, <em>may Allah be pleased with her</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) The funeral prayer (<em>salat ul-janazah</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying <em>takbir</em> (<em>allahu akbar</em>) four times. Reciting <em>al-Fatihah</em> after the first <em>takbir</em>. Following the second <em>takbir</em>, one prays for the Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, as he does in<em>tashahud</em>. Then after saying <em>allahu akbar</em> for the third time, one recites what is usually said in other prayers like asking Allah to forgive all Muslims or any supplications he knows, preferably this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Allahumma ighfir li hayyina wa mayyitina, wa shahidina wa ghaibina wa sagheerina wa kabeerina wa thakarina wa unthana. Allahumma man ahyaytahu minna fa ahyihi ala al Islam, wa man tawaffaytah u minna fa tawaffahu ala al-iman. Allahmma la tahrimna ajrah, wa la taftinna badah.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Allah, grant forgiveness to our living and to our dead, and to those who are present and to those who are absent, and to our young and our old folk, and to our males and our females. O Allah, whomsoever you grant to live, from among us, help him to live in Islam and whomsoever of us you cause to die, help him to die in faith. O Allah, do not deprive us of the reward for patience on his (her, their) loss and do not make us subject to trial after him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or one could say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Allahumma ighfir lah u warhamhu wa&#8217;afihi wa&#8217;fu anhu, wa&#8217;akrim nuzulahu wa wassi&#8217; madkhalahu, wa&#8217;ghsilhu bil mae wathalgi walbarad, wanaqihi mina al-thunoubi walkhataya kama unaqa athawbo alabiado mina addanas, wa abdilhu daran khairan min darihi, wa ahlan khairan min ahlihi, wa adkhilhu al-jannah, wa aidhu min adhabi al qabr, wa adhabi an-nar; wafsah lahu fi qabrihi, wanawir lahu fehi. Allahumma la tahrimna ajrahu, wa la tudhlilna ba&#8217;dahu.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Allah forgive him (her, them) and have your Mercy upon him; protect him and pardon him, receive him with honor and make his grave spacious; wash him with water, snow and hail, and clean him from sins and wrong-doings as is cleaned a white garment from impurity; requite him with an abode more excellent than his, and with a mate better than his mate. Admit him to the Garden, and protect him from the torment of the grave and the torment of the Fire; widen his space in his grave and bring him light therein. O Allah don&#8217;t deprive us from his reward and don&#8217;t let us go astray after him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after saying <em>allahu akbar</em> for the fourth time one turns his head to the right (making<em>taslim</em>) and thus ending the funeral prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is best to raise one&#8217;s hand while saying <em>allahu akbar</em>. In the case when the dead is a child or an infant, the following <em>du&#8217;a</em> is made:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Allahumma ejalhu dhiktan liwalidayehi, washafeean mujaban. Allahuma thaqil bihi mawazeenahuma wa a&#8217;dhun bihi ujorahuma wa alhiqhu bi salih al-mu&#8217;minin, waj&#8217;alhu fi kafalati ibrahim alayhi as-salam, waqihi bi rahmatika adhaba al-jahim.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Allah make him a preceding reward and a reserve treasure (on the Day of Judgment) for his parents; a one whose intercession would be granted. O Allah make of him an excess in the measures and in the rewards (granted by Allah) to his parents. Let him join the company of the righteous believers and make him under the care of Abraham (may the peace of Allah be upon him), and protect him, by Your Mercy, from the torment of the blazing Fire.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tradition is for the <em>Imam</em> to stand right next to the head of the body if it is a man, and to the middle of the body if it is a woman. If the dead were many, men, women, male and female children in one funeral, the following positions are to be taken:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The men right in front of the <em>Imam</em>. The women further towards the <em>qiblah</em>. The male children are between the men and women and more towards the men while the female children follow women further down in the direction of <em>qiblah</em> (all of the dead bodies are to be laid parallel to those praying). The bodies are to be arranged such that the head of the male child lies next to that of a man while the middle of a woman lies next to the head of a man. The head of the female child lies next to the head of a woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The followers of <em>Imam</em> are to stand behind him just as in other prayers. It is acceptable for one to stand to the right of the <em>Imam</em> if he finds no place behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>All praise is due to Allah and His blessings and peace be upon His Prophet, his family and his companions.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Among the qualifications necessary for a Da`y is that he should have patience, kindness, and gentleness with forbearing temperament as the prophets (peace be upon them) were.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never should a Da`y be rushing, violent, or unduly strict. Rather, he has to be patient, forbearing and kind while practicing Da`wah. To this effect, we have stated some evidence earlier. For example, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: And by the Mercy of Allâh, you dealt with them gently. In the story of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allâh).&#8221;</strong> [Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allah, whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is hard upon them, be hard upon him, and whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is kind to them, be kind to him.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">So, it is obligatory for you, slaves of Allah, to be kind in your Da`wah, and not to be harsh with people. Do not make people turn away from Islam because of your harshness, ignorance or violent, harmful approach. It is thus obligatory for you to be forbearing, gentle, pleasant and lenient in speech so that your words may have an effect on the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect on one toward whom your Da`wah is directed. As such, people will receive your Da`wah better, will be affected by it and will show appreciation. On the contrary, harshness causes disaffection, alienation, and division, not unity.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Video Courtesy: Bilal Nahim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is a woman that is menstruating or in her post-partum period allowed to touch the mus-haf or read from it? Also, is the menstruating woman allowed to enter the masjid in order to gain religious knowledge?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Abdulazeez bin Abdullah bin Baaz:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The menstruating woman is not allowed to sit in the masjid nor touch the mus-haf until she has become purified. However, if a need for her to touch it arose, such as in order to revise a verse (of the Qur&#8217;an) or something like that, there is no problem to do so by wearing gloves or by using some other barrier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for touching it without some sort of barrier, then no, she should not do that. This is because her impurity is major, like the one who is impure due to sexual relations (junub). The one who is &#8216;junub&#8217; does not read or touch the mus-haf. As for the menstruating woman, she may recite [the Qur&#8217;an] during the whole period. So can the one in her post-partum period, according to the correct Opinion. She can read from her memory without touching the mus-haf unless she has to in order to revise a verse in which case it is alright if she touches it using a barrier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: It is known that many people are pessimistic about the month of Safar regarding many affairs. Such people, for example, do not conclude <strong>marriage contracts</strong> during Safar. Moreover, many people believe that it is not permissible to <strong>break a stick, knot ropes, or entwine fingers</strong> when concluding a marriage contract for this leads to failure of the concerned marriage and disharmony between the spouses. Since all the foregoing are beliefs bearing on ‘Aqidah (creed), could you please advise and clarify the ruling on it? May Allah guide us all to all that He loves and is pleased with.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Pessimism about Safar is not permissible. It is a characteristic of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance)</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safar &#8211; just like all other months &#8211; does not bring good or evil, as good is only from Allah (Glorified be He) and evil is predestined by Him. Moreover, it is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) annulled the concept of pessimism when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is no ‘Adwa (contagion, disease transmission naturally by itself not by the Decree of Allah), nor is there any Tiyarah (evil omen), nor is there any Hamah (pre-Islamic superstitious belief that the bones of a dead person turn into an owl), nor is there Safar (the month of Safar was believed to bring bad luck during Jahiliyyah).</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same applies to pessimism about entwining fingers, breaking a stick, etc., when concluding a marriage contract. Such beliefs are false, baseless, and thus they should not be adopted by a Muslim. May Allah grant us all success!</p>

</a>Translated by Abu Afnaan Muhammad Abdullah hafidhahullaah<br />
Video Courtesy: Bilal Nahim</p>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Does &#8216;Umrah in the month of Ramadan satisfy for the obligation of Hajj due to the Messenger&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) statement, &#8220;<strong>Whoever performs ‘Umrah in Ramadan is like the one who makes Hajj with me</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Shaykh Abdul- Azeez Bin Baaz:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umrah in Ramadan does not compensate for Hajj. However, it has the merit/virtue of Hajj due to his (صلى الله عليه وسلم) statement, &#8216;<strong>Umrah in Ramadan equals a Hajj&#8217;</strong> or he said &#8216;<strong>a Hajj with me</strong>&#8216;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means in regards to merit and reward and it does not mean it is equivalent to it and replaces it such that he does not have to perform Hajj. No, rather he still must perform the Hajj, the Hajj of Islam (the obligatory Hajj) even if he makes &#8216;Umrah in Ramadan according to all of the scholars. Thus, with &#8216;Umrah in Ramadan, the merit of Hajj is attained from the aspect of reward and excellence, but it does not compensate for the Hajj of Islam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p>Is it permissible to offer two Witr prayers in one night?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p>No one should offer two Witr prayers in one night because the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There cannot be two Witr prayers in one night.[1]</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) also said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Make the end of your prayer at night Witr. [2] </strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever feared that he will not get up at the end of the night should perform Witr at the beginning of it. And whoever desired to stand at the end of it should pray Witr at the end of the night.</strong></span> [3]</p></blockquote>
<p>If it is easy for the Muslim to perform the night prayer at the end of the night, he should seal his prayer with one Rakah of Witr. Whoever found difficulty in this should perform his Witr at the start of the night.</p>
<p>And if Allaah makes it easy for him (after that) to stand in prayer, he should offer what he can in units of two Rakahs, and he need not repeat the Witr, for the first Witr is sufficient for him, according to the aforementioned Hadith which is:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There cannot be two Witr prayers in one night. [4]</strong></span></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: <span style="color:#993300;">Does performing ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) during the months of Hajj have any particular virtue different from performing it in other months?  </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The best month to perform ‘Umrah is during Ramadan, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Umrah (performed) in Ramadan is equal to Hajj (in reward). <span style="color:#808080;">[1]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Agreed upon its authenticity by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another narration by Al-Bukhari:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is equivalent to performing Hajj with me.<span style="color:#808080;"> [2]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the narration by Muslim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is equivalent to Hajj or Hajj performed with me (in reward). <span style="color:#808080;">[3]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that it is equivalent to Hajj or (indicative of uncertainty on the part of the Hadith narrator) equivalent to Hajj performed with the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, comes the <strong>‘Umrah in Dhul-Qa‘dah</strong>, for all the ‘Umrahs which the Prophet (peace be upon him) performed took place in Dhul-Qa‘dah. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow <span style="color:#808080;"> [4]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>May Allah grant us success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Q: It is known that the scholars disagree as to whether it is obligatory to pay Zakah (obligatory charity) on jewelry that is worn, intended to be worn, or borrowed.What is Your Eminence’s opinion on this issue? Supposing that it is obligatory to pay Zakah on them, is there a Nisab (the minimum amount on which Zakah is due) for this? If there is a Nisab, it seems from the Hadith that indicate the obligation of giving Zakah on jewelry &#8211; where the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) warned against the punishment of Fire awaiting those who do not pay the Zakah &#8211; that there is no Nisab. How is this resolved? [1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is a famous controversy among the scholars as to whether it is obligatory to pay Zakah on gold and silver jewelry that is worn, intended to be worn, or borrowed. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The preponderant opinion is that it is obligatory, according to the general evidence on the obligation of Zakah on gold and silver</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also authentically reported that `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: <span style="color:#008000;">A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) with her daughter, on whose hand were two heavy bangles of gold. He (peace be upon him) asked, “Do you pay Zakah on these?” She said, “No.” He (peace be upon him) said, “Would it please you if Allah were to encircle you on the Day of Resurrection with two bracelets of Fire because of them?” She threw them down and said, &#8220;They are (I have given them away) for the sake of Allah and His Messenger.&#8221;</span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also authentically <span style="color:#008000;">reported from Um Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was wearing some gold ornaments, so she asked, “O Messenger of Allah! Is this Kanz (hoarded wealth, the Zakah of which has not been paid)?” He (peace be upon him) said, “Anything that reaches the amount at which Zakah is payable and its Zakah is paid is not considered Kanz.”</span> [3] The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not tell her that there is no Zakah on jewelry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these Hadith refer to jewelry that reach the Nisab, when they are combined with other evidence, as Hadith explain one another just as Qur’anic Ayahs (verses) explain one another, and also Hadith explain Ayahs and make their generality specific and their absoluteness limited, because all of them are revelation from Allah (Glorified be He). Whatever comes from Allah is not contradictory; in fact they confirm and explain one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is necessary that a Hawl (one lunar year calculated from the time a property reaches the minimum amount upon which Zakah is due) must be completed (on jewelry) as is the case with other categories of Zakah wealth, such as money, commercial commodities, and livestock. May Allah grant us success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcription of the Video :</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory upon the individual who has a Wet Dream [1] during the daytime in Ramadan? We would like the answer and may Allah reward you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdul -&#8216;Azeez ibn Baaz:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing becomes obligatory due to a wet dream. If a man or woman has a wet dream in Ramadan and he/she is fasting, then there is nothing obligatory upon him/her as this does not occur due to one&#8217;s choice. If he dreams that he/she is having sexual intercourse and then sees that sperm has emitted, the fast is valid as Allah does not burden a person with more than they can bear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an issue in which there is consensus between the scholars that there is nothing binding upon the person (in this situation) and all praise is due to Allah. Likewise, if he were to imagine and due to this, ejaculated, his fast is valid as it did not happen due to his choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;"><b>[1] </b><span style="color:#993300;">wet dream</span> is a spontaneous orgasm during sleep that includes ejaculation for a male, or vaginal wetness or an orgasm (or both) for a female (source: wikipedia)</span></em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Transcription of the Video:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question Concerning Ramadan &#8211; honorable Sheikh &#8211; Do Backbiting and Tale Bearing in Ramadan break the fast and what are helpful things which assist in contemplation and fearing Allah in the prayer?</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Backbiting and Tale Bearing are two major sins. However, they do not break the fast, but the person incurs a grevious wrong doing as they are major sins, in Ramadan and in other months, yet they do not break the fast.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on paying Zakah (obligatory charity) money for helping to build a Masjid (mosque) whose construction was halted due to lack of financial resources?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A: </b>According to the opinion of the majority of Muslim scholars and the Ijma` (consensus) of our Salaf (righteous predecessors), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Zakah is not to be paid for constructing Masjids, buying books, etc</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, Zakah must be spent on the eight categories which are mentioned in the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) of Surah Al-Tawbah, i.e. the poor, the needy, those employed to collect (the funds), to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islâm), to free captives, for those in debt, in the cause of Allah, and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is worth mentioning that scholars are of the view that the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>category of &#8220;in the cause of Allah&#8221; refers only to Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah)</strong></span> and this does not include constructing Masjids, schools, roads, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Please advise me by giving me a Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) as to whether it is permissible to pay Zakah (obligatory charity) outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the known categories of Zakah recipients, in the same way as it is done inside the Kingdom. We appreciate your assistance and may Allah protect you. Wa‘alaykum as-salam warahmatullah wabarakatuh (And may Allah’s Peace and Blessings be upon you!)</p>
<p><strong>A question asked to His Eminence. He replied on 3/9/1410 A.H.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for the Zakah payer to send Zakah to a country other than where they are living, <strong>if this is for a Shar‘y (Islamically lawful) benefit</strong>, according to the more correct of the two opinions held by the scholars, <strong>such as </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">sending it to the Mujahidun (strivers/fighters in the Cause of Allah),</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">to the poor who are in greater need than those in their country, or</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">for being their relatives, as this combines maintaining the ties of kinship and Zakah.</li>
</ul>
<p>May Allah guide everyone to that which pleases Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">A lecture entitled, &#8220;<strong>Zakah: Its status in Islam</strong>&#8220;, which His Eminence gave in<br />
Al-Jami Al-Kabir, Riyadh<b><br />
</b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all creation. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon His Slave, Messenger, Khalil (beloved, close elect) and truthful conveyer of the Divine Revelation, our Prophet, Imam and Master Muhammad ibn `Abdullah, his family, and Companions and whosoever follows his example and seeks his guidance until the Day of Resurrection. To continue:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The topic of the lecture as the presenter said is (<strong>Status of Zakah in Islam</strong>). Every Muslim individual who possesses the least knowledge of Islam knows that Zakah, being the third pillar of Islam, holds a great status in Islam. Zakah has been mentioned in connection with Salah (Prayer) in many places of the Qur&#8217;an. The Prophet (peace be upon him) also mentioned Zakah next to Salah in numerous Hadiths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât and bow down (or submit yourselves with obedience to Allâh) along with those who bow down (in prayer)&#8221;  </strong>[</span>Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 43]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;And perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) that you may receive mercy (from Allâh)&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#000000;">[</span><span style="color:#000000;">Surah Al-Nur, 24: 56]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another place, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;But if they repent, perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât) and give Zakât, then they are your brethren in religion&#8221; </strong>[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 11]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In yet another place, Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allâh, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât) and give Zakât, and that is the right religion&#8221; </strong></span>[Surah Al-Bayyinah, 98: 5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e., Al-Bukhari and Muslim) on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdullah ibn `Umar ibn Al-Khattab</span>(may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><span style="background-color:#d5d5d5;">I</span>slam was based on five pillars: testimony that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; performing Salah (prayers), giving Zakah; fasting Ramadan; and performing Hajj (pilgrimage).</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="webkit-html-attribute-value" style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Book on faith, Chapter on Islam is based on five things, no. 8; Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on Islam is founded on five (fundaments), no. 16; and Al-Tirmidhy, Book on faith, Chapter on Islam is based on five things, no. 2609, and the wording is his]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version, the Hadith reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Islam was based on five pillars: worshipping Allah Alone and disbelieving that there is any other Gods, performing Salah (Prayers), giving Zakah&#8230;</strong></span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Chapter on Islam is founded on five (fundaments), no. 16]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates the great position which Zakah holds in Islam. It is mentioned next to Salah both in the Qur&#8217;an and Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Salah is considered the cornerstone of Islam and the second greatest pillar next to only the Shahadah (testimony of faith).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says regarding Salah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 238" target="_blank" name="Guardstrictly(fiveobligatory)" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salawât (the prayers) especially the middle Salât (i.e. the best prayer &#8211; ‘Asr ). And stand before Allâh with obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salât (prayers)]. </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 238]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is also reported to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#000000;">That which differentiates us from the disbelievers and hypocrites is our performance of Salah. He who abandons it, becomes a disbeliever. </span></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">[</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Narrated by Al-Tirmidhy, Book on faith, Chapter on abandoning Salah, no. 2621.]</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) is reported to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">What makes one a disbeliever and a polytheist is abandoning prayers.</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on calling one who neglects Salah a disbeliever, no. 82]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Zakah is the sister pillar of Salah</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salah is a physical act of worship in which the Muslim stands before Allah supplicating to Him, mentioning His Name and reciting Ayahs of the Qur&#8217;an. It has such a great effect on hearts. If performed properly, Salah will restrain one from committing indecent acts and will serve as a means to attaining happiness, safety and salvation. It will also set their heart aright and bless their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day the Prophet (peace be upon him) was speaking to his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) about Salah and he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Whoever observes it regularly, it will be a source of light, authoritative proof and a means of salvation on the Day of Resurrection, and whoever does not observe it regularly, it will not be a source of light, authoritative proof and a means of salvation and on the Day of Resurrection he will join the company of Fir`aun (Pharaoh), Haman, Qarun (Korah), and Ubay ibn Khalaf.</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Section on the Hadiths narrated by the Companions who narrated a large number of Hadiths, Section on the Hadiths narrated by `Abdullah ibn `Amar ibn Al-`As, no. 6540.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Imam Ahmad and others with a good Sanad (chain of narrators).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Commenting on the above Hadith, some scholars said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;On the Day of Resurrection one who abandons Salah will join the company of Pharaoh, Haman Qarun, and Ubayy ibn Khalaf on account of his imitating them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The reason is that if he abandons it for the sake of holding a prestigious position, he will be behaving like<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Fir`aun (Pharaoh) </span>who, being an enemy to Musa (Moses, peace be upon him), transgressed and behaved arrogantly taking advantage of his royal position. T</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">he same is true with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Haman, </span>Pharaoh&#8217;s minister,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> </span>who, taking advantage of his position, behaved arrogantly and refused to follow Musa (Moses, peace be upon him). Therefore, one will dwell in Hellfire with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Haman, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Pharaoh&#8217;s </span>minister, because of being occupied with his prestigious position and getting distracted from obeying Allah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">One who abandons it for the sake of collecting wealth will join the company of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Qarun (Korah) </span>who was addicted<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> </span>to the collection of wealth and lusting after his desires. He behaved arrogantly and disobeyed Prophet Musa. Thus, Allah caused the earth to swallow him up together with his dwelling. He was destined to enter Hellfire.<span style="line-height:1.5;">Those who behave after the manner of Qarun will enter Hellfire with him. We seek refuge in Allah from this. </span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">One who abandons Salah on account of being busy, conducting buying and selling transactions will be behaving after the manner of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="line-height:1.5;"> Ubay ibn Khalaf, </span><span style="line-height:1.5;">the Makkan merchant,</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="line-height:1.5;"> </span><span style="line-height:1.5;">and will thus join his company in Hellfire. We seek refuge in Allah.</span></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Zakah and Salah are equally important.</strong> Those who abstain from paying it on account of miserliness and greed for wealth will join the company of Allah&#8217;s enemy who preferred collecting wealth to showing obedience to Allah and His Messenger. It is reported that <a name="WhentheProphet(peacebeupon"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112839" class="tip"></span>when the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent Mu`adh to Yemen, he said: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Invite them to bear witness that there is no God but Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah. Should they accept your invitation, then tell them that Allah has prescribed upon them to offer five Prayers a day. Should they obey you, tell them that Allah has prescribed upon them to pay Zakah which is collected from the rich among them and given to the poor.&#8221;</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Section on Banu Hashim, the beginning of the Section on the Hadiths narrated by `Abdullah ibn `Abbas, no. 2072; Al-Bukhari, Book on Zakah, Chapter on taking Sadaqah from the rich and giving it to the poor&#8230;, no. 1496; and Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on calling people to the testimony of faith&#8230;, no. 19.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that Zakah was prescribed as an act of sympathy and kindness to the poor. It is an obligation due from one&#8217;s wealth which they are obliged to ensure its delivery to those who deserve it. This is based on the Hadith of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ibn `Umar </span>(may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> <a name="Ihavebeencommandedtofight"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112840" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#000000;">I have been commanded to fight against people until they testify that there is no God but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, perform the Prayer, and pay Zakah. If they do that, their blood and property are guaranteed protection on my behalf except when justified by law, and their affairs rest with Allah.</span></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Book on faith, Chapter on Allah&#8217;s Saying: &#8220;If they turn in repentance and establish the prayer&#8221;, no. 25; and Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on the command to fight people until they profess that there is no God but Allah, no. 22.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This and other similar Hadiths indicate the lawfulness to fight those whose miserliness makes them abstain from paying Zakah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>During Abu Bakr&#8217;s lifetime, war was waged against those who refused to pay Zakah.</strong></span> This is because the blood of a Muslim is protected against being shed only when they establish Salah and pay Zakah. That is why when some Arabs refrained from paying Zakah following the Prophet&#8217;s demise, the Sahabah engaged in fighting against them so that they could pay it off. After the Prophet&#8217;s demise, some Muslims apostatized from Islam. Some of them said that had Muhammad been truly a Prophet of Allah, he would not have passed away. They forgot the fact that all prophets preceding him had also passed away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some others refused to pay Zakah. At this point<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Bakr </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) delivered a sermon encouraging the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) to fight the apostates until they came back to Islam.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>argued with him saying: &#8220;How will you fight those who bear witness that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah?&#8221;<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Bakr </span>replied: &#8220;We have been commanded to fight against people until they testify that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they do that, their blood and property are guaranteed protection on our behalf except when justified by law.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr went on to say: &#8220;Is not Zakah one of Allah&#8217;s Rights? By Allah, I will keep fighting those who differentiate between Salah and Zakah. By Allah, if they refuse to give me as much as a she-kid which they used to give during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah, I will fight them on its account. Then<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>said: &#8220;It was nothing but Allah Who had guided<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Bakr </span>to fight and I came to realize that he was right.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sahabah unanimously agreed on fighting the Murtads (apostates). They fought against them vigorously until they came back to the fold of Islam. Only those among them who were destined to die as Murtads were killed at the hands of Muslims. We seek refuge in Allah from this. The ones killed included <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><strong>Musaylimah Al-Kadhab</strong> (the head of the apostates who claimed himself a Prophet after the death of Prophet Muhammad), </span>some of his followers, some people from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Banu Asad, </span>and others. As they refused to come back to Islam, Muslims continued to fight them until they were killed. Other Murtads were guided back to Islam by the Will of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To sum it up: Zakah is of great importance in Islam. It is the third greatest pillar next to Salah and Shahadah. Muslims are duty bound to deliver it to those who deserve it. If the Muslim ruler orders that Zakah be paid off to him to undertake the process of distributing it, his order must be executed. If he does not demand that, the believer has to distribute it to the poor and other people who deserve it. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has defined the categories of Zakah recipientsin the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) where He (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8220;As-Sadaqât (here it means Zakât) are only for the Fuqarâ’ (poor), and the Masâkin (needy) and those employed to collect (the funds), and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islâm), and to free the captives, and for those in debt, and for Allâh’s Cause, and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allâh. And Allâh is All-Knower, All-Wise. </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 60]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first and second categories of Zakah recipients include <strong>Faqirs</strong> (the poor) and the <strong>Miskins</strong> (the needy): These two have been defined as people who do not possess enough money. The Faqir is the person who does not have sufficient wealth to fulfill his needs or the needs of his dependents, such as food, drink, clothing and housing. The Miskin may be someone whose standard of living is better than the Faqir. However, their ruling is the same in all matters. They should be given an amount of Zakah which covers their basic needs for one whole year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third category of Zakah recipients includes <strong>those employed to collect Zakah</strong>: Collectors of Zakah include the people who travel around to collect it, or those who are responsible for maintaining it, or the scribes who record it in its register. Such people are given an amount from Zakah according to the effort they exert in collecting and maintaining it. The Muslim ruler can estimate the amount given to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth category includes <strong>the hearts that are newly inclined to Islam</strong>, This category includes chiefs, masters and men of high standing whose word is listened to by their people. When they enter Islam, their people are expected to follow in their footsteps. When they refuse to accept Islam, the same will be the attitude of their people. They are given a portion of Zakah with the purpose of strengthening their Iman (faith), or winning the hearts of their counterparts, or seeking their help in defending Islam against its enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth category includes the <strong>freeing of slaves and captives of war</strong>: Zakah is to be given to slaves so that they can set themselves free from the bondage of slavery. In this regard, Zakah is given to the type of slaves known as <strong>Mukatabs</strong> (slaves with an agreement to buy their freedom). According to the correct view, one who delivers Zakah may buy slaves with the money of Zakah for the purpose of freeing them. It is also permissible that he uses the money of Zakah in buying Muslims who have fallen captive to the Kafirs (disbelievers). Thus Zakah is delivered to the Kafirs as a ransom to release the Muslim captives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sixth category includes <strong>those in debt</strong>: These are the people who borrow money from others to provide the basic needs of their dependents or to reconcile between Muslims. They offer to pay the money in order to bring about reconciliation between Muslims who are at enmity with each other. One who offers to pay money for that purpose should be given an amount of the Zakah even if he is rich. Zakah is also given to insolvent debtors who are incapable of paying off their debts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh category includes paying Zakah <strong>in the cause of Allah</strong>: in this category Zakah is given to equip Mujahidun (persons fighting in the Cause of Allah) with necessary weapons and cavalry if Bayt-ul-Mal (Muslim treasury) is short of providing them with this. Therefore, they are given a portion of Zakah which enables them to fight against the enemies of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth category includes the <strong>wayfarers</strong>: wayfarers are people who move from one country to another. They may happen to run out of provisions due to the long distances they travel when journeying or being attacked by highway robbers or due to any other reason. They must be given a portion of Zakah which enables them to return home safely even if they are naturally rich people. They must be given an amount of Zakah that helps them return to their country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zakah has such a great effect when delivered to those eight categories of recipients. It helps them perform the duties of Allah and relieves them of their sufferings like paying off their debts if they are in debt or freeing themselves from the bondage of slavery if they are slaves or fighting in the cause of Allah if they are Mujahidun or assisting the wayfarers.It is out of Allah&#8217;s mercy that He makes His poor and rich Slaves co-operate with one another in righteousness and piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Payment of Zakah is a way of giving thanks to Allah</strong> because of the blessings He bestows upon them. Allah is the true Bestower of favors and blessings. It is the duty of every Muslim to pay out their Zakah as an act of showing gratitude to Allah. A Muslim should thank Allah for making him a deliverer and not a recipient of Zakah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The upper hand is better than the lower one&#8230;</strong></span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Book on Zakah, Chapter on Sadaqah should only be given by the wealthy, no. 1428; and Muslim, Book on Zakah, Chapter on the statement that the upper hand (that which gives) is better than the lower hand (that which receives), no. 1034]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The upper hand is the one that delivers Zakah while the lower hand is the one which receives it. The Muslim should thank Allah for providing them with wealth which they are duty bound to give a portion of to Allah&#8217;s Slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Zakah also purges the soul of the deliverer and purifies his wealth as well</strong>. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 103" target="_blank" name="TakeSadaqah(alms)fromtheir" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it&#8221;</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 103]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>You will be rewarded on account of paying Zakah both in this life and the Hereafter. </strong>Your money is purified and preserved when you pay it out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is also a means of purifying the soul</strong>. This has been referred to in the above Ayah which reads: &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 103" target="_blank" name="TakeSadaqah(alms)fromtheir" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslim gives their fellow poor Muslims from the wealth that Allah has bestowed on them, they will be abundantly rewarded by Allah for relieving them of their distresses.This act of yours will make them hold you in high esteem. It may be that they will make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) for you which may be a reason for your happiness and salvation in this life and the Hereafter. A Muslim is not harmed when they pay only a little amount of the many bounties that Allah has bestowed on them. They give these amounts to the children, old people and poor ones. The Muslim will receive great rewards from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allah has threatened those who refuse to pay Zakah out of miserliness.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And those who hoard up gold and silver [Al-Kanz: the money, the Zakât of which has not been paid] and spend them not in the Way of Allâh, announce unto them a painful torment</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 35" target="_blank" name="OntheDaywhenthat(Al-Kanz:" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>On the Day when that (Al-Kanz: money, gold and silver the Zakât of which has not been paid) will be heated in the Fire of Hell and with it will be branded their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs, (and it will be said unto them): <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;This is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves. Now taste of what you used to hoard.&#8221;</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 34-35]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the evil consequence of those who withhold payment of Zakah. They will be thrown into Hellfire where the wealth they amassed and refused to pay its Zakah will be a source of their agony on the Day of Resurrection. This will be a fitting retribution for their refusal to fulfill the right of Allah. While the wealth which a person does not give its due Zakah is labeled as &#8220;<strong>hoarded wealth</strong>&#8220;, that money whose due Zakah is paid is free of blame.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> <a style="color:#000000;" name="Whateverreachesaquantityon"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112843" class="tip"></span>Whatever reaches a quantity on which Zakah is payable is not a treasure (kanz) when Zakah is paid</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Abu Dawud, Book on Zakah, Chapter on what is Kanz and Zakah on jewelry, no. 1564]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever you pay the Zakah due from the wealth in your possession, it will not be labeled as hoarded wealth and vice versa.If you refuse to pay Zakah due from it, it will be a source of your agony on the Day of Resurrection. It is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><a name="Anypersonwhopossessesgoldor"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112844" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#000000;">Any person who possesses gold or silver and does not pay what is due from them (in another narration their Zakah); on the Day of Resurrection, plates of silver and gold would be heated for him in the fire of Hell and with them his flank, forehead, and back will be branded during a day the extent of which will be fifty thousand years. Then he will be shown his final abode, either to Paradise or to Hell. </span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">He who possesses camels and does not pay what is due from him regarding them, will be thrown on his face or on his back in a vast desert plain (on the Day of Resurrection) and they will trample him with their hoofs and bite him with their teeth.

And he would be shown his last abode either to Paradise or to Hell. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">He who possesses cows and sheep and does not pay their Zakah (in another wording of the Hadith what is due on him regarding them) will be thrown on the Day of Judgment in a vast desert plain and they will trample him with their hoofs and gore him with their horns. As often as the last of them passes him the first of them would be made to return to him again during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years. Then he would be shown his last abode either to Paradise or to Hell.</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on Zakah, Chapter on sin of one who does not pay Zakah, no. 987.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith indicates how severe the punishment is of one who refuses to pay Zakah out of miserliness. On the Day of Resurrection, their wealth will be a source of their grief and agony whether it be money, food, fruit, camels, cattle or sheep. They will be used as tools of punishment on the Day of Resurrection. The Prophet indicated how they will be punished with their own wealth. The same is true with regard to gold and silver and other things of the sort. We ask Allah to grant us safety and protection from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It is our duty and the duty of all Muslims to enjoin one another to pay Zakah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are duty bound to enjoin one another to fulfill Allah&#8217;s Rights, strive hard to do that and remind those who are negligent of paying Zakah. Reminding people of this benefits the believers. Zakah, Salah and fasting are all obligatory duties, yet one may be heedless of that because of the gravity of his sins which darken their heart and cause them to continually disobey Allah. Satan and his helpers also make their deeds fair-seeming to them until they become completely unmindful of Allah and the Hereafter. They fall victim to the worship of Satan and start to accompany evil people. Their hearts become obsessed with the love of wealth and lustful desires. They refuse to befriend righteous people and prefer to follow the path of deviant fellows. Therefore, it is the duty of all Muslims to remind those heedless Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-Dhariyat, 51: 55" target="_blank" name="Andremind(bypreachingtheQur%E2%80%99%C3%A2n," rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>And remind (by preaching the Qur’ân, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), for verily, the reminding profits the believers</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Dhariyat, 51: 55]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So remind them (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) &#8211; you are only one who reminds </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;"> [Surah Al-Ghashiyah, 88: 21]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A believer should remind his fellow believing brother. He should not assume that their fellow brothers are well aware of the consequences of refraining from paying Zakah. Whenever they see that their brothers have started to be neglectful of Allah&#8217;s duties, they must start advising them and reminding them of Allah through the use of kind words and gentle preaching. They should seem to beworried about them and concerned with their salvation and happiness. A true Muslim brother is one who keeps advising, reminding and directing you to the straight path. He never keeps himself away from you nor flatters you. Rather, he gives you counsel and admonishes you. He reminds you to be mindful of Allah. He shows you the path of salvation so that you can follow it and warns you of treading the path of perdition so that you can steer clear of it. You should never give up hope of advising him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;&#8230;and never give up hope of Allâh’s Mercy&#8221; </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Yusuf, 12: 87]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Despair not of the Mercy of Allâh&#8221;</strong></span> <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 53]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reality proves that there have been many disobedient Muslims who continued to be heedless of Allah&#8217;s Commandments for years. Then, the time came when they were guided back to the straight path at the hands of righteous Muslims who kept encouraging them to perform deeds of righteousness. They started to awaken from their heedlessness and pray to Allah for the sake of those who guided them. As Allah shows them true guidance, they return to the path of truth and repent to Him of all their past sins. In this way, Allah forgives them and atones their previous misdeeds. So, I advise you, my dear brothers, not to give up hope.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone has told me just after Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer that he had come from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Masjid Al-Nusiry </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Masjid Al-Turky </span>while the marketplaces there were filled with people who did not offer Salah and were busy conducting buying and selling transactions. He started to weep and said: &#8220;This is intolerable.&#8221; Therefore, I see that we are in need of advising and co-operating with one another. It should not be said that authorities in charge would undertake this duty. It is true that these authorities shoulder great responsibility and that they have to be held accountable if they ever fail to play their role properly. We ask Allah to grant them help and success.Muslim rulers shoulder great responsibility in this regard. Every Muslim whether educated, scholar, or judge shares their prescribed responsibility of disapproving evil acts and enjoining good ones. The more Muslims co-operate with one another and enjoin one another to hold fast to the truth, the less evil will spread. Marketplaces are filled with many Muslims who neglect offering Salah (Prayer) and sit outside Masjids (mosques) while their fellow Muslims are in the process of offering it. These people must be reminded of their negligence of Salah and passers-by must disapprove of this heinous act of theirs. They may be warned in such words as &#8220;Do you not fear Allah? How come you are sitting like this while your Muslim brothers are offering Salah.&#8221; One should join their fellow Muslims in Salah even if they are on a journey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">The Prophet (peace be upon him) passed by a man who did not move while the prayer was beginning. He asked him, &#8220;Are you not a Muslim?&#8221;</span> </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Imam Ahmad, the beginning of the Section on the Hadiths narrated by Al-Madinah narrators, the Hadith narrated by Mihjan Al-Diyaly, no. 15960; and Al-Nasa&#8217;y, Book on Imamate, Chapter on performing an obligatory Salah again in a congregation, no. 857]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He ordered him to join Salah with other Muslims even after he had already prayed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">After the Prophet had offered the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer in Mina in the year of the Farewell Hajj, some people said to him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Here are two people who have not offered the Fajr Prayer with us.&#8221; He asked that they be brought to him. They came trembling with fear. The Prophet (peace be upon him) inquired: &#8220;What prevented you from offering Salah with us?&#8221; They said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! We offered it in our camp&#8221;. The Prophet said: &#8220;Never do this again.If you have prayed in your houses and then you come to the Masjid (mosque), then pray with the congregation. It will be regarded as supererogatory Prayer for you&#8221;.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Section on the Hadiths narrated by Levanters narrators, the Hadith narrated by Yazid ibn Al-Aswad, no. 17020; and Al-Tirmidhy, Book on Salah, Chapter on a man offers Salah alone and then joins the congregation, no. 219]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone, who has already offered an Obligatory Prayer alone, goes to the Masjid and sees that the Congregational Prayer is not yet finished, they have to join the Muslims. If they happen to join the Imam in the first Rak`ah (unit of Prayer), then they will make Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer) with him. If they miss some Rak`ahs, they have to make up for them after Taslim. When the Prophet was asked about some Muslim rulers who delay offering Salah until later times, he said to the questioner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Observe the prayer at its proper time and if you can, do it along with them, and do not say that you have already observed prayer for it would be a supererogatory prayer for you.</span></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on Masjids and places for Salah, Chapter on disapproval of delaying Salah from its prescribed time&#8230;, no. 648; Al-Nasa&#8217;y, Book on Imamate, Chapter on performing Salah with wrongful rulers, no. 778; and Abu Dawud, Book on Salah, Chapter on if an Imam delays Salah after its prescribed time, no. 431.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims should reprimand those who sit in the streets at prayer time. Should one of them argue that he has already offered Salah, he must be ordered not to sit near the Masjid and to hide from people or join them in Prayer which will be regarded as supererogatory for him. He must be ordered to do this in order not to discourage people from offering Salah.He must be told to hasten to offer it with his fellow Muslims. It will be regarded as supererogatory Prayer if he has already offered it alone. The Imams at different Masjids should spend equal or similar times in offering Salah so that those who abandon Salah might not claim that they have prayed at such and such Masjid. Muslims are duty bound to co-operate in righteousness and piety and enjoin one another to hold steadfastly to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah describes those of His servants who are winners that they enjoin one another to hold to the path of truth and to endure it patiently. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) informs us that this type of people are the real winners who will attain happiness on account of their possession of the following four characteristics. Firstly, they have sincere belief in Allah and His Messenger. Secondly, they work deeds of righteousness which means that their Iman is fruitful. Iman is not just what resides firmly in the heart as it has to be confirmed by deeds. For example, it is not just enough to believe in the obligatory nature of Salah while neglecting to offer it, or to believe in the obligatory nature of Zakah while refusing to pay it, or to believe in the obligatory nature of fasting while abstaining from it. Iman has to be demonstrated both in words and in deeds. The real winners are those who combine between true Iman, righteous deeds and enjoining one another to do good and to remain steadfast. These are the real winners as they have firm belief in Allah and His Messenger. They declare the Oneness of Allah and His Messenger. They also believe in the Truth revealed by Allah and conveyed by His Messenger. Then, they practiced that really after their belief undertaking the obligations that Allah ordained and leaving the Prohibitions that He forbade. They also advised one another to hold fast to the truth without negligence or weakness, enjoining each other to the truth and cooperating with one another in righteousness and benevolent acts. They preached Islam, enjoined what is right and forbade what is wrong patiently as these matters cannot be attained without observing patience. Whoever seeks these merits has to keep patient and seek the help of Allah; beseeching Allah for His Help, thank Him, do the best in doing His Commandments, advising for His Sake, enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong, reminding people of Allah forbearingly. Undoubtedly, you have to bear troubles as it is the way of Paradise that is surrounded with troubling hardships. The Prophet (peace be upon him) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong>Paradise is surrounded by hardships and Hell-Fire is surrounded by temptations.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on Paradise, description of its boon and inhabitants, first chapter, no. 2823]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">There are many obstacles lying in the way to Jannah (Paradise). These obstacles have to be overcome with patience. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatest of these obstacles include following desires of the self, surrendering to the temptations of Shaytan (devil) and keeping company with evil friends. While the Shaytan makes bad deeds fair-seeming to the doer, his soul is naturally prone to evil and the evil company he keeps corrupts his manners.This evil company brings harm to him by causing him to deviate from the right path. Therefore, one should patiently endure breaking their relationship with them. One should also develop a kind of steadfast adherence to obeying the Commands of Allah and disobeying the incitements of Shaytan. One should have firm determination that helps them not to fall victim to their whims and desires which lead to eternal dwelling in Hellfire. Therefore, you will realize the true meaning of felicity by following the commands of Allah, refusing to follow your whims and desires and holding fast to the path of guidance and steadfastness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Muslim man or woman is duty bound to hasten to performing congregational Salah (Prayer) at its appointed time. They should put aside everything that distracts them from offering Salah like work or sleep. Undoubtedly, some Muslims find this difficult to do. However, once one starts to tame themselves by exercising <strong>self-restraint</strong>, they will sense a feeling of pleasure overwhelming their hearts each time they offer Salah. Self-restraint will help make their souls amenable to them. Thus, the heart is revived each time the Prayer time becomes due. One will also sense a feeling of comfort upon offering Salah to which they will hasten with pleasure. They will sense the same feelings when doing other good deeds. However, if one neglects offering Salah surrendering themselves to whims and desires, Satan will play tricks on them and their heart will become weak to the point that they will feel that Salah is burdensome,because the heart becomes weak due to its submission to desires, devil, and tempting ways of laziness and harmful neglect when a servant argues, in his defense of his falsehood, saying, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful.. Allah is All-Forgiving and All-Generous while he forgets that Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Declare (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) unto My slaves, that truly, I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful. &#8220;And that My Torment is indeed the most painful torment. </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Hijr, 15: 49-50]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also forgets that Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Forgiver of sin, the Acceptor of repentance, the Severe in punishment, the Bestower (of favours). Lâ ilâha illâ Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), to Him is the final return.</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Ghafir, 40: 3]</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah forgives and is merciful to those who turn to Him in repentance, yet He inflicts severe punishment on those who neglect His Rights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant all Muslims success and guidance. May He guide us and you to that which pleases Him. May He also guide us to His Straight Path, teach us what is beneficial to us, and assist us in obeying Him and fulfilling His Rights. May Allah make us all among those who co-operate in righteousness and piety and those who enjoin one another to hold steadfastly to the truth. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) is Most Generous and Most Gracious. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Advising women who listen to music<br />
</b>Nur `Ala Al-Darb Program, Tape no. 11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b></b><b>Q: Kindly advise those women who listen to songs.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b></b>I advise all men and women not to listen to music, because they bring about evil consequences. Songs are presented on TV, broadcast on the radio, and recorded on cassettes. All Muslim men and women are thus required to beware the evil of these songs. Instead, they should listen to the Qur&#8217;an, Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him) or Islamic lectures which benefit them in this life and the Hereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">As for songs and music, their evil is great as they may cause Muslims to deviate from their religion. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Songs and music may <strong>sow seeds of hypocrisy in the heart</strong>, at which point one begins to develop a dislike for everything that is good and become fond of every other thing that is evil. This is the true meaning of hypocrisy in addition to its literal meaning of pretending to be a Muslim while concealing Kufr (disbelief). Therefore, music is one of the means that invites to hypocrisy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Having the habit of listening to music may lead to hating the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an, being heedless of beneficial advice, or listening to Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Moreover, one may be deluded into committing obscenities and corruption. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Thus, it is the duty of faithful men and women to be cautious of evil of songs and music.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states in the Glorious Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing, etc.) to mislead (men) from the Path of Allâh without knowledge, and takes it (the Path of Allâh, or the Verses of the Qur’ân) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire). </strong></span>(Surah Luqman, 31: 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when Our Verses (of the Qur’ân) are recited to such a one, he turns away in pride, as if he heard them not &#8211; as if there were deafness in his ear. So announce to him a painful torment. </span></strong>(Surah Luqman, 31: 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Commentators of the Qur&#8217;an interpret <strong>&#8220;idol talk&#8221;</strong> to mean <strong>singing</strong> and it is equally applied to every sound produced by musical instruments and diversions. This is the view held by most scholars of the Qur&#8217;an (may Allah have mercy on them).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Commenting on the above Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse),<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `<strong>Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud </strong></span>(may Allah be pleased with him) swore: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;By Allah! The reference in this Ayah is to singing.&#8221; </span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">He would swear and say: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;Singing causes the seeds of hypocrisy to grow in the heart like water causes seeds of plants to grow.&#8221; </span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">This means that singing causes one to hate good and to love evil; to hate listening to the Qur&#8217;an and to love songs and diversion and other things of the sort. This is a type of hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">A hypocrite pretends to be associated with Islam. He pretends to be a believer while in fact he conceals Kufr. He pretends to love the Qur&#8217;an while in fact he does not. Music causes one to hate listening to the Qur&#8217;an or listening to someone calling to the way of Allah. It encourages the love of falsehood, speaking evil and obscene words. It not only causes the heart to deviate from the straight path but also to develop a fondness for what Allah (Glorified be He) has declared prohibited. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><strong>This has been proven by experience. Those who are in close contact with singers know how corrupt and spoiled they are because of their love of music and song</strong>. This brings about great evil to those who are accustomed to it. There is no power or might except with Allah.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Does it belong to the methodology of the Salaf to condemn the leaders, mention their errors and backbite them from the pulpits? How does one advise the rulers according to the methodology of the Salaf? How should it occur?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn Bâz</strong>: This question has been posed several times. It does not belong to the methodology of the Salaf to mention the shortcomings of the rulers from the pulpits. It leads to revolts and that people refrain from hearing and obeying in that which is allowed. It leads to something that only harms and benefits nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salaf&#8217;s followed methodology is to advise him in seclusion, write to him and let the scholars contact him so that they can lead him to that which is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sins should be mentioned without the mentioning of the sinner. Fornication, spirits and interest [all of these] should be condemned without condemning the one who falls into them. It is enough that one condemns the sins and warns against them without mentioning the sinner, regardless if he is the ruler or anybody else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the tribulation of &#8216;Uthmân&#8217;s (radhiya Allâhu &#8216;anh) time broke out, some people said to Usâmah bin Zayd (radhiya Allâhu &#8216;anh):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Will you not condemn &#8216;Uthmân?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Should I condemn him amongst the people? I will condemn him in seclusion without opening the gate of evil to the people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they initiated the evilness in the time of &#8216;Uthmân (radhiya Allâhu &#8216;anh) and condemned him publicly, the tribulation, battles and corruption became a fact. To this day one finds traces of all that. It led to the Fitnah between &#8216;Alî and Mu&#8217;âwiyah. &#8216;Uthmân and &#8216;Alî were killed because of it. Many companions and others were killed because of the public condemnation. As a result, the people started hating their ruler and killed him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Issue Issue No.4 &#8211; Jumâdal-Awwal 1417H / November 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CONCERNING MEN WEARING GOLD RINGS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is the ruling concerning a man wearing a gold ring, or what is known as a wedding-ring?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; answered:<br />
&#8220;It is not permissible for a man to wear gold rings. neither before or after marriage. This is due to the fact that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> prohibited gold, as occurs in the authentic narrations. So once when the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam </i>saw a man wearing a gold ring, he took it from him, threw it down and said: <i>&#8220;Does a person pick up a burning piece of coal and hold it in his hand.&#8221;</i> This was related by Muslim in his <i>Saheeh</i> (6/149). So in this is a proof that it is absolutely <i>haraam</i> (prohibited) for men to wear gold rings, even if it is a wedding ring.&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE RULING CONCERNING WISHING FOR DEATH DUE TO ENCOUNTERING MANY HARDSHIPS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: I have faced so many hardships in my life that it has made me hate this life. Every time I turned to Allaah and pleaded to Him to take my life at the earliest possible moment. This continues to be my wish up until now, as I do not see any solutions to my problems except death; it is the only thing that can save me from this torment. Is this behaviour <i>haraam</i> (forbidden) for me?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn al-&#8216;Uthaymeen &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;When a person wishes for death due to the hardships and afflictions that have befallen him, then he is doing something that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> prohibited, when he said: <i>&#8220;None of you should wish for death due to some harm that has come to him, rather, if he has such a wish then let him say: O Allaah! Give me life if You know that life is better for me. And give me death if You know that death is better for me.&#8221;</i>3 Therefore, it is not allowed for anyone to wish for death on account of some harm, hardship or difficulty that has come to him. In fact, he should have <i>sabr</i> (patience) and expect a reward from Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; due to his being patient, and he should wait for relief to come to him; just as the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;And know that victory comes with patience, relief with distress, and ease with hardship.&#8221;</i>4 So the one who is afflicted with any affliction should know that those afflictions are an expiation for some of the sins he has committed. Indeed, no Believer is afflicted with any kind of grief, pain or suffering except that Allaah expiates &#8211; due to that &#8211; some of his sins; even if it be the harm caused by a mere pricking of a thorn. So when a person has patience and hopes in a reward from Allaah, he reaches the level of being amongst the <i>saabiroon</i> (those who truly have patience), and this is a very lofty level. Allaah &#8211; the Most High said about its people:<b> &#8220;And give glad tidings to the apatient ones; those who, when afflicted by a calamity, say: Indeed we belong to Allaah, and to Him shall we truly return.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:155-156].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman in the question feels that there is no solution for her problems except death. I believe that this is a mistaken view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Death does not solve any problems. In fact, sometimes it only increases the difficulties. How many people die whilst being afflicted with calamities, difficulties and suffering, but they had been wronging themselves by sinning, and did not give up their sins or repent to Allaah. So death, in this case, is just a quicker coming of punishment. Perhaps if such a person had remained alive, then Allaah would have guided him him to the doors of repentance, seeking forgiveness, patience, facing up to the problems and expecting relief. All of this would have been good for him. Therefore, it is upon you &#8211; the questioner &#8211; to be patient and expect relief from Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; just as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said in His Book:<b> &#8220;So indeed with hardship here is relief. Indeed with hardship there is relief.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Inshiraah 94:5-6]. And the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said in the authentic narration: <i>&#8220;Victory comes with patience; relief with affliction, and ease with hardship.&#8221;</i>5&#8243;6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>FORCING A YOUNG LADY TO MARRY A MAN THAT SHE DOES NOT WANT TO MARRY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: Is it allowed for a father to force his daughter to marry a particular man that she does not want to marry?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; responded by saying:<br />
&#8220;Neither the father, or anyone other than the father, may force a woman who is under his guardianship to marry a man that she does not wish to marry. In fact her permission must be sought first. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;A previously married women (without a husband) must not be married until she is consulted, and a virgin is not married until her permission is sought.&#8221;</i> They said: O Messenger of Allaah, how is her permission sought? So he said: <i>&#8220;By her being silent.&#8221;</i>7 Another narration states: <i>&#8220;Her silence is her permission.&#8221;</i>8 Yet a third narration states: <i>&#8220;A virgin&#8217;s father seeks her permission, and her permission is her remaining silent.&#8221;</i>9 So the father must seek her permission if she is nine years of age or above. Likewise, her other guardians may not marry her off except by her permission. This is obligatory upon them all. If a lady is married without her permission, then the marriage will not be correct. This is because one of the conditions of a marriage contract is that both partners accept the marriage freely. So if she is married without her permission, by threat or coercion, then the marriage is null and void&#8230; If the (apparent) husband knows that she does not want him, then he should not approach the woman, even if the father approves of it. He must fear Allaah and not approach any wife that does not want him, even if the father claims that he did not coerce her. The man must avoid what Allaah has forbidden him. This is because Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> ordered that her permission be sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also advise the woman to fear Allaah and to accept the man if her father finds that he suitable to marry her, as long as the prospective groom is good in his Religion and in his character. This is also the case if the one who is the guardian is not the girl&#8217;s father. We give this advice because there is a lot of good and a lot of benefit in marriage. Likewise, there are a lot of hazards in living as a maiden. So I advise all young ladies to accept those men who come to them for marriage, if they conform to the compatibility factors of marriage (i.e. good in Religion and character), they should not use studying, teaching, or anything else, as an excuse to get married.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A RELIGIOUS YOUNG MAN PROPOSED TO ME BUT MY MOTHER REFUSED</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: I am seeking a solution to my problem. I am twenty-four years old. A young man proposed to me. He has finished college and is from a religious family. After my father agreed to him, he asked me to come and see him. I saw him and was pleased with him. [we saw each other] because our pure and noble Religion states that I should see him and that he should see me. However, when my mother came to realise that he was from a Religious family, she became harsh against him and my father. She swore that she would not allow such a marriage to take place. My father desperately tried to persuade her, but to no avail. Do I have the right to seek the [Islaamic] Law to intervene in this matter?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: Shaykh Ibn Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:<br />
&#8220;If the matter is as you have stated in your question, then your mother has no right to object, to this matter Indeed it is actually <i>haraam</i> (forbidden) for her to object in this case. You are not obliged to obey your mother in this particular issue, since the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Indeed obedience is only in ma&#8217;roof (when it is good and right).&#8221;</i>11 And it is not from <i>ma&#8217;roof</i> to reject a suitable marriage proposal. In fact, it has been narrated from the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> that he said: <i>&#8220;lf there comes to you a person whose Religion and character are pleasing to you, then marry him (i.e. give the girl in marriage to him). If you do not do this, there will be Fitnah (trial and discord) and great fasad (corruption) upon the earth.&#8221;12 If you have need to take your case to an [Islaamic] court of law, then you would not be wrong in doing so.&#8221;</i>13</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Issue No.7 &#8211; Rabî&#8217; ul-Awwal 1418H / July 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>IS CLINGING TO THE RELIGION A CAUSE OF AFFLICTION?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: There was a person in our city who was very firm in practicing the Religion, and was later afflicted with an illness. Some of the people started saying to him that the cause of him being afflicted with this illness is because of his adhering to the Religion. Being affected with this type of talk, the person then shaved off his beard and he neglected his Prayers. So is it permissible to say that the cause of his affliction was due to him clinging to the commandments of the Religion? And the one who says such a thing, is he considered a <i>kaafir</i> (disbeliever) because of such a saying?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8221;Clinging on to the Religion is not a cause for his illness. Rather, it is a cause for every good, both in this life and in the Hereafter. And it is not permissible for any Muslim, that when some foolish and ignorant people utter words such as this, to give them any weight. Nor is it permissible to shave one&#8217;s beard or shorten it, or to neglect guarding the five obligatory Prayers in congregation. Rather, it is obligatory for such a person to remain steadfast upon the truth, and to keep away from all that Allaah has prohibited, and to beware of all that which angers Allaah and incurs His punishment &#8211; by obeying Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, Allaah &#8211; the One free from all defects said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger will be admitted into Gardens of Paradise, beneath which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. That will be the greatest achievement. But whosoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger and oversteps His limits, Allaah will cast him in the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a humiliating punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:13-14]. And Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever has taqwaa (piety, fear and obedience) of Allaah, He will make a way out for him. And He will provide for him from places he could never imagine.&#8221;</b> [Soorah at-Talaaq 65:2-3]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever has taqwaa of Allaah, He will make his affair easy for him,&#8221; </b>[Soorah at-Talaaq 65:4]. And the verses with this meaning are plentiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who says that the cause for such affliction is due to being firm and steadfast upon the Religion &#8211; then such a person is ignorant. It is obligatory to censure such a person and to know that clinging to the Religion does not bring about anything except good. As for what occurs to a Muslim by way of a calamity that he dislikes, then this is a form of expiating his evil actions and a forgiveness for his sins. As regards to the issue of <i>takfeer</i> (declaring a Muslim to be a <i>kaafir</i>, a disbeliever) upon this person, then this requires detail, and is known from the chapters concerning the judgement upon a <i>murtad</i> (apostate) &#8211; which can be found in the books of Islaamic jurisprudence and understanding. And with Allaah is the power and ability.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>CRYING DUE TO ILLNESS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: I am ill and I sometimes cry because of what happens to me after my illness. Is this considered an action which opposes Allaah and of not being pleased with what He has decreed? I do not do this action willfully. Likewise, does that ruling also include talking to my relatives about my illness?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;There is no harm in crying, if it is simply tears coming from the eyes, without wailing. This is based upon the statement of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, when his son Ibraaheem passed away: <i>&#8220;The eye sheds tears and the heart grieves, yet we do not say anything except what is pleasing to our Lord. By your death &#8211; O Ibraaheem &#8211; we are indeed in grief.&#8221;</i>2 The <i>ahaadeeth</i> with this meaning are numerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also no harm in you speaking about your illness to your relatives and friends, providing that you praise and thank Allaah, glorify Him and ask Him for sound health, following the permissible means. We advise you to patiently persevere and to hope in a reward from Allaah. I give you the glad tidings, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has said: <b>&#8220;Only those who are patient shall recieve their reward in full, without reckoning.&#8221;</b> [Soorah az-Zumar 39:10]. The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;A Muslim is not afflicted with fatigue, sorrow, disease or pain &#8211; even if it be the pricking of a thorn &#8211; except that due to it, Allaah will expiate some of his sins.&#8221;</i>3 Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever Allaah intends good for, He afflicts him with some calamity.&#8221;</i>4 So we ask Allaah to grant you a cure and sound health, as well as goodness of the heart and actions. Indeed He is the One who hears and the One who responds.&#8221;5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SAFEGUARDING THE PRAYERS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: A leaflet was sent to us and with it was a copy of a page which has been distributed amongst the people, and which included a hadeeth attributed to the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> which said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever misses the Prayer due to laziness, then Allaah will punish him with fifteen punishments &#8230;&#8221;</i> So what is the authenticity of this particular hadeeth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;This hadeeth is a lie upon the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and there is no basis at all for it being authentic &#8211; as has been explained by al-Haafidh adh-Dhahabee, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, in <i>al-Meezaan</i> and al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr in <i>Lisaanul-Meezaan</i>. So it is a must that whosoever comes across such a leaflet that he burns it and that he admonishes the one who produced it, in order to defend the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and to protect his Sunnah from the lies of the liars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what has been Recorded in the great Qur&#8217;aan and the authentic Sunnah of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> -with regards to the importance of the Prayer and warning against being lazy in performing it and a threat for whosoever does this &#8211; is more than sufficient against the lies of the liars. So Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;Guard strictly your five daily Prayers and in particular the middle Prayer (i.e. the &#8216;Asr Prayer), and stand before Allaah with obedience.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:238]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: &#8220;And then there came after them a people who gave up their Prayer and followed their lusts. So they will be thrown into the Hellfire.&#8221; [Soorah Maryam 19:59]. And Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;So woe be upon those who pray; those who delay their Prayer from the fixed stated times.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;oon 107:3-4]. And the verses with this meaning are plentiful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;The covenant between us and them is the Salaah (Prayer), so whosoever abandons it has committed an act of disbelief.&#8221;</i> Recorded by Imaam Ahmad and the compilers of the four Sunan with a Saheeh (authentic) <i>isnaad</i> (chain of narration).6 And also his <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam&#8217;s</i> saying: <i>&#8220;Between a person and between al-Kufr (disbelief) and ash-Shirk (associating partners with Allaah in the worship of Allaah) is abandoning the Salaah (Prayer).&#8221; </i>Recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh (1/62). Also the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> mentions the Salaah (Prayer) to his Companions one day, saying: <i>&#8220;Whosoever safeguards them, then that will be a light, a proof and a means of salvation for him on the Day of Resurrection. But whosoever does not safeguard them, then he has no light, nor proof nor salvation and on the Day of Resurrection he will be gathered along with Fir&#8217;awn, Haamaan, Qaaroon and &#8216;Ubayy ibn Khalf.&#8221;</i> Recorded by Imaam Ahmad with a <i>Hasan isnaad</i>.7</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Scholars have said, in explanation to the above hadeeth, that whosoever leaves the Prayer, the he will be raised up, on the Day of Judgement, along with those <i>kaafirs</i> (disbelievers). Thus, if the reason for his leaving the Prayer was due to leadership, then he has resembled Fir&#8217;awn in this, and would be raised along with him and sent to the Fire of the Day of Resurrection. If the reason for leaving the Prayer was due to his ministerial post or a similar occupation, then he has resembled Haamaan, the minister to Fir&#8217;awn, and he will be raised along with him on the Day of Resurrection and sent to the Fire. If the reason for leaving the Prayer was due to wealth and false desires, then he has resembled Qaaroon &#8211; upon whom Allaah bestowed great wealth, yet he became arrogant against the truth and followed his false desires, due to this wealth &#8211; and would be raised up along with him on the Day of Resurrection and sent to the Fire. If the reason for leaving the Prayer was business, or other such social transactions and work, then he has resembled &#8216;Ubayy ibn Khalf, the famous trader from the disbelievers of Makkah &#8211; so he will be raised up along with him on the Day of Resurrection and sent to the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah for forgiveness and protection from their condition and the likes of their condition.&#8221;8</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PRAYING DURING THE FRIDAY SERMON</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: There was a discussion that took place between some brothers and myself regarding praying two rak&#8217;ahs upon entering the mosque and the Imaam is delivering the Friday <i>khutbah</i> (sermon). I ask you &#8211; O noble Shaykh &#8211; to give us a ruling concerning this. Is it allowed or not? The brothers who generally come and pray in the mosque are upon the <i>madhhab</i> of Imaam Maalik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: &#8220;The Sunnah upon entering the masjid (mosque) is to pray two <i>rak&#8217;ahs</i> of <i>tahyatul masjid </i>(a Prayer far greeting the mosque), even if the Imaam is delivering the Friday khutbah, due to the sayings of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>: <i>&#8220;When anyone of you enters the masjid, then let him not sit until he prays two rak&#8217;ahs.&#8221;</i> Recorded by al-Bukhaaree (1/293) and Muslim (2/155). Likewise Muslim relates in his Saheeh (3/1415), from Jaabir <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;When any of you comes on the day of Jumu&#8217;ah (Friday), and the Imaam is delivering the khutbah, then let him pray two rak&#8217;ahs and let him make them short.&#8221;</i> So this is a clear and authentic text concerning this issue. It is not permissible for anyone to oppose it. So perhaps this particular narration did not reach Imaam Maalik <i>rahimahullaah</i>, if it is established from him that he prohibited the praying of these two rak&#8217;ahs at the time of the khutbah. However, when the authentic Sunnah becomes clear, then it is not permissible to oppose it with the saying of anyone else &#8211; whosoever he may be.9 About this Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O you who Believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you. And if you differ in anything amongst yourselves then refer it to Allaah and His Messenger if you do believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and most suitable for final determination.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:59]. And He &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;And in whatever you differ, then the judgement belongs to Allaah,&#8221;</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:10]. And it is known that the judgement of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> is from the judgement of Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; as Allaah said: <b>&#8220;Whosoever obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:80]. And with Allaah rests the power and ability.&#8221;10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>BEING TOO SHY TO CENSURE EVIL</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[Q]</b>: I am a young woman who hates <i>gheebah</i> (backbiting) and <i>nameemah</i> (tale carrying). Sometimes I am amongst a group of people who speak about others and the begin to backbite and spread tales. In my soul, I hate and despise what they are doing, but I am too shy and therefore do not have the ability to make them stop. Also, I have no other place to go to get away from them. Allaah knows that I wish they would start talking about something else. So am I sinful in sitting with them, and what is the obligation upon me in this case? May Allaah grant you what is best for Islaam and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;In this case you are sinful, unless you repel the evil. If they accept that from you, then all praises are due to Allaah. If they do not accept that from you, then you must leave them and not sit with them. This is because Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; stated: <b>&#8220;When you see those engaged in false conversation about Our Verses, by mocking at them, then keep away from them until they turn to another topic.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-An&#8217;aam 6:68]. Likewise, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever sees an evil then let him change it by his hand. if he is unable to do this, then let him change it with his tongue. If he is unable to do this, then let him change it with his heart &#8211; and that is the weakest of eemaan (faith).&#8221;</i> This was Recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.49). And the verses and narrations with this meaning are plentiful.&#8221;11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>RUNNING AWAY FROM THE QUR&#8217;AAN</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Q]: What is your advice &#8211; O Shaykh &#8211; for those who go without reading the Qur&#8217;aan for a month, or even many months, and who have no excuse for such behaviors? However, you will find some of them reading those magazines that contain no benefit for them, and following them up closely!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A]: &#8220;It is recommended for every Believing man and woman to recite the Book of Allaah often, with due contemplation and understanding. This may be done by using a copy of the Qur&#8217;aan or from one&#8217;s memory. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;This is a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, that you may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Saad 38:29].And:<b> &#8220;Indeed those who recite the Book of Allaah and offer the Prayer perfectly and spend in charity out of what We have provided for them &#8211; secretly and openly &#8211; hope for a sure trade-gain that will never perish. That He may pay them their wages in full and give them even more out of His Grace. Indeed, He is Oft-Forgiving, ready to appreciate good deeds.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Faatir 35:29-30].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforementioned recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan includes both reciting and acting upon it. The recitation is to be done with contemplation and understanding of it. Sincerity to Allaah is a means of complying with and acting upon the Qur&#8217;aan, and its recitation contains a great reward &#8211; as the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Recite the Qur&#8217;aan. For on the Day of Resurrection, it shall come as an intercessor for its companion.&#8221;</i> This was recorded by Muslim in his Saheeh (no.804). The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also said: &#8220;The best of you is he who learns the Qur&#8217;aan and teaches it.&#8221; This was Recorded by al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh (3/66). Another narration states: <i>&#8220;Whosoever reads one harf (letter) of the Qur&#8217;aan shall receive a good deed and ten good deeds similar to it. I do not say that Alif Laam Meem is a harf but Alif is a harf and Laam is a harf and Meem is a harf.&#8221;</i>12 The Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said to &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8220;Amr ibn al-&#8216;Aas: <i>&#8220;Complete the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan once a month.&#8221;</i> He said: I am able to do more than that. So he said: <i>&#8220;Then complete its recital once in seven days.&#8221;</i>13 The Companions used to complete the entire Qur&#8217;aan once every seven days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise all the readers of the Qur&#8217;aan to increase in their reading of it, with contemplation and understanding it, along with sincerity to Allaah in this &#8211; with the purpose of learning and benefiting from the Qur&#8217;aan. They should read the entire Qur&#8217;aan once a month. If, however, they are able to do more than this without any difficulty, then they should complete it in less than this time. However, it is best not to complete it in less than three days, since this is the least amount of time that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> mentioned to &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Amr ibn al-&#8216;Aas. This is because if it is read in less than three days, the person becomes hasty and lacks thought and concentration &#8230;&#8221;14</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Saying Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Azhim upon finishing recitation of the Qur&#8217;an</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b></b><b>Q: I often hear that</b><b> saying Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim upon finishing recitation of the Glorious Qur&#8217;an </b>is an act of Bid`ah (innovation in religion). Other people told me that there was nothing wrong with it. Supporting their view, they quote the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) which reads:<b> <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 95" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85):"></a>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;Allâh has spoken the truth; follow the religion of Ibrâhîm (Abraham) Hanîfa (Islâmic Monotheism, i.e. he used to worship Allâh Alone) &#8221; </b>Some educated people also told me that whenever the Prophet (peace be upon him) wanted a Qur&#8217;an reciter to end his recitation, he would just say &#8220;That is enough&#8221;. Never did he use to ask him to say Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim. Therefore, would you kindly give a detailed explanation of the relevant ruling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b>Habitual saying of Sadaqa Allahu Al-Azhim upon concluding recitation of the Glorious Qur&#8217;an is not supported by any proof in the Shari`ah (Islamic Law) and should, therefore, not be used as a common practice. It belongs to the category of Bid`ah particularly when someone believes it to be an act of Sunnah. Such a practice must be given up.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">As for the Ayah which reads: &#8221; <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 95" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85):"></a>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;Allâh has spoken the truth &#8221; it has nothing to do with saying this expression. The Ayah simply means that the Prophet (peace be upon him) is commanded by Allah (Exalted be He) to make it clear to people that the revelations contained in the Tawrah (Torah), the Injil (Gospel) and all other heavenly revealed Scriptures are true.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">By the same token, clear revelations contained in the Glorious Qur&#8217;an are true. However, this does not establish a proof for the desirability to conclude reading of some Ayahs or a certain Surah of the Qur&#8217;an by saying: Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim. Neither the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor any of his Sahabah (Companions, may Allah be pleased with them) were authentically reported to have done such a practice. <a name="TheProphetoncelistenedtoIbn"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="110824" class="tip"></span>The Prophet once listened to Ibn Mas`ud reading Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;. Upon reaching the Ayah which reads: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 41" target="_blank" name="How(willitbe)then,whenWe"></a>How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as a witness against these people? &#8221; The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him:&#8221;That is enough&#8221;. Ibn Mas`ud said: &#8220;When I turned to him, I saw his eyes shedding tears.&#8221;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> The Prophet (peace be upon him) was moved to tears because the Ayah reminded him of the great horror of the Day of Resurrection. The Ayah reads: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 41" target="_blank" name="How(willitbe)then,whenWe"></a>How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) &#8221; <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 41" target="_blank" name="How(willitbe)then,whenWe"></a>&#8230;as a witness against these people &#8221; i.e. The Muslim people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">In short, there exists no evidence in the Shari`ah that makes it desirable to conclude recitation of the Qur&#8217;an by saying: Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim. This expression has to be left unsaid so that one would be following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them). However, there is nothing wrong if someone happens to say this expression unintentionally. Since Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) always speaks the truth, this expression of Sadaqa Allahu Al-Azhim has to be thought of as an absolute expression which should not be limited to a given time, place, or situation. Therefore, habitual recitation of this expression whenever one finishes reading the Qur&#8217;an has no evidence in its support as has been early mentioned.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, the Lords of the Worlds, and may peace and blessings of Allaah be upon the noblest of the Prophets and Messengers, our Prophet, Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions. As for what follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, Allaah, the Most Glorified, Most High has legislated purification for every prayer, because the elimination of impurity and the removal of pollution &#8211; whether on the body, the clothes or the place of prayer &#8211; are two of the conditions of prayer. So when the Muslim wishes to pray, he must perform the well known ablution <i>(Wudhu)</i> to purify himself from minor impurity, or make Ghusl if the impurity is of the major kind. And before making ablution, <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> must be performed with water, or <i>Istijmar</i> by the one who has urinated or defecated in order that the purification and cleansing be complete. What follows is an explanation of some of the rulings related to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with water is obligatory every time something is discharged from the bowel and bladder, such as urine or faeces. But it is not necessary for the sleeper or one who passes wind to perform <i>Istinja&#8217;</i>. He is only required to perform ablution, because <i>Istinja&#8217;</i>is only prescribed for the removal of impurity, and there is no impurity in this situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Istijmar</i> is performed using stones, or another material in its place (such as wood, paper etc.) It must consist of three clean stones, as proved by the Hadith of the Prophet<i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> which states that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;Whoever performs Istijmar, let him make it </i><i>Witr</i> (i.e. use an odd number of stones).&#8221;</span> [Abu Dawud no.35 and Ibn Majah no. 337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If any of you goes to defecate, he should take with him three stones, for they will be sufficient for him.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim narrated that he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> forbade <i>Istijmar</i> with less than three stones. It is not permissible to make <i>Istijmar</i> with animal droppings, bones or food or anything which contains some forbidden material. It is preferred for a person to perform <i>istijmar</i> with stones, or the like such as tissues etc. After which, he should use water, because the stones remove the essence of the pollution, but the water purifies the area and is therefore more thorough. A person has a choice of <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with water, or<i>Istijmar</i> with stones or the like. It is reported on the authority of Anas, may Allaah be pleased with him, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;The Prophet </i><i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> entered the toilet and I and a young boy like me carried materials, including water and <i>&#8216;anaza</i> (a short spear) and he would perform <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with the water.&#8221;</span> [al-Bukhari no.152 &amp; Muslim no.271.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the authority of &#8216;Aishah, may Allaah be pleased with her, that she said to a group of women:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Order your husbands to clean themselves following defecation with water, for I am too embarrassed to do so, and the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) used to do so.&#8221;</span></em> At-Tirmidhee said that it was authentic [At-Tirmidhee no.19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person wants to use only one of them (i.e. stones or water), it is preferred to choose water, because it cleans the area removing the essence and the traces and it is more thorough in cleansing. If he chooses to only use stones, he should content himself with three, if it cleanses the area, but if it is not enough, he may use four or five (or more) until he has cleaned the area, but it is better to finish with an odd number, based upon the saying of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever performs Istijmar, let him make it Witr.&#8221;</span></em> [Abu Dawud no.35 and Ibn Majah no. 337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissable to make the <i>Istijmar</i> with the right hand, according to the <i>Hadith</i> of Salman, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah forbade us from performing <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with the right hand.&#8221; And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;None of you should hold his penis in his right hand while he is urinating. nor should he wipe himself with the right hand after answering the call of nature.&#8221;</span> </i>[Al-Bukhari no.153 &amp; Muslim no.267]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if his left hand has been cut off, or is broken or there is some disease in it, he may use his right hand, and there is no objection to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the Islamic law is based upon facility and ease, Allaah, the Most Glorified, Most High has lightened the burden of worship on those who have some excuse, according to the excuse. He, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (He) has not laid upon you in religion any hardship</b>.&#8221; [Surah al-Hajj 22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.&#8221;</b>[Surah al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can.&#8221;</b> [Surah at-Taghabun 64:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If I order you to do something, do it as much as you can.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukharino.7288 &amp; Muslim no.1337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;Verily the Religion is ease.&#8221;</i> </span>[Narrated by al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a sick person is unable to cleanse himself of minor impurity with the water by making ablution, or he is unable to purify himself of major impurity by making <i>Ghusl</i>, due to weakness, or fear of making his illness worse, or delaying his recovery, he may perform<i>Tayammum</i> [Dry ablution using sand or dust.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is done by striking his hands in clean dust once, then wiping his face with the palms of his hands and his fingers slowly, based upon the Words of Him, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform <i>Tayammum</i> with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum). Truly, Allaah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.&#8221;</b> [Surah An-Nisa 4:43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ruling on those who are unable to use water is the same that of those who are unable to find water, according to the words of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukhari no. 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sick person may fall into one of a number of categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. If his illness is a simple one and he does not fear to use the water, such as an ailment from which there is no fear that using the water will delay his recovery, or increase his pain, or cause any infection, such as a headache, toothache and the like, or he is able to use warm water without harm, then it is not allowed for him to make <i>Tayammum</i>. Because the permission to perform it is in order to prevent harm, and there is no fear of harm to him, and because he can find water, therefore he must use it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If he fears from an illness which he fears may &#8211; should he use water &#8211; cause his death or harm one of his organs, or may lead to some illness which might cause his death or harm one of his organs, or cause the loss of some faculty, then it is permissible for him to perform <i>Tayammum</i>, based upon the words of the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allaah is Most Merciful to you.&#8221;</b>[Surah an-Nisa&#8217; 4:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If he is suffering from some illness which makes him unable to move, and he finds no one to bring him water, it is permissible for him to perform <i>Tayammum</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Anyone suffering from a wound, an ulcer or fracture, or any illness which will be exacerbated by using water, and who becomes <i>Junub</i> [in a state of sexual impurity] is allowed to perform <i>Tayammum</i>, based upon the above evidences. If he is able to wash the healthy areas of his body, he must do so and make <i>Tayammum</i> for the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sick person who is in a place in which he finds neither water nor dust, or anyone who can bring him either one of them, may pray whatever condition he is in, and he is not allowed to delay the prayer, as Allaah, the Most High say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can.&#8221;</b> [Surah at-Taghabun 64:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. An invalid afflicted with incontinence of urine, who is not cured by his treatment, must make ablution for every prayer after the start of its prescribed time, wash off any urine that has affected his body, and wear a clean garment for his prayer, if this is not a burden on him. But if it is, he is excused from it, based upon the Allaah Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (He) has not laid upon you in religion any hardship</b>.&#8221; [Surah al-Hajj 22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.&#8221;</b>[Surah al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the words of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If I order you to do something, do it as much as you cable.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukhari no.7288 &amp; Muslim no.1337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He must try to the best of his ability to prevent the spread of the urine to his clothes, or his body, or the place in which he will pray. And everything that invalidates ablution also invalidates <i>Tayammum</i>, and in addition, the ability to use water or its presence. And Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[Q]</b>: There was a discussion that took place between some brothers and myself regarding praying two rak’ahs upon entering the mosque and the Imaam is delivering the Friday <i>khutbah</i> (sermon). I ask you – O noble Shaykh – to give us a ruling concerning this. Is it allowed or not? The brothers who generally come and pray in the mosque are upon the <i>madhhab</i> of Imaam Maalik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[A]</b>: “The Sunnah upon entering the masjid (mosque) is to pray two <i>rak’ahs</i> of <i>tahyatul masjid </i>(a Prayer far greeting the mosque), even if the Imaam is delivering the Friday khutbah, due to the sayings of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“When anyone of you enters the masjid, then let him not sit until he prays two rak’ahs.”</i></span> Recorded by al-Bukhaaree (1/293) and Muslim (2/155).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise Muslim relates in his Saheeh (3/1415), from Jaabir <i>radiallaahu ‘anhu</i>, that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>“When any of you comes on the day of Jumu’ah (Friday), and the Imaam is delivering the khutbah, then let him pray two rak’ahs and let him make them short.”</i> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a clear and authentic text concerning this issue. It is not permissible for anyone to oppose it. So perhaps this particular narration did not reach Imaam Maalik <i>rahimahullaah</i>, if it is established from him that he prohibited the praying of these two rak’ahs at the time of the khutbah. However, when the authentic Sunnah becomes clear, then it is not permissible to oppose it with the saying of anyone else – whosoever he may be. [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About this Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“O you who Believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger and those in authority amongst you. And if you differ in anything amongst yourselves then refer it to Allaah and His Messenger if you do believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and most suitable for final determination.”</b> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4:59].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He – the Most Perfect – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And in whatever you differ, then the judgement belongs to Allaah,”</b> [Soorah ash-Shooraa 42:10].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is known that the judgement of Allaah’s Messenger <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i> is from the judgement of Allaah – the Mighty and Majestic – as Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Whosoever obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah.”</b>[Soorah an-Nisaa 4:80].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with Allaah rests the power and ability.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<i>Al-Fataawaa</i> (1/53)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Imaam an-Nawawee – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said about the hadeeth in <i>Sharh Saheeh Muslim</i> (6/ 164): “I cannot imagine any Scholar who comes to knows about it and believes in the correctness of it, and would then oppose it.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following are the excerpts from  A speech delivered by His Eminence at Al-Jami` Al-Kabir in Riyadh on 27/4/1400 A.H., published in His Eminence&#8217;s book &#8220;Collection of Miscellaneous Fatwas and Articles&#8221;, vol. 9, pp. 128-141. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Read the full speech  at <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=1375&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.net</a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If Allah wills to do good to a person, He makes them comprehend Din &#8216;religion&#8217;.</strong></span></em>&#8221; (Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This important Hadith shows us the excellence of comprehending Din.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Comprehending religion</strong> includes understanding the Qur&#8217;an, the Sunnah, and Islam. Islam covers the basics of Shari`ah, Allah&#8217;s Ordainment&#8217;s, His Prohibitions, a servant&#8217;s duty towards Allah and other servants and Allah&#8217;s fear, glorification, and watchfulness. In fact, the first step towards attaining knowledge is fearing Allah (Exalted be He), honoring His Sanctities, and watching Him in all deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever does not <strong>fear or be aware of Allah</strong> (Exalted be He) in their deeds, all their knowledge will be worthless. However, true beneficial knowledge and understanding of Din that leads to happiness is that which instills Allah&#8217;s Awe in a Muslim&#8217;s heart, directs them to honor Allah&#8217;s Sanctities, pushes them to obey Allah&#8217;s Orders and abstain from His Prohibitions, and urges them to call to Allah (Exalted be He) and to clarify Shari`ah to people. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So, anyone who is granted comprehension in religion in this way, Allah (Exalted be He) has indeed wanted to do them good.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, anyone deprived of these blessings will be among the ignorant, misguided and negligent who renounce attaining the knowledge that Allah (Exalted be He) has made obligatory. They will be among those whom Allah (Exalted be He) has not wanted to do good to them. Further, Allah (Exalted be He) talks about Kafirs (disbelievers) who turn away from the purpose of their creation, to teach us that it is our duty, as Muslims, to haste to comprehend religion and ask about any unclear matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But those who disbelieve turn away from that whereof they are warned</span></em>.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Ahqaf, 46: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, but turns away from them, forgetting what (deeds) his hands have sent forth.&#8221;  </span></em></strong>[Surah Al-Kahf, 18: 57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, it is the duty of a Muslim to seek for attaining knowledge in religion, to attend to, reflect on, and benefit from the Qur&#8217;an and pay great attention to, study, apply, and memorize the Sunnah as much as possible. When a person neglects these two basics, it is an indication that Allah (Exalted be He) did not will good for him. They are doomed since their heart is corrupt and deviating from the path to guidance. We ask Allah to protect and keep us away from whatever displeases Him!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear Muslims, it is incumbent upon us to learn our religion and know its rulings and to attend to, meditate, reflect on, recite, and apply the Qur&#8217;an. In addition, we should give great care to, memorize, apply and study the Sunnah along with asking about ambiguous matters. Muslims should ask those who have more knowledge to find out the correct answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So ask the people of the Scripture, if you do not know</strong></span></em>.&#8221; [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, a Muslim can attend knowledge lessons and benefit from them and study with other knowledgeable Muslims to benefit from them and add to himself. In this way, a Muslim can attain comprehension of religion and avoid the characteristics of the negligent and heedless.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;If Allah wills to do good to a person, He makes him comprehend the Din.&#8221; </strong></span></em>[1]</p>

<p><b>[Question]</b></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">Sometimes whilst praying – especially during <i>rukoo’</i> (bowing) and <i>sujood</i> (prostration) – part of the <i>awrah</i>(private parts) of a person becomes exposed due to his wearing trousers. So what is the ruling concerning the wearing of trousers whilst praying?</span></p>
<p><strong>[Answer] </strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> “If the man’s trousers cover what is between his navel and his knees and are loose fitting, wide and baggy, then it fulfills the condition for the correctness of the Prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what is more preferable is to wear a <strong><i>qamees</i> </strong>(long shirt) – which reaches half-way down to the shins, or just above the anklebone – over the trousers. This is a more complete form of covering the <i>awrah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Prayer in an <i>izaar</i> (a loose lower garment) is more preferable than Prayer in a pair of trousers without a long shirt – since the <i>izaar</i> far better covers the <i>awrah</i> than a pair of trousers.”</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Answered by the Noble Scholar and Muftee &#8211; Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdullaah bin Baaz &#8211; Al-Fataawaa (1/68-69).</em></span></div>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth: Morals and etiquette of the Da`ys to Allah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The morals and qualities necessary for a Da`y (caller to Islam) are highlighted by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) in many occurrences in the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>First: Devotedness.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory for a Da`y to be so devoted to Allah that he neither intends to show off, nor wants a good reputation or praise from people. Rather, he should only call to Allah to please Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;This is my way; I invite unto Allâh (i.e. to the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islâmic Monotheism).&#8221; </strong>[Surah Yusuf, 12: 108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And who is better in speech than he who [says: “My Lord is Allâh (believes in His Oneness)&#8221;</strong> [Surah Fussilat, 41: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you have to be devoted to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). It is the most important virtue and the greatest quality that has to characterize your way of Da`wah (call to Islam), i.e. seeking Allah and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Second: Knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Invite people to Allah with firm knowledge. You should not be unaware of or ignorant about what you call people to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;This is my way; I invite unto Allâh (i.e. to the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islâmic Monotheism) with sure knowledge.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Yusuf, 12: 108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge is a necessary obligation. You should not call people while you are ignorant nor talk about a topic you are unaware of. An ignorant person destroys and never constructs, spoils and never reforms. You, servants of Allah, have to fear Allah and never say anything about Him without knowledge. Likewise, you should never preach something unless you have sure knowledge and insight into what Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) said about it. Sure knowledge is indispensible and essential for a seeker of knowledge or a Da`y to be fully conversant with and have a deep knowledge of all the aspects of what he calls people to. He must also be sure of the proofs that substantiate his topic. Once he is sure of the truth of his points, he should then call people to them, regardless of whether it is a call to do something or to abandon something, i.e. an act of obedience to Allah and His Messenger or an act forbidden by Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call should be based on sure knowledge and insight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Among the qualifications necessary for a Da`y is that he should have patience, kindness, and gentleness with forbearing temperament as the prophets (peace be upon them) were.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never should a Da`y be rushing, violent, or unduly strict. Rather, he has to be patient, forbearing and kind while practicing Da`wah. To this effect, we have stated some evidence earlier. For example, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: And by the Mercy of Allâh, you dealt with them gently. In the story of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allâh).&#8221;</strong> [Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allah, whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is hard upon them, be hard upon him, and whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is kind to them, be kind to him.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Muslim, Sahih, Book on rulership, no. 1828; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 6, p. 93.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory for you, slaves of Allah, to be kind in your Da`wah, and not to be harsh with people. Do not make people turn away from Islam because of your harshness, ignorance or violent, harmful approach. It is thus obligatory for you to be forbearing, gentle, pleasant and lenient in speech so that your words may have an effect on the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect on one toward whom your Da`wah is directed. As such, people will receive your Da`wah better, will be affected by it and will show appreciation. On the contrary, harshness causes disaffection, alienation, and division, not unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Among the necessary etiquettes and attributes a Da`y should or even must have is to act upon what he is calling people to. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should be a good example for those whom he invites to Allah &#8211; that is, he should not call people to something which he himself does not do, or call people to abandon something that he himself does. This is the behavior of the losers &#8211; we seek Allah&#8217;s Refuge from this. But the winning believers call to the truth, act upon it, practicing it actively and vividly and never do what they forbid people to do. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do? Most hateful it is with Allâh that you say that which you do not do.&#8221;</strong>[Surah Al-Saff, 61: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted be He) also saysrebuking the Jews for enjoining righteousness while forgetting to practice it themselves:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Enjoin you Al-Birr (piety and righteousness and each and every act of obedience to Allâh) on the people and you forget (to practise it) yourselves, while you recite the Scripture [the Taurât (Torah)]! Have you then no sense?&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>On the Day of Resurrection, a man will be brought and thrown in Hellfire. His intestines will then pour forth and he will revolve around them like a donkey revolves around a millstone. The people of Hell would gather around him and say, &#8216;O so and so, what happened to you? Did you not use to command us to adhere to righteousness and forbid us to do wrong?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;Yes. But I used to enjoin righteousness but I did not practice it myself and I used to forbid wrong but I committed it.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Book on the beginning of creation, no. 3267; Muslim, Sahih, Book on asceticism and heart-softening narrations, no. 2989; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 5, p. 207.&#8217;)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This will be the case with whoever calls to Allah, enjoins good and prohibits evil while his words are contrary to his actions &#8211; we seek Allah&#8217;s Refuge from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, from among the most important and greatest attributes a Da`y has to be characterized by is to act upon that which he calls people to and not to do things that he prohibits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Da`y should have excellent behavior, good reputation, patience, persistence, sincerity and diligence in guiding people to goodness and keeping them away from falsehood. He should supplicate to Allah to guide the people whom he invites. He should supplicate for the people he invites to Allah, such as by saying, &#8220;May Allah guide you and open up your heart to accept the truth.&#8221; Thus, you should call and guide him, forbear his misbehavior and even supplicate to Allah to guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On hearing people saying about the tribe of Daws that they disobeyed, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allah, guide Daws and bring them (to Islam).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Jihad and military expeditions, no. 2937; Muslim, Sahih, Book on merits of the Companions, no. 2524; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 2, p. 243.&#8217;)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, you should supplicate to Allah for those you call to truth so that Allah may guide them and open up their hearts to the truth. You should show patience and persistence and do not lose hope. Moreover, you should say only that which is good and never rebuke or say bad words that might cause people to turn away from truth. However, if someone commits aggression and injustice, they will be given different treatment. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And argue not with the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), unless it be in (a way) that is better (with good words and in good manner, inviting them to Islâmic Monotheism with His Verses), except with such of them as do wrong&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-`Ankabut, 29: 46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the one who commits injustice through opposing the Da`wah with evil and enmity is to be dealt with in a different manner. If possible, such a person should be imprisoned or receive similar disciplinary punishment, which depends on the kind of injustice he commits. But as long as he causes no harm, you should be patient,seeking Allah&#8217;s Reward, and to argue with him in ways that are best. Anyway, if such a person causes you any personal harm, it is to be endured with patience as did Allah&#8217;s messengers and those who followed them in piety and righteousness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to grant us all the power to practice Da`wah in the best manner. May He reform our hearts and actions and grant us understanding of and holding fast to Islam. May Allah also make us among those who are guided, who guide others, are righteous and teach others righteousness. Surely He (Glorified and Exalted be He) is the most Supreme, the Most Noble. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon His Slave, Messenger and Prophet Muhammad, his family, Companions and all those who follow him in goodness until the Day of Judgment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 14777</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I am a married woman with children and I am a practicing Muslim &#8211; all praise be to Allah &#8211; but my husband smokes<strong> Shisha (hookah, water pipe)</strong>. I have advised him, in vain, to give it up. In fact, he has sworn by Allah that he will stop smoking it, but he has not done so. After this, I took an oath by Allah that, if he did not stop smoking, I would go to my parents, but he has not stopped and I have not gone to my parents. What should I do with my husband? What is the ruling on the oath that I took? What is the ruling on smoking Shisha? I hope that you will answer my letter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>First</strong>: smoking shisha is Haram (prohibited) because it is an obnoxious habit and includes many harmful effects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: It is Wajib (obligatory) on your husband to fulfill his oath and stop smoking Shisha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: You have done well to advise your husband to stop smoking Shisha. You should continue doing so and make Du‘a’ (supplication) to Allah for Him to guide your husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the oath that you broke, you have to make Kaffarah (expiation) for it and you should not go to stay with your parents.The Kaffarah is to feed ten Miskin (needy people), to clothe them, or to free a believing slave. If you are unable to do any of these things, you should observe Sawm (Fasting) for three days.<br />
May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p>Ruling on smoking and using hookah &#8211; Shaykh Ibn Baaz</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the ruling on smoking and using hookah? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Smoking and using hookah are prohibited, because they contain evil and much harm. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) made lawful for His servants all kinds of lawful and good things and made unlawful to them all kinds of evil things, as He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says to His Prophet (peace be upon him): <span style="color:#008000;">They ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) what is lawful for them (as food). Say: &#8220;Lawful unto you are At-Tayyibât [all kind of Halâl (lawful-good) foods which Allâh has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]</span>. Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says with regard to the description of His Prophet (peace be upon him): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibât (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabâ’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)&#8221;  </span>Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 157</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No type of smoking is from the lawful good things, but they are from the evil things due to their much harm. They are not from the lawful-good things which Allah (Exalted be He) permitted; therefore, they should be abandoned and o<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>ne should beware of approaching them and should strive against his evil soul to avoid these evil things, because the soul persists in evil, except those relieved by Allah&#8217;s Mercy.</strong></span> It is the duty of the believer to strive against his soul to set aside whatever harms him from these and other evil things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A 2005 WHO report states that smoking using a waterpipe poses a serious potential health hazard and is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. The average hookah session typically lasts more than 40 minutes, and consists of 50 to 200 inhalations that each range from 0.15 to 0.50 liters of smoke. <strong>In an hour-long smoking session of hookah, users consume about 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke of a cigarette</strong>. The chemical compositions of cigarette smoke and hookah smoke are different, however, as the workings of the charcoal in the modern hookah causes the tobacco mixture to be heated to a lower temperature, as opposed to the higher temperature in a cigarette where the tobacco is directly burnt. Consequently, the potential health effects of hookah smoke are expected to be very different.<sup id="cite_ref-Saad_58-0" class="reference"><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some young people today think that showing enmity towards disbelievers, those who reside in Islamic lands or those visiting here, is sanctioned by the Islamic legislation.

<p style="text-align:justify;">It’s <strong>forbidden</strong> to kill a non-Muslim resident or anyone who legitimately and legally entered the country with the permission of the government under a contract of safety (indicated by the issuance of a visa). Showing any type of aggression towards them is also <strong>impermissible</strong>. Any criminal actions that occur from them must be reported to the legitimate Islamic authorities.[1]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From<span id="ContentParagraph"><a id="ContentAnchor" href="http://www.alifta.net/Search/MoftyDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;Type=Mofty&amp;section=tafseer&amp;ID=2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="Abdul-AzizibnAbdullahibnBaz"> `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz </a></span>to any Muslim who reads this Fatwa. May Allah guide us all and grant us the means to make sincere repentance from all sins. Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace, Mercy and Blessings of Allah be upon you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a>&#8220;</a><span id="This was published on Sunday 7/5/1408 A.H. and this collection, vol. 13, p. 69."></span> :As you know, may Allah bestow His Mercy upon us all, that the ruler of Muslims, may Allah protect and guard him, gave directions for offering the <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">Rain Prayer </span></span>in the morning of Monday, 7 Jumadal-Ula, 1408 A.H., because <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>season is late this year and has not fallen in many places at its annually scheduled time. Muslims are in dire need of it, and they are desperately asking Allah to overwhelm them with His Mercy [Exalted and Sublime Be He], His Bounty and Kindness. He (Exalted and Glorified be He) has guided them to invoke and implore Him so that He grants them their needs with His Grace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most Glorified, assured them of answering their supplications, as He (Exalted and Glorified be He) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Ghafir, 40: 60" target="_blank" name="AndyourLordsaid:^InvokeMe,"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord said: &#8220;Invoke Me, I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islâmic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!</span>&#8220;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 186" target="_blank" name="AndwhenMyslavesaskyou(OMuhammad"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In other verses, He (Exalted and Glorified be He) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 55" target="_blank" name="InvokeyourLordwithhumility"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" style="color:#008000;" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 56" target="_blank" name="Anddonotdomischiefontheearth,"></a>And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order, and invoke Him with fear and hope. Surely, Allâh’s Mercy is (ever) near to the good-doers</span>&#8221; .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the early Muslims always turned to Allah seeking His Help in times of distress or adversity. He answered their invocations and granted them of His Bounties and Benevolence as He (Exalted and Glorified be He) said regarding the Battle of Badr,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 9" target="_blank" name="Remember)whenyousoughthelp"></a><span style="color:#008000;">(Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): &#8220;I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other (following one another) in succession</span>.&#8221;&#8221; .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When drought intensified in<span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Madinah </span>and its suburbs, Muslims requested the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to pray for <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain</span></span>. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> raised his hands while giving the Friday Sermon and prayed for <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>and repeated his supplication twice</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On another occasion he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out with them to the desert where he led them in<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> two Rak&#8217;ahs <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">prayer </span></span>similar to the &#8216;Eid <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">prayer</span></span></strong></span>. He supplicated his Lord asking Him for <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain</span></span>. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In this <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">prayer </span></span>he raised his hands and repeated the invocation many times and then inverted his garment.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Muslims also raised their hands in <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">prayer </span></span>and supplicated Allah. Then Allah sent down abundant <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain</span></span>, bestowed His Mercy upon them and removed their distress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted and Glorified be He) said: &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 21" target="_blank" name="IndeedintheMessengerofAll%C3%A2h"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allâh and the Last Day, and remembers Allâh much</span>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>most important means</strong></span> of obtaining Allah&#8217;s Mercy and being blessed with <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>is fearing Allah [Exalted and Sublime Be He], turning to Him in repentance from all sins, promoting all what is right and forbidding all what is evil, cooperating in matters of piety and righteousness, holding mutual consultation for the sake of Allah, advising each other with the truth and being steadfast in implementing it, being compassionate to the poor and the needy, consoling them and being generous to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted and Glorified be He) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 96" target="_blank" name="Andifthepeopleofthetowns"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwâ (piety), certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth</span>&#8221; till the end of the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He,Most Glorified, said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Talaq, 65: 2" target="_blank" name="Thenwhentheyareabouttoattain"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Talaq, 65: 4" target="_blank" name="Andthoseofyourwomenashave"></a><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted and Glorified be He) also said in another verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 56" target="_blank" name="Anddonotdomischiefontheearth,"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, Allâh’s Mercy is (ever) near to the doers of good</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 71" target="_blank" name="Thebelievers,menandwomen,are"></a><span style="color:#008000;">The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden); they perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give the Zakât, and obey Allâh and His Messenger. Allâh will have His Mercy on them. Surely Allâh is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</span>&#8220;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these noble verses, He (Exalted and Glorified be He) explained that fearing Allah, being kind to Allah&#8217;s servants and keeping upright and straight on the path of Allah are of the means of bringing about Allah&#8217;s Mercy to His servants, His kindness to them, sending down <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>and removing their distress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, fear Allah O servants of Allah! Be kind to His servants, and advise one another with truth and be steadfast and patient in doing so; cooperate among yourselves in acts piety and righteousness, promote what is right, forbid what is evil and repent altogether from all your sins. Hence your Sustainer (Exalted and Glorified be He) will encompass you with His Mercy upon you and send down blessed <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>for you. He will also give youwhatever you desire and withhold from you whatever you dislike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Almighty said: &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Nur, 24: 31" target="_blank" name="Andtellthebelievingwomento"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And all of you beg Allâh to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) advised us saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a name="Whoeverisnotmercifultoothers"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="405861"></span>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Whoever is not merciful to others will not be treated mercifully&#8221;</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Hadith he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a name="TheMostCompassionate(Allah)"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="405862"></span><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Compassionate (Allah) has mercy on those who are compassionate to people. If you show mercy to those on the earth, He Who is in the heaven will show mercy to you</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">&#8221; .</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;anic verses and Prophetic Hadiths urging people to observe piety, uprightness, mercy and kindness to those in need are many and well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah to rectify the affairs of all Muslims; to grant them sincere repentance from all sins; to send down the <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>for them out of His Grace and Bounty; to reconcile and unite their hearts on piety and good deeds; to protect everyone from the evils of their selves and to purify them from their sinful acts; to rid them of misguidance of tribulations; to support His Deen; to make His word the uppermost; to guide our rulers to what is good and beneficial forpeople and countries; to correct the behavior of their advisors and enable them to do all kinds of good. Indeed, He is the Grantor of all this and is the Most Omnipotent. Peace, Mercy and Blessings of Allah be upon you.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<a style="color:#008000;" name="Allah(GlorifiedandExaltedbe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="11401" class="tip"></span>“Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, ‘My Love is due to those who love one another for My Sake, who sit with one another for My Sake, who visit one another for My Sake, and who are generous to one another for My Sake.’”</span>&#8220;</span> (Related by Imam<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Malik </span>[may Allah be merciful to him] with a Sahih (authentic) Sanad (chain of narrators)][1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Also, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<a name="TherearesevenwhomAllahwill"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="11402" class="tip"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">There are seven whom Allah will shade with His Shade on the Day when there will be no shade but His Shade&#8230;”</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span> among them he (peace be upon him) mentioned: &#8220;<a name="Twomenwholoveeachotherfor"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="11402" class="tip"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">Two men who love each other for the sake of Allah, meeting for that and parting upon that.</span>”</span>&#8221; [2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The example given is that of two men, but the ruling is general and applies to two men or two women. Thus, if a Muslim visits another Muslim or non-Muslim for the purpose of calling them to Allah, teaching them and guiding them to goodness without seeking worldly gain or taking the Commands of Allah lightly, this is a good act.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">It is good for a Muslim woman to visit her sister in Islam and advise her to avoid Tabarruj (woman’s public display of her adornment or charms), unveiling the face or taking lightly what Allah prohibits. Similarly, it is good to visit her Christian or non-Christian female neighbor, such as a Buddhist woman or the like, to advise, teach, or instruct her. Actually, this comes under the heading of the Prophet’s words: &#8220;<a name="Religionissincerity(well-wishing)."></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="23000688" class="tip"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">Religion is sincerity (well-wishing). Religion is sincerity. Religion is sincerity.</span>”</span>&#8220;[3]  <strong>If she responds positively, all praise is to Allah; if she does not then you should give up the visits which do not serve any useful purpose.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Visiting for the purpose of gaining worldly benefits, playing, exchanging idle talks, eating or the like is not permissible to be made to non-Muslims, whether they are<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Christians </span>or others. Such visits may corrupt one’s religious commitment or morals, because the Kafirs (disbelievers) are enemies to us and we do not feel love towards them [as a reaction for their Shirk, disbelief, rejection of truth, enmity, sinning, transgression against Allah, etc. Ed]. Thus, we should not take them as protectors or confidants. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">However, visits are required when they are made for the purpose of calling to Allah, urging to do goodness, and warning against evil. In Surah (Qur’anic chapter) Al-Mumtahinah, Allah (Glorified be He) says: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: &#8220;Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh: we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allâh Alone&#8221;&#8221; </span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[</span><span id="ContentParagraph">Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60: 4]</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>An extract from my letter I sent to His Excellency Shaykh</b><b> Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy </b><b>concerning</b><b> the difference between `Ibadah and obedience</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On 2/4//1392 A.H.,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy </span>sent me a letter no. 1526, dated 2 Safar, 1392 A.H. explaining his case and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Tufayl&#8217;s, </span>his successor in the leadership of Islamic Group. I replied in the same year when I was the President of the Islamic University in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah </span>and the following is some of my reply:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some brothers from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Milbar </span>living in the country told me that Your Eminence opine that <em>`Ibadah is clarified by obedience and that when someone obeys another, he worships him. `Ibadah is also interpreted as enslavement and idolization. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar ibn Ahmad Al-Millibary, </span>owner of Al-Salsabil Magazine, wrote to me concerning this issue asserting what is mentioned about you and the Group. He sent me a copy of a survey pertaining to this question. You will find an enclosed copy of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This question appears strange for me so I determined to write to you before I receive your letter to know whether these statements which are attributed to you are true. So, please let me know your opinion. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I see that obedience has a wider scope than `Ibadah. Every act of `Ibadah a person does in compliance with Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah is seen as obedience, but not every act of obedience to anything other than Allah (Exalted be He) is seen as `Ibadah</strong></span>. This matter needs more elaboration. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Obedience to Allah (Exalted be He) is seen as `Ibadah when a person seeks to please Him. However, it may be valid or corrupt depending on whether the requirements of `Ibadah are met.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Please tell me in details your view on this question. It adds further explanation that `Ibadah may be denied when tainted with Shirkas Allah says concerning Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Kafirun, 109: 3" target="_blank" name="NorwillyouworshipthatwhichIworship"></a>&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Nor will you worship that which I worship</span></strong>.&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Kafirun, 109: 3</span> . Ibadah is negated because of their acts of Shirk. It is known that they worship Allah (Exalted be He) during times of hardships through showing Tawhid, performing Hajj and `Umrah, offering Sadaqah and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since these acts of `Ibadah are spoiled by Shirk, disbelief in the Hereafter and other kinds of disbelief during times of prosperity, it is permissible to negate the `Ibadah of people who show it. Furthermore, I would like to explain another point.<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> The person who obeys the authorities or rulers in something forbidden by Allah (Exalted be He) is not seen worshipping them when he does not believe in the permissibility of obedience to anyone in something opposing Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah. They rather obey these rules out of fear of their evils or vain desires while they know that they are sinful. Due to their act of obedience, such persons are sinners, not Mushriks, unless they obey such rulers in matters which do not involve Shirk. Examples of these matters include striking, killing, and taking someone&#8217;s money unjustly.</strong></span> There are many other examples that come under this heading. I think this view is known by the people of knowledge whose status is below yours. I find it imperative to ask you about this and know your detailed opinion so that I can refute any claim against you and support you with sure knowledge and show the truth concerning the Islamic Group to any one who seeks it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If what is attributed to you is true, we can discuss it thoroughly and examine the problematic issues using the evidence. The truth is the long-sought aim of everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah (Exalted be He) to grant us success to do what pleases Him and to comprehend His Religion and to adhere to it. May Allah purify our hearts and deeds and make the truth our long-sought aim wherever we are, for He is the Most Generous. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b></b><b></b><b>Q: Could you please tell us about the reward that Allah prepares for the patient in this world and in the hereafter and those who are obedient to Him (Exalted be He)?</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b>Allah (Glorified be He) created mankind and Jinn (creatures created from fire) to worship Him Alone and not to associate any partner with Him. He (Exalted be He) thus says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;And I (Allâh) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody" style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Dhariyat, 51: 56</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"> &#8220;O mankind! Worship your Lord (Allâh), Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become Al-Muttaqûn (the pious &#8211; See V.2:2).&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 21</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The `Ibadah (worship) that mankind and Jinn are created for and commanded to do is to obey Allah (Exalted be He), avoid His prohibitions, and mention Him abundantly. The essence of `Ibadah is to believe in Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and to manifest this through making Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to Allah Alone, fearing Allah Alone, longing for His Mercy, and being sincere to Him in all forms of `Ibadah such as Salah (Prayer), Sawm (Fast), and so on.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) promises His obedient slaves that He will bestow upon them abundant goodness and praised rewards in this world and in the hereafter. Allah (Exalted be He) promised them that He will grant them Jannah (Paradise) and dignity in the Hereafter. Thus, Allah (Exalted be He) says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"> &#8220;So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for Al-Muttaqûn (the pious)&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Hud, 11: 49</span></span><strong><span class="HarfBody"><br />
</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) also says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;&#8230;but give glad tidings to As-Sâbirûn (the patient).&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 155</span></span><strong><span class="HarfBody"><br />
</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"> &#8220;Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly! To Allâh we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 156</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;They are those on whom are the Salawât (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.&#8221; </strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 157</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning.&#8221; </strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 10</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Whoever works righteousness &#8211; whether male or female &#8211; while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islâmic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter).&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 97</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;<a style="color:#000000;" name="Nobodyisgivenablessingbetter"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="15206" class="tip"></span>Nobody is given a blessing better and greater than patience.</span>&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[1]</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;<a style="color:#000000;" name="Wonderfularetheaffairsofa"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="10537" class="tip"></span>Wonderful are the affairs of a believer, for there is good in every affair of them. If they have an occasion to feel delight, they thank &#8216;Allah&#8217;, thus there is good for them in it; and if they suffer from an affliction, they endure it patiently, which is good for them. This is not the case with anyone else except a believer.</span>&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[2]</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the patient person has a praised reward in this world and in the hereafter or he will be rewarded in Jannah and dignified in the hereafter. It is worth mentioning that such a reward will only be given to the patient person who shows patience regarding being pious, adherence to obedience of Allah, and enduring the hardships that they encounter in this world; poverty, illness, and so on. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to Allâh, etc.) that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Al-Birr is (the quality of) the one who believes in Allâh, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 177</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;&#8230;and who are patient in extreme poverty and ailment (disease) and at the time of fighting (during the battles). Such are the people of the truth and they are Al-Muttaqûn (the pious).&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 177</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Generally speaking, patience and piety always lead to praised consequences. Allah (Exalted be He) tells the believers regarding their enemy: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">&#8220;But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaqûn [the pious &#8211; See V.2:2], not the least harm will their cunning do to you.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q : A brother from Dar&#8217;a, Syria asks: What is the correct opinion about the stories narrated from one of the famous leaders of Sufism, Al-Sayyid <strong>Ahmad Al-Rifa&#8217;y</strong> that he visited the Mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in Al-Madinah and supplicated at the Prophet&#8217;s grave. The Messenger (peace be upon him) then stretched his hand out to him and he kissed it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">This is a widespread belief among the followers of his Tariqah (Sufi order). It is a belief they hold firmly, even though he lived in the 6th century A.H. How true is this story?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">A : This is false and baseless, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) died as decreed by Allah (Glorified be He) who says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30" target="_blank" name="Verilyyou(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Verily you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will die, and verily they (too) will die.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> [Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">According to a Sahih Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah has angels roaming around the land; if they find anyone greeting me, they carry back these greetings to me.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">There is no one who sends greetings upon me but Allah will restore my soul to me so that I may return his greeting.</span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) said: <a name="Themostexcellentofyourdays"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">The most excellent of your days is Friday; so invoke more blessings on me on that day, for your blessings will be submitted to me.</span> The people asked: O Messenger of Allah, how can it be that our blessings will be submitted to you while your body is decayed? He replied: <span style="color:#008000;">Allah, the Exalted, has prohibited the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets. </span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths which say similar things but it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that he would shake hands with anybody</strong></span>. This indicates that this story is false. Even if we were to assume that it is true, then it could be that this was a <strong>shaytaan</strong> (devil) who shook hands with him in order to deceive him and lead him and others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What all Muslims have to do is to fear Allah and adhere to His Shari`ah, which is indicated in His Noble Book and in the Sunnah of His trustworthy Messenger, and beware of anything that goes against that. May Allah reform the Muslims and grant them understanding of His religion and cause them to adhere to His Shari`ah, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b>If these insects are harmful, it is permissible to kill them by insecticides and the like, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>not by burning</strong></span>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The Prophet (peace be upon him said): <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#008000;">Five kinds of animals are harmful and may be killed even in the Haram (all areas within the Sacred Sanctuary of Makkah): The crow, the kite, the scorpion, the mouse, and the rabid dog </span></span></span><strong><span id="ContentParagraph">[1]<a href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/" target="_blank"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#008000;">.</span></span></a></span></strong><span class="HarfBody">According to another authentic narration, the viper was mentioned among the animals that may be killed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">This authentic Hadith reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) indicates the <strong>permissibility of killing harmful creatures, such as ants, cockroaches, mosquitoes, flies, and predators</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">However, if ants cause no harm, they are not to be killed. <a name="TheProphet(peacebeuponhim)"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="19794" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited killing <strong>ants, bees, hoopoes, and sparrow-hawks</strong></span>.<strong>[2]</strong> </span>This case only applies when they cause no harm.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">However, when harm is perceived, they take the same ruling of the harmful animals mentioned in the Hadith. May Allah grant us success.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>If these <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">insects </span></span>are harmful and electric shock is the only way to get rid of them, it will be permissible to use it</strong>. This will be an exceptional case of the Prophet&#8217;s order to kill in a good way, since the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="Fivekindsofanimalsaremischief-doers"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="19799"></span>Five kinds of animals are mischief-doers and may be killed even in the precincts of Ka`bah or in the state of Ihram: They are the crow, the kite, the scorpion, the mouse, and the dog known for biting people.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Also, the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered to dip the flies [if they fall] into the water that may often cause their death.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Fatwas of Ibn Baz &gt; Volume 8 &gt; Ruling on saying &#8220;Whatever is good is from Allah while evil and sin are from ourselves and Satan&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: <span style="color:#993300;">We received a question from Makkah and it reads: Some Du`ah (callers to Islam) and lecturers say at the end of their lecture, &#8220;Whatever is good is from Allah while evil and sin are from ourselves and Satan.&#8221; What is the ruling on saying that? Please, enlighten us. May Allah enlighten you!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>There is nothing wrong &#8211; I see &#8211; with saying that, as it is the truth</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A lecturer, teacher, preacher or anyone else giving advice should observe Taqwa (fear/wariness of offending Allah) and seek the truth. If they do well, it is due to Allah&#8217;s Favor on them and if they err, it is due to their negligence and Satan. Allah (Glorified be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) are free from such error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah is the Grantor of success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Fatwas of Ibn Baz &gt; Volume 8 &gt; A note concerning a false report circulated by some ignorant people</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah. May Allah&#8217;s Blessings and Peace be upon the slave and Messenger of Allah, our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have come across a false report that is being disseminated by some ignorant people who have little understanding of the religion of Allah.<b> The text of this report is as follows:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><b> </b><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Peace and blessings be upon the noblest of the messengers, our Master Muhammad (peace be upon him), and upon his family and Companions! Allah (Exalted be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#993300;" title="Surah Yunus, 10: 62" target="_blank" name="Nodoubt!Verily,theAuliy%C3%A2%E2%80%99of"></a><span style="color:#008000;">No doubt! Verily, the Auliyâ’ of Allâh [i.e. those who believe in the Oneness of Allâh and fear Allâh much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden), and love Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)], no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve.</span> Allah is Most Truthful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">My Muslim brother, my Muslim sister. A thirteen-year-old girl was inflicted with hard illness and the doctor failed to treat her. One night her sickness grew worse and she wept until sleep overtook her. In her dream, she saw Sayyidah<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Zaynab </span>(may Allah be pleased with her). She put some drops in her mouth, and when she woke up she was completely healed from her sickness. Sayyidah<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Zaynab </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) asked her to write this story thirteen times and distribute it to the Muslims to demonstrate the power of the Creator, may He be Exalted, and how it is manifested in His signs and His creation, Exalted be He above all that they associate with Him. The girl did what she was asked to do, and this is what happened:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>1 – The first copy </b>fell into the hands of a poor man, who wrote it out and distributed it. Thirteen days later, the Lord willed that this poor man should become rich.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>2 – The second copy </b>fell into the hands of a worker who ignored it. Thirteen days later he lost his job.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>3 – The third copy </b>fell into the hands of a rich man, who refused to write it out. Thirteen days later, he lost all the riches that he possessed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">Hasten, O Muslim brother or sister, after reading this story, to copy it out thirteen times and distribute it to people, so that you may get what you wish for from the Most Generous Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings upon our Master Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I read this false report, I thought it is necessary to point out that the benefits and good things that the author claims will come to those who copy and distribute it, and the bad things that will happen to those who ignore it and do not disseminate it further, are all lies and baseless. Rather, they are fabrications of the liars and charlatans. They want to divert the Muslims from putting their trust in their Lord alone, with no partner or associate, to bring them benefits and ward off harm, as well as taking the permissible means as prescribed in the Shari`ah (Islamic law). They also want them to put their trust in someone or something other than Allah to bring benefits and ward off harm and to take false means that are not permitted or prescribed in the Shari`ah, which lead them to become attached to something other than Allah and to worship someone other than Him. Undoubtedly, this is one of the plots of the enemies against the Muslims, who want to divert them away from their true Din (religion) of Islam by any means possible. The Muslims should beware of these plots and not be deceived by them. The Muslim should pay no attention to this false report and similar reports which appear from time to time. Warnings have been issued about several of them in the past. It is not permissible for a Muslim to copy out this and similar reports, or to distribute them under any circumstances. Rather, doing so is an evil action and a person who does that is committing a sin; there is the fear that he will be punished in this world and in the Hereafter, because this isBid`ah (innovation in religion) whose evil is great and whose punishment is severe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This report is a kind of reprehensible Bid`ah and is one of the means that lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and overestimation of Ahl-ul-Bayt (members of the Prophet&#8217;s extended Muslim family) and others among the dead; calling upon them instead of Allah, seeking their help, and thinking that they can bring benefit or ward off harm from those who call upon them and seek their help. It is also a kind of telling lies about Allah. Allah (Glorified be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 105" target="_blank" name="Itisonlythosewhobelievenot"></a><span style="color:#008000;">It is only those who believe not in the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh, who fabricate falsehood, and it is they who are liars</span>. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <a name="Hewhoinnovatesthingsinour"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="18424" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#008000;">He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected.</span></span> (Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Muslims who receive this letter should tear it up, destroy it, warn people against it and pay no attention to any promises or warnings that it may contain, because these are false reports that have no sound basis and nothing good or bad will result from it. But the one who invents it, those who copy it out and distribute it, and those who promote it and disseminate it among the Muslims are all sinful, because all of that comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression which Allah has forbidden in His Book, where He (Glorified be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 2" target="_blank" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Violatenot"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwâ (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is Severe in punishment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to keep us and all the Muslims safe and sound from all evil. Allah is Sufficient for us and He is the best to deal with those who fabricated this report and similar reports, and introduced into the religion of Allah things that have nothing to do with it. We ask Allah to deal with them as they deserve, for telling lies about Allah, disseminating falsehood, calling people to the means that lead to Shirk and exaggeration about the dead and distracting them with something that will harm them and will not benefit them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sincerity towards Allah and His slaves demands that we point this out. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon His slave and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;">Content &gt; Volume 8 &gt; Answers to some questions submitted by students to His Eminence &gt; How to wake up for Fajr Prayer everyday  </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q : <span style="color:#993300;">What are the methods I can use in order not to miss the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer? I go to bed early but wake up after sunrise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Every Muslim has to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>fear Allah</strong></span> (Exalted be He) and offer the Five Obligatory Daily Prayers at their appointed times. He has to try all means that help him in this regard. One of the means that he can try in order to offer the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer in congregation is to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>sleep early</strong></span> and to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>set the alarm</strong></span> for the Fajr prayer time. In this way he will be able to arise at the right time and attend the congregational Prayer. He should also<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ask Allah (Exalted be He) to help him</strong></span> wake up at Fajr time. Another means he can try is to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>recite the Dhikr (remembrance of Allah)</strong></span> which is said upon sleeping. This way, Allah (Exalted be He) will help him wake up to offer Fajr Prayer in congregation.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Purchasing products from non-Muslims is of course permissible. The prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) used to buy things from Jews. Even when he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) died, his shield was in the possession of a Jewish man, pawned for food to feed his (the prophet’s) family. He used to clarify to people their (the non-Muslims) beliefs so that people would not take  them as their closest and most intimate friends. But as for buying things from them for  which there is a need, then this is a simple matter. [1]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">From Shaykh, <em>Allaama, Mufti</em> of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Abdul Azeez bin Abdullaah Bin Baz</span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">by Umm Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Noble Shaykh Bin Baz <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The reward for reciting the Book of Allaah is evident. Is there a reward for reading Hadeeth too?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is a great reward for reading the Noble Qur’an in terms of coming closer to Allaah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala, as is reading and memorizing the Hadeeth of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. And this is because it is worship of Allaah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala (in pursuit of) acquiring knowledge and a greater understanding of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Evidence in the <em>Shariah</em> indicates that seeking knowledge and gaining an understanding of the religion is obligatory in order for the slave to worship His Lord upon firm knowledge (<em>Baseerah</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this evidence is the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever Allaah wills good for He grants them the understanding of the Deen (religion)’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The best of you are those who learn the Qur’aan and teach it’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever treads a path seeking knowledge on that path, then Allaah makes the path to paradise easy for him due to his seeking knowledge, and no group of people gather in one of the houses of Allah reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it, except tranquility descends and they are covered with Mercy and the angels surround them and Allaah mentions them to those who are close to Him’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many Hadeeth regarding the virtues of reciting the Qur’aan such as the saying of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Recite the Qur’aan for verily it will come as an intercession for the one who recites it on the Day of Resurrection’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And one day the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> came out and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Who would like to go to <em>Bathaan</em> (a valley in Medina) or to <em>al-Aqeeq</em> (a valley in Makkah) and return with two great female camels, without sinning and without severing the ties of kinship?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Messenger of Allaah we would love that’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘If one of you went to the masjid and learnt or read two <em>Ayaat</em> from the Book of Allah Azza wa Jal  (that) is better for him than two female camels and three <em>Ayaat</em> are better than four female camels and in addition to that the same amount in male camels’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As is collected by Imam Muslim in ‘Saheeh Muslim’ and this is an evidence concerning the virtue of reciting the Qur’aan and teaching it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is (another) famous Hadeeth from Ibn Mas’ood which is collected in ‘Jamia Tirmidhi’ with a <em>Hassan</em> (good) chain of narrators that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever reads one letter from the Book of Allaah he gets one reward for it and one reward is equivalent to ten times the reward of it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is the same for reading the Sunnah, if a believer learns it by reading the<em>Ahadeeth</em> and studying them and memorizing them, distinguishing the authentic from the non authentic, then he will receive a great reward. This is because this is considered acquiring knowledge, concerning which the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever treads a path seeking knowledge on that path, then Allaah makes the path to paradise easy for him due to his seeking knowledge, and no group of people gather in one of the houses of Allaah reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it, except tranquility descends and they are covered with Mercy and the angels surround them and Allaah mentions them to those who are close to Him’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is proof of reading the <em>Ayaat</em> and reflecting upon them, studying Hadeeth and memorizing them, desiring knowledge and (desiring) an understanding of the religion and acting upon it (consequently) is from (one of the reasons) for entering paradise and being saved from the hell-fire. As the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever Allah wills good for He grants them the understanding of the Deen (religion)’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a consensus with regard to its authenticity and it clarifies the virtue of knowledge and seeking it, and that is a sign of goodness as we clarified earlier. And the understanding of the <em>Deen</em> is attained through the Book (The Qur’aan) and through the Sunnah (Hadeeth) therefore (attaining the) understanding the Sunnah is a sign that Allah has intended goodness for His slave, there is a lot of evidence to substantiate (this point).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is for Allah Lord of the worlds</p>
