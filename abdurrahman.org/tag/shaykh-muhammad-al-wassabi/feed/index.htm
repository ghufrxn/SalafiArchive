										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The tenth door is Material Means :</strong> The Sheikh says from those means are those material means like for instance being a farmer, a merchant or a manufacturer – any means from the material means as long as you don’t destroy yourself. You were not created for the purpose of the Dunya. You were created for the purpose of Allaah (azza wa jal) i.e for the purpose of worship and the most important thing is satisfaction and continence, i.e self-control with regards to passions and seeking self-sufficiency from Allaah and satisfaction in Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you know that some people only have a motor and Allaah made his sustenance from that –– the sustenance of his family, that one motor. And some of them a donkey, and some people from villages have only one donkey and he spends from that for his whole family. Some a camel, some an ox —- he tilts for the people and supports the family. And for some of them an electric tool, or pliers and support from this a whole family. Some of them have 3, 4, 5, items in his possessions, he sells and spends on his family. And others have miswaak and he spends on his family. And another has perfume of antimony (khul) and he spends on his family. So it is more a means that you work by.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As you would say : ‘O Allaah this is the dua and it is upon You to answer it.’ In the same way you say : ‘O Allaah this is the means and it is upon You to provide for me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>You don’t depend upon the means.</strong></span> Because if you depend upon the means and only the means then you would have depended or put your trust in other than Allaah — and this is not permissible. This is a mere means. If it wasn’t for the fact that Allaah ordered us to take towards the means, we would have not taken towards it. However, it is an order of Allaah and look at Maryam (alaihissalam) while she was in her post-natal bleeding, Allaah says to her :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">‘And shake the trunk of the date palm towards you and it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. ‘</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this state of pregnancy while being weak and with that He still said : ‘Shake the trunk of the date palm towards you.’ There must be working by the means. Work by the means. We are not dervishes — people that do nothing. We are Muslims and people of daleel and people of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah. We work by the means — in a safe correct means that which does not come in conflict with the deen. i.e. the means is not something unlegislated by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One person who might say, ‘we steal’ and this is a means. The other may say, ‘we fornicate’ and this is a means. Another sells intoxicants and says ‘this is a means.’ These means are unlegislated, forbidden. Or asks for bribes or robs or plunders and says ‘this is a means’ or cheats and deceives and says ‘this is a means.’ No, there must be with regards to the means that they have to be legislated from what Allaah has made halaal, not being any disobedience in it, not having any opposition to the deen of Allaah. He mentioned the ayah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">‘And shake the trunk of the date palm towards you and it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. ‘</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sheikh reiterates that every time he entered the mihrab — the praying place of the private room, he (Zakariya) found her (Maryam) supplied with sustenance even though Allaah told us this about her. He found with her sustenance. He (Zakariya) said : O Maryam, from where did you get this? She said : From Allaah. Verily, Allaah provides sustenance to whom He wills without limit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at that time Zakariyya invoked his Lord. If you work with the legislated, trusted means, you are trusting in Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) and by Allaah your rizq will come to you, no doubt. And I have put forward for you examples and Allaah puts forward parables for the people so they can reflect. I said to you : a person spends on his family by selling ‘miswaak and that one spends on his family by being a seller of oil, and that one a seller of ghee and that one a seller of honey and that one is a seller of wheat. He sells wheat and that one is a ‘bazzaar’ and he sells seeds. The books of biographies are filled with this, that of our pious predecessors. And that one is ‘al-Kayyaal’ — he has a scale and he weighs things for people and they pay him and that one fixes shoes, nails it and ties it. Up until now all what I mentioned is present and it is a sign from the signs of Allaah and ar-Razzaaq, He is Allaah (azzawajal) and you may very well find that a person who fixes shoes is in a state of self-contentment than a big merchant and a big manager. Or a ‘sayy aathi’ —- the one who fixes watches and sells watches. You may very well find him in a state of contentment. He has 4 watches in his possessions and he sells it, goes home and is comfortable. You may not find this self-contentment with a merchant or a big manager. Each one of them — his head is filled with problems and he doesn’t find comfort in his sleep and is not patient, and is not resting. Everything is preoccupation and stress and a lot of them become victims to diabetes, cancer and asthma. The other one is comfortable i.e the one who sells honey, wheat, watches etc. He is content with himself. He is not concerned with taxes or he is not concerned with the rent of a store or show room. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the most important thing is self-contentment.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Khutbatul Haajah the Sheikh mentions our subject tonight deals with: The means of getting sustenance and the doors towards sustenance. This subject in which everyone likes it, however many of them went wrong in the way of going about it. So, the Muslim knows the legislated means and doors towards attaining sustenance of which Allaah has mentioned in the Qura’an and of the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم has mentioned and carried those legislated means out he would have gained what has been promised to him. And sometimes these means are called ‘Abwaabur Rizq’ or ‘Abwaabul Furaj’ i.e doors towards relaxation and relief or if you wish to say ‘Abwaabul Rizq’ – doors towards obtaining sustenance or if you wish then say ‘Asbaabur Rizq’ i.e the means of sustenance. So the first means insha-Allaah (the students of knowledge should write these down in the notebooks with the proofs which we will mention from the Qura’an and the Sunnah). The Sheikh continues with the first door of means is :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1. Al-Istiaqaamah (Steadfastness on the Deen of Allaah)</strong> : Al-Istiqaamah of the Deen is a door from the doors of relief from difficulty and a door from the doors of sustenance and a means from the means of sustenance. Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘and if only they had believed in Allaah and had Istiqaamah on the right way, We would surely have bestowed upon them water (rain) in abundance.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Istiqaamah on the Book and the Sunnah and holding onto them wholeheartedly without increasing in them or taking away from them, this is a door from the doors of relief from discomfort, and a door from the doors of sustenance and a means from its means. On the contrary it is from the greatest means of Rizq in the Dunya and the Aakhirah. And if you knew the following means you would have known how much the people had gone away from them these days except whom Allaah has had mercy on. They want Rizq but they went wrong in the ways of attaining it and the doors towards it and its means except who Allaah has had mercy on them and they are very few. Even to the point where it might come to the thought of a person that if he wants rizq all he has to do is engross himself in pursuing the dunya and leave off the ‘Asbaab-al-Shar’eeah’ – (that is the means designated by the Shariah). So he doesn’t find except adverse hardship and you ofcourse know what rain has of benefits for the Ummah. The Sheikh mentions the ayah in Surahtul Anbiah :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘We made all things living from water.’</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When rain comes, i.e the rain that has the mercy of Allaah with it, all of the good in turn comes – the earth vegetates fruits and various herbs and waters in rivers become plentiful and the cattle and the riding beasts benefit and the good of humans and animals become abundant and agriculture becomes successful and ghee and honey becomes abundant, and sheep, cattle becomes abundant and the market prices become lower. And even the heat it gets lowered a great deal from the people. The Sheikh mentions the ayah again :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘and if only they had Istiqaamah on the right path, We would have given them water (rain) from the sky in abundance.’</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Istiqaamah as you know as Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) says :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘That is verily those who say, “Our Lord is Allaah, then they have Istiqaamah, the angels descend upon them saying, ‘have no fear and do not be sad and have good tidings of Jannah (Paradise) that you have been promised. We are your protecting friends in the Dunya and in the Aakhirah. ‘</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whomsoever has Allaah as his wali or his protecting friend and has the angels as his awliyaah, his protecting friends, will Allaah leave that person to be by himself without any protection? Whoever thinks that Allaah will let go to waste his awliyaah, the ones that are close to Him, that hold firm to the Book and the Sunnah – then he has thought negatively about Allaah. So, the first door from the doors of rizq is Istiqaamah upon the Deen. And visualize the time that the people were Mustaqeemeen – when they had Istiqaamah upon the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Ibn al Qayyim (rahimahullah) he mentioned in his book ‘Zaad al-Maad’ that he found a grain of wheat the size of a date stone. The Sheikh reiterates : a grain of wheat the size of a date stone. And a cucumber the length of it being such and such … This is barakah from Allaah. So then Istiqaamah would probably lead to having a tomato that would need two people to hold it, a water melon which needs 5 or 6 people to hold it – i.e if there is present holding to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah, no bid’ah, no khurafaath (superstitions &amp; folklore), no sheer foolishness, no magic, no taking of intoxicants, no ribaa and no zinaa, no ‘liwaath’ — no sodomy and no lying and no fujoor – witness evil doing and no ‘shahaadatuz zoor’ — bearing witness to falsehood, and no wicked oath and not putting off of the prayers.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With Istiqaamah there will be present an abundance of good by the permission of Allaah. Our forefathers mentioned to us (May Allaah forgive us and them and all the Muslims) that they used to sell a young sheep for a Riyal. So, they eat its meat and sell its skin for a Riyal. So he slaughters it, he eats it with his family, his neighbours and whoever comes and at the end of it he sells the skin for a Riyal. He didn’t lose anything. So Isthiqaamah its affair is great in this Dunya and Aakhirah, in your Deen and dunya and in your Barzaakh, in your Aakhirah if you held on to the Kitaab and the Sunnah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The eighth door of sustenance : As-Sadaqaat (non-obligatory charity) :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Charitable donations, and <em><strong>nafaqaath</strong> </em>(regular spending) – you spend on yourself, on your wife, on your children, on your father and your mother, on your uncles and aunts, on your righteous neighbours, on sons and daughters, relatives, widows and orphans – this type of charity, the affair of this is great with Allaah. This is a means of accumulation of provision, a door from the doors of sustenance.</p>
<p>It was narrated from Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no day on which the people get up but two angels come down and one of them says, ‘O Allaah, give in compensation to the one who spends (in charity),’ and the other says, ‘O Allaah, destroy the one who withholds.’”  </strong></span></p>
<p>[Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 1374; Muslim, 1010.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So try and not make a day pass from you from the days of Allaah except that you stretch your hand as much as it is in your ability to do, even if it is a little.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said : <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Fear Allaah even if it is with half a date.’ </strong></span>[Muttafaqun alai &#8211; agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘fa mai ya’mal misqaala zarrathin kharrai yara. Wamai ya’mal misqaala zarrathin sharrai yara’ — ‘that whoever does an atoms worth of good he will see it</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) also says,<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Whatever you spend in the way of Allaah, He will replace it and He is the best of the Providers.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the meaning of <strong>‘He will replace it?</strong>’ i.e He will give you what is better than it. Don’t think that is the end &amp; that it has gone from you. It will return to you with that which is better, insha-Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh says again : Whatever you have spent, then Allaah will replace it for you and He is the Best of Providers. And he says again that : <strong>O Allaah give the person that spends a replacement that is replaced for him with good, O Lord of the worlds.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the hadith of Abu Huraira (radiallaahu anhu) that Msulim related that the Messenger of Allaah said : that there was people from people that were from before you a man who had a garden. And another man heard a cry from the sky, an angel from the clouds who said, ‘give water to the garden of so and so.’ So he poured into it some water into one of the irrigation holes and then the water ran into that garden. So the person who owned the garden, he had a shovel in his hand and he was fixing the water and fixing the dirt and this man said to the man who owned the garden, ‘may Allaah have mercy upon you. What is your name?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: I am so and so, the son of so and so. Then he said: ‘Why do you ask?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ” I heard a voice from the clouds saying, ‘give water to the garden of so and so. May Allaah have mercy on you. What do you do with this?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the owner of the garden says : ‘When I plant and then I harvest, I take one-third for me and my family and  I put one-third to roll it back into my garden and I give one-third  in charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at this. What is required from him is only a one-10th of the farm that is if it comes from natural torrential streams and the like (without any artificial irrigation or water). And a half of the 10th if it is water with sprinklers and irrigation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So rather than giving 1/10th or half of 1/10th, he gave 1/3rd. Meaning he put aside more for charity. So see how Allaah singled him out with rain especially for his garden. Rain specific for him over his neighbors. What did he do to deserve this? He gave sadaqa. Therefore Sadaqaa doesn’t decrease wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we were in a certain area giving dawah and alhamdulillaah we always go out calling the people to the Book and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and remind them of Allaah and the Last Day and righteous deeds and we saw that the mountains were green and the trees were green maasha’Allaah and what a beautiful sight. And they had good agriculture. There must have been a reason because their neighbour’s lands were dusty and barren and their land was green. We saw the reason on the way. There if you walk from a distance to a distance you could have the coolness of water i.e from place to place except that we saw a water cooler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh said : Because of the water cooler, Allaah sent down rain because of this cooler. If they are generous people, then Allaah is more generous than them. He is generous and loves the generous people and if they are merciful, then Allaah is more merciful than them. Allaah is Merciful and He loves the merciful people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sadaqa that they did, Allaah did not lose it for them. On the contrary, He gave them the reward for it in this world and the Hereafter. Therefore Sadaqa is a reason for the increase in provision and it is a door from the doors of sustenance and a door from the doors of relief &amp; distress. And also az-Zakaat, it is a door from the doors of relief &amp; distress and all of what you have heard are doors from the doors of relief from distress –- a door of provision and a reason for provision. Even if some of the people only see the material means. As for these other legislated means then these are not in the minds of most people these days, except those on whom Allaah has mercy on. Eventhough they read the Qur’aan however, without pondering, except whom Allaah has protected from that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Tawakkal alallaah (having trust in Allaah) :</span> </strong>If you placed your trust in Allaah, a true trust in Allaah, Allaah would have provided for you like the bird who goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening full. Having trust in Allaah, not on oneself, not on the pocket, not on the job, not on the friend, not on the merchant, not on the car or the store you might own. That is just a means that you work with, however it is obligatory for your heart to be dependant on Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth door is : Tawakkal alallaah (having trust in Allaah) : The Prophet said, (as recorded in Tirmidhi &amp; Ahmad) <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘If you placed your trust in Allaah, a true trusting in Allaah, Allaah would provide for you just like he provides for the birds. It goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening full.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-tawakkal alallaah – ‘having trust in alAllaah, not on oneself, not on the pocket, not on the bag, not on the job or employment, not on the friend, not on the merchant, not on the farm, not on the car or the store you might own. That is just a means that you work. It is nothing more than a means. However it is obligatory for your heart to be dependant on Allaah and to trust in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He alahis-salaatu wassalaam, you have heard him say : <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If you put your trust in Allaah, a true trusting in Allaah, He would have sustained or provided for you as He provides for the birds.</strong> </span>That is the rizq or the sustenance of the bird is easy. i.e the sustenance of the bird is very easy. It goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening satisfied with their bellies filled not with difficulty. It gets its rights with ease and then returns and birds are of many types. Take notice. Some of those birds are those that are big and don’t eat except meat. And Allaah azzawajal gives it meat. And every bird takes what Allaah has decreed for it. And no one enumerates it except Allaah and the amount that no one can enumerate except Allaah and their sustenance is due upon Allaah. i.e He will sustain it. And He mentions the ayah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘And so many a moving creature carries not its own provision. Allaah provides for it and for you.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And there is no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah and He knows its dwelling and its deposit i.e in the uterus or in the grave. All is in a clear Book.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is talking about the ‘Lawh al Mahfudh’ — the Book of Decree which is with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘ We have not created the Jinn and the mankind except that they should worship Me. I do not want from them sustenance nor do I want them to feed Me. Verily Allaah is the One that provides. He is the Owner of Power and Strong.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In the sky is your sustenance and what you are promised and by the Lord of the sky or the Heavens and the earth, verily it is the truth just like it is the truth that you can speak. Verily it is the truth that Allaah is Ar-Razzaak and your rizk is with Allaah and it is written for you and that is coming to you and there is no doubt about it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Sheikh reiterates :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily by the Lord of the Heavens and the earth, it is true, just like it is true that you can speak. However where is the Eemaan in the Book and the Sunnah these days? Where is the one who wholeheartedly believes in the word of Allaah and the words of the Rasool alaisalaathu wassalaam and who is aware and feels the power of Eemaan and the power of tawakkal alallaah? And Tawakkal alallaah does not mean that you don’t work with the means. No, you carry out the means. However, you don’t depend totally on the means. You carry out the means. However you depend upon the ‘Musabbibul Asbaab’ – the One that makes the means and actually from above. He is Allaah. Look at the bird – it carries out the means; it went out hungry and returns satisfied. So it carried out the means. It flew and moved from tree to tree, and from place to place with comfort and received its sustenance and then it returns. So you also carry out the means in a way that is best without torment, without toil and adverse hardship and that is the way that is best. No more than a means. For example the cure for a disease – a mere means. A man is sick and they say he is tired and sick. Give him some black seed or a little honey or give him some pure milk to drink. Someone has an acidic stomach – so pure milk is good for his stomach. A small thing in a way that is good. And Allaah healed him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mere means that they used to do in the past. Someone got sick in the times of the Salaf and their medicine was very simple – maybe with 5 Riyals or 6 Riyals. Not like now where a man may have to sell his house, his property and his car and sell and sell and sell .. so that he can go around and get treatment, go abroad and get treatment and if he had taqwa of Allaah azzawajal he would have got cured with 5 Riyals easily. However, when they opposed look at the punishment? And they didn’t depend upon Allaah, they depended upon the pocket, upon their money, upon his pocket, upon his money, and leaned on himself and didn’t lean on Allaah and in turn Allaah entrusted them to their own selves. My slave did not trust in Me and depended on himself so Allaah entrusted him to himself. So he sells what he owns and he returns sick – the same way he went. Sometimes even more sick and he dies there. And they comes with him dead, wrapped up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has to be tawakkal alallaah along with carrying out the legislated means. The salaf there used to be from them who used to sell oil and this is present in the biographies of the narrators of Hadeeth – so and so, the son of so and so As-Zayyaath. Meaning he sells zaith – olive oil and such. He spends on himself and his immediate and extended family. So and so, the son of so and so as-Sammaam – he sells saman which is called ghee (a butter material from cattle) and he spends on himself and his family. So and so, the son of so and so al- Assaal – he sells honey. So and so, the son of so and so is al-Hannar – he sells wheat; and they depend on Allaah. Right now you’ll find in most stores and supermarkets – in some of them you will find a thousand type of products as if he wants to put the whole dunya into his pocket.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ash-Shukr (Giving thanks)</strong> : Not giving shukr decreases one’s good deeds, if you give thanks to Allaah, Allaah will increase you and Allaah does not go back on a promise. Always make your tongue used to giving thanks to Allaah, even a little. ‘<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do work, O family of Daawood with thanks, and few of my servants are thankful.</strong></span>’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fifth door is Ash-Shukr (Giving thanks) :</strong> <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘And when your Lord proclaimed that if you give thanks, I would increase you and if you deny the blessings then verily My torment is severe. ‘</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where is Ash-Shukr these days as Allaah (subhana wa ta’ala) says. You have a 100 Riyals, you gave thanks to Allaah without saying ‘what is this, it is just a little bit, this is not enough’. The people they have and they have and you didn’t say this. You leave the speech of the ignorant people. Give thanks to your Lord for a quarter of a Riyal and give thanks to your Lord for the excrement of the feces. If it wasn’t for Allaah it wouldn’t come out. Yes by Allaah the excretion is a very big Ni’maah. If it didn’t come out you would have been befallen by poison and death. Don’t say I don’t have. Has Allaah given me and the people who have and have and have and then they make it hard and then you forget what Allaah gave you of blessings. Don’t you know that giving shukr is a means of increasing your rizq and not giving shukr is a means of decreasing of sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Sheikh reiterates :</strong> ‘If you give thanks, We will increase you.’  for e.g, If you give thanks to Allaah for a 100/- Allaah increases for you upon it and then it becomes 500/-. If you give thanks to Allaah for 500/- Allaah increases it for you and then it becomes a 1000/-. And the more you give thanks the more Allaah increases you. Allaah does not go back on a promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has to be Shukr and Hamd, giving praise and Sana’a (giving praises of Allaah subhana wa ta’ala) and Eemaan that it is Allaah who provided it for you. Allaah is the One Who provides and He is the One who gives life. He is the One Who gives death and He is the One who does everything (subhana wa ta’ala) and as for the people then they are weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>‘O mankind it is you who stands in need of Allaah but Allaah is rich and free of all needs. If He wished He could destroy you and bring another creation and that is not at all hard upon Allaah</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people all of them are fuqaraahu ilallaah. They are poor people with regards to Allaah so don’t look at their pockets. Look to Allaah. Look to the treasures of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">‘For Allaah is the treasures of the heavens and the earth</span></strong>. However, the hypocrites do not understand this. The munaafiqun, the hypocrites they always believe and have faith in the material things and as for the unseen things, then they don’t believe. Only in material things 1+1 = 2. Something material, tangible, calculated. Faith in the unseen – this is not present with him. This is present with the believers. For this Allaah said about the Munaafiqeen : They say, ‘Spend not on those who are around Allah’s Messenger until they desert him. They said make it hard for them with regards to charity and donation until they leave from Muhammad and were finished from Islaam and its people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the ones who said that : don’t spend on the Messenger – the people that are around the Messenger of Allaah until they leave from him. So Allaah said refuting them : &#8220;And for Allaah are the treasures of the Heavens and the earth. However, the hypocrites they understand not&#8221;. So beware of being from the Munaafiqeen that don’t understand the Book and the Sunnah and the ones that don’t believe except in material things. They don’t have eemaan in the unseen, untangible things and pursue the Deen of Allaah, and learn the Book and the Sunnah, and act upon it and spread it to the people because Allaah says : We have neglected nothing in the Book, everything is present in the Book of Allaah and in the Sunnah of the Messenger .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have now 5 ways. So shukr — always make your tongue accustomed to Shukr of Allaah, upon His blessings even if it is a little. Because it is something enormous with Allaah. First of all you are ordered to give Shukr. Then He mentions the ayah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do work, O family of Daawood with thanks, and few of my servants are thankful So you have to thank Allaah</span></strong>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a saying of the Prophet : ‘So you have to thank Allaah. Whoever doesn’t thank People doesn’t thank Allaah. ‘It is also in the hadith that whoever has helped you : say Jazaak Allaahu khaira. Don’t’ say : what has he given me? Such and such…this is nothing. By Allaah this is a catastrophe for the one that doesn’t accustom himself to giving shukr i.e he doesn’t have except denial of the favours of Allaah and His creation. You should do the contrary, accustom yourself to giving thanks and be from the thankful people. And Allaah (azzawajal) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed it has been revealed to you as it was to those before you, if you make shirk then all your deeds will be in vain. And you will certainly be among the losers. Nay, but worship Allaah and be among the grateful. Be from the grateful. Give thanks to Him for everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you not see that if Allaah did not make the sleep for you, what would you do? The rest of the people are asleep and comfortable at night and you don’t have sleep night after night after night. Is it torment or isn’t it? It is ni’maah, the blessing of sleep. How much does it equal?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ni’mah of security, how much does it equal? He mentioned the Surah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[106] Surah Quraish (The Tribe of Quraish)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(1. For the Ilaf of the Quraysh.) </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">(2. Their Ilaf caravans, in winter and in summer.) </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">(3. So, let them worship the Lord of this House.) </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">(4. Who has fed them against hunger, and has made them safe from fear.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Aman – security or safety is a ni’mah</strong></span>. You must single Allaah in worship. He Allaah subhana wa ta’ala said : You must worship (Allaah) the Lord of this House (the Ka’bah in Makkah), the One who fed you against hunger and made you safe from fear. You must sacrifice for Allaah alone, you don’t make vows except for Allaah, and you don’t swear except by Allaah and you don’t put your trust except in Allaah and he goes on to mentioning a hadeeth about tawakkal :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Allaah put your trust if indeed you are believers. Verily Allaah loves those who trust in Allaah. Then upon Allaah let the people put their trust in. Then upon Allaah let the believers put their trust in.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation Of The Text In Al-Qawl-ul-Mufeed Fee Adillatit Tawheed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit (Faa’idah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ash-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah al-Faqeeh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (rahimahullaahu ta’aalaa) said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his valuable book ((al-Ibdaa’ fee Kamaal ash-Shara’ wa Khatar al-Ibtidaa’)) [Innovations in the Perfect Legislation and the Hazards of Innovations] pages 21 –23:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( … Oh my brother, verily following and adherence does not become a reality until the action is in agreement with six issues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The First (al-Awwal): <strong>as-Sabab (Reason)</strong>. Like the one who prays two Raka’at for the reason of the descending of the rain (Nuzool al-Matar).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second (ath-Thaanee): <strong>al-Jins (Type)</strong>. Like the one who brings his Zakaat al-Fitr in the form of money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Third (ath-Thaalith): <strong>al-Qadar (Number)</strong>. Like the one who prays four Raka’at for Maghrib intentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fourth (ar-Raabi’): <strong>al-Kayfiyyah (How)</strong>. Like the one who makes Wudoo’ (ablution) and starts with his feet and ends with his face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fifth (al-Khaamis): <strong>az-Zamaan (Time)</strong>. Like the one who performs the ‘Udhiyah (slaughtering) in Ramadhaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sixth (as-Saadis): <strong>al-Makaan (Place)</strong>. Like the one who makes I’tikaaf in places other than the Masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh my brother: Bite unto the Sunnah of the Messenger ( صلى الله عليه و سلم) with your molar teeth (an- Nawaajidh). And tread the path of as-Salafus-Saalih (the righteous predecessors), and be on what they were upon, and see if this harms you in any way?!). End of his (rahimahullaah) speech with abbreviation (Tasarruf) and summarization (Ikhtisaar).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation Of The Text By Shaykh Ahmed Al-Wasaabee (Hafidhahullaah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above six conditions that have been mentioned, they are the conditions for which every action must be in agreement to them. And the examples that ash-Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen has mentioned for each of the six conditions are the actions that are opposite to and do not satisfy these conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in regards to the first condition, and it is as-Sabab (reason), then the example mentioned, which is of the one who prays two Raka’at for the descending of the rain, then it has no Daleel (evidence) from the Kitaab or the Sunnah, and the Book and the Sunnah have not legislated and given us permission to pray two Raka’at for the reason of the descending of the rain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the second example, of the one who brings his Zakaat al-Fitr in the form of money, then this is in opposition to the Ahaadeeth of the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم) when he ordered the people that they should bring out their Zakaat at the end of Ramadhaan in the form of foodstuff, such as raisins or dates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the third condition, which is al-Qadar (number), and the example mentioned is of the one who prays four Raka’at for Salaatul-Maghrib intentionally, and we know the number legislated for Salaatul-Maghrib is three Raka’at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the fourth example is of the person who makes Wudoo’ and starts with his feet first and ends with his face, and this is also in opposition to the Sunnah of the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So al-‘Allaamah ibn ‘Uthaymeen has mentioned the examples which oppose and go against the Sunnah in these six conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the sixth condition, which is al-Makaan (place), and the example mentioned is of the one who makes I’tikaaf in places other than the Masjid. So the one who makes I’tikaaf in his house, or in a cave, or in any place other than the Masjid, then his I’tikaaf is not accepted. And the best places to make I’tikaaf are the three Masaajid: Masjid al-Haraam, Masjid an- Nabawee, and Masjid al-Aqsa. And there is a Hadeeth in which we find the wording: ((<em><span style="color:#008000;">There is no I’tikaaf except in the three Masaajid</span></em>)) [Laa I’tikaaf Illaa fil-Masaajid ath-Thalaathah] [1]. And Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that this Hadeeth is weak in its chain, and the meaning of the Hadeeth is that the best and more perfect type of I’tikaaf is in these three Masaajid, even though it is allowable for a person to make I’tikaaf in other than these three Masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;"><em>[1] 1 Sa’eed ibn Mansoor said in his Sunan as is stated in al-Muhallaa (5/195, issue: 633): Sufyaan ibn ‘Uyaynah narrated to us from Jaami’ ibn Abee Raashid from Shaqeeq ibn Salamah that he said: “Hudhayfah said to ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood: ‘I have come to know that the Messenger of Allaah ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) said: ((There is no I’tikaaf except in the three Masaajid)).’”</em></span></p>

</a>The Ninth Invalidator: Believing That Some Have The Choice To Leave Of The Sharee&#8217;ah Of Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Translation Of The Text In Al-Qawl-ul-Mufeed Fee Adillatit Tawheed:</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever believes that some of the people have been given the choice to leave off the Sharee&#8217;ah of Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), just as al-Khidr was given the choice to go outside the jurisdiction of the Sharee&#8217;ah of Moosa (alayhi assalam), then he has disbelieved. That is because every Prophet was sent specifically to his own people, so it is not obligatory for all the people to follow them. As for our Prophet, Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), then he was sent for all peoples, so it is not lawful for anyone to oppose him, not to leave off his Sharee&#8217;ah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allâh</span> (Al-A&#8217;raf 7:158)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Glorified and Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And We have sent you (O Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) not but as a mercy for the &#8216;Alamîn (mankind, jinns and all that exists).</span> (Al-Anbiya 21:107)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the statement of Allaah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion (of right and wrong, i.e. this Qur&#8217;ân) to His slave (Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) that he may be a warner to the &#8216;Alamîn (mankind and jinns).</span> (Al-Furqan 25:1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And We have not sent you (O Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind, but most of men know not</span>. (Saba&#8217; 34:28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jaabir Ibn &#8216;Abdullaah al-Ansaaree (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhumaa), that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I was given five things that no one before me was given: [i] I was aided by causing intimidation for a months time; [ii] the entire earth was made a masjid (place of prostration) and pure for me, so regardless of where a man from my Ummah is, whenever the Prayer reaches him, he may pray; [iii] and the spoils of war have been made lawful for me and they were not made lawful for anyone before me; [iv] and I have been given the intercession (shafaa&#8217;ah); [v] and <strong>every Prophet was sent specifically to his people and I have been sent to all of mankind</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(al-Bukhaaree no. 328 &amp; Muslim no. 521)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Truly, the religion with Allâh is Islâm.</span> (Aali Imran 3:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever seeks a religion other than Islâm, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.</span> (Aali Imran 3:85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion.</span> (Al-Ma&#8217;idah 5:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Glorified and Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do they seek other than the religion of Allâh (the true Islâmic Monotheism worshipping none but Allâh Alone), while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned. (Aali Imran 3:83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in a hadeeth,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;By Allaah if Moosaa was living, he would have no choice but to follow me&#8221; </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Da&#8217;eef &#8211; Shaykh Muqbil &amp; Hasan by al-Albaanee al Irwaa&#8217; no. 1589 &amp; mentioned in Ibn Katheer of this verse)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Explanation Of The Text By Shaykh Al-Wasaabee:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmed (hafidhahullaah) mentioned to us that this ninth invalidator has a connection to the third invalidator, which is not stating the Christians and the Jews as disbelievers as Allaah has mentioned them as being disbelievers. The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) has certain things that are specific to him, no other Prophet were given these things; one of these is that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was sent for all the people. This is unlike the other Prophets who were sent specifically for their people and this is mentioned directly in the text from the Hadith from Jaabir Ibn &#8216;Abdullaah al- Ansaaree (radiyAllaahu &#8216;anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh then mentioned to us that Allaah (subhaana wa ta&#8217;laa) has completed the revelation with Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and that there remains no deen after Muhammad except Islaam and whoever holds onto anything other than Islaam then it will not be accepted from him. Also, his works will be refuted and not accepted. Whoever, from the people who have had news of this deen reach them, and verily the news of this deen of Islaam and Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) has reached all the people, and they do not believe in it they will be the people of the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also mentioned, concerning the verse in Sooratul Ma&#8217;idah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion.</span> (Al-Ma&#8217;idah 5:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That it was revealed in the farewell pilgrimage of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and that after he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) returned from the hajj to Medina he lived for a few days. Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that this ayah is a great verse and that it explains the greatness of Islaam until:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Tariq bin Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jew said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers, if this verse: &#8216;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favors upon you, and have chosen for you, Islam as your religion.&#8217; (5.3) had been revealed upon us, we would have taken that day as an &#8216;Id (festival) day.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I know definitely on what day this Verse was revealed; it was revealed on the day of &#8216;Arafat, on a Friday.&#8221; (al-Bukhaaree no. 6800)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh then mentioned to us that the Muslims to do not take their celebrations and their &#8216;Eid from themselves. The Muslims have 3 &#8216;Eids, &#8216;Eid of fitr and the &#8216;Eid of adha, which are the two &#8216;Eids that come yearly and the third &#8216;Eid which is yawmul Jum&#8217;ah. The Muslims do not take their &#8216;Eids like the Jews and Christians, who take their &#8216;Eids at every single matter, like for example the celebration of the birthday.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that anyone who takes a deen other than Islaam it will not be accepted from them and that there is no excuse that we enter is Islaam and that we don&#8217;t pray, hear and obey. Our return is to Allaah (subhaana wa ta&#8217;laa) using the explanation of the verse,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Do they seek other than the religion of Allâh (the true Islâmic Monotheism worshipping none but Allâh Alone), while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned.</span> (Aali Imran 3:83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our deen, the deen of Islaam, has abrogated all of the deens, and that there remains no other deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh mentioned to us the statement of Allaah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) the Book (this Qur&#8217;ân) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Mohayminan (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures).</span> (Al-Ma&#8217;idah 5:48)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab Al-Wassaabee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of a small booklet entitled: <b><i>Eedaah-ud-Dalaalah fee Takhreej wa Tahqeeq &#8220;Laa &#8216;Itikaaf Illaa fil-Masaajid ath-Thalaathah¡¨</i></b><i></i>(Clarifying the Evidence in Referencing and Verifying the Hadeeth: &#8220;There is no &#8216;Itikaaf except in the Three Mosques&#8221;) printed by Dar-ul-Athaar, San&#8217;aa in 2003H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this brief discussion, the author, Shaikh Muhammad bin ¡¥Abdil-Wahhaab Al-Wasaabee, presents the references and grading of the hadeeth: <b>&#8220;There is no &#8216;Itikaaf except in the Three Mosques&#8221;</b> through a discourse on the hadeeth&#8217;s narrators and sources. He also alludes to points of benefit drawn from the discussion on the verification of the hadeeth and presents the readers with advice concerning &#8216;Itikaaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Itikaaf is an important topic, especially in this month of Ramadaan, due to the many blessings and rewards contained within it. The matter of it being legislated in just the three mosques, i.e. Masjid al-Haraam in Makkah, Masjid an-Nabawee in Madeenah and Masjid Al-Aqsaa in Jerusalem, or in every mosque in which the Jumu&#8217;ah Prayer is established is an issue that has long been in debate. However, through the presentation of the evidence in this treatise, it is hoped that the readers may gain insight on the correct position with regard to this tremendous act of worship. It is also hoped that this book will aid the one who reads it into preserving and abiding by this sacred practice of Islaam, by which one¡¦s heart grows attached to the masjid and the servant dedicates himself entirely for a specified amount of time to the service and worship of His Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Author:</b> Shaikh Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi¡¦ee said in his introduction to the book: &#8220;As for the author of these three treatises, then he is Shaikh Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab &#8211; the teacher of Tawheed and Fiqh, and of good manners, abstinence and piety; the compassionate educator; the caller to Muslim unity; the warner against repulsive partisanship; the one who is extremely patient with poverty and difficulties, and the one who is wise with regard to the field of Da&#8217;wah (Calling to Allaah). He loves the predecessors (i.e. Salaf) of this ummah and hates the innovators &#8211; each one according to the form of his innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b> &#8220;In the report of Sa¡¦eed, there occurs the wording: <b>&#8220;&#8230;or a congregational masjid.&#8221;</b> This addition has not been mentioned by those who reported it in marfoo&#8217; form or those who reported it in mawqoof form. Yes, the addition occurs in some of the paths of narration from Ibraaheem bin Yazeed An-Nakha¡¦ee. However, you have already read that the path of narration from Ibraaheem bin Yazeed is broken.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When a Companion states: <b>&#8220;Such and such is from the Sunnah&#8230;&#8221;</b>, the hadeeth takes on the ruling of being raised to a statement of the Prophet. This has been agreed upon in the books on Principles of Hadeeth. So based on this hadeeth, &#8216;Itikaaf is therefore permissible in every masjid in which the Jumu&#8217;ah prayer is established. However, performing it in the Three Mosques is better and more complete.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The summary of this study is that &#8216;Itikaaf is prescribed in every masjid in which the Jumu&#8217;ah Prayer is established. However, performing it in one of the Three Mosques is better and more perfect. This was the favored opinion of our teacher, the great scholar, the Muhaddith, the Faqeeh, Abu &#8216;Abdir-Rahmaan Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee, may Allaah have mercy on him.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is The Smile On The Face Of A Dead Person An Indication Of Husn Al Khātimah (I.E. Good Ending Of One&#8217;s Worldly Life)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muhammad Al-Wassãbi</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Husn al-khātimah has been mentioned in various hadīths. So we should rely solely on what was reported from the Messenger (peace be upon him) regarding it and should not add to it based on opinion. From the opinion-based signs of husn al-khātimah is the dead person being light. Some people consider this to be from husn al-khātimah&#8212; that his body was extremely swift and easy (when carried) over people&#8217;s shoulders. This is not a proof. It might be because his body is lean, yet knowing whether or not a person&#8217;s actions are righteous is something else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ok then what if his body were fat? Would it be said that this is from sū&#8217; al-khātimah (i.e. evil ending)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Pay no attention to this. Husn al-Khātimah is when (a Muslim) dies while fasting, performing haj, praying, doing jihaad, when he dies upon a good ending, upon a righteous deed. In this case, you say: Maashaallaah! Wishing him good but not affirming Paradise for him. Conversely, sū&#8217; al-khātimah is when one dies while not praying (i.e. abandoning prayer), (visiting) a sorcerer, while drunk, or committing robbery or any forbidden act. However, affirm for him neither Paradise nor Hell.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By al-&#8216;Allaamah Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wassaabee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Overview</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who is al-&#8216;Allaamah Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wassaabee?<br />
He is from amongst the senior (eldest) students of Imaam Muqbil Ibn Haadee al-Waadi&#8217;ee (rahimahullaah), to the extent that Shaykh Muqbil referred to Shaykh Muhammad as &#8216;my khaleefah.&#8217; His specialty is in Fiqh (Islaamic jurisprudence), and he has a centre of Islaamic studies in Hudaydah, Yemen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Lecture :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wasaabee states, &#8216;If the Muslim knows the legislated means and doors towards gaining sustenance of which Allaah has mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) has mentioned and carries these legislated means out, he will have gained what has been promised to him. Sometimes these doors are called the door towards attaining sustenance or the means of sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the doors are :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Al-Istiaqaamah (Steadfastness in the Religion) : Allaah says, &#8216;and if only they had believed in Allaah and had Istiqaamah on the right way, We would surely have bestowed upon them water (rain) in abundance.&#8217; So Istiqaamah on the Book and the Sunnah and holding onto them wholeheartedly is a door from the doors of relief from discomfort, a door from the doors of sustenance.<br />
2. Eemaan (Faith) : al-&#8216;Eemaan is a door from the doors of relief of difficulty, a door from the doors towards attaining rizq (provision). &#8216;Eemaan in Allaah and his books, and his angels, the last day, qadr (divine decree), its good and it&#8217;s bad, the Qur&#8217;aan, the Rasool (Messenger), the pure prophetic Sunnah and what is contains.<br />
3. Taqwaa (Fear and consciousness of Allaah) : &#8216;And if the people of the towns had Taqwaa and had piety, certainly We would have opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth. But they belied the Messengers so We took them with punishment for what they used to earn..&#8217; Whoever has Taqwaa of Allaah, Allaah provides for him from where he would never have expected, where his mind would never have though about. However, Taqwaa of Allaah provided these means for him and gave him ease.<br />
4. Tawakkal ilallaah (having trust in Allaah) : If you placed your trust in Allaah, a true trust in Allaah, Allaah would have provided for you like the bird who goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening full. Having trust in Allaah, not on oneself, not on the pocket, not on the job, not on the friend, not on the merchant, not on the car or the store you might own. That is just a means that you work with, however it is obligatory for your heart to be dependant on Allaah.<br />
5. Ash-Shukr (Giving thanks) : Not giving shukr decreases one&#8217;s good deeds, if you give thanks to Allaah, Allaah will increase you and Allaah does not go back on a promise. Always make your tongue used to giving thanks to Allaah, even a little. &#8216;Do work, O family of Daawood with thanks, and few of my servants are thankful.&#8217;<br />
6. Dhikr (Acts of Obedience and Remembrance) : A person who remains upon the remembrance of Allaah will have a pleasant life, whoever turns away from remembrance will have a wretched life.<br />
7. Zakaat (Charity) : It is upon the Muslim to fear Allaah with Zakaat, it is from the five pillars of Islaam. Give Zakaat from the apparent and the non-apparent, from the jewellery and possessions.<br />
8. Sadaqaat (non-obligatory charity) : &#8216;Spending on one&#8217;s parents, family and companions. The angels make du&#8217;aa for the one who spends, that Allaah replenishes them, and another makes du&#8217;aa that the one who refrains from spending that his wealth is destroyed. Allaah says &#8216;whoever does even an atoms worth he will see it and whoever spends in the path of Allaah, Allaah will replace it&#8217;.<br />
9. Du&#8217;aa (Supplication) : Allaah says, &#8216;Call on Me and I will answer you&#8217;. Allaah orders us to supplicate; supplication should be made for one&#8217;s rizq. &#8216;O Allaah give us the good in this life and the hereafter and save us from the Fire&#8217;. The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) used to say this du&#8217;aa.<br />
10. al-Birr (The Righteous) : A door from the doors of relief, &#8216;Verily the pious people will be in the paradise and the evil doers will be in the hellfire Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (Rahimahullaah) stated that this ayah refers to the dunyaa (worldly life), the barzakh (the period between death and the day of resurrection) and the Aakhirah (hereafter) contrary to what people comprehend.<br />
11. Material Means : The means from the material means are also from the means of sustenance but self-control must be observed, knowing that dependency is upon Allaah alone. It is merely a means by which you work. We Should say &#8216;O Allaah, this is the means by which you provide for me if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that Allaah provided we wouldn&#8217;t have used it. When Maryam (alayhis-salaam) was in her post-natal bleeding, Allaah says &#8216;And shake the trunk of the date palm before you and it will provide ripe dates for you. We are not dervishes who do nothing, we work by the means but we do not go by means which are unlegislated by Allaah. Many of those who are obsessed with their means fall to diabetes and Cancer, their minds obsessed with their work.<br />
12. Holding Fast to the Book and the Sunnah : And if only they had established the Toraah and the Injeel, they would have eaten from above them and under their feet.&#8217; If this is in regards to those who should have held on to the scriptures then it is pivotal to hold on to the book and the Sunnah. We have mentioned 11 of which are abstract and now we mention the last which is physical.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Khutbatul Haajah the Sheikh mentions our subject tonight deals with: The means of getting sustenance and the doors towards sustenance. This subject in which everyone likes it, however many of them went wrong in the way of going about it. So, the Muslim knows the legislated means and doors towards attaining sustenance of which Allaah has mentioned in the Qura&#8217;an and of the Messenger has mentioned and carried those legislated means out he would have gained what has been promised to him. And sometimes these means are called &#8216;Abwaabur Rizq&#8217; or &#8216;Abwaabul Furaj&#8217; i.e doors towards relaxation and relief or if you wish to say &#8216;Abwaabul Rizq&#8217; – doors towards obtaining sustenance or if you wish then say &#8216;Asbaabur Rizq&#8217; i.e the means of sustenance. So the first means insha-Allaah (the students of knowledge should write these down in the notebooks with the proofs which we will mention from the Qura&#8217;an and the Sunnah). The Sheikh continues with the first door of means is :<br />
1. Al-Istiaqaamah (Steadfastness on the Deen of Allaah) : Al-Istiqaamah of the Deen is a door from the doors of relief from difficulty and a door from the doors of sustenance and a means from the means of sustenance. Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says,<br />
&#8216;and if only they had believed in Allaah and had Istiqaamah on the right way, We would surely have bestowed upon them water (rain) in abundance.&#8217;<br />
So Istiqaamah on the Book and the Sunnah and holding onto them wholeheartedly without increasing in them or taking away from them, this is a door from the doors of relief from discomfort, and a door from the doors of sustenance and a means from its means. On the contrary it is from the greatest means of Rizq in the Dunya and the Aakhirah. And if you knew the following means you would have known how much the people had gone away from them these days except whom Allaah has had mercy on. They want Rizq but they went wrong in the ways of attaining it and the doors towards it and its means except who Allaah has had mercy on them and they are very few. Even to the point where it might come to the thought of a person that if he wants rizq all he has to do is engross himself in pursuing the dunya and leave off the &#8216;Asbaab-al-Shar&#8217;eeah&#8217; – (that is the means designated by the Shariah). So he doesn&#8217;t find except adverse hardship and you ofcourse know what rain has of benefits for the Ummah. The Sheikh mentions the ayah in Surahtul Anbiah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We made all things living from water.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When rain comes, i.e the rain that has the mercy of Allaah with it, all of the good in turn comes – the earth vegetates fruits and various herbs and waters in rivers become plentiful and the cattle and the riding beasts benefit and the good of humans and animals become abundant and agriculture becomes successful and ghee and honey becomes abundant, and sheep, cattle becomes abundant and the market prices become lower. And even the heat it gets lowered a great deal from the people. The Sheikh mentions the ayah again :<br />
&#8216;and if only they had Istiqaamah on the right path, We would have given them water (rain) from the sky in abundance.&#8217;<br />
And Istiqaamah as you know as Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;That is verily those who say, &#8220;Our Lord is Allaah, then they have Istiqaamah, the angels descend upon them saying, &#8216;have no fear and do not be sad and have good tidings of Jannah (Paradise) that you have been promised. We are your protecting friends in the Dunya and in the Aakhirah. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whomsoever has Allaah as his wali or his protecting friend and has the angels as his awliyaah, his protecting friends, will Allaah leave that person to be by himself without any protection? Whoever thinks that Allaah will let go to waste his awliyaah, the ones that are close to Him, that hold firm to the Book and the Sunnah – then he has thought negatively about Allaah. So, the first door from the doors of rizq is Istiqaamah upon the Deen. And visualize the time that the people were Mustaqeemeen – when they had Istiqaamah upon the Book and the Sunnah.<br />
Ibn Qayyim (rahimahullah) he mentioned in his book &#8216;Zaad al-Maad&#8217; that he found a grain of wheat the size of a date stone. The Sheikh reiterates : a grain of wheat the size of a date stone. And a cucumber the length of it being such and such … This is barakah from Allaah. So then Istiqaamah would probably lead to having a tomato that would need two people to hold it, a water melon which needs 5 or 6 people to hold it – i.e if there is present holding to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah, no bid&#8217;ah, no khurafaath (superstitions &amp; folklore), no sheer foolishness, no magic, no taking of intoxicants, no ribaa and no zinaa, no &#8216;liwaath&#8217; &#8212; no sodomy and no lying and no fujoor – witness evil doing and no &#8216;shahaadatuz zoor&#8217; &#8212; bearing witness to falsehood, and no wicked oath and not putting off of the prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With Istiqaamah there will be present an abundance of good by the permission of Allaah. Our forefathers mentioned to us (May Allaah forgive us and them and all the Muslims) that they used to sell a young sheep for a Riyal. So, they eat its meat and sell its skin for a Riyal. So he slaughters it, he eats it with his family, his neighbours and whoever comes and at the end of it he sells the skin for a Riyal. He didn&#8217;t lose anything. So Isthiqaamah its affair is great in this Dunya and Aakhirah, in your Deen and dunya and in your Barzaakh, in your Aakhirah if you held on to the Kitaab and the Sunnah.<br />
And the second means is Eemaan and Taqwa : i.e the second and third. Now we have three means, Eemaan and Taqwa. As Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says :<br />
&#8221;And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwaa or piety, certainly We would have opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth. But they belied or denied the Messengers so We took them with punishment for what they used to earn. Did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they were asleep? Or did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they were playing? Did they then feel secure against the plan of Allaah? None feels secure from the plan of Allaah except the people who are losers.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first three means he returns he says with the ayah : walaw anna ahlal Qura ..&#8217; and &#8216;Qura&#8217; here encompasses al-Qura wal Mudah. i.e the word Qura means villages and he says this ayah encompasses both villages and cities. And Makkah is the Ummul Qura as you know. This is not specific to villages but on the contrary villages, cities and all. He repeats the ayah :<br />
&#8216;If only the people of the cities had believed and had taqwa, We would have opened for them the blessings from the heavens and the earth.&#8217;<br />
Henceforth al-&#8216;Eemaan is a door from the doors of relief from difficulty, and a door from the doors towards attaining rizq (provision) and a means from the means Rizq. &#8216;Eemaan in Allaah and His Books, and His angels, the Last Day and in Qadr (Divine decree), its good and its bad, the belief or Eemaan in the Qur&#8217;aan and in what the Qur&#8217;aan contains, Eemaan in the Rasool (Messenger) and what he came with from Allaah, Eemaan in the pure prophetic Sunnah and what it contains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If they believed and had piety, We would have opened up for them the blessings from the heavens and the earth.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as He said (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) :<br />
&#8216;And whoever has Taqwaa of Allaah, Allaah makes for him a way out and provides for him from where he would not expect.&#8217;<br />
The Sheikh reiterates that &#8216;He would have provided for him from where he never would have expected – from where his mind would never have thought about it. And hence not expecting that he would find this prepared blessing, the blessed sustenance from this source. However, taqwa of Allaah prepared for him these different ways and made ease for him the means.&#8217;<br />
The Sheikh reiterates: &#8216;He would make for him a way out and provide for him from where he would not expect.&#8217;<br />
We want rizq. However we lost gaining it by its legislated ways except whom Allaah has had mercy on. Rizq by lying and playing and zig zagging, stealing and deceit, evil plotting : &#8216;O people&#8217; the Sheikh implores : Is this the way to get rizq? You are right now spreading up the establishment, you are right now speeding up the establishment of punishment on yourself and torment if you disobey Allaah. Therefore why not hold onto the deen and have glad tidings of good and have glad tidings of relief from hardship?<br />
So right now we have three doors : Al-Istiqaamah, al-Eemaan and Taqwa.<br />
The fourth door is : Tawakkal alallaah (having trust in Allaah) : The Prophet said, (as recorded in Tirmidhi &amp; Ahmad) &#8216;If you placed your trust in Allaah, a true trusting in Allaah, Allaah would provide for you just like he provides for the birds. It goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening full.&#8217;<br />
At-tawakkal alallaah – &#8216;having trust in alAllaah, not on oneself, not on the pocket, not on the bag, not on the job or employment, not on the friend, not on the merchant, not on the farm, not on the car or the store you might own. That is just a means that you work. It is nothing more than a means. However it is obligatory for your heart to be dependant on Allaah and to trust in Allaah.<br />
He alahis-salaatu wassalaam, you have heard him say : If you put your trust in Allaah, a true trusting in Allaah, He would have sustained or provided for you as He provides for the birds. That is the rizq or the sustenance of the bird is easy. i.e the sustenance of the bird is very easy. It goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening satisfied with their bellies filled not with difficulty. It gets its rights with ease and then returns and birds are of many types. Take notice. Some of those birds are those that are big and don&#8217;t eat except meat. And Allaah azzawajal gives it meat. And every bird takes what Allaah has decreed for it. And no one enumerates it except Allaah and the amount that no one can enumerate except Allaah and their sustenance is due upon Allaah. i.e He will sustain it. And He mentions the ayah :<br />
&#8216;And so many a moving creature carries not its own provision. Allaah provides for it and for you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And there is no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah and He knows its dwelling and its deposit i.e in the uterus or in the grave. All is in a clear Book.&#8217;<br />
He is talking about the &#8216;Lawh al Mahfudh&#8217; &#8212; the Book of Decree which is with Allaah.<br />
&#8216; We have not created the Jinn and the mankind except that they should worship Me. I do not want from them sustenance nor do I want them to feed Me. Verily Allaah is the One that provides. He is the Owner of Power and Strong.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;In the sky is your sustenance and what you are promised and by the Lord of the sky or the Heavens and the earth, verily it is the truth just like it is the truth that you can speak. Verily it is the truth that Allaah is Ar-Razzaak and your rizk is with Allaah and it is written for you and that is coming to you and there is no doubt about it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Sheikh reiterates : Verily by the Lord of the Heavens and the earth, it is true, just like it is true that you can speak. However where is the Eemaan in the Book and the Sunnah these days? Where is the one who wholeheartedly believes in the word of Allaah and the words of the Rasool alaisalaathu wassalaam and who is aware and feels the power of Eemaan and the power of tawakkal alallaah? And Tawakkal alallaah does not mean that you don&#8217;t work with the means. No, you carry out the means. However, you don&#8217;t depend totally on the means. You carry out the means. However you depend upon the &#8216;Musabbibul Asbaab&#8217; – the One that makes the means and actually from above. He is Allaah. Look at the bird – it carries out the means; it went out hungry and returns satisfied. So it carried out the means. It flew and moved from tree to tree, and from place to place with comfort and received its sustenance and then it returns. So you also carry out the means in a way that is best without torment, without toil and adverse hardship and that is the way that is best. No more than a means. For example the cure for a disease – a mere means. A man is sick and they say he is tired and sick. Give him some black seed or a little honey or give him some pure milk to drink. Someone has an acidic stomach – so pure milk is good for his stomach. A small thing in a way that is good. And Allaah healed him. Do cupping for him or cauterization (healing with fire).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah said : &#8216;A cure is in three things. In drinking a little bit of honey, or in the line that a person who does cupping draws (puts marks on your skin) or in the using of the fire (cauterization).&#8217; And this is in Bukhari in the Book of Medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mere means that they used to do in the past. Someone got sick in the times of the Salaf and their medicine was very simple – maybe with 5 Riyals or 6 Riyals. Not like now where a man may have to sell his house, his property and his car and sell and sell and sell so that he can go around and get treatment, go abroad and get treatment and if he had taqwa of Allaah azzawajal he would have got cured with 5 Riyals easily. However, when they opposed look at the punishment? And they didn&#8217;t depend upon Allaah, they depended upon the pocket, upon their money, upon his pocket, upon his money, and leaned on himself and didn&#8217;t lean on Allaah and in turn Allaah entrusted them to their own selves. My slave did not trust in Me and depended on himself so Allaah entrusted him to himself. So he sells what he owns and he returns sick – the same way he went. Sometimes even more sick and he dies there. And they comes with him dead, wrapped up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has to be tawakkal alallaah along with carrying out the legislated means. The salaf there used to be from them who used to sell oil and this is present in the biographies of the narrators of Hadeeth – so and so, the son of so and so As-Zayyaath. Meaning he sells zaith – olive oil and such. He spends on himself and his immediate and extended family. So and so, the son of so and so as-Sammaam – he sells saman which is called ghee (a butter material from cattle) and he spends on himself and his family. So and so, the son of so and so al- Assaal – he sells honey. So and so, the son of so and so is al-Hannar – he sells wheat; and they depend on Allaah. Right now you&#8217;ll find in most stores and supermarkets – in some of them you will find a thousand type of products as if he wants to put the whole dunya into his pocket.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh then said something that was not clear and he continued. He made distrust and greed and toil and adverse hardship and they lost the Deen except whom Allaah had mercy on. Now we have four means from the means of sustenance.<br />
The fifth door is Ash-Shukr (Giving thanks) : &#8216;And when your Lord proclaimed that if you give thanks, I would increase you and if you deny the blessings then verily My torment is severe. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where is Ash-Shukr these day Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says. You have a 100 Riyals, you gave thanks to Allaah without saying &#8216;what is this, it is just a little bit, this is not enough&#8217;. The people they have and they have and you didn&#8217;t say this. You leave the speech of the ignorant people. Give thanks to your Lord for a quarter of a Riyal and give thanks to your Lord for the excrement of the feces. If it wasn&#8217;t for Allaah it wouldn&#8217;t come out. Yes by Allaah the excretion is a very big Ni&#8217;maah. If it didn&#8217;t come out you would have been befallen by poison and death. Don&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t have. Has Allaah given me and the people who have and have and have and then they make it hard and then you forget what Allaah gave you of blessings. Don&#8217;t you know that giving shukr is a means of increasing your rizq and not giving shukr is a means of decreasing of sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh reiterates : &#8216;If you give thanks, We will increase you.&#8217; If you give thanks to Allaah for a 100/- Allaah increases for you upon it and then it becomes 500/-. If you give thanks to Allaah for 500/- Allaah increases it for you and then it becomes a 1000/-. And the more you give thanks the more Allaah increases you. Allaah does not go back on a promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has to be Shukr and Hamd, giving praise and Sana&#8217;a (giving praises of Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and Eemaan that it is Allaah who provided it for you. Allaah is the One Who provides and He is the One who gives life. He is the One Who gives death and He is the One who does everything (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and as for the people then they are weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O mankind it is you who stands in need of Allaah but Allaah is rich and free of all needs. If He wished He could destroy you and bring another creation and that is not at all hard upon Allaah. The people all of them are fuqaraahu ilallaah. They are poor people with regards to Allaah so don&#8217;t look at their pockets. Look to Allaah. Look to the treasures of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;For Allaah is the treasures of the heavens and the earth. However, the hypocrites do not understand this. The munaafiqun, the hypocrites they always believe and have faith in the material things and as for the unseen things, then they don&#8217;t believe. Only in material things 1+1 = 2. Something material, tangible, calculated. Faith in the unseen – this is not present with him. This is present with the believers. For this Allaah said about the Munaafiqeen : They say, &#8216;Spend not on those who are around Allah&#8217;s Messenger until they desert him. They said make it hard for them with regards to charity and donation until they leave from Muhammad and were finished from Islaam and its people.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the ones who said that : don&#8217;t spend on the Messenger – the people that are around the Messenger of Allaah until they leave from him. So Allaah said refuting them :<br />
And for Allaah are the treasures of the Heavens and the earth. However, the hypocrites they understand not. So beware of being from the Munaafiqeen that don&#8217;t understand the Book and the Sunnah and the ones that don&#8217;t believe except in material things. They don&#8217;t have eemaan in the unseen, untangible things and pursue the Deen of Allaah, and learn the Book and the Sunnah, and act upon it and spread it to the people because Allaah says : We have neglected nothing in the Book, everything is present in the Book of Allaah and in the Sunnah of the Messenger .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have now 5 ways. So shukr &#8212; always make your tongue accustomed to Shukr of Allaah, upon His blessings even if it is a little. Because it is something enormous with Allaah. First of all you are ordered to give Shukr. Then He mentions the ayah :<br />
&#8216;Do work, O family of Daawood with thanks, and few of my servants are thankful So you have to thank Allaah.&#8217;<br />
It is a saying of the Prophet : &#8216;So you have to thank Allaah. Whoever doesn&#8217;t thank Allaah doesn&#8217;t thank the people. &#8216;It is also in the hadith that whoever has helped you : say Jazakallaahu khaira. Don&#8217;t&#8217; say : what has he given me? Such and such…this is nothing. By Allaah this is a catastrophe for the one that doesn&#8217;t accustom himself to giving shukr i.e he doesn&#8217;t have except denial of the favours of Allaah and His creation. You should do the contrary, accustom yourself to giving thanks and be from the thankful people. And Allaah (azzawajal) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed it has been revealed to you as it was to those before you, if you make shirk then all your deeds will be in vain. And you will certainly be among the losers. Nay, but worship Allaah and be among the grateful. Be from the grateful. Give thanks to Him for everything.<br />
Do you not see that if Allaah did not make the sleep for you, what would you do? The rest of the people are asleep and comfortable at night and you don&#8217;t have sleep night after night after night. Is it torment or isn&#8217;t it? It is ni&#8217;maah, the blessing of sleep. How much does it equal? The ni&#8217;mah of security, how much does it equal? He mentioned the Surah :<br />
[106] Surah Quraish (The Tribe of Quraish)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1. For the Ilaf of the Quraysh.) (2. Their Ilaf caravans, in winter and in summer.) (3. So, let them worship the Lord of this House.) (4. Who has fed them against hunger, and has made them safe from fear.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
Al-Aman – security or safety is a ni&#8217;mah. You must single Allaah in worship. He Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala said : You must worship (Allaah) the Lord of this House (the Ka&#8217;bah in Makkah), the One who fed you against hunger and made you safe from fear. You must sacrifice for Allaah alon, you don&#8217;t make vows except for Allaah, and you don&#8217;t swear except by Allaah and you don&#8217;t put your trust except in Allaah and he goes on to mentioning a hadeeth about tawakkal :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Allaah put your trust if indeed you are believers. Verily Allaah loves those who trust in Allaah. Then upon Allaah let the people put their trust in. Then upon Allaah let the believers put their trust in.<br />
There must be a firm holding on to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger and their must be obedience to the Messenger if we want success and salvation in the Dunya and the Aakhirah. So Ash-Shukr is the fifth.<br />
And the sixth : Dhikr (Acts of Obedience and Remembrance) : Because Allaah says :<br />
&#8216;Whoever who turns away from the dhikr of Ar-Rahman, We would put for him a shaitaan to be a companion for him.&#8217;<br />
He says :<br />
&#8220;And whoever turns away from My remembrance then verily for him is a wretched life. And We will raise him up on the Day of Judgement blind. He will say, &#8216;O Lord why did you raise me up blind when I used to be able to see?&#8217; He will say that it is the same way that My ayath had come to you and you forgot them and this day, you will be forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, when he went away from the remembrance of Allaah and his obedience, Allaah punished him with a wretched life, hard life, tiresome. However, if he was the opposite i.e if he didn&#8217;t turn away from the remembrance of Allaah on the contrary took towards the remembrance of Allaah and took towards the obedience of Allaah, he will not in this case have wretched life but a pleasant and comfortable life of course. Henceforth pay attention. Those who turn away do not have reward and those who turn to Allaah have a reward i.e. a person who remains upon the remembrance of Allaah will have a pleasant life, whoever turns away from remembrance will have a wretched life.<br />
The Sheikh reiterates :<br />
&#8216;Whoever turns away from My remembrance then for him is a wretched life.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He turned away from the remembrance of Allaah and the thanks of Allaah and the obedience of Allaah so Allaah punished him with a wretched life. He doesn&#8217;t attain his morsel of livelihood except after a day of great hardship – after having reached the verge of death, after having had a toil of a donkey and the toil of a camel and having seen different forms of death repeatedly, he attains his morsel of livelihood or drink of water. However, if he obeyed Allaah all of his affairs would have been good, his life and livelihood would have been pleasant, comfortable, pure, blessed and henceforth zikrullaah and holding fast to the obedience of Allaah, you will tread in steadfastness and goodness and comfort with the blessing of Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala). This is the sixth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh is Zakaat (Charity) : As the Prophet said (reported by Hakim) : If they didn&#8217;t stop preventing from paying their zakaat of their monies except that the rain from the skies was prevented from them. And if it was not for the animals, rain wouldn&#8217;t have fallen upon them. It is a long hadith but this part of the hadith is the point of discussion. &#8216;That they did not prevent from paying their zakaat, of their monies, except that the water from the sky was prevented from them and if it wasn&#8217;t for the animals it would not have rained upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this hadith it is clear that if they prevent from giving their zakaat, the water from the sky would be prevented from them. And if it wasn&#8217;t for the animals it would not fall upon them at all. It does however rain on them &#8212; a mercy from Allaah due to the animals and due to the babies who are not responsible. Therefore not paying zakaat is a means of the prevention of rain from the sky. And if the rain is prevented from the sky, poverty takes place and torment and destruction over the people of the land. So fear Allaah with regards to the zakaat of the properties, the apparent and the non-apparent, (the Daahir and the Baatin) &#8212; the non-apparent meaning the gold and the silver in jewellery and these other cash commodities in their different known currencies; and the apparent meaning the cows and sheep and camels and agricultural products. These things that are seen in front of the people. So it is upon the Muslim to fear Allaah with regards to the zakaat of his properties : apparent and non-apparent properties. Because zakaat is a pillar from the five pillars of Islaam. And Allaah had made the things that should be spent on in the 8 categories mentioned in surah at-Tawbah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh said : Read the ayah. He does not mention it in full. However, I will mention it. In the ayah sadaqaath here means zakaat. They are only for the fuqaraah and the masakeen, (which is a degree higher than a fakeer) and those employed to collect the funds, and to attract the hearts of those who have been attracted to Islaam, to free the captives, to free those in debts and for Allaah&#8217;s cause and for the wayfarer. A duty imposed upon Allaah and Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if the people stopped paying their zakaat, the water from the sky would be prevented from them. The correct statement from the people of knowledge that jewellery of women from gold and silver if it reaches the limits from where one pays the zakaat , then zakaat is upon it if it reaches that limit and one year has passed on that limit. Nasaab or the least amount on which the zakaat should be paid is 80g of gold and 400g from silver. So if the husband owns it, he gives the zakaat. And if the wife owns it she gives the zakaat which is obligatory every year. So, if it is less than 80g maybe 76g and she does not have cash properties then, it is not upon her to pay zakaat. However if it is 76g for instance and she has cash worth such and such grams, then she has to pay zakaat because she has from this cash what would make up for the deficiency in silver.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh says again : If people did not stop paying their zakaat, except that the rain from the sky was prevented from them and if it wasn&#8217;t for the animals rain would not have fallen upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth door of sustenance : Sadaqaat (non-obligatory charity) : Charitable donations, and nafaqaath (regular spending) – you spend on yourself, on your wife, on your children, on your father and your mother, your uncles and aunts, your righteous neighbours, on sons and daughters, relatives, widows and orphans – this type of charity, the affair of this is great with Allaah. This is a means of accumulation of provision, a door from the door of sustenance. And it has come in the saheehain from the hadith of Abu Huraira (radiallaahu anhu) that the Messenger of Allaah said : There is not a day that the slaves wake up in it .. everyday that the servant wakes up except that two angels come down and say : one of them says to the other &#8216;O Allaah give to the person that spends , give him something to replace it;&#8217; and he says to the other one : &#8216;O Allaah give to the person that holds back a type of destruction.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So try and not make a day pass from you from the days of Allaah except that you stretch your hand as much as it is your ability to do, even if it is a little.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said : &#8216;Fear Allaah even if it is with half a date.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says: &#8216;fa mai ya&#8217;mal misqaala zarrathin kharrai yara. Wamai ya&#8217;mal misqaala zarrathin sharrai yara&#8217; &#8212; &#8216;that whoever does an atoms worth of good he will see it. And Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) also says, &#8216;whatever you spend in the way of Allaah, He will replace it and He is the best of the Providers.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the meaning of &#8216;He will replace it?&#8217; i.e He will give you what is better than it. Don&#8217;t think that is the end and that it has gone from you. It will return to you with that which is better, insha-Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh says again : Whatever you have spent, then Allaah will replace it for you and He is the Best of Providers. And he says again that : O Allaah give the person that spends a replacement that is replaced for him with good, O Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the hadith of Abu Huraira (radiallaahu anhu) that Msulim related that the Messenger of Allaah said : that there was people from people that were from before you a man who had a garden. And another man heard a cry from the sky, an angel from the clouds who said, &#8216;give water to the garden of so and so.&#8217; So he poured into it some water into one of the irrigation holes and then the water ran into that garden. So the person who owned the garden, he had a shovel in his hand and he was fixing the water and fixing the dirt and this man said to the man who owned the garden, &#8216;may Allaah have mercy upon you. What is your name?&#8217;<br />
He said: I am so and so, the son of so and so. Then he said: &#8216;Why do you ask?&#8217;<br />
He said: &#8221; I hears a voice from the clouds saying, &#8216;give water to the garden of so and so. May Allaah have mercy on you. What do you do with this?&#8217;<br />
So the owner of the garden says : &#8216;When I plant and then I harvest, I give one-third for me and my family and I take 1/3rd and I give it in charity. i.e I take 1/3rd and roll it back into my garden.<br />
Look at this. What is required from him is only a 10th of the farm that is if it comes from natural torrential streams and the like (without any artificial irrigation or water). And a half of the 10th if it is water with sprinklers and irrigation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So rather than give one from 10 or ½ from 10, he gave from 3. Meaning he put aside more for charity. So see how Allaah singled him out with rain especially for his garden. Rain specific for him over his neighbours. What did he do to deserve this? He gave sadaqa. Therefore Sadaqaa doesn&#8217;t decrease wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we were in a certain area giving dawah and alhamdulillaah we always go out calling the people to the Book and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and remind them of Allaah and the Last Day and righteous deeds and we saw that the mountains were green and the trees were green masha&#8217;Allaah and what a beautiful sight. And they had good agriculture. They must have had a good reason because their neighbour&#8217;s lands were dusty and barren and their land was green. We saw the reason on the way. There if you walk from a distance to a distance you could have the coolness of water i.e from place to place except that we saw a water cooler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh said : Because of the water cooler, Allaah sent down rain because of this cooler. If they are generous people, then Allaah is more generous than them. He is generous and loves the generous people and if they are merciful, then Allaah is more merciful than them. Allaah is Merciful and He loves the merciful people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sadaqa that they did, Allaah did not lose it for them. On the contrary, He gave them the reward for it in this world and the Hereafter. Therefore Sadaqa is a reason for the increase in provision and it is a door from the doors of sustenance and a door from the doors of relief &amp; distress – as-Sadaqa. And also az-Zakaat, it is a door from the doors of relief &amp; distress and all of what you have heard are doors from the doors of relief from distress –- a door of provision and a reason for provision. Even if some of the people only see the material means. As for these other legislated means then these are not in the minds of most people these days, except those on whom Allaah has mercy on. Even if they read the Qur&#8217;aan – however, without pondering, except whom Allaah has protected from that. We have eight now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth door is ad-Du&#8217;aa (Supplication) &#8212; Don&#8217;t forget ad-Du&#8217;aa O&#8217; Servants of Allah. Its affair is enormous. And your Lord said : &#8216;Call on me and I will answer you&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Du&#8217;aa is if you said something like :<br />
&#8216;Allahummar-ziqni&#8217; &#8212; O Allaah provide for me.<br />
Rizqan Halaalan&#8217; – a Halaal rizq.<br />
&#8216;Tayyiban&#8217; – pure<br />
&#8216;Mubarakan&#8217; &#8212; blessed<br />
&#8216;And make what you provided for us something a means of help – that would help us in your obedience.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;O Allaah it is your rizq that is pure and halaal.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;O Allaah make me be free with your halaal &#8212; from having to deal with anything that is haraam. To be free from needing anything except your bounty.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have supplicated to Allaah asking for good sustenance because he ordered you to supplicate.<br />
Allaah ordered you to supplicate and He has promised you that He will answer. And what do you think, du&#8217;aa is for something else and not for rizq? No, it is even for rizq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah mentions from the supplications from His righteous slaves : &#8216;O Allaah give us in this world the good and in the Hereafter the good and save us from Fire.&#8217; – And from the good of the Dunya is halaal sustenance that helps you in the obedience of Allaah. And the Hadith of Anas in the saheehain that he said : &#8216;Every time the Prophet used to make dua, he used to make dua with this du&#8217;aa :<br />
Rabbana Aaathina fid-Dunyaa hasana wafil Aaakhirathi hasana wa kina azaabannaar.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;O Allaah give us the good in this world and the good in the Hereafter and save us from the<br />
Hell-Fire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, du&#8217;aa its affair is great. So supplicate to your Lord to give you good sustenance and halaal provision and pure sustenance, blessed provision and beneficial sustenance and you should ask Him to satisfy you with halaal and not with haraam and to make you satisfied with His bounties and not in need of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to say in between the two sajdaas in salaah :<br />
Rabbigh firli warhamni, wajburni, ….<br />
&#8216;O Allaah forgive me and have mercy on me, make me firm, guide me, comfort me and sustain me.&#8217;<br />
Between the two sajdaas in every salaah and sometimes he would say<br />
&#8216;Rabbighfir lee, Rabbigh firlee.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;O Allaah forgive me, O Allaah forgive me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at how many hadiths with regard to seeking rizq or sustenance from Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and this is considered from the means as you have heard from the legislated means. So now we have nine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth door is al-Birr (The Righteous) – &#8216;Al-Birr al Waalidain&#8217; having piety towards the parents, its affair is great. And it is a door from the doors of relief from grief, and it is a door from the doors of rizq and it is a means from the means of rizq. Allaahu (azzawajal) says :<br />
&#8220;Innal abraara lafee na&#8217;eem. Wa innal fujjaara lafee jaheem.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;Verily the (Abraar) the pious people are going to be in Paradise and the (Fujjaar) the wicked, evil doers will be in the Hellfire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (Rahimahullaah) mentions in his book &#8216;Madaarijus Saadiqeen&#8217; – the people who check the course &#8212; in the first volume that the one that thinks that Naeem and Jaheem i.e the Paradise and the Fire in this ayah will only be on the Day of Judgement, then he has misconstrued the ayah. The ayah is general. So the abraar are in Naeem&#8217; in the Dunya (worldly life), and the Barzaakh (the period between death and the day of resurrection) and the Aaakhirah (Hereafter). And the Fujjaar – the wicked, evil doers are in Jaheem in the Dunya (worldly life), in the Barzaakh and in the Aakhirah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the Naeem, the pleasantry of the Dunya is good provision, halaal provision, pure sustenance, that is a help for you to do righteous deeds. In that case, then be righteous to your parents and ya subhanAllaah. This is something that is tested and proven to be true. Just by if you did good to your parents and by being righteous to them, help them and ask from them du&#8217;aa except that Allaah will provide for you good and fast sustenance as the Prophet said in Saheeh al-Jaami : &#8216;there are two subjects whose punishments are made to come fast. Al-Baghi i.e infringement upon people&#8217;s rights and &#8216;uqooq&#8217; i.e being disobedient to the parents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who infringes on the rights of the people, infringes on the rights of the people with oppression, infringes on the rights of the people by insult, infringes on their rights by striking physically, infringes on their rights with transgression and taking their money or striking their bodies or insulting their honour. This &#8216;baab&#8217; or affair &#8212; its punishment comes in this life and fast, i.e. before the Aakhirah and just like this &#8216;al-Uqooq&#8217; – disobedience to the parents. The punishment of disobedience to parents comes fast and the opposite is the same al-Birr and Adl and Insaaf. i.e justice / equity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Insha-Allaah you will take the reward now and later. This is the developed understanding of the Hadith and the ayah:<br />
&#8220;Innal abraara lafee na&#8217;eem&#8221; – Verily the pious people or the people that are the righteous are in the Paradise. So there are &#8216;Naeem&#8217; in their Dunya and their Aakhirah. And from the Naeem is self-contentment. Even if what is in his position is minute. Allaah has given him &#8216;an-Naeem&#8217; in the dunya – he feels contentment with that. He is not like the one that was victim to bankruptcy, feels that he has nothing in his pocket – bankruptcy, he has a lot of burden, always thinking, always angry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No, the power of Imaan makes him content and comfortable. Allaah is the One who created me and He has been responsible for my sustenance. You have the Hadith of Abdullah Ibn Masood in the Saheehain and it has been mentioned in the 40 Hadith of Imaam Nawawi : Allaah creates the soul in the womb in the fourth month and in the fourth month he sends an angel to write four words : what his sustenance would be, what his work would be, when he would die and whether he would be happy or miserable.<br />
When you are in the stomach of your mother in the fourth month, when the spirit is blown in, this angel is ordered in the writing of these four things and from these is sustenance, how much provision you will get so you will live in the dunya, the measuring of what Allaah has written for you and your rizq in the dunya is the measuring of what Allaah measured for you of rizq and whether you are going to be happy or miserable, what is the appointed time for death and the reason &#8211;– so you walk on a path that Allaah has written for you Azzawajal, you walk on it with your choice because Allaah did not oppress anyone. As He said: &#8216;And I surely am not an oppressor for the servants.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Imaan : the believer in Allaah and the believer in His deen and Shariah, then she should do what is from Imaan – Imaan in al-Qadr &#8212; the good of it and the bad of it. And that Allaah has decreed his sustenance and that his endeavour does not speed up anything and his slowness doesn&#8217;t delay anything in this affair and that the affair is in the hands of Allaahu ta&#8217;ala. So what He wills it is and what He didn&#8217;t, it will not come out to anything. However it is this person who reads the Book of Allaah and ponders over the Book of Allaah and always reads the Sunnah of the Messenger (alaihissalaatu wassalam) and ponders always upom the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth door is Material Means : The Sheikh says from those means are those material means like for instance being a farmer, a merchant or a manufacturer – any means from the material means as long as you don&#8217;t destroy yourself. You were not created for the purpose of the Dunya. Whether you were created for the purpose of Allaah (azzawajal) i.e for the purpose of worship and the most important thing is satisfaction and continence, i.e self-control with regards to passions and seeking self-sufficiency from Allaah and satisfaction in Him. And you know that some people only have a motor and Allaah made his sustenance from that –&#8211; the sustenance of his family, that one motor. And some of them a donkey, and some people from villages have only one donkey and he spends from that for his whole family. Some a camel, some an ox &#8212;- he tilts for the people and supports the family. And for some of them an electric tool, or pliers and support from this a whole family. Some of them have 3, 4, 5, items in his possessions, he sells and spends on his family. And others have miswaak and he spends on his family. And another has perfume of antimony (khul) and he spends on his family. So it is more a means that you work by. As you would say :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O Allaah this is the dua and it is upon You to answer it.&#8217;<br />
In the same way you say : &#8216;O Allaah this is the means and it is upon You to provide for me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You don&#8217;t depend upon the means. Because if you depend upon the means and only the means then you would have depended or put your trust in other than Allaah &#8212; and this is not permissible. This is a mere means. If it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that Allaah ordered us to take towards the means, we would have not taken towards it. However, it is an order of Allaah and look at Maryam (alaihissalam) while she was in her post-natal bleeding, Allaah says to her :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And shake the trunk of the date palm towards you and it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this state of pregnancy while being weak and with that He still said : &#8216;Shake the trunk of the date palm towards you.&#8217; There must be working by the means. Work by the means. We are not dervishes &#8212; people that do nothing. We are Muslims and people of daleel and people of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. We work by the means &#8212; in a safe correct means that which does not come in conflict with the deen. i.e. the means is not something unlegislated by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One person who might say, &#8216;we steal&#8217; and this is a means. The other may say, &#8216;we fornicate&#8217; and this is a means. Another sells intoxicants and says &#8216;this is a means.&#8217; These means are unlegislated, forbidden. Or asks for bribes or robs or plunders and says &#8216;this is a means&#8217; or cheats and deceives and says &#8216;this is a means.&#8217; No, there must be with regards to the means that they have to be legislated from what Allaah has made halaal, not being any disobedience in it, not having any opposition to the deen of Allaah. He mentioned the ayah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And shake the trunk of the date palm towards you and it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. &#8216;<br />
(Even though Allah has informed us thus).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sheikh reiterates that every time he entered the mihrab &#8212; the praying place of the private room, he found her supplied with sustenance even though Allaah told us this about her. He found with her sustenance. He (Zakariya) said : O Maryam, from where did you get this?<br />
She said : From Allaah. Verily, Allaah provides sustenance to whom He wills without limit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at that time zakariyya invoked his Lord. If you work with the legislated, trusted means, you are trusting in Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and by Allaah your rizq will come to you, no doubt. And I have put forward for you examples and Allaah puts forward parables for the people so they can reflect. I said to you : a person spends on his family by selling &#8216;miswaak and that one spends on his family by being a seller of oil, and that one a seller of ghee and that one a seller of honey and that one is a seller of wheat. He sells wheat and that one is a &#8216;bazzaar&#8217; and he sells seeds. The books of biographies are filled with this, that of our pious predecessors. And that one is &#8216;al-Kayyaal&#8217; &#8212; he has a scale and he weighs things for people and they pay him and that one fixes shoes, nails it and ties it. Up until now all what I mentioned is present and it is a sign from the signs of Allaah and ar-Razzaaq, He is Allaah (azzawajal) and you may very well find that a person who fixes shoes is in a state of self-contentment than a big merchant and a big manager. Or a &#8216;sayy aathi&#8217; &#8212;- the one who fixes watches and sells watches. You may very well find him in a state of contentment. He has 4 watches in his possessions and he sells it, goes home and is comfortable. You may not find this self-contentment with a merchant or a big manager. Each one of them &#8212; his head is filled with problems and he doesn&#8217;t find comfort in his sleep and is not patient, and is not resting. Everything is preoccupation and stress and a lot of them become victims to diabetes, cancer and asthma. The other one is comfortable i.e the one who sells honey, wheat, watches etc. He is content with himself. He is not concerned with taxes or he is not concerned with the rent of a store or show room. And the most important thing is self-contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eleventh door to the doors of sustenance is Holding Fast to the Book and the Sunnah : Holding fast to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah is considered one of the doors from the doors of sustenance. As Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) said about the people of the Book : &#8216;that only if they had established the Toraah and the Injeel (what was revealed to them from their Lord) they would have eaten from above them and from under their feet.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is so for the one who holds onto the Tauraat and the Injeel. Then for the one who holds fast to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah this the given priority because the Book and the Sunnah is better than the heavenly books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then we have mentioned 12 doors and means from the means of rizq and from this 11 are spiritual and one was physical or material. Material means we mentioned that we should do work that is halaal, not to waste the time of salaah, he sells or buys or manufactures We have mentioned 11 of which are abstract and now we mentioned the last which is physical.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever likes that his rizq is widened for him and his life is expanded then he should join family ties. Joining the ties is increase in one&#8217;s rizq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another Hadith of Anas : There used to be 2 brothers at the time of the Messenger and one of them used to work to earn a living and the other one used to go and seek knowledge from the Prophet and he used to worship Allaah. So the one who earned a living complained about his brother to the Prophet and so the Prophet said : &#8216;May be you are giving sustenance to him. i.e may be Allaah made your sustenance plentiful because of you spending upon your brother.&#8217; So the sheikh reiterated saying: maybe you are given rizq because of him. And he said that this might enter under the category of spending on the student on knowledge. So one of the ways of joining ties of relationships is to spend. With this the Sheikh ends the remainder some of the many means of attaining sustenance and getting relief from distress. Wa sallaahu ala nabee ina Muhammad wa &#8216;ala Aaalihi wasahbihi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I finally advice myself and you with the taqwa of Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and to hold fast to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of the Messenger . May Allaah give us all tawfeeq and He affirms us on His deen and makes us upon the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>May Allaah reward the sister who Transcribed from the Audio </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">These were lessons conducted on the book &#8216;<strong>al-Qawl-ul- Mufeed Fee Adillatit-Tawhid&#8217; [Beneficial Speech in Establishing the Evidences of Tawhid] </strong>written by one of the major scholars of the Sunnah in Yemen, <strong>Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi</strong> (may Allah preserve him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were explained live via a telephone conference calling system by the Imam of the Masjid in Dar-ul-Hadith, Dammaj (Yemen), who is one of the senior scholars of the center of learning in Dammaj, <strong>Shaikh Ahmad al-Wasabi</strong> (may Allah preserve him). These lessons were conducted every Saturday from the period of April 2005 to June 2006. The .pdf files also contain questions which were asked in relation to the topic of the lesson in question.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reviver of the Sunnah in Yemen, <strong>Shaikh Muqbil ibn Hadi al-Wadi&#8217;ee</strong> (rahimahullah) [d.1422H], said regarding this book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This treatise deserves to be instilled in students in centres of learning due to the much good in contains since it is small in size and large in benefit&#8230;I also advise all the scholars of the Sunnah in Yemen to increase in their efforts in spreading knowledge, writings and lectures. And by the Praise of Allah this book has benefitted much and it has been recommended as a syllabus for students in many of the centres for learning the Sunnah. And few will you find on the Sunnah except that this book is in their homes.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaikh Muqbil (rahimahullah) goes on to praise the author of the book by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Shaikh Abu Ibrahim Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi al-Abdali established upon teaching, writing and calling to Allah. Allah has given him patience and full comprehension in all the branches of hadith and therefore the ability to judge the authenticity and weakness of the hadith&#8230;Our brother, Abu Ibraheem is assisted upon continuation of the journey in seeking and spreading knowledge by his Zuhd and by his concentration on knowledge and teaching until he became a reference and his fatawa and his statements became dependable, and that is by the Grace of Allah upon him. And Allah is the only one to bestow this Grace.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Mutawakkil : One Who depends upon Allah<br />
One of the names of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ataa ibn Yasar who said: ‘I met Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas and asked him, “Tell me about the description of Allaah’s Messenger which is mentioned in the Tawrah (i.e. Old Testament).” He replied, “Yes. By Allaah, he is described in the Tawrah with some of the qualities attributed to him in the Qur’aan as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O Prophet! We have sent you as a witness (for Allaah’s True Religion), and a giver of glad tidings (to the faithful believers), and a warner (to the unbelievers), and a guardian of the illiterates. You are My slave and My Messenger. I have named you <strong>“al-Mutawakkil” (who depends upon Allaah)</strong>. You are neither discourteous, harsh, nor a noise-maker in the markets, and you do not do evil to those who do evil to you, but you deal with them with forgiveness and kindness. Allaah will not let him (the Prophet) die until he makes straight the crooked people by making them say: “None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah,” with which will be opened blind eyes and deaf ears and enveloped hearts.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From Buraydah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhu) who said that the Messenger of Allaah ( peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>((Whoever takes an oath by al-Amaanah (the trust), then he is not from us)).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Aboo Daawud, no. 3253 with an authentic chain, authenticated by ash-Shaykh al-Albaanee in as-Saheehah, no. 94, and also authenticated by ash-Shaykh Muqbil in al-Jaami’ as-Saheeh 1/291.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the third hadeeth of Buraydah, Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that this great test and tribulation has affected the general people in the lands of the Muslims, such that they have become accustomed to this (i.e. swearing by al-Amaanah), and it has become widespread on their tongues to swear by al-Amaanah. And the trust (al-Amaanah) is a great thing to them, and they use as a proof for their action of this the statement of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Truly, We did offer AlAmaanah (the trust or moral responsibility or honesty and all the duties which Allaah has ordained) to the heavens and the earth, and the mountains, but they declined to bear it and were afraid of it (i.e. afraid of Allaah&#8217;s Torment). But man bore it. Verily, he was unjust (to himself) and ignorant (of itsresults).</span></em> (Al-Ahzaab 33:72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that in this verse is the affirmation that al-Amaanah, the trust, isa great thing. A great thing which Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa) has sent down upon the creation. A thing which mankind took and bore it. But if the person who swears by al-Amaanah is asked what is greater than al-Amaanah, he would say: ‘Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa).’ So why not swear by Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa), who is greater than all things, and he is the One who is entitled to glorification. And the promise of punishment that the Prophet ( peace be upon him) mentioned for the one who swears by al-Amaanah is that ‘he is not from us,’ which means that he is not from our path, our clear path and Manhaj (way /methodology).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon the person who due to accustom and habitual habits finds himself swearing by al-Amaanah, it is upon him to take note and to be careful of what comes out of his tongue, and that he must be truthful in his swearing, and that he must swear only by Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in regards to being truthful when swearing, the shaykh mentioned the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood (radiyAllaahu ‘anhu): The Prophet ( peace be upon him ) said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Whoever swears falsely in order to grab the property of a Muslim (or of his brother), Allaah will be angry with him when he meets Him.”</span> </em>Reported by al-Bukhaaree, no. 6238.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmed Wasabi then read to us from the book of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen, al- Qawl ul-Mufeed Sharh Kitaab ut-Tawheed, Beneficial Speech in Explaining the Book of Tawheed, which is an explanation of Kitaab ut-Tawheed of Shaykhul-Islaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul Wahhaab an- Najdee (rahimahullaah). He read to us from the chapter ‘Swearing by Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa)’:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The meaning of this is the <strong>glorification</strong> of the one that is being sweared by. And the reason of doing this action of swearing is to certify an issue by the remembrance of the one that is glorified. And it has specific terminology that is used in the Arabic language, certain words and phrases that are used to swear by, and they are known as <strong>Huroof al-Qasam</strong>, which consists of the harf <strong>baa, waav, and taa</strong> (<strong>billaahi</strong>, <strong>wallaahi</strong>, and <strong>tallaahi</strong>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a person who numerously swears by Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa), and is consistently and in all times found swearing by Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa), then this is a proof that his glorification of Allaah is weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the reason for mentioning these chapters in Kitaab ut-Tawheed is that from the perfection and completion of Tawheed is that a person glorifies Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa). And the fact that a person swears by Allaah numerously, without taking heed of what he is swearing about, then this is a proof that shows the weakness in his glorification of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa).”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Umar ibnul-Khattaab (radiyAllaahu ‘anhumaa) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) met ‘Umar ibnul-Khattaab (radiyAllaahu ‘anhu) while the latter was going with a group of camel-riders, and he was swearing by his father. So Allaah’s Messenger ( Peace be upon him) said, <strong>((Behold! Allaah (‘azza wa jall) forbids you to swear by your fathers, so whoever has to take an oath, he should swear by Allaah or keep quiet))</strong>. Reported by al- Bukhaaree, no. 6270 and Muslim, no. 1646. Also from him [‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Umar] (radiyAllaahu ‘anhumaa), who said, Allaah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said, <strong>((Whosoever wishes to take an oath then he should not take an oath except by Allaah)).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">In this hadeeth is the proof that it is not allowable to swear by other than Allaah, and that it is forbidden to swear by the created things.</span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;color:#993300;">And the thing that is sweared by, this is in actuality glorification of that which is sweared by, so the one who swears by the creation is glorifying it, and Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa) is greater than everything and He deserves glorification more than anything else that is in existence. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;color:#993300;">And the one who swears by other than Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa) has committed an act of shirk (association).</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Abee Hurayrah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhu) who said, Allaah’s Messenger ( peace be upon him) said, <strong>((Whoever amongst you swears, (saying by error) in his oath “By al-Laat and al-‘Uzzaa,” then he should say, “Laa Ilaaha illaAllaah (None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah).” And whoever says to his companions, “Come let me gamble with you,” then he must give something in charity (as an expiation for such a sin).))</strong> Reported by al-Bukhaaree, no. 4579 and Muslim, no. 1647.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The one who swears by other than Allaah without intentionally intending this, and the ones who become accustomed to this due to the fact that they have been brought up in Jaahiliyyah, then the Prophet (peace be upon him) has made clear to them the atonement of doing this act (i.e. swearing by other than Allaah in error), and it is by saying the statement of Laa Ilaaha illaAllaah.</span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The atonement for the one who swears by other than Allaah (i.e. in error) by saying the statement of Laa Ilaaha illaAllaah is the affirmation of worship to Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa) and its negation to other than Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa).</span></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Buraydah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhu) who said that the Messenger of Allaah ( peace be upon him) said, <strong>((Whoever takes an oath by al-Amaanah (the trust), then he is not from us)).</strong> Reported by Aboo Daawud, no. 3253 with an authentic chain, authenticated by ash-Shaykh al-Albaanee in as-Saheehah, no. 94, and also authenticated by ash-Shaykh Muqbil in al-Jaami’ as-Saheeh 1/291.</p>

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Qutaylah, the woman from Juhaynah, (radiyAllaahu ‘anhaa) that a Jew came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said: “Verily you make equal and verily you associate, you say: ‘What Allaah Wills and what you will,’ and you swear: ‘By al-Ka’bah.’ So the Prophet () ordered them: (If they want to swear, they should say: ‘By the Lord of al-Ka’bah,’ and they should say: ‘What Allaah Wills then what you will.’).” Narrated by an-Nisaa’ee 7/6, and authenticated by ash-Shaykh al-Albaanee in as-Saheehah: 1166, and also by ash-Shaykh Muqbil in the book as-Saheeh al-Musnad Mimmaa Laysa Fee as-Saheehayn 2/515.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">It is allowable to swear by the attributes of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa). </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Therefore, it is allowable for someone to swear by the Qur’aan, the Qur’aan being the speech of Allaah (jalla wa ‘alaa), and speech is an attribute of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa). </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As for al- Ka’bah, then it is not from the attributes of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’aalaa), and therefore it is not allowable for a person to swear by al-Ka’bah. So it is upon us to say as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, ‘By the Lord of al-Ka’bah.’</span></li>

<blockquote><p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It is that the slave fears someone other than Allaah, such as the Jinn, a dead person or other than that, as he fears Allaah or greater.</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (ta’laa) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">Have you not seen those who were told to hold back their hands (from fighting) and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat­as­Salât), and give Zakât, but when the fighting was ordained for them, behold! a section of them fear men as they fear Allâh or even more.</span> <span style="font-family:georgia;">(An-Nisa 4:77)</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">It is only Shaitân (Satan) that suggests to you the fear of his Auliyâ&#8217; [supporters and friends (polytheists, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh and in His Messenger, Muhammad SAW)], so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are (true) believers.</span> (Aali Imran 3:175)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our Lord (subhaana wa ta’laa) says:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"> Therefore fear not men but fear Me</span> . (Al-Ma&#8217;idah 5:44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explanation Of The Text By Shaykh Al-Wasaabee</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explaining the verse in Sooratun-Nisaa’ (4:77), the shaykh mentioned that this verse was revealed concerning a group of Companions, who while they were in Makkah, were weak and oppressed in the land, and were not able to defend themselves and to fight in the path of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa). And then the Prophet (peace be upon him ) and His Companions were ordered to make Hijrah to Madeenah. And after they had made Hijrah, Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa) ordered them to fight the kuffaar. And when this order came to them from Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa), a group of them fell into association with Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa) by fearing the people like they fear Allaah, or greater than they fear Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So it is not befitting for the creation of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa) to fear those who are like them, those who are also created</strong></span>. Those who are created from dust and clay, and those who are going to return to being clay.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Rajb (rahimahullaah) said that this is not permissible, and that it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not befitting for the people to fear the creation</strong></span> as they fear Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa). How can they fear the creation when they have been created from clay, and from dust, and verily they are to return back to it. And they are only to fear Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa), who is the King and Owner of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explaining the verse in Soorah Aali Imraan (3:175), the shaykh highlighted the context in which this verse was revealed by mentioning the two verses that precede this verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Those (i.e. believers) unto whom the people (hypocrites) said, &#8220;Verily, the people (pagans) have gathered against you (a great army), therefore, fear them.&#8221; But it (only) increased them in Faith, and they said: &#8220;Allâh (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs (for us).&#8221;</span> (Aali Imran 3:173)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So they returned with Grace and Bounty from Allâh. No harm touched them; and they followed the good Pleasure of Allâh. And Allâh is the Owner of Great Bounty.</span> (Aali Imran 3:174)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">It is only Shaitân (Satan) that suggests to you the fear of his Auliyâ&#8217; [supporters and friends (polytheists, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh and in His Messenger, Muhammad (Peace be upon him)], so fear them not, but fear Me, if you are (true) believers.</span> (Aali Imran 3:175)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this verse informs us that the shaytaan tries to push the people to fear his allies. And Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa) is more entitled to be feared of, as He is the One who has created us, and has brought us from nothing in existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explaining the verse is Sooratul-Maa’idah (5:44), the shaykh mentioned again that it is not befitting for someone to fear the people as one fears Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَنْظُرُ إِلَى صُوَرِكُمْ وَأَمْوَالِكُمْ وَلَكِنْ يَنْظُرُ إِلَى قُلُوبِكُمْ وَأَعْمَالِكُمْ<br />
&#8220;Verily, Allah does not look at your appearance or wealth, but rather He looks at your hearts and actions.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The 2 conditions are:<br />
<strong>1) al-Ikhlaas</strong><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">If one of the two, or even both are missing the action of the servant of Allaah becomes corrupt. May Allaah make our actions sincere for Allaah alone in accordance with the Sunnah of our beloved messenger Muhammad, sallAllaahu alahyi wa sallam.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A question posed to <em>Ash-Shaykh</em> <em>al-Allaamah Muhammad ibn &#8216;AbdulWahhab </em><em>al-Wasaabee (hafidhahullaah)</em>concerning the distinguishing characteristics and traits of <span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Ahl Tamyee&#8217;</em> (people who are laxadasical about the<em>deen</em>).</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>[Q]: </strong>What are the distinguishing characteristics and traits of <em>Ahl Tamyee&#8217;</em> (people who are laxadasical about the <em>deen</em>)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[A]:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">From their characteristics is that they do not hold on tenaciously to the <em>Qur&#8217;aan</em> and <em>Sunnah</em> of the Messenger <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em>. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">They are not people who have adherence and care for the Book of<strong>Allaah</strong> and <em>Sunnah</em> of the Messenger <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</em>, and they do not have a particular focus of the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and <em>Sunnah.</em> </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">They do not return to the major scholars of <em>Islaam</em>. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">You will find that if one of them is advised, he will not accept the advice, and he will not return to the truth rather he will become stubborn and will remain upon the issues he was advised against. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">He will follow his desires and whims, and you will also see that they are not people that are particularily successful in their statements and actions rather the lack of success is seen from them and the lack of guidance. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">You will see the effects of sins upon them and the effects of transgression are seen upon them. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">They are also close to other people of <em>tamy&#8217;ee</em> (negligent in the deen), and the people of <em>hizbiyyah</em> (partiisianship and sectarianism), and </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">they are close sometimes to the disbelievers. They become close to them and they veer away from the scholars, becasue being close to the scholars is a fear for them. They fear that the scholars will tie them down to the evidences, and the scholars will have them adhere to the rulings of the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and the <em>sunnah</em>, so they are not keen in being in touch with the scholars, but rather they are happy to be alone in their own places and their own domains so that no one can link them and tie them down to the evidences from the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and the <em>sunnah</em> and they are actually pleased with this, with being loners.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These are from their signs and their signs are many, and we ask <strong>Allaah</strong> for success</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fifth Invalidator Of Islam</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who hate anything that the Prophet came with are also disbelievers even if they act upon them.<br />
The Qurâan says: &#8220;That is because they hate that which Allah sent down, so He has made their deeds fruitless.&#8221; (Soorah 47:9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AL-WASAABEE:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The shaykh read to us from the book, Explanation of the Nullifiers of Islaam, by Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhaab (rahimahullaah), which was explained (sharh &#8220;Explanation of the Nullifiers of Islaam&#8221;) by Shaykh Abdul Azeez ibn Marzook. The shaykh read to us the following from the aforementioned book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever dislikes or hates something which the Prophet (Peace be upon him) came with, from his guidance or his rulings, then verily he has disbelieved in Allaah. And this is from the attributes of the hypocrites. The hypocrites who have nifaaq [hypocrisy] in belief. And this is nifaaq akbar (major hypocrisy) that takes one out of the fold of al-Islaam. A person who has this type of nifaaq, then he is in the lowest part of the hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever hates something from the legislation of Allaah and the guidance of the Prophet (Peace be upon him), whether it be his rulings, or his orders, or his forbiddances, or what has come from the Prophet (Peace be upon him) concerning belief; then he has exceeded his bounds, and has exposed himself to a wrath that he cannot bear. And even if one were to work in accordance with and agree to what one hates from the rulings and legislations of Allaah, then this will not benefit him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who hates the permissibly of having more than one wife in Islaam, and hates this legislation, then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, even though he may have more than one wife.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly is the one who dislikes the legislation of Allaah for the witnessing of two women, which equals the witness of one man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise is the one who he hates certain legislations that have been affirmed through news of the unseen, and believes that they do not agree with the aql (intellect), and that they are not an actuality and a reality. The proofs for this are the verses in Soorah Muhammad (47:8-9). Allaah (subhaana wa taâlaa) has categorized them and made them disbelievers, the reason behind this being that they hate what Allaah has revealed.</p>

by Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi (may Allah preserve him).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>TRANSLATION OF THE TEXT IN AL-QAWL-UL-MUFEED FEE ADILLATIT TAWHEED:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Du’aah Ilaa Bid’atihim (Caller to the innovation).</li>
<li>Ghayr Du’aah Ilayhaa (Those who do not call to it).</li>
</ol>
<p>See Hadee as-Saaree of al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar (rahimahullaah) page 385.</p>
<p><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AHMED AL-WASAABEE (HAFIDHAHULLAAH):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that the majority of the scholars are upon this division of the people of innovation:</p>
<ol>
<li>those who call to their innovation and</li>
<li>those who do not call to their innovation.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is mandatory upon us that we take caution from both categories. And the first category of people are more hazardous to the general people than the second category. And even the second category, those who do not call to their innovation, then caution must still be taken from them, for verily a person can be fooled by a particular persons’ statements and actions, because even though he may not be calling to his innovation directly and explicitly, but his actions and deeds are calling to his innovation, and this is very harmful to the slaves of Allaah, and they must take caution from this. And from the way of the Salaf was that they used to have complete caution from all types of people of innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">From Sa’eed ibn ‘Aamir who said: “I heard Ismaa’eel [i.e. Ibn Khaarijah] narrate, saying: ‘Two men from the people of the innovated sects came to Muhammad Ibn Seereen and said: “O Aboo Bakr we want to narrate something to you.” He said: “No.” They said: “Then may we recite an Aayah from Allaah’s book to you?” He said: “No, not even half of an Aayah!” He said: “Either you two get up and leave or I will get up.” So the two men stood up and left. So one of the people said: “What harm would it do to you for him to recite an Aayah?” He said: “I hated that he should recite an Aayah and that they would distort it and then it would enter my heart.”</span> [Reported in Sharh Usool I’tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah of Imaam al-Laalikaa’ee, no. 242.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that Ibn Seereen (rahimahullaah) was scared that something might fall into his heart from the beautiful words of that person of innovation, even though he was not calling to his innovation. So the way of the Salaf is that the people of innovation, the Ahlul-Bid’ah, are not to be sat with, and they are not to be listened to, and Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) has made Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in sufficiency, and there is no need for the people of innovation, whether they are calling to their innovation or are not calling to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the people are those who say concerning the people of innovation that we take from them [i.e. the Ahlul-Bid’ah] that which is good, and we leave off the evil that is with them. And Shaykh Ahmed (hafidhahullaah) mentioned that this is a false statement, and it is an incorrect statement. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And what is correct is that we do not take from the people of innovation in entirety</strong></span>. And there are great dangers in this [i.e. this false statement that we take the good and leave the bad], and the Shaykh mentioned a story that one of the early Salaf wanted to marry a woman who was known to be from a sect of the Khawaarij. And he hoped that by marrying her he might win her over to the Sunnah, but when he did marry her, it turned out that in fact she had pulled him to the beliefs of the Khawaarij.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi </strong>(may Allah preserve him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the religion of al-Islaam can be summarized into two basic important and mighty principles, and they are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First (al-Awwal):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That we do not worship anyone except Allaah alone, having no partner in that<br />
[An-laa Na’budu illa-Allaah Wahdahu laa Shareeka lah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (ta’aalaa) said:<br />
Say (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam): &#8220;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allaah, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allaah.&#8221; Then, if they turn away, say: &#8220;Bear witness that we are Muslims.&#8221; (Aali Imraan 3:64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said: And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. (Al-Israa’ 17:23)<br />
And this is the meaning of: (I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah) [Ash-hadu an-laa Ilaaha illa-Allaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And The Second (ath-Thaanee):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That we do not worship Him except by what He legislated in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Messenger Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), without innovations and desires [An-laa Na’budahu illaa bimaa Shara’ fee Kitaabihi aw fee Sunnati Rasoolihi Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) laa bil-Bida’i wal-Ahwaa’].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (ta’aalaa) said:<br />
[Say (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) to these idolaters (pagan ‘Arabs) of your folk:] Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord (the Qur’aan and Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s Sunnah), and follow not any Awliyaa&#8217; (protectors and helpers, etc. who order you to associate partners in worship with Allaah), besides Him (Allaah). Little do you remember! (Al-A&#8217;raaf 7:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it), and fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment. (Al-Hashr 59:7) And this is the meaning of: (I bear witness that Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah) [Ash-hadu anna Muhammadar-Rasool-ullaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) said in his valuable book ((Iqtidaa’ as- Siraatul-Mustaqeem Mukhaalifat Ashaab al-Jaheem)) [The Requirements of the Straight Path in Opposing the Companions of the Fire] page 451:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( And these two fundamentals: are the essence of the religion (Jimaa’ ad-Deen): That we do not worship anyone except Allaah and that we do not worship Him except with what He has legislated, and we do not worship Him with innovations … and these two fundamentals, they are the realization and the perfection of the two testimonies (ash-Shahaadatayn), which are the head of al- Islaam … ). End of quote. And see at-Tahqeeq wal-‘Eedaah of ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah) page: 63.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AHMED AL-WASAABEE (HAFIDHAHULLAAH):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the first fundamental principle, which is the Tawheed of Allaah, the Shaykh mentioned that in the Kitaab of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger we find many Aayaat and Ahaadeeth that point to this great fundamental principle. And it was for this cause that Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) sent His Messengers, and He ordered them to call the people first and foremost to this fundamental principle, which is the Tawheed of Allaah, and the oneness of Allaah in His worship (Tawheed al-Ulooheeyah), and the oneness of Allaah in His Names and Attributes (Tawheed al- Asmaa was-Sifaat), and the oneness of Allaah in His Lordship (Tawheed ar-Ruboobeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) said:<br />
And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): &#8220;Worship Allaah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities, etc. i.e. do not worship Taaghoot besides Allaah).&#8221; (An-Nahl 16:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said:<br />
And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam)) but We inspired him (saying): Laa Ilaaha Illaa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allaah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).&#8221; (Al-Anbiyaa’ 21:25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person worships Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) and obeys these commands of Allaah, then this is the realization of Tawheed, and this is the first fundamental which this religion of al-Islaam is based upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the second fundamental principle, and it is that we do not worship Allaah except by what He has legislated in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Messenger Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), and that we do not worship Him with innovations and desires. The Shaykh mentioned that those who beautify and make beautiful to themselves innovations and desires, and from the innovations is celebrating the Mawlid (birthday) of the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), which is an innovation of the Soofiyyah, and the Shaykh mentioned that this is not allowable in our religion and it is not legislated, and the people who perform this, they are under a severe threat. Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) has issued a severe warning against those who oppose and go against the commandments of the Messenger:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And let those who oppose the Messenger&#8217;s (Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam)) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them. (An-Noor 24:63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have been ordered to be followers and we have been ordered to take firm hold of the Sunnah. So that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has given us, then it is upon to take it and firmly hold on to it, and that which he prohibited us from then it is upon us to prohibit ourselves from it. And the one who goes against the clear orders of the Messenger (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) is in opposition to the Messenger, and he is on a great level of jeopardy, and if Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) does not give him the Tawfeeq to repent, and he dies upon this, then he is in a dangerous state. And many of the people in this day and age have fallen into numerous types of innovations, such as the Soofiyyah and the Raafidhah, and other than them. And they have not prohibited themselves from that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has prohibited them from, and they have not enjoined upon themselves that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has enjoined upon them and ordered them with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the valuable book of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah is the warning to the Believers of following the path of the people whose destination is the Fire, the people of the Book, the Jews and the Christians. And in this day and age we find many of the Muslims following the Kuffaar in all levels of life. And verily we have been ordered to oppose the Kuffaar in all actions and in all levels of life, such as our speech, and our character, and in our dress, and in our actions of worship, so much so that even in the prayer, as the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has said: ((Pray in your shoes, for verily the Jews do not pray in their shoes)). A Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And many of the Muslims have invented various holidays following in the footsteps of the Kuffaar, such as labor day, and workers holiday, and mothers day, and other holidays like this, all of which are alien to al-Islaam and all of which are innovations.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation Of The Text In Al-Qawl-Ul-Mufeed Fee Adillatit Tawheed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Benefit (Faa’idah):<br />
al-‘Allaamah Ibnul-Qayyim has mentioned in Zaad al-Ma’aad: 4/352:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (ta’aalaa) statement:<br />
Is it not sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur&#8217;aan) which is recited to them? (Al-&#8216;Ankaboot 29:51)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: ((Whosoever the Qur’aan does not heal, then may Allaah not heal him. And whosoever the Qur’aan does not suffice, then may Allaah not suffice him)) [Faman lam Yashfih al- Qur’aan, Falaa Shafaahul-Allaah, wa man lam Yakfih Falaa Kafaahul-Allaah]. End of quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Aboo Ibraaheem [2] said: Whosoever the Book and the Sunnah does not suffice, then may Allaah not suffice him. And whosoever the Book and the Sunnah does not satisfy, then may Allaah not satisfy him [Wa man lam Yakfih al-Kitaab was-Sunnah Falaa Kafaahul-Allaah, wa man lam Yaqna’ bil-Kitaab was-Sunnah Falaa Aqna’hul-Allaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AHMED AL-WASAABEE (HAFIDHAHULLAAH): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We find many of the people of innovation following the statements of their leaders in misguidance, and beautifying this to themselves and to the people, and leaving off the guidance of the Kitaab and the Sunnah. So the phrases that are mentioned in this chapter are supplications against these people and their likes, from the people of innovations and desires, those who are not satisfied, and do not find comfort in the Kitaab and the Sunnah, then these are supplications against them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It is permissible to make graveyards into roads and car parks, and to build shops upon them and other types of insults?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Answer, and Allaah is the One who Grants Success:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, insult and oppression is prohibited whether that is upon the living or upon the dead. Rather, it is more severely prohibited upon the dead due to these two noble Prophetic Hadeeths:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – From Abee Hurayrah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhu) who said: that Allaah’s Messenger ( Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said: ((That one of you should sit upon hot coals, and thereby burn his clothes and then his skin, is better for him than sitting upon a grave)). Reported by Muslim, no. 971.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – From ‘Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (radiyAllaahu ‘anhu) who said: that Allaah’s Messenger ( Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said:<br />
((For me to walk on coal or on a sword is more beloved to me than to walk upon the grave of a Muslim. And I would take more caution around a grave than when I relieve myself or in the middle of the market)). Narrated by Ibn Maajah: 1/499 with an authentic chain of narration. See al-Jaami’ as-Saheeh of ash-Shaykh Muqbil (rahimahullaahu ta’aalaa) 2/280.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say:<br />
Based upon this, it is not permissible for a Muslim who believes in Allaah and the Last Day to harm his Muslim brother, be he living or be he dead. And it is upon the state authorities to prevent the oppression of those who take the graveyards as roads and markets and places of sitting and resting. And it upon the scholars to clarify the truth that is with them, and Allaah is the One who Grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) said in al-Iqtidaa’, page 325:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( For verily the grave of a Muslim has a status as has come in the Sunnah, as it is the house of the Muslim who has died. So nothing is to be placed upon it from the impure things (an-Najaasaah), and this is in agreement with all the scholars, nor is it to be walked upon, nor is it to be leaned upon, and this is with us and the majority of the scholars (Jamhoor al-‘Ulamaa’). And they are not be present in the neighbourhood of those who harm the dead with statements and evil actions. And it is beloved and wanted that a person visits and sends Salaams upon the person of the grave, and makes Du’aa’ for him. And if the status of the dead person is high, then this right is even more valid ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And al-‘Allaamah al-Albaanee (rahimahullaah) said in Ahkaam al-Janaa’iz, pages 298-299:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(( And from this we know the prohibition of what some of the Islaamic governments do from the erasing of some of the graveyards of the Muslims, and the digging for the reason of improving living conditions, without any consideration for the status of these graveyards, and without any consideration of the prohibition of walking over them and the breaking of their bones, and other than this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And no one ponders if the arranging of housing affairs makes allowable these types of opposition. Verily, this is not allowed. For verily, these are not from the necessities (ad-Darooriyaat), but they are from that which reaches perfection. And it is not allowed to inflict this type of opposition and harm upon those who have died. So it is upon those who are living to arrange their affairs without harming those who have died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is truly amazing that you find some of these governments that they have a great concern and value for some stones and old buildings which have been built around the graveyards of the dead, more than they have value and concern for those who have died themselves. And verily, if some of these stones and ancient sites were to suffer some damage in their building designs, then they would go out of their way to alter and fix their building designs. But if it were a dead person, they have no value for it. Because they consider this to be from ancient rare objects which must be preserved! As for the graves of the dead, then they do not preserve them from these people! )) End.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And Shaykh Muqbil ibn Haadee al-Waadi’ee (rahimahullaah) was asked – about making the graveyards into marketplaces. As is mentioned in Qama’i al-Ma’aanid 1/165.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he responded: (( The graves are considered the houses of the dead, and it is not allowed for anybody to sit on a grave, and it is not allowed for cars to drive over the graveyard, and it is not allowed for anyone to sit upon the grave … And it is not allowed for the people to walk upon the graveyard, and it is not allowed for the graveyard to be changed into a playground or a learning center or a school or a Masjid, and other than these from the interests of the people … And it is obligatory upon the Muslims that they stop doing this, and even if a person were to build a five-storey house or higher than this upon a graveyard, then it would still not be allowable for him to live in, because the Prophet ( Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) has forbidden that people sit on the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The End</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above is taken from Class 45 of the below most excellent book:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>One of the names of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him)</h3>
<p align="justify">Narrated Ataa ibn Yasar who said: ‘I met Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘Aas and asked him, “Tell me about the description of Allaah’s Messenger which is mentioned in the Tawrah (i.e. Old Testament).” He replied, “Yes. By Allaah, he is described in the Tawrah with some of the qualities attributed to him in the Qur’aan as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">‘O Prophet! We have sent you as a witness (for Allaah’s True Religion), and a giver of glad tidings (to the faithful believers), and a warner (to the unbelievers), and a guardian of the illiterates. You are My slave and My Messenger. I have named you <strong>“al-Mutawakkil” (who depends upon Allaah)</strong>. You are neither discourteous, harsh, nor a noise-maker in the markets, and you do not do evil to those who do evil to you, but you deal with them with forgiveness and kindness. Allaah will not let him (the Prophet) die until he makes straight the crooked people by making them say: “None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah,” with which will be opened blind eyes and deaf ears and enveloped hearts.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>These were lessons conducted on the book &#8216;al-Qawl-ul- Mufeed Fee Adillatit-Tawhid&#8217; [Beneficial Speech in Establishing the Evidences of Tawhid] written by one of the major scholars of the Sunnah in Yemen, Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi (may Allah preserve him).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam al-Awwal (The First Category): </strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>They do not want by this from the people a recompense or thankfulness, and nor do they seek a high position with them, and they do not seek praise and position in their heart, and they are not fleeing from their rebuke. Verily, they see the people [who are alive] in the position of the people of the grave, those who do not control for them harm or benefit, or life or death, or resurrection. So actions for the people, and seeking a position with them,and hoping in harm or benefit from them [i.e. the general people], is not from them [i.e. these category of people]. Verily, it is from those who are ignorant of the situation and ignorant of their Lord. And whoever knows the people and puts them in their proper places, and knows Allaah, is sincere in his actions and his statements and his givings and his forgivings and his love and his hatred. So no one does actions and deeds for the creation other than Allaah except that he is ignorant of Allaah and ignorant of the creation. For verily, the one who knows Allaah and knows the people prefers actions and deeds for Allaah over actions and deeds for the people.</li>
<li>So their actions, all of them, are for Allaah, and all of their statements are for Allaah, and their giving and their forgiving is for Allaah, and their love is for Allaah and their hatred is for Allaah, and their actions, both in the apparent and the hidden, are for the face of Allaah alone.</li>
<li>Those who have gathered between Ikhlaas (sincerity) and Mutaabi’ah (following the guidance of the Prophet).</li>
<li>And like this their actions, all of them, and their worship is in agreement with the command of Allaah, and with what He loves and what He is Pleased with. And Allaah does not accept from the people any action except this. And Allaah has tested His servants with life and death, so He said: Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. (Al-Mulk 67:2)</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He has made that which is upon the earth as a beauty for them upon the earth so that He may test them which of them are best in actions and deeds. al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyyaad said: A beautiful action (al-‘Amal al-Hasan) is that which is sincere (Akhlasuh) and that which is correct (Aswabuh).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: Oh Abaa ‘Alee, what is sincere and what is correct? He said: Verily, if the action is sincere (Khaalis) but it is not correct (Sawaab): it is not accepted (Lam Yuqbal), and if it is correct but it is not sincere: it is not accepted, until it is sincere and correct. And a sincere [action] is: that which is for Allaah, and a correct [action] is: that which is upon the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is mentioned in His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord. (Al-Kahf 18:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His (ta’aalaa) statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allaah (i.e. follows Allaah&#8217;s Religion of Islaamic Monotheism); and he is a Muhsin (a good-doer). And follows the religion of Ibraaheem (Abraham) Haneefaa (Islaamic Monotheism &#8211; to worship none but Allaah Alone). (An-Nisaa’ 4:125)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah does not accept from the actions except that which is done sincerely seeking His Face, and that which is in agreement with His Order, and other than this is not accepted, rather it is repelled back on the person who does it at a time when he is in most need of it, and it is turned intoscattered ashes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in as-Saheehayn [i.e. al-Bukhaaree and Muslim] from the narration of ‘Aa’ishah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhaa) who narrated from the Prophet (Peace be Upon him), that he said: ((Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected)). And in the narration from Muslim: ((Whoever does a deed that is not ordered by us will have it rejected)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every action that is not in agreement [with the Sunnah], then it does not increase its doer except in distance away from Allaah, for verily Allaah (ta’aalaa) is only worshipped with what He has ordered to be worshipped with, not with opinions (Aaraa’) and desires (Ahwaa’).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam ath-Thaanee (The Second Category): </strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Those who have no sincerity and have no adherence to the Sunnah,so their actions and deeds are not in agreement with the legislation, and they are not sincere to the One who is worshipped.</li>
<li>They are like the ones who beautify themselvesto the people, showing-off to them with that which Allaah has not decreed and that which the Messenger has not informed the people of. And they are the evilest of creation (Shiraarul-Khalq).</li>
<li>And they are the most disliked and the most hated of people to Allaah (‘azza wa jall), and they havethe biggest portion of His (ta’aalaa) statement: Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think not you that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment. (Aali Imraan3:188)</li>
<li>They are happy with what they do from innovation (Bid’ah) and misguidance (Dalaalah) and association (Shirk), and they love that they be praised as they are the followers of the Sunnah and the people of sincerity – and they are not from the people of the Sunnah or sincerity (Ahlus-Sunnati wal-Ikhlaas) –</li>
<li>And this category of people are numerous, from the people who have gone astray from the ones who are alienated from the people of knowledge (‘Ilm), and poverty (Faqr), and worship (‘Ibaadah), from the Straight Path (Siraatul-Mustaqeem).</li>
<li>For verily they do actions of innovation and misguidance to show-off and to be heard-off, and they love to be praised for that which they have not done from the following of the Sunnah, and possessing sincerity and knowledge. So they are the people of hatred and misguidance (Ahlul-Ghadabi wad-Dalaal).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam ath-Thaalith (The Third Category)</strong>:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The one who is sincere in his actions and deeds,but his actions and deeds are not in agreement with the order of Allaah.</li>
<li>And they are like the ignorant worshippers and the ones who are from the path of abstinence (Zuhud) and poverty (Faqr).</li>
<li>And they are the ones who worship Allaah with other than what He has decreed and legislated, and they believe that their worship is bringing them close to Allaah.</li>
<li>And they believe that listening to clapping and whistling is bringing them close to Allaah, and being isolated and leaving off the Jumu’ah [i.e. the Friday prayer] and the Jama’ah [i.e. the mandatory prayers] is also being close to Allaah, and continuing the fast until the night is also being close to Allaah, and fasting the two holidays (Siyaam al-‘Eedayn) of al-Islaam is also a way of being close to Allaah.</li>
<li>And they try to get close to Allaah with actions of innovation (Bid’ah) and disobedience (Ma’aasee).</li>
<li>So the sincerity of a person in this state does not benefit him because these actions that he does are from the actions of innovation. And the actions of the innovator are not accepted, and the proof being in the Hadeeth of Umm-ul-Mu’mineen ‘Aa’ishah (radiyAllaahu ‘anhaa), raised to the saying of the Prophet (Peace be upon him): ((Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it will have it rejected)). Agreed Upon [i.e. reported by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim].</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Qisam ar-Raabi’ (The Fourth Category):</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>The one whose actions are in accordance with the Sunnah, but they are for the sake of other than Allaah.</li>
<li>Such as obedience of the ones who show-off, and like the ones who fight to show-off, and because of great pride and great courageousness. And he does the Hajj so that it may be said that he has performed the Hajj.</li>
<li>And he reads the Qur’aan so that it may be said that he reads the Qur’aan.</li>
<li>And the actions of these people, from the apparent they seem righteous, but they are not righteous since they are performed for other than the sake of Allaah, so they are not accepted. Allaah (ta’aalaa) said: And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him). (Al-Baiyinah 98:5)</li>
<li>So they have not been ordered except that they worship Allaah with that which He has legislated and with sincerity to Him in all their worship.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of sincerity and adherence (Ahlul-Ikhlaas wal-Mutaabi’ah), they are the people of:You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). (Al-Faatihah 1:5)</p>
