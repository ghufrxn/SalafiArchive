<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Difference between Kufr and Shirk</strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A Muslim sister N. S. `A from Riyadh says: What is the difference between Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)? Please, advise. May Allah reward you!</span></strong></p>



<p><strong><span style="color:#808080;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Kufr</strong> </span>is the denial and concealment of the Truth such as those who deny the obligation of Salah, Zakah, Sawm, Hajj in case of being financially and physically able, and dutifulness to one&#8217;s parents, and so on.&nbsp;It is also like those who deny the prohibition of Zina (premarital sexual intercourse and/or adultery), consuming Khamr (intoxicants), and disobeying one’s parents.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shirk</span> </strong>is to devote the acts of worship to anything beside Allah (Exalted be He) such as those who seek the help of the dead, the absent, the Jinn, idols, the stars, and so on or those who offer sacrifices or make vows to them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A Kafir (disbeliever) may be called a Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and vice versa. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says,</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allâh, any other ilâh (god), of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! Al­Kâfirûn (the disbelievers in Allâh and in the Oneness of Allâh, polytheists, pagans, idolaters) will not be successful.</span></strong>&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Allah (may He be Praised) also says, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode.&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In Surah Fatir, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Such is Allâh, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmîr (the thin membrane over the date­stone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص) like Him Who is the All­Knower (of everything).&#8221;</span> </strong>Here, Allah (Exalted be He) names their call upon things other than Him as Shirk and in Surah Al­Mu&#8217;minun, Allah (Exalted be He) names it Kufr.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In Surah Al­Tawbah, Allah (Glorified be He) says, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;They (the disbelievers, the Jews and the Christians) want to extinguish Allâh’s Light (with which Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص has been sent ­ Islâmic Monotheism) with their mouths, but Allâh will not allow except that His Light should be perfected even though the Kâfirûn (disbelievers) hate (it). It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islâm), to make it superior over all religions even though the Mushrikûn (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) hate (it).&#8221;</strong></span> Here, Allah (Exalted be He) calls the disbelievers as Kuffar and Mushriks. This indicates that a Kafir may be called a Mushrik and vise versa. There are many Ayahs and Hadith that stress the same meaning.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, between a man and Shirk and Kufr is the negligence of prayer.</strong></span>&#8221; (Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir Ibn `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them).He (peace be upon him) also said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The covenant that distinguishes between us and them (the hypocrites) is Salah. Anyone who abandons it is a Kafir.</strong></span>&#8221; (Related by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Al­Tirmidhy, Al­Nasa&#8217;y, and Ibn Majah with a Sahih chain of transmission on the authority of Buraydah ibn Al­Hasib, may Allah be pleased with him).May Allah grant us success!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Explanation of Allah’s Saying: &#8220;Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Allah (Exalted be He) says in His Noble Book (what means): <em>&#8220;Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire&#8221;</em>. What is meant by hypocrisy and hypocrites in this Ayah (Qur’anic verse)? Please clarify their meaning.</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hypocrites are those who make a false pretense of Islam, when they are professing otherwise. They claim to be Muslims, although deep down they disbelieve in Allah and belie the Messenger (peace be upon him). These are the hypocrites who are so called because they show Islam, while hiding Kufr (disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And of mankind, there are some </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(hypocrites) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">who say: &#8220;We believe in Allâh and the Last Day&#8221; while in fact they believe not. They </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(think to)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> deceive Allâh and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves, and perceive </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(it)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> not! In their hearts is a disease </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(of doubt and hypocrisy) </span><span style="color:#008000;">(namely doubt and suspicion) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and Allâh has increased their disease. A painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This theme is continued in the Ayahs following them in Surah Al­Baqarah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the hypocrites who disbelieve in Allah and belie His Messengers (peace be upon them). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allâh, but it is He Who deceives them. And when they stand up for As­Salât </strong>(the prayer)<strong>, they stand with laziness and to be seen of men, and they do not remember Allâh but little. </strong>(They are) <strong>swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those.</strong></span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that they vacillate between the Kafirs (disbelievers) and the Muslims; at times they support the Kafirs when they prevail and achieve victory and at other times they support the believers when they prevail and achieve victory. They are not steadfast; their Din (religion) is not constant, and their Iman (Faith) is not solid. They waver between the state of Kufr and the state of Iman, and between the Kafirs and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) has disclosed their Kufr in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allâh and in His Messenger </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and that they came not to As­Salât </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the prayer) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">except in a lazy state, and that they offer not contributions but unwillingly. So let not their wealth nor their children amaze you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad</span><span style="color:#008000;">sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">; in reality Allâh’s Plan is to punish them with these things in the life of this world, and that their souls shall depart </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(die) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">while they are disbelievers.</span></strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the hypocrites. We ask Allah to grant us safety and protection.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>33 &#8211; Ruling on raising one&#8217;s hands and rubbing one&#8217;s face after supererogatory Prayer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on raising one&#8217;s hand and rubbing one&#8217;s face after offering Tahiyyat-ul-Masjid (two-unit-Prayer to greet the mosque), optional Prayer and Al-Sunan Al-Rawatib (supererogatory prayer that was stressed and regularly performed by the Prophet)?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Raising one&#8217;s hands is one of the ways to have supplications answered. It is reported in a Prophetic Hadith that raising one&#8217;s hands is a way to have supplications answered. So, it is permissible for a Muslim to raise his hands after offering supererogatory prayer or at other times; however, he should not keep doing so, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) would not keep doing so all the time, but he may peace be upon him) sometimes did it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for obligatory prayer</strong>, neither the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor the Companions did it, but they would sometimes do it <strong>after supererogatory Prayer</strong> according to the religious evidence permitting raising one&#8217;s hands on supplicating to Allah when it is done from time to time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <strong>rubbing one&#8217;s face</strong> after supplicating to Allah (Exalted be He), nothing has been reported about it in authentic Prophetic Hadiths. However, some weak Hadiths allow it, so the Muslim scholars see that such weak Hadiths support one another and authenticate one another. Thus, there is nothing wrong if a Muslim rubs the face after supplicating to Allah (Exalted be He), but it is better not to do it, because no authentic Hadith reported this act, i.e. rubbing one&#8217;s face after supplicating.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Necessity of approaching Allah with Tawbah and supplication in adversity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Abdul­‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdullah ibn Baz to every Muslim who reads this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah help us remember Him and take warnings and lessons from the destinies unfolding before our eyes and lead us to sincere Tawbah (repentance to Allah) from all sins and misdeeds. Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As­salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) wills with His Deep Wisdom, absolute Proof, and all­ Encompassing Knowledge to test His Servants with prosperity and adversity, poverty and affluence, blessings and calamities, to try their patience and thankfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Anyone who is patient at the time of adversity, thankful at the time of prosperity, humbles themselves and supplicates to Allah upon facing hardships, acknowledges their sins and shortcomings, and asks Allah for His Mercy and Forgiveness, has succeeded and will be granted the blessed end. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) revealed in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Alif­ Lâm ­Mîm.</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur’ân, and none but Allâh (Alone) knows their meanings.]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: &#8220;We believe,&#8221; and will not be tested. And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allâh will certainly make </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(it)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> known </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the truth of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> those who are true, and will certainly make </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(it) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">known </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the falsehood of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> those who are liars, </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(although Allâh knows all that before putting them to test)</span><strong>. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fitnah (trial) mentioned in this Ayah (Qur’anic verse) means the test of faith that makes evident the truthful from the liar, the patient and the thankful, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We have made some of you as a trial for others: will you have patience? And your Lord is Ever All­ Seer (of everything)</span></strong>&#8220;. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) further says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good. And to Us you will be returned.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We tried them with good </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(blessings) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and evil </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(calamities)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> in order that they might turn</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (to Allâh’s Obedience)</span>&#8220;. The good refers here to the blessings of fertility, prosperity, good health, honor, victory over enemies, and the like, while the evil here are adversities, such as diseases, domination of the enemy, earthquakes, hurricanes, storms, torrential destructive floods, and the like. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Evil </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(sins and disobedience to Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> has appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of men have earned </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by oppression and evil deeds)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, that He</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by repenting to Allâh, and begging His Pardon)</span>&#8220;. This means that Allah (may He be Praised) predestined the good and the evil and the occurrence of corruption for people to return to Al-­Haqq (the Truth), to hurry and make Tawbah from what Allah has forbidden them, and hasten to the obedience of Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kufr (disbelief) and sins are the cause of all afflictions and evil in this world and the Hereafter, while tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and Iman (belief) in Him and His Messengers, obedience to Him and His Messengers, holding fast to His Shari‘ah (Islamic law), Da‘wah (calling) people to it, and refuting those who oppose it, are the causes of all good in this world and in the Hereafter. Perseverance on these principles and enjoining and cooperating in them bring honor in this world and the Hereafter, and salvation from every evil and protection from every Fitnah (trial). Allah (may He be Praised) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! If you help </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in the cause of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm. And He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(may He be Praised) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">says: Verily, Allâh will help those who help His </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Cause)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. Truly, Allâh is All ­Strong, All ­Mighty</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span>. Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) enjoin Iqamat­ as­Salât [i.e. to perform the five compulsory congregational Salât (prayers) (the males in mosques)], to pay the Zakât and they enjoin Al­Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid Al­ Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islâm has forbidden) [i.e. they make the Qur’ân as the law of their country in all the spheres of life]. And with Allâh rests the end of (all) matters (of creatures). He (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieves after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh). </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwâ (piety), certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth, but they belied (the Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what they used to earn (polytheism and crimes).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Praised) explains in many Ayahs that the afflictions and exemplary punishments that befell the preceding nations, such as floods, devastating winds, the mighty shriek, and being swallowed up by the earth, and the like, were nothing more than the result of their Kufr and sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:<strong><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;So We punished each (of them) for his sins; of them were some on whom We sent Hâsib (a violent wind with shower of stones) [as on the people of Lût (Lot)], and of them were some who were overtaken by As­-Saihah [torment ­ awful cry. (as Thamûd or Shu‘aib’s people)], and of them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow [as Qârûn (Korah)], and of them were some whom We drowned [as the people of Nûh (Noah), or Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his people]. It was not Allâh Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves.&#8221; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised and Exalted) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much.&#8221;</span></strong> (See the Qur’ân Verse 35:45).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah orders His Servants to turn to Him in sincere Tawbah (repentance to Allah) and supplicate to Him at the time of adversity, as He (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe! Turn to Allâh with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And all of you beg Allâh to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful He (may He be Praised) &#8220;</span></strong> also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you (O Muhammad ىلص ملـسو هـيلع اللها). And We seized them with extreme poverty (or loss in wealth) and loss in health (with calamities) so that they might humble themselves (believe with humility). When Our Torment reached them, why then did they not humble themselves (believe with humility)? But their hearts became hardened, and Shaitân (Satan) made fair­ seeming to them that which they used to do.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this glorious Ayah, Allah urges His Slaves and awakens in them the desire that, when they face adversities, such as illness, wounds, fighting, earthquakes, winds, storms, and other tribulations, they should humble themselves to Him in need of Him and ask for His Help. This is the meaning of Allah’s Saying: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">When Our Torment reached them, why then did they not humble themselves (believe with humility)?</span></strong>&#8221; It asks why they (the preceding nations) did not turn to Allah humbly when they were inflicted with torment. Allah then tells that their hard­ heartedness and the handiwork of Satan, making evil deeds pleasing to them, prevented them from Tawbah, supplication, and beseeching forgiveness. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But their hearts became hardened, and Shaitân (Satan) made fair­ seeming to them that which they used to do.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported that the Rightly ­Guided Caliph, Amir Al ­Mu’minin (Commander of the Believers), ‘Umar ibn ‘Abdul­‘Aziz (may Allah be merciful to him), when there was an earthquake during his era, wrote to his agents in the different countries and ordered them to tell the Muslims to make Tawbah to Allah, humble themselves to Him, and seek His Forgiveness from their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All you Muslims know the different types of Fitan (trials) and calamities that prevail in our time, among which is the that the Kafirs have power over the Muslims in Afghanistan, the Philippines, India, Palestine, Lebanon, Ethiopia, and other countries. There have also been earthquakes in Yemen and many countries; devastating floods, and violent hurricanes that have destroyed homes, trees, ships, and other properties; avalanches that have brought about incalculable harm; and famines and droughts in a multitude of countries. All this and much more are the different types of punishment that Allah afflicts upon His Servants due to their Kufr and misdeeds, deviation from His Obedience, zeal for this world and its transient pleasures, and turning away from the Hereafter and failing to prepare for it; except those to whom Allah has shown His Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that all such adversities obligate Allah’s Servants to hasten to make sincere Tawbah to Him (may He be Praised) from all that He prohibited them from, to return to His Obedience, to rule according to the Shari‘ah (Islamic law), to cooperate in righteousness and piety, and advise one another to adhere to the truth and have patience. The moment the Servants repent to their Lord, humble themselves to Him, and hasten to do what pleases Him: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Help you one another in Al­Birr and At­Taqwâ (virtue, righteousness and piety)</span></strong> and enjoin one another to do good and forbid one another from evil, Allah will set their affairs aright and ward off the evil of their enemies, grant them authority in the land, give them victory over their enemies, bestow upon them His Blessings, and protect them from His Punishment. Allah, the Truest Speaker, says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">and (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them)&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors. And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order, and invoke Him with fear and hope. Surely, Allâh’s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good­ doers&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(commanding you)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">: &#8220;Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, that He may grant you good enjoyment, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding Grace to every owner of grace (i.e. the one who helps and serves the needy and deserving, physically and with his wealth, and even with good words). But if you turn away, then I fear for you the torment of a Great Day </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e. the Day of Resurrection)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practice their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided)&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) further says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al­Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al­Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden); they perform As­Salât (Iqâmat­as­Salât), and give the Zakât, and obey Allâh and His Messenger. Allâh will have His Mercy on them. Surely Allâh is All­ Mighty, All­ Wise&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) clarifies in these Ayahs that His Mercy, Benevolence, Protection, and all His other Blessings are granted in full and shall continue to be given in the Hereafter to those who fear Him, believe in Him, obey His Messengers, hold fast to His Shar‘iah (Islamic Law), and make Tawbah to Him from their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But for those who shun His Obedience, are too proud to fulfill the Rights owed to Him, and persist in their Kufr and disobedience, Allah (may He be Praised) threatens them with different punishments in this life and the Hereafter, and shall expedite the share of punishment which He has allotted for them (in this world. ed.), as His wisdom dictates, for them to be an example and warning to others. Allah (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them (in punishment), and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows. So the root of the people who did wrong was cut off. And all the praises and thanks are to Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinn, and all that exists).&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Muslims! Call yourselves to account for your deeds, make Tawbah to your Lord, and seek His Forgiveness. Hasten to obedience and be on your guard against disobedience, and cooperate in righteousness and piety. Do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good. Be just; indeed, Allah loves those who act justly. Make provision of righteous acts before death befalls you. Show mercy to the weak, help the poor, increase your Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah), ask for His Forgiveness, enjoin that which is good and forbid that which is evil that you may receive mercy. Take admonition from what happened to the preceding nations due to their sins and misdeeds. Indeed, Allah accepts the Tawbah of the penitent, shows mercy to the doers of good, and grants a blessed end to the pious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Praised) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for Al-­Muttaqûn (the pious) And He (Exalted be He) says: Truly, Allâh is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him), and those who are Muhsinûn (good­doers)</span></strong>. (See the footenote of V.9:120).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah with His Most Beautiful Names and Most High Attributes to show mercy to the Muslims, grant them understanding of the Din (religion), give them victory over His and their enemies among the Kafirs and hypocrites, afflicting them with His Wrath that never will be turned back from the wrongdoers. He is the Guardian and the One Who is Capable of doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions, and those who follow them in righteousness until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As­salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q3: What is the ruling on amulets consisting of the Qur’an and other things? </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Amulets that consist of other than the Qur’an such as bones, talismans, cowrie shells, wolf’s hair and the like are all evil and Haram (prohibited) by the Nas (Islamic text from the Qur’an or the Sunnah)</strong></span>. It is not permissible to hang them on anybody or anything, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Anyone who wears an amulet, may Allah not fulfill it (i.e., their purpose) for them, and whoever wears a cowrie shell, may Allah not give them peace.” And in another narration, he (peace be upon him) said, “Anyone who wears an amulet has committed Shirk (associated others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if amulets consist of the Qur’an or well­known good supplications, this is a controversial matter among the scholars. Some say that such amulets are permissible. This opinion was reported from a group of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) who likened it to recitation (of some Qur’anic Ayahs and supplications) over sick people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others say that it is not permissible. This opinion is supported by ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud and Hudhaifah (may Allah be pleased with them both). A group of the Salaf and the righteous successors said it is not permissible to tie amulets even if they are from the Qur’an in accordance with the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>principle of Sadd­ul­Dhara’i (blocking the means leading to sins)</strong> </span>and to forestall acts of Shirk and to act upon the general meaning of the Hadiths. This is because the Hadiths that prohibit amulets are general and make no exception. Muslims should abide by the general ruling. Therefore, it is basically not permissible to use any kind of amulets in order not to permit people to use some other types of amulets, thus leading to confusing matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to prohibit all types of amulets and this is the soundest opinion for the obvious evidence supporting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If we permit the use of amulets made from the Qur’an and good supplications, it will open the door for people to wear any form of amulets they like</strong></span>. Then, if they are reproved for what they do, they will say that they are amulets consisting of the Qur’an or good supplications. Consequently, the door will be opened, the hole will expand and all types of amulets (whether from the Qur’an or anything else) will be worn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is another reason for their prohibition, which is the fact that people may enter the bathroom and other unclean places while wearing them</strong></span>. It is well­known that the Words of Allah (the Qur’an) are too sacred to be in such places and it is not appropriate to take them into bathrooms.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Fatwa No. 8377</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I would like to raise an issue that caused a dispute between some people. It is the writing of the word &#8220;Allah&#8221; and the word &#8220;Muhammad&#8221; in an interlacing shape on top of the door of one of the Masjids (mosques) in Adlab. Some of them said that it is not permissible to write these names in such a shape. The proof they mentioned to support their viewpoint was that in this way, Muhammad&#8217;s status (peace be upon him), would be the same as Allah&#8217;s which is not reasonable. Others said that writing them in such a way is permissible as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) places His name beside the name of His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him). I would like you to guide me to what is right. Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans. by Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;, KSA:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shari&#8217;ah (Islamic law) texts join between testifying that no one is worthy of worship except Allah and testifying that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah in certain places, such as in Adhan (call to Prayer), Iqamah (call to start the Prayer), in the Hadith: Islam is based on five pillars: (Testifying that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah&#8230;) and other places. These texts point out what Mukallafun (legally competent persons) should believe in with regard to Allah and the Messenger, such as saying that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But mixing the two words in writing was not mentioned in the Book of Allah or the Sunnah </strong>(whatever is reported from the Prophet, peace be upon him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Moreover, mixing both words in writing contains great danger as this is similar to the false creed of the Christians with regard to the trinity. They believe that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one God.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It also contains an element of the false creed of pantheism, and leads to elevating the Prophet </strong>(peace be upon him)<strong> and worshipping him along with Allah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is prohibited to write the Name of Allah and the name of His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) by mixing the letters of the two words together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is also <strong>prohibited to write the words (Allah &#8211; Muhammad) next to each other</strong> on the top of the door of the Masjids or any other place because doing so may contain some delusion and misguidance with regard to the prohibitions mentioned above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

They take as evidence the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse): &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> were not on the western side</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (of the Mount)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span></strong> and:  &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">You were not with them, when they cast lots with their pens as to which of them should be charged with the care of Maryam </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Mary)</span>; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">nor were you with them when they disputed&#8221;</span></strong>. They claim that the two Ayahs denote that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) was not with them, but Allah was there in His Self ­Entity, as he exists everywhere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since those people misunderstand the whole point and made a big mistake, opposing the true `Aqidah (creed) as shown in the Holy Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah and as adopted by the Salaf (righteous predecessors) of the Muslim nation, I think I should show the right opinion on such a false belief and what seems to be confusing about this point pertaining to Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Exalted and Glorified) can be described only with the Names and Attributes with which He has described Himself and the Names and Attributes with which His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) described Him, which suit His Majesty without Takyif (questioning Allah&#8217;s Attributes), Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation), Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), or Ta`til (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes). This is because Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All­ Hearer, the All­ Seer&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As stated in the Holy Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah and unanimously agreed upon by the Salaf of the Muslim nation, Allah (Glorified be He) is above His creatures and is seated on His Throne in a manner that suits His Majesty, unlike the seating of His creation. Allah (Exalted be He) is among His creatures with His knowledge and nothing is concealed about them from Him. This is what has been proven by the Holy Qur&#8217;an with its rhetoric Ayahs and by the Prophetic Sunnah with its direct authentic Hadiths.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>There are many Qur&#8217;anic proofs</strong></span> that Allah exists in the heavens above His creatures and is seated on His Throne. Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">To Him ascend </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(all)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it (i.e. the goodly words are not accepted by Allâh unless and until they are followed by good deeds) ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I will take you and raise you to Myself ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The angels and the Rûh</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [Jibrîl (Gabriel)]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> ascend to Him ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Istawâ)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> rose over the Throne </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in a manner that suits His Majesty)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. The Most Gracious </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">! ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, will not cause the earth to sink with you Or do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, will not send against you a violent whirlwind? ; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Gracious </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> rose over </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Istawâ)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Mighty)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Throne </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in a manner that suits His Majesty)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. and: O Hâmân! Build me a tower that I may arrive at the ways The ways of the heavens, and I may look upon the Ilâh </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(God)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> of Mûsâ </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Moses)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">: But verily, I think him to be a liar.</span></strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for the proofs from the Prophetic Sunnah</span></strong>, there are uncountable numbers of Sahih (authentic) and Hasan (good) Hadiths, such as: the Hadith about the Prophet&#8217;s Mi`raj (Ascension to the heavens) to his Lord and the Hadith about the Ruqyah (reciting Qur&#8217;an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing) which was reported by Abu Dawud and others: &#8220;<strong>Our Lord is Allah Who is in the heaven; Holy is Your Name, Your command reigns supreme in the heaven and the earth</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Hadith about the mountain goats, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span><strong>..and the Throne is above this; Allah is above the Throne; and He knows your states</strong><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span>. (Related by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and others)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an authentic Hadith he (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said to the bonds woman: &#8220;Where is Allah?&#8221; She replied: &#8220;In the heaven.&#8221; He (peace be upon him) asked her: &#8220;Who am I?&#8221; She replied: &#8220;You are the Messenger of Allah.&#8221; Then he (peace be upon him) said to her master: &#8220;Release her for she is a believer.&#8221; (Related by Muslim in his Sahih book of Hadith)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other Hadiths that were authentically reported from the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) stating that Allah&#8217;s Messenger said that Allah is above His Throne and that He is above the heavens, as naturally known by all nations, Arabs and non­-Arabs both in the pre­Islamic period and under Islam, except those whom Satan has allured. Also, there are hundreds or thousands of statements by the Salaf on the same topic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing in the Holy Qur&#8217;an, the Prophetic Sunnah or the statements of the Salaf, neither from among the Prophet&#8217;s Companions nor those who followed their guidance or the Imams who lived in the age of allurement and difference, that opposes what has been mentioned above whether explicitly or implicitly. None of them ever said that Allah is not above the heavens, not above the Throne, not exist anywhere in His Self ­Entity, all places are the same to Him, or not exist in the world nor outside it, not permissible to use your fingers, etc. to point at Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contrarily, it was authentically reported in the Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir Ibn `Abdullah that on concluding a famous sermon by Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) on the Day of `Arafat in the biggest gathering attended by Allah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam), he said: &#8220;<strong>Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you, haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you</strong>.&#8221; They said: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then He (peace be upon him) raised his finger to the sky and pointed at the people and said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong></span><strong>O Allah! Bear witness to this</strong>.&#8221; There are many similar Hadiths on this point.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also discussed by Shaykh­ul ­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and others who were well ­versed in such matters (see Al ­Fatawa, v., p. 14).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Generally, the corrupt belief adopted by the impairing <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Jahmiyyah</span> </strong>(a deviant Islamic sect denying some Attributes of Allah, claiming they are ascribed to people and cannot be ascribed to Allah) and those following them from among the people who introduced innovations to the religion is one of the most wicked and harmful beliefs. It detracts from Allah&#8217;s Majesty ­ we seek refuge in Allah from our hearts&#8217; deviation from the right path! There are many pieces of evidence of such misleading and corrupt beliefs. There can be no doubt that a sound mind and upright natural disposition deny such corrupt beliefs. Besides, there is hard legal evidence that denies such corrupt beliefs. Regarding the practice of taking the above ­mentioned Ayahs as evidence to support their corrupt belief, it is a wicked practice, as they claim that Allah was incarnate in the earth beside Mount Sinai, taking as evidence the Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs on such an event. May Allah be Glorified and High from their grave falsehood!</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those claiming Allah is incarnate among His creation do not know that Ma`iyyah is of two types; general and private.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examples of the <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>private Ma`iyyah</strong></span> are the Ayahs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Truly, Allâh is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him), and those who are Muhsinûn (good­doers)&#8221;</strong></span>. See the footenote of V.9:120). ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allâh is with us&#8221;</span></strong>. and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I am with you both, hearing and seeing&#8221;</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are similar Ayahs on the private Ma`iyyah that Allah (Exalted be He) is with His prophets and pious believing servants through support, help, guidance and care. This is confirmed by Allah (Glorified be He) in a Qudsi Hadith related by His Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>My slave keeps on coming closer to Me through performing Nawafil (praying or doing extra deeds besides what is obligatory) until I love him, so I become his sense of hearing with which he hears; his sense of sight with which he sees; his hand with which he grips; and his leg with which he walks&#8221;</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, this does not mean that Allah becomes a servant&#8217;s extremities ­ may Allah be Glorified and High from such meaning! Conversely, it denotes that Allah becomes with a servant through support and guidance, as explained in another narration of the Qudsi Hadith mentioned above:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>With Me he hears, with Me he sees, with Me he grips, and with Me he walks</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the second narration Allah explains the meaning of His saying, &#8220;<strong>I become his sense of hearing, etc.<span style="color:#000000;">,</span></strong>&#8221; which implies Allah&#8217;s guidance to and support of His servants and protecting them from committing what displeases Him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <strong><span style="color:#993300;">general Ma`iyyah</span></strong>, it means perfect knowledge. Such a type of Ma`iyyah is mentioned in many Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs, such as:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is no Najwâ </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(secret counsel)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> of three but He is their fourth </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, nor of five but He is their sixth </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, nor of less than that or more but He is with them </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(with His Knowledge)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> wheresoever they may be&#8221;</span></strong>. ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He is with you (</strong>by His Knowledge)<strong> wheresoever you may be&#8221;</strong></span>. ;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Then surely, We shall narrate unto them (</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">their whole story) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">with knowledge, and indeed We have not been absent</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Neither you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> do any deed nor recite any portion of the Qur’ân, ­ nor you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(mankind)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> do any deed </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(good or evil)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> but We are Witness thereof, when you are doing i</span></strong>t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many similar Ayahs on such a type of Ma`iyyah. Allah (Glorified be He) is seated on His Throne in a manner that suits His Perfection and Majesty. Also, He is All ­Knowing of His creation and a Witness over them wherever they exist; on land or in the sea, by night or by day, at their homes or in the open desert. All are equal with regard to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge, as He surrounds them all in His Knowledge and they all are under His Sight and Hearing that He hears their speech, sees them wherever they are, and knows their secrets and private counsel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">No doubt! They did fold up their breasts, that they may hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Verily, He is the All ­Knower of the </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(innermost secrets) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">of the breasts.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah (Exalted be He) says:<strong><span style="color:#008000;"> It is the same </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(to Him)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> whether any of you conceal his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">that you may know that Allâh has power over all things, and that Allâh surrounds all things in </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(His)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Knowledge. There is no god or lord but Allah</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) begins the Ayahs on general Ma`iyyah with knowledge and finishes them with knowledge so that His servants may know that Allah is All ­Knowing of their affairs, not that He is incarnate among them in their dwellings, etc. Allah is Exalted above such falsehoods.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">The falsehood that the general Ma`iyyah means that Allah is incarnate among His creation is adopted by those believing in incarnation</span>. They claim that Allah exists everywhere in His Self­ Entity and that He is Exalted above being seated on His Throne and existing in the heavens over His creation. They never exalt Him above being existent in the dirtiest places ­may Allah disgrace them all!</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Great scholars from among the Salaf fought such falsehoods such as Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, `Abdullah Ibn Al­Mubarak, Ishaq Ibn Rahawayh, Abu Hanifah Al­Nu`man and others. Similarly, scholars from among the Imams of Guidance did the same such as Shaykh­ul ­Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, the great scholar Ibn Al­Qayyim, Al­ Hafiz Ibn Kathir and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since this point has been clear, the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you (by His Knowledge)</span></strong> and similar Ayahs do not denote that Allah is incarnate among His creation, neither explicitly nor implicitly. The preposition &#8220;with&#8221; in these Ayahs does not mean this at all, but it only denotes Ma`iyyah and association. Such Ma`iyyah has a different meaning in each situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As said by Abu `Umar Al­ Tallamanky (may Allah be merciful with him), Muslims from among Ahl­ul­Sunnah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) unanimously agree that the meaning of the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be</span></strong>. and similar Qur&#8217;anic Ayahs is that Allah is with His creation by His knowledge and that He, may He be Exalted, is established on His Throne above the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, great scholars and Imams from among the Salaf were of the opinion that Allah is established on His Throne above the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Nasr Al­Sijzy said our great Imams, such as Sufyan Al­Thawriy, Malik, Hammad Ibn Salamah, Hammad Ibn Zayd, Sufyan Ibn `Uyaynah, Al­Fudayl, Ibn Al­Mubarak, Ahmad, and Ishaq unanimously agree that Allah (Glorified be He) is established on His Throne by His Self­ Entity and everywhere by His Knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu `Umar Ibn `Abdul­Bar said: &#8220;Great scholars from among Sahabah (Prophet&#8217;s Companions) and Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) known for Ta&#8217;wil (allegorical interpretation) were of the opinion that the Ta&#8217;wil of the Ayah: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is no Najwâ (secret counsel) of three but He is their fourth</strong></span> (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven) is that Allah is seated on His Throne above the heavens in His Self­ Entity and that He exists everywhere by His Knowledge. It is worth mentioning that no notable scholar opposed their opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al­ Hafizh Ibn Kathir (may Allah be Merciful with him) said, &#8220;The Ayah: &#8216;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by His Knowledge) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">wheresoever you may be. And Allâh is the All ­Seer of what you do&#8217;</span></strong>. means that Allah is a witness of our deeds wherever and whenever we exist; on land or in the sea, by night or by day, in our homes or in the open desert, as we are all equal with regard to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge because He surrounds us all with His Knowledge. We are all under His Sight and Hearing that He hears our talk and sees us wherever we are, and knows our secrets and private counsels. Allay (Glorified be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">No doubt! They did fold up their breasts, that they may hide from Him. Surely, even when they cover themselves with their garments, He knows what they conceal and what they reveal. Verily, He is the All ­Knower of the (</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">innermost secrets) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">of the breasts</span></strong>. Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is the same (to Him) whether any of you conceal his speech or declares it openly, whether he be hid by night or goes forth freely by day. There is no God or lord but Him</span></strong>. Regarding the Tafsir (explanation) of the Ayah quoted from Surah Al­Mujadalah in which Allah says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is no Najwâ (secret counsel) of three he said that there are no three persons with a secret but He is their fourth (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven), nor of five but He is their sixth (with His Knowledge), nor of less than that or more but He is with them (with His Knowledge) wheresoever they may be&#8221;</span></strong>. that He is All­Knowing of their affairs, hearing their talk and knowing their secrets and private counsels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah&#8217;s messengers write down people&#8217;s private counsels though Allah is All­ Knowing of such private counsels and hears them. Allah (Glorified be He) says: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Know they not that Allâh knows their secret ideas, and their Najwa (secret counsels), and that Allâh is the All­ Knower of things unseen&#8221;</strong></span>. and: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private counsel? (Yes We do) and Our messengers (appointed angels in charge of mankind) are by them, to record&#8221;</span></strong>. As said, many scholars reported consensus over the meaning of this Ayah is that Allah exists among His creation by His Knowledge. There can be no doubt with regard to this point. In addition, His hearing as well as His Knowledge encompasses them. Moreover, they are under His Sight, as He (Exalted be He) is All­ Knowing of the affairs of His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There can be no doubt that the statements of the Salaf about such a point are too many to be counted. Therefore, the belief that Allah is incarnate among His creation, the claim that Allah exists among His creation in His Self­ Entity according to the Ayah: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(</span><span style="color:#008000;">by His Knowledge)</span> and that it is not permissible to point at Him are totally wrong and false as shown from the many direct proofs mentioned here and the consensus of Muslim scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, it becomes clear that those who say that Allah is incarnate among His creation and those who follow them are not right at all. Rather, they ascribe to Allah what does not suit His Majesty. In addition, they give the Ayahs on Ma`iyyah explanations that are different from those given by great scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah protect us from disgrace and from ascribing to Allah that which does not suit Him, out of ignorance! We ask Allah (Glorified be He) to make us adhere to the right path, as only He is Able to do all things! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>37- Merits of learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A questioner from Hadhramaut is asking about &#8216;Aqidah (creed): Your Eminence, is learning the Attributes of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Wajib (obligatory) or Mustahab (desirable)? Does learning these Attributes make any difference? What is the ruling on those who believe that it is not Wajib to learn the Attributes because this might entangle one into asking why and what? What are the books you recommend in this regard?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes from the Noble Qur&#8217;an and the purified Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) is <strong>one of the best acts of worship that brings us nearer to Allah</strong>. Learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes <strong>helps one to glorify, praise and call on Allah by His Names and Attributes</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allâh, so call on Him by them)&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that we should know Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes and use them while calling on Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah has ninety-nine Names; anyone who learns them will be admitted to Jannah (Paradise).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p>This Hadith indicates that Allah is Witr (&#8216;Odd&#8217;, i.e. He is one) and He loves odd numbers.  It also indicates that scholars and believers should learn the Names and Attributes of Allah to invoke and praise Him and act upon them so that they enter Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A believer should know that to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) belongs all Magnificent Names and that He has no peer, equal or rival. He is Perfect in His Essence, His Names, His Attributes and His Deeds and none is comparable to Him. Allah (Glorified be He) says: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</span></strong>.) None of Allah&#8217;s Attributes such as His Mercy, Highness, Istiwa&#8217; (Allah&#8217;s rising over the Throne in a manner that befits Him), Wrath , Laughter etc, is similar to ours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">As for the books we recommend in this regard,</span> </strong>the Noble Qur&#8217;an is the greatest Book. We advise you and all Muslims to adhere to it and recite it frequently because it is the Book of Allah which contains light and guidance. Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, this Qur&#8217;ân guides to that which is most just and right</strong>&#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing.&#8221;</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(This is) a Book (the Qur&#8217;an) which we have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember</strong></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they not then think deeply in the Qur&#8217;ân, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?)&#8221;</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We advise all Muslims to frequently recite, ponder over, and memorize the entire Qur&#8217;an or parts thereof. It is the Book of Allah and the source of light and guidance. It calls for adopting good morals, performing righteous deeds, following that which Allah has enjoined, and avoiding that which He has forbidden. It contains the stories of the prophets, messengers, and the righteous so that people may follow in their footsteps and the stories of the wrongdoers, so people may avoid their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also recommend those who are versed to read the books of Hadith such as the Two Sahihs (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) and the four Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) books (of Imams Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, Al-Nasa&#8217;y and Ibn Majah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, we recommend novices to read the abridged versions of these books which can be easily memorized, such as, Bulugh Al-Maram by Al-Hafidh ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani, Kitab Al-Tawhid, Thalathat Al-Usul, Al Qawa&#8217;id Al &#8216;Arba&#8217;, and Kashf Al-Shubuhat by Shaykh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah be merciful to him), Al-`Aqidah Al-Wasatiyyah by Shaykh Al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah, and Umdat Al-Hadith by Shaykh Al-Hafidh Abdul Ghani Al-Maqdisi. These are some important books which should be read and studied because they are useful.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">(Part No. 11; Page No. 58)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>27- Ruling on performing the Sunnah of Wudu&#8217; during a time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Depending on the indication of the Hadith reported by Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him): Whenever I perform Wudu&#8217; (ablution), I offer a two-Rak&#8217;ah (unit of Prayer) Salah after it) I sometimes perform Wudu&#8217; during a time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah, such as the times after the &#8216;Asr (Afternoon) Prayer, after the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer, or during sunset or sunrise. Will I be blamed if I perform the two Rak&#8217;ah Salah of Wudu then? May Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Wudu&#8217; is <em><strong>Mustahab</strong></em> (desirable) and offering Salah is Mustahab, so whenever a person performs Wudu&#8217;, it is recommended to pray the two-Rak&#8217;ah Salah of Wudu&#8217; at any time, even during the times when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah, because the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever performs Wudu like this Wudu&#8217; of mine and then prays a two-Rak&#8217;ah Salah without being distracted with worldly matters during them will have their previous sins forgiven.)&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that whenever he (peace be upon him) performed Wudu&#8217;, he would pray the two-Rak&#8217;ah Salah of Wudu&#8217; and would encourage people to pray them, may Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon him. This Salah is called the Sunnah (supererogatory) Salah of Wudu&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is nothing wrong with praying this Salah during the time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah, because it is a stressed Sunnah.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q: A questioner from Bahrain asks: Is it permissible for me to offer Salah (Prayer) at the time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah? For example, I may hasten to perform Wudu&#8217; (ablution) and start reciting the Qur&#8217;an and supplication, especially on Fridays after the &#8216;Asr (Afternoon) Prayer, knowing that I do not perform Wudu&#8217; for Salah, but I do it for supplication as mentioned. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If one performs Wudu&#8217; during the time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah, one may offer <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship) of Wudu&#8217; (ablution)</strong></span>, as there is no forbidden time for it. So, when performing Wudu&#8217; after Fajr (Dawn) Prayer or after Asr Prayer, it is prescribed to offer two Rak ahs (unit of Prayer) as Sunnah of Wudu&#8217;. This applies to both males and females.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, when entering the Masjid after &#8216;Asr or Fajr Prayer, it is prescribed to offer two Rak&#8217;ahs as <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Tahiyyat-ul-Masjid</strong></span> (two-unit-Prayer to greet the mosque) and there is no restriction regarding the time of these ceremonial Salahs; it may be offered during the time when it is impermissible to offer supererogatory Salah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same equally applies to the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Salat-ul-Kusuf</span> </strong>(Prayer on a solar eclipse) when a solar eclipse takes place after &#8216;Asr Prayer. Muslims should perform Salat-ul-Kusuf, because this Salah is one of the ceremonial Salahs that are offered for specific reasons and there is no restriction imposed regarding the time when these Salahs are offered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 11; Page No. 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is permissible to perform these ceremonial Salahs that are <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>offered for specific reasons</strong> </span>even during the time when it is impermissible to offer supererogatory Salah.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">29- Ruling on postponing the Sunnah of Wudu&#8217;</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q: A female questioner says: Should the Sunnah (supererogatory Prayer) of Wudu&#8217; (ablution) be offered immediately after Wudu&#8217; or is it permissible to postpone it due to some affairs while holding the intention of performing it after finishing my work? Which of these two practices is better; to perform it immediately or postpone it until I finish my work? May Allah reward you with the best! </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is better to hasten to perform the two-Rak&#8217;ah (unit of Prayer) Salah (Prayer) immediately after Wudu&#8217;, and if a person is occupied with work and thus prays it after that, this is acceptable. Both cases are good, but it is better to perform the Salah immediately.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Slaughtering animals upon building houses</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Q: In our residential area, people are accustomed to slaughtering an animal upon starting or finishing the construction of a house. Neighbors and relatives are invited on this occasion. What is Your Eminence&#8217;s opinion about this practice? Is there any recommendable act to be performed before going to live in a new house? Benefit us may Allah reward you well!</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 2; Page No. 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This practice needs to be clarified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If by slaughtering the animal the owners of the house seek to protect themselves from jinn or ensure that the house is safe to live in or any similar issue, this practice will be considered an act of <strong>Bid&#8217;ah</strong> (innovation in religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the slaughter is offered for the sake of the jinn, then it will be considered an act of <strong>major Shirk</strong> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) as it involves offering an act of Ibadah (worship) to someone other than Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if by doing this, one intends <strong>to show gratitude to Allah&#8217;s Blessings</strong> for reaching the roof or completion of construction works there is nothing wrong with this and with inviting the relatives and neighbors. This is the custom of many people who offer thanks to Allah due to Him helping them construct a house of their own instead of renting a house to live in. There is nothing wrong in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the <strong>intention</strong> behind this is to protect oneself from jinn or to fulfill any other non-Islamic purpose, then this practice is impermissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This practice will be valid only if the intention is to show gratitude to Allah for enabling one to construct a house of their own. This practice is similar to being hospitable to one&#8217;s relatives and neighbors.This is also similar to holding a <strong>marriage banquet</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A similar practice is performed when people <strong>return from travel</strong> when animals are sacrificed and relatives are entertained. It was the Prophet&#8217;s (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wasallam</em>) regular practice that upon returning from a journey he would slaughter a camel and invite people to dine with him.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>7- Ruling on offering supererogatory Salah (Prayer) fifteen minutes before Zhuhr (Noon) Prayer?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A sister from Riyadh asks: What is the ruling on offering supererogatory Salah (Prayer) fifteen or ten minutes before Zhuhr (Noon) Prayer? Please, clarify this matter, for a fellow Muslim sister told me that it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah at this time. May Allah reward you with the best.</span> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baaz (rahimahullah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for a Muslim to offer supererogatory Salah before Zhuhr when the sun is straight overhead, as this is included among the periods during which it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah. It is authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There are three hours at which the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) forbade us to pray or bury our dead: when the sun begins to rise until it is fully up, when the sun is at its height at midday until it has passed the meridian, and when the sun inclines to setting until it sets.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that shortly before noon no Salah should be offered. This is not a long period; rather, it is only the period when the sun reaches the meridian, the highest point reached by the sun when it is directly overhead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 11; Page No. 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During this time, it is impermissible to offer Salah until its passes the meridian, i.e. until the Adhan (call) to Zhuhr Prayer is announced. After this time, a person may offer Salah as much as they like. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Thus, it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah until the sun passes the meridian, a relatively short period; it is almost fifteen or twenty minutes before noon. However, it is better to be on the safe side and stop offering supererogatory Salah thirty minutes before noon</span></strong>.</span> After the sun passes the meridian, the time of impermissibility ends up to the &#8216;Asr (Afternoon) Prayer.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q 7: I have a relative who frequently swears by Allah whether he is truthful or not. What is the religious ruling on such an act?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (<em>rahimahullaah)</em>:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should be advised and told to abstain from swearing frequently, even if he is truthful, for Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much)</strong></span>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Three persons whom Allah shall neither speak to on the Day of Resurrection, nor look at, nor purify, and they shall have a painful torment: a white-haired adulterer, an arrogant poor person, and a man who made Allah as his merchandise: he does not buy except by swearing (by Allah) and he does not sell except by swearing.”</strong></span> &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Arabs used to be praised for taking oaths rarely. A poet said about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Whoever does not swear so much, can keep his oath</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>If he takes an oath he will fulfills it</strong></span></p>
<p>Aliyah in Arabic means oath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is prescribed for a Mu’min (believer) to swear rarely even if they are truthful</strong>. Swearing frequently may lead them to tell lies. It is well known that telling lies is Haram (prohibited); but it is much more prohibited when it is combined with swearing oaths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nevertheless, if there is a demanding situation or a probable benefit calling a Muslim to swear untruthfully, it will be permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been authentically reported from the Hadith of Umm Kulthum bint Uqbah ibn Abu Mu&#8217;it (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Not a liar the one who tries to reconcile between people and so narrates something good or says something good</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Kulthum bint‘ Uqbah (may Allah be pleased with her) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I have never heard him (the Prophet, peace be upon him) permit anything of what people call ‘lying’, except in three cases: war, reconciliation between people, and man’s talk to his wife and woman’s talk to her husband.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Related by Muslim in the Sahih [Authentic Hadith Book])</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a Muslim, in an attempt to reconcile between people, says, &#8220;I swear by Allah that your companions desire reconciliation with you, they like to be on good terms with you and want such and such&#8221;, then he goes to the other party and tells them the same words, intending good and hoping to achieve reconciliation, this is permissible according to the above-mentioned Hadith. The same is when a Muslim sees that a person wants to kill another one unjustly or wants to commit an unjust act against him. So, he says: &#8220;By Allah, he is my brother&#8221; in order to save him from such an oppressor who wants to kill him or beat him without any right, and he is sure that by saying: &#8220;this is my brother&#8221; the oppressor will leave the other person out of respect for him. In such a case, a Muslim should do this for the sake of saving his brother from oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basic ruling concerning false oaths is that they are forbidden and prohibited, unless they are meant for a serious benefit graver than lying, such as the three examples mentioned in the previous Hadith.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1- Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Is it true that some Muslims will enter Jannah (Paradise) without being called to account?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Yes, it is true, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(<strong>&#8220;All the nations were shown to me, and I saw a prophet accompanied by a small group of his followers, another with two or three people of his followers and a third not accompanied by any follower.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the end of the Hadith, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Among my Ummah there are seventy thousand who would enter Jannah without being brought to account or being punished.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) asked who these people were, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah (recitation for healing or protection); they are those who do not get themselves cauterized; and they are those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith implies that the Mu&#8217;min (believer), who continues obeying Allah&#8217;s commands and avoiding His prohibitions until death, will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds and without suffering punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Falling under this category are the Mu&#8217;mins who do not ask others to recite Ruqyah over them. There is nothing wrong, however, if they themselves are accustomed to reciting Ruqyahs over other Muslims. This is because one who recites Ruqyah basically does a good deed by asking Allah (Exalted be He) to cure the illness of the person for whom they recite the Ruqyah. This is based on the authentic Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Whosoever among you is able to benefit his fellow believer, let him do so.)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Istirqa</strong></span>&#8216; means to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. For example, you may ask a person to recite Rygyah for you. It is better not to ask others for Ruqyah unless one happens to be suffering from an ailment, In this case, it is not wrong to ask others to recite Ruqyah. It has been reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) asked Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) saying: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Seek healing through asking for Ruqyah</span></strong>) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered her to treat herself by means of asking others for Ruqyah, He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to recite Ruqyah to the children of Jafar when they were under the influence of the evil eye. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is no Ruqyah (reciting Qur&#8217;an and supplicating over the sick seeking healing) better than that which is said as a treatment for an evil eye or (a sting of) a venomous animal</strong></span>.&#8221; It is not wrong to seek treatment by means of Istirqa’ when necessary. However, it is better not to resort to such means if it is possible to cure oneself by means of some other kind of medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also better not to treat oneself by means of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>cauterization</strong> </span>if another means of treatment is available. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The best of all remedies are three; cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I hate to be cauterized.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version it states: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">..and I forbid my Ummah (nation) from cauterization.</span></strong>) This denotes that cauterization should be used as a last resort when all other means prove unsuccessful. It is better to seek treatment by other means if possible. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah. However, cauterization may only be resorted to when necessary. It is, however, better to apply another means of treatment like drinking honey, cupping, or reciting the Qur&#8217;an, The Prophet&#8217;s (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) statement: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are those who do not seek Ruqyah; they are those who do not get themselves cauterized&#8230;</strong></span>) does not denote that seeking Ruqyah or cauterization are prohibited; rather, it denotes that one may resort to other means of treatment in preference to these kinds. However, if one is forced by necessity to seek Ruqyah or cauterization, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“T<strong><span style="color:#008000;">hey are these who do not believe in bad omens</span></strong>&#8220;: Believing in the occurrence of evil omens, a custom practiced by the pre-Islamic Arabs, constitutes an act of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the characteristics of the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account is that they avoid the prohibited practice of believing in bad omens and the reprehensible practice of seeking Ruqyah and cauterization when there is no need for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>,&#8221; means that such Muslims avoid these things because they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He) and seek to attain His Pleasure. The statement implies that they steadfastly obedient to Allah (Exalted be He) and they avoid not only what He has declared as prohibited but also some of what He has declared as permissible if there is something better than it. By doing so, they hope for Allah&#8217;s Reward and fear His Punishment. They draw near to Him through doing deeds that He loves and do so with their hearts filled with trust and confidence in Him (Glorified and Exalted be He),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another similar Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand&#8230;)</span></strong> According to another Hadith: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allah promised to increase the number by as many as three Handfuls added by my Lord, Glorified be He.</span></strong>) This increase in number is known to none but Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize, every upright Mu&#8217;min who avoids Allah&#8217;s Prohibitions and does not allow themselves to go beyond the limits set by Allah (Exalted be He) will be counted among the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without Allah calling them to account or consigning them to punishment.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment. When the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) inquired about their characteristics, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told them that they are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omen. We ask Your Eminence to clarify these characteristics so that we may develop them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that <strong><span style="color:#008000;">seventy thousand people of his Ummah (nation) will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment.</span></strong> In another Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand.,.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was asked about their characteristics, he said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah from others, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith refers to pious and faithful Muslims who adhere steadfastly to Allah&#8217;s Din (religion), those who worship Allah Alone, those who fulfill their religious duties, those who avoid His Prohibitions and strive hard to do good to the point that they decline to do what is permissible, yet undesirable, like seeking Ruqyah and cauterization. This perfects their Iman (faith). They do not ask others to make Ruqyah for them nor do they get themselves cauterized. It is better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization unless under necessity. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah when they were under the influence of the evil eye. This indicates that seeking Ruqyah is permissible only when necessary. However, it is better not to treat oneself by means of Istirqa&#8217; or cauterization if another means of treatment is available, Some of the Sahabah were treated by means of cauterization. Khabbab ibn Al-Arat and other Sahabah were also treated by means of cauterization, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have used cauterization as a means of treating the sickness of some of his Sahabah. Having oneself cauterized does not necessarily mean that one will not be counted among the seventy thousand people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds. However, one of their good characteristics includes their uprightness, truly obeying Allah (Exalted be He) and avoiding disobedience to Him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the meaning of the following Hadith: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) once asked his Sahabah: &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; They asked him about those people who will enter Jannah without being called to account. Whereupon the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This has been reported in the Hadith about the seventy thousand Muslims who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told his Sahabah that his Ummah were displayed before him. Among them were seventy thousand people who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment, Some people said; &#8220;The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) may be referring to those who were born Muslims.&#8221; Others said: &#8220;He may be referring to those who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) during the early days of Islam and did not associate any partners with Allah.&#8221; When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) entered upon them, he asked them about the topic they were discussing, When they told him that they were inquiring about the Muslims who will enter Jannah without being judged, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said; (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to the characteristics mentioned in the above Hadith, they also fear Allah, believe in Him and hold steadfastly to His Din (religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not get themselves cauterized</span></strong>&#8221; means that they do not resort to cauterization when they are ill. Another great characteristic is that they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He), However, it is permissible to treat sickness by means of cauterization or seeking Ruqyah as the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have permitted them both. He permitted “Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also permitted the mother of Ja ‘far&#8217;s children to treat them by means of seeking Ruqyah. However, if another means of treatment is available, then it will be better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I do not like to be cauterized</span></strong>. )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Believing in bad omens is prohibited because it leads to pessimism. There is a narration from Imam Muslim that states: &#8220;They do not recite Ruqyah to others,&#8221; but its status has been classified as weak. Some narrators have mistaken seeking Ruqyah for Ruqyah. There is nothing wrong if the Muslim recites Ruqyah for his fellow Muslim, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing wrong with Ruqyahs as long as they do not contain formulas that bear the meaning of Shirk</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have recited Ruqyah to his Sahabah, “Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) is also reported to have recited Ruqyah over the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) when he fell sick. The Sahabah are also on reported to have recited Ruqyah to each other. There is nothing wrong with reciting Ruqyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is better not to seek Ruqyah unless there is a necessity. This is based on the fact that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered Aishah saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over you.</strong></span>&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) also said to the mother of the children of Ja ‘far &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over them (her children).</span></strong>&#8221; There is nothing wrong to ask someone saying: “<strong>O so and so, recite the Qur&#8217;an over me so that Allah may cure my sickness. May Allah reward you greatly</strong>.&#8221; There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is need for that.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Who are the people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds? Are they those who do not recite Ruqyah for themselves nor for others? Kindly explain this to us. May Allah reward you with the best.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Those who follow Allah&#8217;s Din, fulfill His religious duties, and avoid His Prohibitions are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account or suffering punishment. Among them are the seventy thousand who do not seek Ruqyah, have themselves cauterized or believe in bad omens, but put their trust in Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also do not believe in bad omens because believing in them is prohibited. Moreover, they prefer to avoid cauterization as a form of treatment, This is because the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said that these are among the characteristics of the seventy thousand (who will enter Paradise without being called to account). It would be better to use another form of treatment instead of cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey, yet I do not like to be cauterized, ) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah, Therefore, it is better not to treat oneself by means of cauterization, especially when another means of treatment is available. If no other means is available, then there is nothing wrong to resort to this. That does not necessarily mean that they will not be accounted among the seventy thousand. This is because the seventy thousand are those who adhere to the Din of Allah, avoid His Prohibitions, and fulfill the duties He prescribed. Among their good characteristics is that they do not seek Ruqyah. However, seeking Ruqyah does not necessarily mean that they will not be included among the seventy thousand. Seeking Ruqyah is to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. There is nothing wrong to ask for Ruqyah if there is need for that. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah, He also ordered the mother of the children of Ja far to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah, so there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is a need for that. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three things: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey.) This Hadith denotes that though it is permissible to seek treatment by means of cauterization, it is preferable not to resort to it, especially when some other sort of medicine is available.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 4; Page No. 17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4- Observing causes does not contradict Tawakkul</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The questioner asks: “I recite many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) that talk about Tawakkul (putting one’s trust in Allah). How can we observe Tawakkul in our life? I hope you will give me examples of that.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Tawakkul is one of the duties of the believers. Allah (Glorified be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and put your trust in Allah if you are believers indeed</strong></span>.) , (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him</span></strong>.) and, (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and in Allah (Alone) let those who trust, put their trust.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawakkul is one of the acts of worships and obligations upon Muslims. It means entrusting all affairs with Allah (may he be Exalted) and depending upon Him in everything. It also means putting one&#8217;s trust in Allah along with observing the causes. One should believe that Allah is the Causer of causes and the Disposer of all affairs and that everything rests in Allah&#8217;s Hands (Glorified and Exalted be He). One should also believe that no one can hinder what Allah gives and no one can give what Allah hinders and that Allah is the benefit Giver and the harm Inflicting, and the Supreme Giver and the Preventer. But, at the same time, one should follow legal causes that can bring him benefit by eating when he is hungry, drinking when he is thirst, marrying, earning lawful provision through selling and buying and other things. One should not neglect observing causes and put his trust in Allah along with believing that nothing happens to him except what is predestined by Allah (Exalted be He) and that he will not succeed without Allah&#8217;s support and help. Therefore, one should observe causes and put his trust in Allah and rely upon Him alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 4; Page No. 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should treat the patient while putting his trust in Allah as He is the One Who brings cure. You should follow the causes by seeing a physician, carrying out his instructions, having medicine, Cauterization, dietary or the like. You should sell and buy while putting trust in Allah and believing that nothing will occur except what Allah predestines for you. You can rent your estates in order to receive their due revenues, irrigate your farm, give your animals to drink and eat in order to gain their benefits while depending upon Allah in all these things. This means that one should observe the causes in everything while putting his trust in Allah and believing that He is the Causer of causes, Disposer of all affairs, benefit Giver, harm Inflicting, the Supreme Giver and the Preventer. One should only observe the causes that are ordained for him. You travel for performing Hajj (Pilgrimage), Umrah (Lesser Pilgrimage) or for trading while observing causes and believing that Allah is the Causer of causes and He is the Only One Who can make you reach your destination, support you in performing rites of Hajj and help you to achieve your goals in trade, return from your journey, and so on.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1- Definition of Islam</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Please, illustrate to me the meaning of Islam.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>Islam</strong> means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>total submission to Allah (Exalted be He) through belief in His Oneness, and showing subservient and servile obedience to Him</strong></span>. This is the meaning of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic root word ‘<strong>Aslama</strong>&#8216; means to show submission and surrender to someone and obey his commands. Accordingly, Islam means surrender and submission to Allah&#8217;s Will by means of believing in His Oneness, being devoted to Him, obeying His commandments and abandoning what He has prohibited. Such is Islam, about which Allah (Exalted be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam</strong></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides, a Muslims are thus called as they show complete submission to Allah and obey Him, abiding by His Commandments and refraining from what He has prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is also a name for <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>all the Commandments of Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him)</strong></span>, including Salah (Prayer), Sawm (fast), Zakah (obligatory charity), Hajj (pilgrimage), faith and so on. Such categories fall under Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this regard, Allah (Exalted be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion</b></span></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers</strong></span>, )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, a Muslim is a person who submits himself to Allah (Exalted be He) as far as words, practical behavior and belief are concerned. In other words, Islam stands for total submission to and abidance by His Commandments in all aspects of life.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">167. The difference between the Fard and Nafilah Prayers</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Are there differences between the Fard and Nafilah Prayers ?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Yes, there are differences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Nafilah</em> is a desirable supererogatory act, while the <em>Fard</em> is obligatory, based on a definitive text. If one does not offer the <em>Nafilah</em> Prayer, such as <em>Salat-ul-Duha</em> (supererogatory Prayer before noon), <em>Al-Witr</em> (Prayer with an odd number of units), or the <em>Sunnah Ratibah</em> (supererogatory Prayer performed on a regular basis) related to the the <em>Zhuhr</em> (Noon), <em>Fajr</em> (Dawn), <em>Maghrib</em> (Sunset), and ‘<em>Isha</em>’ (Night) Prayers, one is not regarded as sinful for this. On the other hand, if one gives up the the Fard Prayers, one is sinful and may even be considered a disbeliever if one does so intentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Nafilah Prayer may be offered while sitting, even if the person performing it is healthy, while the Fard Prayer cannot be performed while sitting unless the person offering it has a reason for this; such as being sick or disabled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) would sometimes offer the optional late night Prayer while sitting, and he (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said: (<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever prays while standing will get greater reward;one who prays while sitting will get half of the reward of the person praying while standing; and one who prays laying will get half of the reward of the person who prays sitting</strong></span>.) Peace and blessings be upon the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is permissible in general to pray the Nafilah during the night or day while sitting. However, this is not the case with the Fard Prayer. The latter must be offered while standing, as the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said to “Imran: (<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Offer Prayer while standing).</span></strong> He said to ‘Imran ibn Al-Husain (may Allah be pleased with him): (<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Pray while standing and if you cannot, pray while sitting, and if you cannot do even that, then pray lying on your side.) (If you cannot do even that, you can pray lying on your back</span></strong>.) This Hadith is about the Fard; as for the Nafilah, there is no problem if one performs it while sitting; if he or she finds himself or herself too tired to stand while praying the same, they may sit.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Maniy</strong> (sperm/vaginal secretions that are released on <strong>orgasm)</strong><br />
<strong>Wady</strong> (a thick white secretion discharged after urination)<br />
<strong>Madhy</strong> (thin white viscid fluid secreted due to erotic thoughts or desire)</p>
<p>The fifth question of Fatwa no. 8540</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q:</strong></span> <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What are the Wady and Madhy discharges? How can a person purify himself from them? Do they occur during sleep? </strong></span></p>
<p>A: All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, and his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Wady</em> is mostly discharged after urination. It is a white thick fluid that resembles the <em>Maniy</em> (spermatic fluid) in thickness, but differs from it in turbidity, and it is odorless.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Madhy</em> is a white, tenuous, viscous fluid that is discharged when engaging in foreplay, thinking of or desiring intercourse, or because of a look and the like, at the abatement of desire. A person may not feel the discharge come out, but it is discharged at the onset of sexual desire. It is experienced by both men and women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both fluids (<em>Madhy</em> and <em>Wady</em>) are <em>Najis</em> (impure) and invalidate <em>Wudu</em>’ (ablution). Therefore, when such secretions are discharged, the soiled parts (of body and clothes) must be purified with water and the person must perform <em>Wudu</em>’. Discharge of <em>Madhy</em> also necessitates washing the whole penis and testicles with water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<hr />
<p>The second question of Fatwa no. 4262</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q:</strong></span> <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is the difference between <em>Maniy</em> and <em>Madhy</em>? Which of them necessitates taking <em>Ghusl</em> (ritual bath)?  </strong></span></p>
<p>A: All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, and his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, the difference between <em>Maniy</em> (sperm/vaginal secretions) and <em>Madhy</em> (thin white viscid fluid secreted when having sexual thoughts or desire) is that <em>Maniy</em> in the case of men is a thick white fluid, and in the case of women it is thin and yellow. <em>Madhy</em>, on the other hand, is a thin, white, sticky fluid that is emitted when engaging in foreplay, thinking of or desiring intercourse, or because of a look and the like. <em>Madhy</em> is emitted by men and women alike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, <em>Maniy</em> necessitates <em>Ghusl</em>, while <em>Madhy</em> necessitates washing the penis and testicles, performing <em>Wudu</em>’ (ablution) like that performed for <em>Salah</em> (prayer), in addition to washing it off from the body and clothes.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 18084</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: Toothpaste contains some sugar ingredients which a person tastes while using it, keeping in mind that the normal taste of food takes place by the dissolution of the food within the saliva, and then its penetration to the taste receptors. Accordingly, if the tasted matter dissolves within the saliva then, most probably, no one can avoid swallowing it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A- Is it permissible for a fasting person to use toothpaste, keeping in mind that they can use the toothbrush only?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">B- What is the ruling on using mouthwash?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">C- It was reported through a good chain of transmission from Ibn ‘Abbas (Al-Irwaa&#8217;, p. 937) that he (may Allah be pleased with him) did not see any harm in tasting honey, butter, and similar foods and then spitting it out while one is observing Sawm (Fast). This view was also reported from some Salaf (righteous predecessors). Thus, after knowing the way in which food is tasted, what is the ruling on tasting food by a fasting person</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>no harm in using toothpaste during Sawm; however, one should spit out</strong> </span>what has been dissolved of the toothpaste in the mouth; and if something from it goes unintentionally into the throat, it will not affect Sawm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By the same token, there is no harm in using <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>mouthwash</strong> </span>which contains medication provided that one spits it out, and nothing from it goes intentionally into the throat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same ruling applies to <strong><span style="color:#000000;">tasting food</span></strong>; there is no harm in doing it as long as one spits it out without swallowing anything of it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">But it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not permissible to have nutritive injections</strong></span>, as they come under the same ruling as having food and drinks.Thus, taking them is considered a trick to break Sawm in Ramadan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 21436</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Praise be to Allah Alone and peace and blessings be upon the Last Prophet. To continue,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; had read the letter received by his Eminence, the Grand Mufty (Islamic scholar qualified to issue legal opinions) from a number of inquirers whose names are registered at the Secretariat General of the Council of Senior Scholars nos.(5411) ,(1026), (1016),(1395), (1650), (1893), (2106) dated 7/11/1420, 7/2/1421, 7/2/1421, 3/8/1421, 17/3/1421, 25/3/1421, 7/4/1421 A.H., successively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The inquirers asked many questions to the following effect: Lately, the idea of <em><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/al-murjiah/"><strong>Irja</strong></a></em>&#8216; (a deviant conviction claiming that Faith is restricted to belief not deeds) has dreadfully spread. Many writers have been propagating it, depending on some incomplete quotations from the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s writings, something which leads many people to confusion with respect to the definition of <em>Iman</em> (faith). They try to exclude the element of deeds from the definition of <em>Iman</em>. They claim that anyone who abandons all deeds will still be saved (from Hellfire). This definitely facilitates the committing of sins, acts of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and <em>Riddah</em> (apostasy) for people attain <em>Iman</em> in light of this conviction, even if they do not abide by religious obligations, avoid prohibitions, or act in accordance with Shari`ah (Islamic law). There is no doubt that this conviction has a severe effect on Islamic societies, issues of `<em>Aqidah</em> (creed) and worship. Therefore, I hope Your Eminence will reveal the reality of this conviction and its bad effects, and the truth that is based on the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). I hope you will also verify the writings reported from Shaykh-ul-Islam so that all Muslims can be sure about and have knowledge of their religion.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: After the Committee studied the inquiry, it answered as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mentioned sayings are attributed to <strong><em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em></strong> (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that Faith is restricted to belief not deeds) who exclude deeds from the definition of <em>Iman</em>. They claim that <em>Iman</em> is achieved by belief with the heart and utterance with the tongue, whereas the deeds, according to their view, are a condition for attaining perfection but are not considered a prerequisite for it. Thus, according to their conviction, anyone who believes with their heart and utters with their tongue will be a perfect <em>Mu&#8217;min</em> (believer), even if they abandon obligations and violate prohibitions, they will also be entitled to enter <em>Jannah</em> (Paradise) without observing any good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This has led to many null ideas, including the restriction of <em>Kufr</em> (disbelief) to denial of faith and <em>Al-Istihlal</em> (deeming what is <em>Haram</em> (prohibited) to be lawful) by heart. In fact, all these sayings are false, deviant and contradict the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah and the way of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah</em> (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream); the predecessors and successors.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>However this opens the door to the people of evil and mischief to deviate away from their religion and be free from Allah&#8217;s (Glorified be He) commands, prohibitions, fear and reverence.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This also deactivates the concept of Jihad (struggling in the cause of Allah), enjoining good and forbidding evil.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Furthermore, this also equates between good and bad, obedient and disobedient people, a person who abides by Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah and the <em>Fasiq</em> (someone flagrantly violating Islamic law) who abandons His Commands and Prohibitions since deeds do not violate <em>Iman</em> as they claim.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Imams of Islam concentrated on clarifying the falseness of this conviction and replying to its supporters in the past and the present. They also allocated a chapter for this issue in the books of `<em>Aqidah</em> and compiled complete books in this regard, such as the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) mentioned in <em>Al-`Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Among the fundamentals of <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah w-Al-Jama`ah</em> is that Din (religion of Islam) and <em>Iman</em> are attained by words and actions and that <em>Iman</em> increases by acts of obedience and decreases by acts of disobedience.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also mentioned in his book Al-Iman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;In this chapter, we find several sayings of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) and the Senior Scholars of Sunnah in explaining <em>Iman</em>. Sometimes they say: It is utterance and action and some others say: utterance, action and intention. Others say: <em>Iman</em> is utterance with the tongue, belief with the heart, and acts with organs. All these definitions are true.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, he (may Allah be merciful to him) added:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The Salaf strictly censured <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> for excluding actions from <em>Iman</em>. However, their claim that all people have the same degree of <em>Iman</em> is absolutely fraudulent. Belief, love, fear of Allah, knowledge, etc., of people vary from one person to another.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Regarding this basic origin, <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> deviated from what was clarified in the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah, opinions of the <em>Sahabah</em> (Companions of the Prophet) and the <em>Tabi`un</em> (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet), rather they founded their opinion on their own understanding and linguistic interpretation [of texts]; this is certainly the manner of people of <em>Bid`ahs</em> (innovations in religion).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the proofs that indicate that deeds are included in Iman and that they affect it positively or negatively is Allah&#8217;s saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The believers are only those who, when Allâh is mentioned, feel a fear in their hearts and when His Verses (this Qur’ân) are recited unto them, they (i.e. the Verses) increase their Faith; and they put their trust in their Lord (Alone); Who perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât) and spend out of that We have provided them. It is they who are the believers in truth</span>. (Qur&#8217;an &#8211; Surah Al-Anfaal  Verses: 2-4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Successful indeed are the believers. Those who offer their <em>Salât</em> (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness. And those who turn away from <em>Al-Laghw</em> (dirty, false, evil vain talk, falsehood, and all that Allâh has forbidden). And those who pay the <em>Zakât</em>. And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, &#8211; for then, they are free from blame; But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors; Those who are faithfully true to their <em>Amanât</em> (all the duties which Allâh has ordained, honesty, moral responsibility and trusts) and to their covenants; And those who strictly guard their (five compulsory congregational) <em>Salawât</em> (prayers) (at their fixed stated hours). </span>(Qur&#8217;an &#8211; Surah Al-Muminoon  Verses: 1-9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, the Messenger (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>Iman</em> (Faith) has over seventy branches, the most superior of which is the declaration that there is no deity except Allah, and the lowest of which is the removal of (anything) harmful from the street, and modesty is a branch of Iman.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islam (may Allah be merciful to him) also mentioned inhis book Al-Iman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;The origin of Iman is in the heart, including utterance and action. It is recognition of belief, love and submissiveness. Whatever rests in the heart should be manifest in action. If a person does not act in accordance to it, this indicates absence or weakness of Iman. This is why the visible deeds are a reflection of the <em>Iman</em> of heart and a confirmation to what exists in it. They constitute evidence of it and they are a branch and part of full <em>Iman</em>.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Thinking of what<em> Al-Khawarij</em> and <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> say with respect to the meaning of <em>Iman</em> reveals that this includes disobedience of the Messenger. Obeying Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) denotes the perfection of <em>Iman</em>, and that Allah (Exalted be He) would never render a sinner to be a <em>Kafir</em>. <strong>Suppose</strong> that some people went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and told him: &#8216;We believe in what you have brought us by our hearts and bear witness (that there is no deity except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah) with our tongues, but we do not abide by your commands and prohibitions; as we do not offer prayers, fast, perform Hajj or believe what is told to us; we do not return trusts, fulfill our promises, maintain the ties of kinship or observe any good acts which you ordained us; we drink intoxicants and commit incest and adultery; we kill as many people as we can of your Companions and Ummah (nation) and take their money; we may even kill you too and fight with your enemies against you.&#8217; Can any rational person imagine that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would answer them by saying: &#8216;You are the perfect <em>Mu&#8217;minun</em> (believers) and you are the ones entitled to my intercession on the Day of Resurrection, and it is expected that none of you would enter Hellfire?&#8217; On the contrary, every Muslim indisputably knows that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have told them: &#8216;You are the most disbelieving people ever to what I came with&#8217; and that he would have executed them if they had not repented.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;When the word of <em>Iman</em> is generally mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah, it is meant with dutifulness, piety, and religion as previously mentioned, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) declared that <em>Iman</em> has over than seventy branches, the best of which is to witness that there is no Deity but Allah, and the least is to remove harm from the road. Therefore, whatever pleases Allah falls under the meaning of <em>Iman</em>. All this is also included in the meaning of dutifulness when generally mentioned, and so are the <em>Taqwa</em> (fear/wariness of offending Allah) and the <em>Din</em> (religion of Islam). It was also narrated that when people asked about Iman, Allah revealed the following Ayah: <span style="color:#008000;">It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to Allâh, etc.) that you turn your faces</span> .What is meant here is that <em>Iman</em>, which is accompanied by action, is praised, other than that which is devoid of it.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said about Iman; anyone who reports other than this on his authority will be inventing lies against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Whereas what was mentioned in the Hadith concerning the entrance of some people into <em>Jannah</em> despite that they had never done any good is not absolute to anyone who abandons deeds while being capable of doing them. Rather it is restricted to those who have excuses for abandoning deeds or for any other reason that is consistent with the objectives of Shari`ah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After clarifying this issue, the Permanent Committee warns against arguing over the fundamentals of `<em>Aqidah</em>, because of the serious consequences resulting from this. It recommends resorting to the books of the Righteous Salaf and leading Muslim scholars which are based on the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah and accounts of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also warns against referring to any books that carry views opposing the original references, or modern books that are issued by authors who have not acquired knowledge through scholars or from original sources. Those people are intruders to this one great fundamental of `<em>Aqidah</em>. They adopt the views of <em>Al-Murji&#8217;ah</em> and falsely attribute them to <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah W-al-Jama`ah</em>, causing confusion to people. They also wrongly ascribe these views to the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) and other Imams of the Salaf through incomplete quotations. We advise them to fear Allah and to return to the Right Path, and not break the unity (of Muslims) by promoting this deviant belief. The Committee also warns Muslims against being tempted and falling into the trap of those opposing <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah W-al-Jama`ah</em>. May Allah guide everyone to useful knowledge, righteous deeds and good understanding of the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Leaving the Masjid after the Adhan is announced</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second question of Fatwa no. 5133</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on leaving the Masjid (mosque) after the Adhan (call to Prayer)? Moreover, does the same ruling apply to a person who may be in a room, not used for Salah, within the precincts of the Masjid but when leaving, he passes through the courtyard of the Masjid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible to leave the Masjid after hearing the Adhan except to perform Wudu&#8217;, answering the call of nature, or any other necessity. It is reported that Abu Hurayrah  saw a person leaving the Masjid after the Adhan. Upon this he remarked,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;This (man) disobeyed Abu Al-Qasim (peace be upon him).&#8221;</strong> </span>Related by Muslim in his Sahih. The same ruling applies for a person who is in a room inside the precincts of the Masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">[Q] What is the ruling regarding leaving the Masjid after the Adhan has been called?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[A] Abu Hurayrah saw a man leave (the Masjid) after the Adhan (had been called) and said (about him):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">As for this (one), then he has gone against (the teachings of) Abul-Qasim (Muhammad, peace be upon him</span>)</strong></span>.(Sahih Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And to go against (the teachings) principally is prohibited. Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in a plain error.</strong></span> (Quran, 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, because of this, the people having Islamic knowledge have said: <span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Indeed it is not permissible for a person to leave the Masjid after the Adhan (has been called) except for an (Islamically justifiable) reason, such as leaving to make Wudhu or if he wanted to go to answer the call of nature, then he is permitted to leave, even if he misses the prayer</strong></span> as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">There is no prayer if food has been served or for him who needs to answer the call of nature</span></strong>. (Sahih Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if we say that someone is waiting for the prayer and then felt the need to go and answer the call of nature or even to pass wind, since some people (may be in) need of passing wind, then there is no harm if he left and relieved himself (and) then returned. And if he was able to (catch and) join the congregation, then it is a blessing, and if he was unable to do so, then there is no harm in this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth question of Fatwa no. 16874</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q4: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is raising the hands upward when supplicating to Allah after the end of Adhan (call to Prayer) an act of Bid`ah (innovation in religion)?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: After repeating Adhan and invoking Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings upon Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), it is recommended to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>O Allah! Lord of this perfect call and of the regular prayer which is going to be established, bestow upon Muhammad Al-Wasilah (the highest position in Paradise) and Al-Fadilah (extra degree of honor) and raise him to Al Maqam Al Mahmud (the best and the highest place in Paradise), which You have promised him</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement is authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) on the authority of Jabir ibn `Abdullah Al-Ansary (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) in Sahih Al-Bukhari (may Allah be merciful to him). <strong>However, raising the hands has no mention in the report, so it is an act of Bid`ah.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following has been taken from Imam Ibn Baz&#8217;s Fatwas of Nur `Ala Al-Darb</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>171- What is the ruling on raising one&#8217;s hands in Du`a&#8217; after Iqamah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I have noticed that some Muslims, who are about to perform Salah (Prayer), raise their hands and supplicate immediately after the Mu&#8217;adhin (caller to Prayer) finishes the announcement of the Adhan (call to Prayer). This takes place before Takbirat-ul-Ihram (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221; upon starting Prayer. Is this practice reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This action has no basis in Shari`ah (Islamic law). Nothing has been reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to supplicate between Iqamah (call to start the Prayer) and the start of Prayer. <strong>He was never reported as having raised his hands at this time</strong>. This should not be done because it is contrary to the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the proper manner of announcing Adhan (call to Prayer)?<br />
What is your opinion concerning the additions people use after the Adhan?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The proper manner of announcing the Adhan is the way taught by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to his followers. Bilal (رضي الله عنه) used to announce the Adhan in the presence of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) till the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) died. He used to announce the Adhan during the Makkan period and at Al-Madinah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Adhan that we announce today which consists of fifteen phrases:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>ٱللهُ أَكْبَر ٱللهُ أَكْبَر<br />
Allah-u-Akbar, Allah-u-Akbar,<br />
Allah-u-Akbar, Allah-u-Akbar</strong><br />
(Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest.<br />
Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله, أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله<br />
Ashhadu An La Ilaha Illa Allah,<br />
Ashhadu An La Ilaha Illa Allah</strong><br />
(I bear witness that there is no god but Allah.<br />
I bear witness that there is no god but Allah);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ ٱلله, أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا رَسُولُ ٱلله<br />
Ashhadu Anna Muhammad-an Rasul-ul-llah,<br />
Ashhadu Anna Muhammad-an Rasul-ul-llah</strong><br />
(I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.<br />
I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلصَّلَوَة, حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلصَّلَوَة<br />
Hayy `Ala as-Salah, Hayy `Ala as-Salah</strong><br />
(Come to Prayer. Come to Prayer);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلْفَلَاح, حَيَّ عَلَى ٱلْفَلَاح<br />
Hayy `Ala al-Falah, Hayy `Ala al-Falah</strong><br />
(Come to success. Come to success);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>ٱللهُ أَكْبَر, ٱللهُ أَكْبَر<br />
Allah-u-Akbar, Allah-u-Akbar</strong><br />
(Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest);</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> لَا إِلٰهَ إِلَّا ٱلله<br />
La ilaha illa Allah</strong><br />
(There is none worthy of worship but Allah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Adhan that Bilal used to announce in the presence of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) till he died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in Fajr (Dawn) Prayer, he added:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">ٱلصَّلَوةُ خَيْرٌ مِن النَّوم<br />
<strong>As-Salatu Khayr-un Mina an-Nawm</strong><br />
(Salah is better than sleeping),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">twice after his saying: Hayy `Ala al-Falah (Come to success), and before saying: Allah-u-Akbar (Allah is the Greatest).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what some people used to add as:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">حَيَّ عَلَى خَيْرٌ الْعَمَل<br />
Hayy `Ala Khayr al-`Amal<br />
(Come to best of deed),</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">or</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">أَشْهَدُ أَنَّ عَلِيًّا وَلِي ٱلله<br />
Ashhadu Anna `Aly-an Waliy-ul-llah<br />
(I bear witness that `Aly is the Waliy of Allah),</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">is an <span style="color:#ff0000;">evil deed and Bid`ah (innovation in religion) introduced by Shi`ah (Shi&#8217;ites)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible, neither, to offer peace and blessings upon the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) audibly directly after the Adhan. This is a Bid`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is commendable for a Muslim, after announcing the Adhan, to ask Allah to bestow peace and blessings upon the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). Then say:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ هَذِهِ الدَّعْوَةِ التَّامَّةِ، وَالصَّلَاةِ الْقَائِمَةِ، آتِ مُحَمَّداً الْوَسِيلَةَ وَالْفَضِيلَةَ، وَابْعَثْهُ مَقَاماً مَحْمُوداً الَّذِي وَعَدْتَهُ</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;O Allah! Lord of this perfect call (perfect by not ascribing partners to You) and of the prayer which is going to be established, give Muhammad the right of intercession and illustriousness, and raise him to the best and the highest place in Paradise which You promised. Surely, You do not renege Your promise.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doing so is commendable for every Muslim whether male or female after the Adhan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is commendable also for the Mu&#8217;adhin (caller to Prayer), as any other person, to offer peace and blessings upon the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) after announcing Adhan. He should also recite: &#8220;O Allah! Lord of this perfect call and of the regular prayer which is going to be established, give Muhammad the right of intercession and illustriousness, and raise him to the best and the highest place in Paradise that You promised.&#8221; <span style="color:#ff0000;">But he should not say these words in a loud voice like the Adhan</span>. This is because the Adhan ends with saying: La ilaha illa Allah (There is no god but Allah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for the Mu&#8217;adhin to raise his voice in order to let others to hear and follow him. It was authentically reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;When you hear the Mu&#8217;adhin, repeat what he says, then invoke blessings on me, for everyone who invokes blessings on me will receive them tenfold from Allah; then beg from Allah Al-Wasilah for me, which is a rank in Paradise fitting for only one of Allah&#8217;s servants, and I hope that I will be that one. If anyone who asks that I be given the Al-Wasilah, he will be assured of my intercession.&#8221;<strong>  </strong></span>[#01]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is was stated by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). (Related by Muslim in his Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (رضي الله عنه)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a Sunnah for both Mu&#8217;adhin and listener, whether male or female, everywhere after announcing the Adhan. All are to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;<strong>O Allah, bestow peace and blessings upon Muhammad</strong>!&#8221; or</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;<strong>O Allah, bestow peace and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and Companions</strong>!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">in a tone that differs from the Adhan&#8217;s and in a lower voice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should say: &#8220;O Allah! Lord of this perfect call and of the Prayer which is going to be established, grant Muhammad Al-Wasilah and illustriousness, and raise him to the best and the highest place (in Paradise) that You promised.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was recorded in Al-Bukhari&#8217;s Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir ibn Abdullah Al-Ansary that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;Whoever says upon hearing the Adhan: &#8216;O Allah, Lord of this perfect call and of the established Prayer (Salah), grant Muhammad the Al-Wasilah and superiority, and raise him up to the praiseworthy position which You have promised&#8217;, <strong>it becomes incumbent upon me to intercede for him on the Day of Resurrection</strong>.&#8221;  </span>[#02]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the Hadith reported from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). Al-Bayhaqy reported this addition:  &#8220;You do not break Your promise.&#8221;  with a Hasan chain of narrators. This is what is legally permitted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">As for increasing the Adhan by saying: &#8220;Come to the best deed&#8221;, &#8220;I bear witness that `Aly is the Waliy of Allah&#8221; or any other phrases is an evil deed and Bid`ah (innovation in Islam) that has no basis in Islam as mentioned earlier. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stated:  &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;">Whoever performs any act for which there is no sanction from our behalf, it is to be rejected</span>.&#8221; [#03] (Related by Muslim in his Sahih book of Hadith on the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported also by Muslim in his Sahih on the authority of Jabir (رضي الله عنه) that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)  used to say during the Friday sermon: &#8220;<span style="color:#808000;">The best speech is embodied in the Book of Allah, and the best of guidance is the guidance given by Muhammad. And the most evil affairs are their innovations and every innovation is misguidance</span>.&#8221; [#04]  There are many Hadiths in this regard. Allah is the One Who grants success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 1304</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The questioner would like to be given a general idea about the Qadiriyyah Tariqah (Sufi order). He read one of the Qadiriyyah books: <em>&#8220;Al-Fiyudat Al-Rabbaniyyah fi Al-Ma&#8217;athir wa Al-Awrad Al-Qadiriyyah&#8221;</em>, and saw a poem including some of the claims and feats performed by the shaykh of this Tariqah. He asks if what is said in this poem is true or untrue. The questioner sent the poem along with his question to ask for a general Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) on it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The poem that was sent by the questioner shows that the one who wrote it was ignorant, as the things that he ascribes to himself are Kufr (disbelief) and misguidance. He claims that all the scholars&#8217; knowledge has been derived from his knowledge and is part of him. He also claims that the Servants&#8217; behavior is according to what he legislates for them and that he would be able to close the Fire due to his greatness, except for a prior pledge taken from the Prophet. He says he can help those of his Murid (students) who are loyal to him and save them from ordeals, protect them in this world and in the Hereafter, secure them from fear, and be with them at the Mizan (the Scales for weighing deeds) on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are false claims, and could only be said by someone who is ignorant and does not know his own ability. Comprehensive knowledge is possessed by Allah Alone, as are the matters related to the Hereafter, and He Alone has control over them; not an angel, a prophet, or a pious person. Allah commanded His Messenger, who was the best of His Creation, to recite to the Ummah (nation) His Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;I possess no power over benefit or harm to myself except as Allâh wills. If I had the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen), I should have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe</strong></span>.&#8221; (Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 188)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say: &#8220;It is not in my power to cause you harm, or to bring you to the Right Path.&#8221; </strong></span>(Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;None can protect me from Allâh’s punishment (if I were to disobey Him), nor can I find refuge except in Him</strong></span>.&#8221; (Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) told those closest to him to save themselves and their children from Allah&#8217;s Punishment through having Iman (Faith) in Him (Glorified be He) and by acting according to His Shari`ah (laws). He also told them that Allah is not in need of them and that Adam, Nuh (Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham) and `Isa (Jesus) will be saying on the Day of Resurrection, &#8220;Myself, myself!&#8221; So how can a shaykh of the Qadiriyyah Tariqah or anyone else created by Allah save their followers, protect those who are loyal to them, and come with them when their deeds are being weighed on the Day of Resurrection? And how could he close the gates of Hell by his greatness? <strong>This is a manifest fabrication and clear Kufr regarding the Shari`ah of the Lord of the Worlds</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of this poem has been excessive in his exaggeration and has overstepped the boundaries of the senses,the intellect, and the Shari`ah, when he claims that he was in the light of Muhammad before the existence of creation, and that he witnessed the meeting of friends, i.e. when Jibril (Gabriel) met with Muhammad (peace be upon them both); he was with Nuh (peace be upon him) in the ark and witnessed the flood; he was with Ibrahim (peace be upon him) when he was thrown to the fire and saw how the fire cooled due to his Du`a&#8217; (supplication); he was with Isma`il (Ishmael) and that the ram was only sent except by his generosity; he was with Ya`qub (Jacob, peace be upon him) when his sight was taken away and that his eyes were only cured with his spit; he was the one who settled Idris (Enoch, peace be upon him) in Jannah (Paradise); he was with Musa (Moses, peace be upon him) when he talked to his Lord and that Musa&#8217;s stick was taken from his stick; he was with `Isa (peace be upon him) in the cradle; and that it was he who gave Dawud (David) his beautiful voice for recitation. He also makes even more obscene claims than these, as he claims that he is Allah in three verses of his poem, the clearest of which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am the one, the only, and the great one in himself,<br />
I am the describer and the described; the shaykh of the Tariqah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah be Exalted and Glorified from this great exceeding of the bounds; <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">is there anything worse than this sheer Kufr?</span> </strong>May Allah protect us from it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Dear questioner, may Allah turn you away from this evil you heard and make you feel no need to study the detailed history and biography of the Qadiriyyah, and what is in this poem by the shaykh of this Tariqah in terms of falsehood, Kufr, and exaggeration. Exert yourself instead to learn the truth from the Book of Allah(Exalted be He), the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him), and the explanations of the Salaf (pious predecessors) from among the Sahabah (Companions) and their followers of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sahih (authentic) Sunnah. We believe that <strong>Shaykh `Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilany</strong>, to whom this Tariqah is ascribed, is as innocent of what is in this poem as the wolf was innocent of the blood of Yaqub&#8217;s son. His followers tell many lies about him and ascribe to him that which he is innocent of.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From <a href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/MoftyDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;Type=Mofty&amp;section=tafseer&amp;ID=2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">`Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz</a> to the honorable brother H. M. Th., may Allah grant him safety! May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you. In respect of your request for Fatwa registered in the Department of the Scholarly Research and Ifta’ (no. 1513), dated (21/4/1407 A.H.), it contains three questions. Here are the answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> Q3: What is the wisdom behind saying, <span class="f"> </span><strong>لا حَوْلَ وَلا قُوَّةَ إِلا بِالله</strong> &#8220;<strong>La Hawla Wala Quwwata Illla Billah</strong>&#8221;  (There is no might nor power except with Allah) when the Mu`adh-dhin says, <strong> حي على الصلاة</strong> &#8220;<strong>Hayya `Ala Al-Salah</strong> (Come to Salah)&#8221; and  <strong>حي على الفلاح &#8220;Hayya `Ala Al-Falah</strong> (Come to Success)&#8221; taking into consideration that they imply a call to Salah? Is there a Hadith that refers to that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The wisdom behind that saying is that man is weak by nature. He has no ability to move from a condition to another except with the help of Allah. Even his going to Salah in congregation needs the help and power of Allah. A servant of Allah has no might or power except with Allah. He realizes that he is weak, powerless, and unable to answer this call unless Allah helps him Alone. Therefore, upon hearing that call, he says: &#8220;La Hawla Wala Quwwata Illa Billah&#8221;.</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is authentically reported from `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) as related by Muslim in his Sahih. May Allah grant us all success! May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!</p>

<p>Q 43: What is the ruling on blood donation? [1]</p>
<p>A: There is no wrong in doing so, especially at times of necessity and need.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is the ruling on non-Muslims donating blood to Muslims?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 1: What is the ruling on blood donation? What is the ruling on non-Muslims donating blood to Muslims?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is permissible to donate blood to Muslims whether the donor is Muslim or Kafir (non-Muslim); and whether he is of the People of the Book, or idolater if there is no harm to the donor and the person to whom blood is donated was in need of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; &#8211; alifta.net<br />
Fatwas of the Permanent Committee&gt;Group 1&gt;Volume 25: Miscellaneous Fatwas 2&gt;Treatment with blood&gt;Blood donation</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it allowed to transfer blood from one person to another, and what if the two are of different religions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a patient becomes so sick that the only way for him to get better is to undergo a blood transfusion, and when doctors are at least confident of the benefits that will result, he may be treated in this fashion, even if the donor and the recipient belong to different religions. Blood form a disbeliever, even though he may be at war with the Muslims, can be donated to a Muslim. <strong>And Muslim blood may be donated to a disbeliever who is not at war with the Muslims</strong>. May Allaah send peace and blessings upon Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Muslims donating blood to non-Muslims is a good deed</strong></span></h3>
<p>The former Mufti of Saudi Arabia Shaykh bin Baz mentioned&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for Muslims to donate blood to non-Muslims and you will be rewarded (by Allah) for doing so. But it’s not permissible to accept compensation for donating blood. Thus Whoever accepted money for donating blood should give that money in charity to the poor.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transferring blood from a male to a female and vice versa</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing wrong with transferring blood from a male to a female and vice versa, as this does not affect marriageability and such matters.</p>
<p>[Issued by the Permanent Committee, Fatwa no. 19477, the sixth question]<br />
<a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=319&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=319&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=17</a></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Donating blood and taking a Price / receiving Gifts for it.</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Receiving compensation for blood donation is unlawful, whether the compensation is money or any other kind of payment based on the Hadith reported on the authority of Abu Juhayfah in Sahih Al-Bukhari: The Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade the price of blood [1].There is a general Ijma` (consensus of scholars) that it is unlawful even if the money is a gift; for it is a gift given in return for something that it is forbidden to sell.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated `Aun bin Abu Juhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father bought a slave who practiced the profession of cupping. (My father broke the slave&#8217;s instruments of cupping). I asked my father why he had done so. He replied, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) forbade the acceptance of the price of a dog or blood, and also forbade the profession of tattooing, getting tattooed and receiving or giving Riba, (usury), and cursed the picture-makers.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahih al-Bukhari 2086 (Book 34, Hadith 39), Translated Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A blood bank grants gifts to blood donors, such as prayer rugs, medals, head coverings or the like, and sometimes three hundred riyals. I would like to know what is the Islamic ruling on such gifts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: After considering the Fatwa request, the Committee gave the following answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to sell blood based on the Hadith related in Sahih Al-Bukhari on the authority of Abu Juhayfah who said: I saw my father buying a cupper [a person who performs cupping] and ordered that his tools be broken. I asked him about this and he replied: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade the price of blood, the price of dogs, and the earnings of a prostitute; and he cursed the woman who tattoos others and she who gets tattooed, the one who takes or gives Riba (usury or interest), and the Musawwir (one who makes pictures, statues, or photographs of living beings).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafiz in Al-Fath said: <strong>&#8220;This means that it is prohibited to sell blood just as it is prohibited to sell dead meat and pork. This is unanimously Haram (unlawful), i.e., to sell blood and take a price.&#8221;</strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Does blood transfusion create a Mahram relationship?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Transferring blood from a man to a woman or vice versa does not fall under the same category as breastfeeding, whether linguistically, conventionally, or legally, nor is it liable to the rulings on breastfeeding, such as creating a Mahram (unmarriageable relatives) relationship or affecting marriageability and the like, as breastfeeding does.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Establishing an Islamic bank to store blood for emergency aid for wounded Muslims</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to found an Islamic bank for accepting blood donations from people and preserving it to provide first aid to the Muslims who need it, provided that the bank does not take anything from the patients or their guardians in return for providing blood to them and does not use it as a commercial means to earn money. There is no doubt that such project will be of public interest to Muslims.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#993300;">[A question asked by a fellow Muslim, and His Eminence replied on 9/2/1415 A.H., no. Sh/1179]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To His Eminence, Shaykh `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz, the Grand Mufty (Islamic scholar qualified to issue legal opinions) of Saudi Arabia, may Allah protect him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As you know, this year the 9th of Muharram was on Saturday, and the 10th was on Sunday, according to the Makkan calendar. Acting upon the Hadith that states: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If I live until next year, I will perform Sawm (Fasting) on the 9th and 10th (of Muharram) </strong>[1]</span> I performed Sawm on Saturday and Sunday. However, one of my Muslim brothers objected to my Sawm on Saturday, and told me that it is forbidden to perform a voluntary Sawm on Saturdays, based on a Hadith, which he said its meaning and not its text. Due to my desire for clarifying this matter, and acting upon the Words of Allah (Exalted be He): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So ask the people of the Scripture, if you do not know</strong></span>. [2] I would like Your Eminence to clarify this ambiguity, mentioning the Hadith and the degree of its authenticity, and advise me on this matter. May Allah protect you. [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Wa `alaykum as-salam warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you too).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith he mentioned is well-known and included in: &#8220;Bulugh Al-Maram&#8221;, in the Chapter on Sawm. However, it is a Hadith Da`if (a Hadith that fails to reach the status of Hasan, due to a weakness in the chain of narration or one of the narrators) and Shadh (a Hadith narrated by a trustworthy narrator, not in line with the narration of other trustworthy narrators in terms of wording, chain of narrators, or both), and contradicts the Hadith Sahih (Hadith that have been transmitted by people known for their uprightness and exactitude; free from eccentricity and blemish) such as the next one in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Do not perform Sawm on Fridays, unless you perform Sawm on the day before it or the day after it. </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">[4]</span> It is known that the day that follows Friday is Saturday. Also, the Hadith, which is mentioned in the Two Sahih Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to perform Sawm on Saturdays and Sundays, saying: “They are feast days for the Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), and I like to do the opposite of them</strong></span>. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths that carry the same meaning, and they all show the permissibility of voluntary Sawm on Saturday.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. A<span style="font-size:1rem;">s-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.</span></p>

<p>The following Question and Answers are extracted from the Fatwa from The Permanent Commitee ( Link <strong><a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Tree&amp;NodeID=2195&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a>)&nbsp;</strong>&amp; Fatwa of Ibn Baz.. Download the PDF of these Fatawa <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/sujud-ul-tilawah-prostration-of-recitation1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Here</strong></a></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>What is&nbsp;the ruling on Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation)?</b></span></p>



<p>Sujud-ul-Tilawah is an act of Sunnah.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>When someone is reciting the Qur&#8217;an and does Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation), should they say Takbir (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;) when prostrating and when rising up from the Sujud (prostration) or just when prostrating?</b></span></p>



<p>They should say Takbir when prostrating, as&nbsp;related by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">&nbsp;Abu Dawud&nbsp;</span>in his Sunan (Hadith compilation classified by jurisprudential themes) on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">&nbsp;Ibn `Umar&nbsp;</span>(may Allah be pleased with them) who said,&nbsp;<a name="TheMessengerofAllah(peacebe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="1025" class="tip"></span><span style="color: #99cc00"><em>The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to recite the Qur&#8217;an to us. When he came upon Ayat-ul-Sujud (Qur’anic verses of Prostration), he would say Takbir and prostrate, and we would prostrate</em></span>.</span></p>



<p>A Muslim should not say Takbir when rising from the Sujud, as it was not confirmed that he (peace be upon him) did so. Sujud-ul-Tilawah is an act of worship and acts of worship are Tawqifiy (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion), they are limited to what was proved in the Shari`ah texts.</p>



<p>It was related that the Takbir is only said when going into Sujud-ul-Tilawah and not when rising from it, <strong>unless the Ayat-ul-Sujud are recited while offering Salah (prayer), then the Takbir is said when prostrating and when rising from the Sujud.</strong> There are many Sahih (authentic) Hadith that mention how the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to offer Salah, which report that he used to say Takbir when prostrating and when rising from prostration.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Should Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer) be made when Sujud-ul-Tilawah is performed during recitation of the Qur&#8217;an outside Salah (Prayer)?</b></span></p>



<p>There is no Nas (Islamic text from the Qur’an or the Sunnah) to support that Taslim should be made after performing it; therefore, no Taslim should follow Sujud.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Should they recite the Tashahhud (a recitation in the sitting position in the second/ last unit of Prayer) and should they say the Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer)?</b></span></p>



<p>The Tashahhud should not be said during Sujud-ul-Tilawah nor the Taslim, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not do so. Sujud-ul-Tilawah is an act of worship and acts of worship, as was mentioned, are Tawqifiy. So you should not resort to Qiyas (analogy) and include the Taslim or Tashahhud in the Sujud-ul-Tilawah as it is in Salah.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>If someone is offering Salah and one of Ayat-ul-Sujud (Qur&#8217;anic verses of Prostration) is recited at the end of the Surah (Qur&#8217;anic chapter), should they start to recite the next Surah after rising up from Sujud (prostration) or just proceed directly to Ruku` (bowing)?</b></span></p>



<p>It is not obligatory for someone who offers Salah and performs Sujud-ul-Tilawah at the end of Surahs such as Al-A`raf, Al-Najm, and Al-`Alaq, to recite more Qur&#8217;an after rising from Sujud-ul-Tilawah and before bending for Ruku`; but there is nothing wrong if they do.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Some people believe that it is not a requirementto be in a state of Taharah (ritual purification) and face the Qiblah (Ka`bah-direction faced in Prayer)when performing Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation), while others say that it is. Which opinion is correct?</b></span></p>



<p>Some scholars consider Sujud-ul-Tilawah a Salah (Prayer) and, on the basis of this opinion, stipulate the conditions of Taharah, facing the Qiblah, Takbir (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;) when prostrating and upon rising from Sujud, and offering Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer). Other scholars consider it an act of `Ibadah (worship), yet not similar to Salah, and therefore do not deem the abovementioned conditions &#8211; such as Taharah, facing the Qiblah, and the other conditions &#8211; necessary. This is the preponderant opinion, as we do not have any evidence supporting the necessity of meeting these conditions. However, whenever it is possible to face the Qiblah or be ritually pure when performing Sujud-ul-Tilawah, this is preferred, to avoid the divergent opinions of scholars.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>What is the Du`a&#8217; (supplication) that should be said in Sujud-ul-Tilawah?</b></span></p>



<p>The Du`a&#8217; that should be said is the same as that said in Sujud during Salah.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Is it permissible for a menstruating woman to do the Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation) and the Sujud-ul-Shukr (Prostration of Thankfulness to Allah)?&nbsp;If it is not permissible, can she glorify Allah verbally (by saying: &#8220;Subhana Allah [Glory be to Allah]&#8221;) when hearing Ayat-ul-Sujud (Qur’anic verses of Prostration)?</b></span></p>



<p><b>Firstly:&nbsp;</b>When a woman is allowed to recite the Qur&#8217;an, she is permitted to do the Sujud-ul-Tilawah, whether she listens to it or recites it.The soundest opinion is that it is permissible for a woman to recite from memory, but not from the Mus-haf (copy of the Qur&#8217;an), and she is permitted to prostrate, because it is not a Salah (prayer), but a way of showing submissiveness to Allah and an act of worship, like Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah).</p>



<p><b style="font-size: 1rem">Secondly:&nbsp;</b><span style="font-size: 1rem">It is not conditional for a reciter or a listener to be in a state of Taharah (ritual purification) to perform Sujud-ul-Tilawah or Sujud-ul-Shukr, because they do not have the same ruling of Salah.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Is it permissible for a woman reciting the Qur&#8217;an to prostrate upon coming across one of Ayat-ul-Sujud (Qur’anic verses of Prostration) while she is not wearing Khimar (veil covering to the waist)?</b></span></p>



<p>It is better that her head be covered when she prostrates, but hopefully it is not wrong if she performs Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation) without covering her head, because Sujud-ul-Tilawah does not have the same ruling as Salah (Prayer). Rather, Sujud-ul-Tilawah is a way of showing submission to Allah (Glorified be He) and a means of approach, similar to reciting Adhkar (invocations and remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis) and performing other righteous works.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>What is the ruling on passing in front of a worshiper who is performing Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation)?</b></span></p>



<p>There is nothing wrong in this.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Sajdatut-Tilawah is a Sunnah</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Question</strong>:&nbsp;If I come across a Verse in which there is a prostration when I am reciting the Quran at my desk, or when I am teaching the students, or in any place, should I perform Sajdatut-Tilawah, or not? And is the prostration for the reciter and the listener both?</span></p>



<p><strong>Answer</strong>:&nbsp;Sajdatut-Tilawah is a Sunnah for the reciter and for the listener and it is not an obligation, nor is it prescribed for the listener except in following of the reciter.</p>



<p>So if you recite a Verse in which there is a prostration in your office or the place of instruction, it is lawful for you to make prostration and it is prescribed for the students to prostrate with you, because they are the listeners. And if you do not observe the prostration, there is no objection.</p>



<p>Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />Fatawa Islamiyah Vol. 2 Page 282, Darussalam English Publication</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><b>Q: What are the Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) requiring prostration when recited and which of them are obligatory?&nbsp;( alifta Link&nbsp;<a href="http://www.alifta.net/fatawa/fatawaDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;BookID=14&amp;View=Page&amp;PageNo=1&amp;PageID=4882" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here</a>)</b></span></p>



<p><strong>Answer from Shaykh Ibn Baz:</strong></p>



<p>Any Sujud-ul-Tilawah (Prostration of Recitation) is Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) and is not obligatory.</p>



<p>There are <strong>fifteen prostrations of recitation in the Qur&#8217;an,</strong> according to the correct opinion of scholars: one at the end of Surah Al-A`raf, one in Surah Al-Ra`d, one in Surah Al-Nahl, one in Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, one in Surah Maryam, two in Surah Al-Hajj, one in Surah Al-Furqan, one in Surah Al-Naml, one in Surah Al-Sajdah, one in Surah Sad,&nbsp;one in Surah Fussilat, one at the end of Surah Al-Najm, one in Surah Al-Inshiqaq that begins with:&nbsp;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0"/><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Inshiqaq, 84: 1" target="_blank" name="Whentheheavenissplitasunder"></a><span style="color: #99cc00">When the heaven is split asunder</span>,&nbsp;and the last one in Surah Al-`Alaq that begins with:&nbsp;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0"/><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-`Alaq, 96: 1" target="_blank" name="Read!IntheNameofyourLord"></a><span style="color: #99cc00">Read! In the Name of your Lord</span>&nbsp;These are fifteen positions for prostration.</p>



<p>It is an act of the Sunnah to prostrate upon reciting them and if one does not prostrate, there is no sin, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) read Surah Al-Najm at times and did not offer Sujud (prostration). This indicated that Sujud-ul-Tilawah is not obligatory.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">&nbsp;`Umar&nbsp;</span>(may Allah be pleased with him) also said: &#8220;<strong>Allah has not made Sujud-ul-Tilawah obligatory; only if we want to</strong>.&#8221; This shows that whoever prostrates is rewarded and whoever does not prostrate is absolved.</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>The Ruling on reciting the Verses of Prostration in the Quiet Prayers</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Question</strong>:&nbsp;What is the ruling on reciting a Verse in which there is a prostration in the quiet prayers, such as Zuhr prayer or Asr prayer?</span></p>



<p>Answer:&nbsp;It is disliked for the Imam to recite a Verse of prostration in the quiet prayers, because he has no alternative in that case but either to prostrate for it or not. If he does not do so, he is abandoning a Sunnah, and if he does so, he will cause confusion in the minds of the worshippers. Therefore it is better to avoid the cause of such confusion. But if he does recite it, he should not prostrate, so as not to confuse the worshippers.</p>

Rather, they have to offer the Salah upon seeing the eclipse when it is happening.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The publications of the astronomers’ reports about the timing of eclipse should be banned by the Ministry of Information lest some people should be deceived by them. These publications may make people feel less fear upon seeing the eclipse.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Fatwas &gt; Shawwal Fatwas &gt; Priority to make up for missed days of Ramadan over fasting the six days of Shawwal</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prescribed to give priority to make up for missed days of Ramadan over fasting the six days of Shawwal</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Is it permissible to observe Sawm (Fasting) for six days in Shawwal before making up for the missed days of the previous month of Ramadan?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Scholars differ regarding this issue; however, the soundest opinion is that it is prescribed to give precedence to observing Sawm of the missed days of Ramadan over the six days of Shawwal and other supererogatory Sawm, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <strong>Anyone who fasts Ramadan and then follows it with six days of Shawwal it is as if they fasted the whole year.</strong> (Related by Muslim in his Sahih [Authentic Hadith Book]) If one chooses to observe Sawm of the six days of Shawwal first, it will not be considered as one who fasts these six days after fasting all of Ramadan, but after some days of Ramadan. Making up for the missed days of Ramadan is a Fard (obligatory act of worship) while fasting the six days of Shawwal is voluntary, and a Fard is more important to fulfill. May Allah grant us success!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: I was unable to fast during Ramadan due to post-partum bleeding. I became ritually pure during the days of ‘Eid and I really wish to fast the six days of Shawwal. Is it permissible for me to fast these days and then begin making up the missed days of Ramadan? Please give us your Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar). May Allah guide you to all goodness!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is prescribed to first make up for the missed days of fasting in Ramadan, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <strong>Anyone who fasts Ramadan and then follows it with six days of Shawwal it is as if they fasted the whole year.</strong> (Related by Muslim in his Sahih) Thus, the Prophet (peace be upon him) clarified that fasting six days of Shawwal comes after fasting Ramadan. It is your duty to start by making up for your missed days of fasting, even if you miss fasting the six days of Shawwal, for the previous Hadith. Moreover, Fard (obligatory act of worship) take precedence over Nafl (supererogatory act of worship). May Allah guide us all to success!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q 4: Should the voluntary Sawm (Fast) of the six days of Shawwal be observed directly after Ramadan, following the day of `Eid-ul-Fitr (the Festival of Breaking the Fast), or is it permissible to start observing it several days after `Eid-ul-Fitr, during the month of Shawwal?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A: It is not necessary to observe this Sawm directly after `Eid-ul-Fitr. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is permissible to start observing it one or more days afterwards. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The six days can be observed either consecutively or non-consecutively during the month of Shawwal, whichever is easier. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This matter is open to choice, as this Sawm is Sunnah and not Faridah (obligatory act).May Allah grant us success.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Book on Talaq</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">125- Talaq which complies with the Sunnah and ruling on uttering the divorce three times in one session or in case of anger</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz to the respected brother; may Allah grant you success! Amen.<br />
As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kindly be informed that I have read your letter which contains some questions. They are answered as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 1: What is the prescribed way of Talaq (divorce pronounced by a husband) in the light of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The prescribed way is that the husband declares the divorce one time when his wife is pregnant or in a state of purity and he has not engaged in any sexual relations with her. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#339966;"><em>O Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)! When you divorce women, divorce them at their ‘Iddah (prescribed periods)</em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) on the authority of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) that the latter divorced his wife when she was menstruating. `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) about his son’s action to which he replied: Command him to take her back, and keep her till she is purified, then has another period, then is purified. If he wishes he may keep her and if he wishes he may divorce her before having sexual intercourse, for that is the `Iddah (woman&#8217;s prescribed waiting period after divorce or widowhood) which Allah commanded for the divorce of a woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another report narrated by Muslim from the Prophet (peace be upon him) reads: Then he can divorce her when she is pure (not menstruating) or pregnant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 2: Is declaring Talaq three times in the same session regarded as one divorce or three divorces?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Three divorces uttered at the same time is only to be counted as one according to the soundest view of scholars. It was authentically reported in Sahih Muslim on the authority of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that the (pronouncement) of three divorces during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) and that of Abu Bakr and for two years of the caliphate of `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) was deemed as one time of divorce. Then, `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) said, &#8220;People hasten in a matter in which they are required to observe respite. So, it is recommended to impose it upon them,&#8221; and he imposed it upon them. It is evident that the divorce in this way is counted as a threefold divorce according to Ijtihad (juristic effort to infer expert legal rulings) made by `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him). Yet, it is better to follow the authentic Sunnah than following Ijtihad made by `Umar or others for the benefit of the Muslims. This is supported by the report narrated by Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal in his Musnad through an authentic Sanad (chain of narrators) from Ibn `Abbas that Abu Rukanah made three pronouncements of divorce and later regretted. So, he went to the Prophet (peace be upon him) who returned his wife to him, and said: It is one divorce.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 3: In a state of rage, a husband said to his wife: &#8220;I divorce you thrice.&#8221; He later regretted and wants to take her back.What is the ruling on this act?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: According to the most correct opinion of scholars, <strong>Talaq is not effected if it is declared &#8211; once or thrice &#8211; in a fit of anger.</strong> They have to prove the claim that the apparent state which caused divorce is true. On the other hand, when anger is so intense that a person is no longer aware of what he is doing or saying, the divorce is not effected according to Ijma` (consensus of scholars). In this case, he is like one who is insane and one who has lost all power of reason due to unintentional drunkenness. Uttering divorce in a state of intentional drunkenness does not become effective due to loss of reason. `Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him) issued a Fatwa that supported this view and it was followed by a group of people of knowledge, because it was based on Shar`y (Islamically lawful) evidence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to guide all Muslims to understanding the religion and holding fast to it, for He is the One Who is capable to do so. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Browse by Volume Number &gt; Group 1 &gt; Volume 20: Divorce &gt; Wisdom behind granting the right to initiate Talaq to men &gt; Is it permissible for a woman to have the right to divorce?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 5245</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Q: Many people from neighboring countries ask me about the issue of `Ismah (the bond of marriage, i.e. the right to initiate divorce). Is it permissible for a woman to have this right? Please enlighten us.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The basic rule is that divorce is in the husband&#8217;s hands and anyone he delegates. This is in case the husband is fit, but if he is not, his guardian will act in his behalf. <strong>Moreover, if the husband authorizes his wife to initiate the divorce, she will have the right to do so as long as he has not annulled the Wakalah (appointment of a legally accountable person to act on behalf of another for a specific permissible matter)</strong>. However, when a husband grants his wife the right to initiate divorce at any time by adding a condition in the marriage contract, this condition is Batil (null and void) since it opposes the main purpose behind the marriage contract. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Any condition that is not in the book of Allah is null, even if they are one hundred conditions.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The third question of Fatwa no. 4497</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 3: Why does Islam grant only the husband the right to initiate Talaq (divorce pronounced by a husband)? What is the ruling if the husband&#8217;s company is unbearable? How can we say that Islam treats both men and women equally?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>Firstly</strong>: Allah grants the husband alone the right to initiate Talaq due to many important reasons, such as;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The husband&#8217;s wisdom, strong will, understanding, and insight being more than the wife&#8217;s.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) The husband is the one who provides for the family, manages its affairs and takes decisions. He is the main pillar and head of the household.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) The husband is obligated to pay the Mahr (mandatory gift to a bride from her groom) and that is why divorce is in his hand. Had it been in the woman&#8217;s hand, a woman may marry someone to take the Mahr and divorce him to marry another, and so on. This is not proper and Allah warns Muslims against this when He says: Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: When the husband&#8217;s company is unbearable, the matter is to be referred to the courts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>: Allah favors men with some rulings and favors women with some rulings, and both of them share some rulings, and the mutual reference is the Shari`ah (Islamic law).</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Browse by Volume Number &gt; Group 1 &gt; Volume 20: Divorce &gt; Wisdom behind granting the right to initiate Talaq to men &gt; Should a woman make Kaffarah for divorcing her husband?</p>
<p>The first question of Fatwa no. 8065</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q 1: When a woman divorces her husband, is she required to make Kaffarah (expiation)? If so, what is it?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: When a woman pronounces the divorce word to her husband, the divorce does not take place. No Kaffarah is required, but she has to perform Tawbah (repentance to Allah) and ask Allah&#8217;s forgiveness. Her pronouncement of divorce to her husband goes against the Shari`ah (Islamic law) proof that indicates that the right of divorce is given to the husband or the Islamically lawful authorized person that replaces the husband in divorce.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Statement from the Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’ concerning the ruling on celebrating the Gregorian Year 2000 and related issues</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah, Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the Last of the Prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The questioners have asked about the ruling on dedicating attention to the Gregorian millennium, celebrating it, and other issues relating to the event. It is sufficient for us to quote just two of the posed questions:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The first question says,</strong> “Nowadays we see the programs that the mass media is broadcasting about the celebrations and preparations held for the arrival of the Year 2000, and the beginning of the third millennium. The Kafirs (disbelievers) from among the Jews, Christians, and others, are very happy about it and pin their hopes on this event. My question, Your Eminence, is that some Muslims have become interested in it and are considering it a happy occasion to get married or do business on. Others are advertising this event in their shops or companies, and doing other things that offend Muslims. What is the Shari‘ah (Islamic law) ruling on celebrating this event and exchanging verbal congratulations and cards on it? May Allah reward you with the best for the efforts you exert for Islam and Muslims!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The second question says,</strong> “The Jews and the Christians are preparing to celebrate the arrival of the Year 2000 according to their calendar, in an extraordinary way to promote their plans and beliefs in the world, particularly in Muslim countries. Some Muslims have been influenced by this propaganda and have also started preparing for it and many of them are announcing sales on this occasion. We fear that this may affect the Muslims’ ‘Aqidah (creed) in relation to their loyalties to non-Muslims. We hope you will explain the ruling on Muslims’ following the Kafir (disbelievers) in their special occasions, propagating and celebrating them, and the ruling on giving workers the day off in some organizations and companies to mark this occasion?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Does doing any of these or similar things, or approving them, have any effect on a Muslim’s ‘Aqidah?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Having studied the questions, the committee answered as follows:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam and the guidance to the Straight Path are the greatest blessings that Allah has bestowed upon His Servants. It is through His Mercy that Allah (Exalted be He) obligates His Believing Servants to ask Him for guidance during Salah (Prayer). They ask Him to guide them to and keep them on the Straight Path. Allah (Glorified be He) describes this Straight Path as being the path of those on whom He has bestowed His Grace from among the Prophets, the Siddiqin (the followers of the prophets who were first to believe in them, such as Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq), the martyrs, and the righteous, and not the path of those who have gone astray from the Jews, Christians, and other Kafirs (disbelievers) and Mushrikin (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once this is learned, it is obligatory on a Muslim to realize the greatness of Allah’s Blessing upon them. They should give thanks to Allah (Glorified be He) in words, deeds, and beliefs. They should guard this blessing, protect it, and adopt the means necessary to keep from loss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An insightful look into Allah’s Din (Religion) in today’s world, in which the truth and falsehood have become mixed and confused for many people, will clearly see the efforts the enemies of Islam are exerting to destroy its realities, extinguish its light, distance Muslims from it, and sever all their connections with it by any possible means. Not only that, but they are also attempting to distort its image and bring accusations and forge lies against it, to avert people from the Way of Allah,and from Iman (Faith) in what Allah revealed to His Messenger, Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) confirms this by saying (what means): <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 109" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="ManyofthepeopleoftheScripture"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Many of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their ownselves, even after the truth (that Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is Allâh’s Messenger) has become manifest unto them</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 69" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="ApartyofthepeopleoftheScripture"></a><span style="color:#008000;">A party of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) wish to lead you astray. But they shall not lead astray anyone except themselves, and they perceive not.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 149" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Ifyouobey"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! If you obey those who disbelieve, they will send you back on your heels, and you will turn back (from Faith) as losers</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 99" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Say:OpeopleoftheScripture"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Say: &#8220;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you stop those who have believed, from the Path of Allâh, seeking to make it seem crooked, while you (yourselves) are witnesses [to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم as a Messenger of Allâh and Islâm (Allâh’s religion, i.e. to worship none but Him Alone)]? And Allâh is not unaware of what you do.</span>&#8220;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There as also many other Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) to this effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nevertheless, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has made a promise to protect His Religion and Book, as He says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Hijr, 15: 9" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Verily,We,itisWeWhohavesent"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’ân) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption</span>).<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> All praise is to Allah! Moreover, the Prophet (peace be upon him) has informed that a group of his Ummah (nation based on one creed) will continue on the Truth, triumphant, and they will not be harmed by those who forsake or oppose them until the Day of Judgment. All praise is to Allah! We ask Allah (Exalted be He), Who is the Ever-Near and the Responsive, to make us and our Muslim brothers among this group. Indeed, He is the Most Generous Bestower.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’ has seen and heard about the huge preparations and great interest shown by the Jews, the Christians, and those so-called Muslims who are influenced by them to mark the end of the year and welcome the new millennium according to the Gregorian calendar, and the committee cannot but provide advice and clarification for all Muslims on the facts of this occasion and give the ruling of the sanctified Shari‘ah on it, so Muslims will be enlightened about their Din and beware of the deviations of those who earned Allah’s Anger and those who went astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To continue:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>First</strong></span>: The Jews and the Christians have attached events, sufferings, and pinned hopes on the arrival of this millennium, which they are certain &#8211; or almost certain &#8211; that they shall come to pass, as they are the outcome of their researches and studies, as they claim. They have also attached some of their creedal issues to this millennium, which they claim to have been mentioned in their distorted books. It is obligatory on Muslims not to pay attention to this or believe it; instead they should be content with the Book of their Lord (Exalted be He) and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him), and any theory or opinion contrary to these is just an illusion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Second</span></strong>: This and other similar occasions are never devoid of mixing the truth with falsehood, and inviting to Kufr (disbelief), Dalalah (deviation from what is right), licentiousness, atheism, and the emergence of Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect).Among these invitations are the calls to unify the religions, equate Islam with false creeds and sects, ask for the blessing of the Cross, and practice the Jewish and Christian rites. This is in addition to the words and deeds that either imply that the distorted abrogated Christian and Jewish creeds can lead to Allah, or express approval of some of their beliefs which contradict the Din of Islam or constitute Kufr (disbelief) in Allah, His Messenger, and Islam, by the Ijma‘ (consensus) of the Muslim Ummah. Moreover, this occasion is one of the means of alienating Muslims from their Din.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Third</strong></span>: The Qur’an, Sunnah, and authentic Athar (narrations from the Companions) give detailed evidence on the prohibition of imitating the disbelievers in what is particular to them. This includes imitating them in their ‘Eids or celebrating them. ‘Eid (festival) is a generic term which (in the context of these reports) includes every day or occasion which is repeated and is venerated by the Kafirs, or any place in which the Kafirs hold religious gatherings, or any action which they do in these places or at these times &#8211; all of that is part of their ‘Eids or festivals. The prohibition applies not only to their festivals, but to any times or places which they venerate that have no basis in the Din of Islam; and all the invented acts that they do at them are prohibited also. The days preceding and following their festivals are also covered by this prohibition, as pointed out by Shaykh Al-Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Ayahs (Qur’anic verses) which specifically forbid imitating Non-Muslims in their festivals is Allah’s Saying: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Furqan, 25: 72" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Andthosewhodonotbearwitness"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And those who do not bear witness to falsehood</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> This is stated as one of the characteristics of Allah’s Believing Servants. A group of the Salaf (righteous predecessors), including: Ibn Sirin, Mujahid, and Al-Rabi‘ ibn Anas, interpreted the word &#8220;<strong>Al-Zur (falsehood)</strong>&#8221; as referring to the festivals of the Kafirs. It was authentically reported that Anas ibn Malik (may Allah be pleased with him) said, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="WhentheMessengerofAllah(peace"></a><span id="13870"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came to Al-Madinah, they had two days on which they would celebrate. He (peace be upon him) asked, ‘What are these two days?’ They said, ‘We used to celebrate on these two days during the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance).’ The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, “Allah has given you two days instead of these that are better than them: the Day of Al-Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice) and the Day of Al-Fitr (the Festival of Breaking the Fast)</span>.”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> (Reported by Al-ImamAhmad, Abu Dawud, and Al-Nasa&#8217;y, through Sahih [authentic] Sanad [chain of narrators])</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically narrated by Thabit ibn Al-Dahhak (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Amanvowedtosacrificesomecamels"></a><span id="10255"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">A man vowed to sacrifice some camels in Buwanah (a hill beyond Yanbu`) during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). So, he came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and said, ‘I have vowed to sacrifice some camels in Buwanah.’ The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked, “Were there any idols of the Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance) there that were worshipped?” They said, ‘No.’ He (peace be upon him) asked, ‘Were any of their festivals held there?’ They said, ‘No.’ The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, ‘Fulfill your vow, for there is no fulfillment of a vow which involves disobedience to Allah, or with regard to a thing the son of Adam does not own</span>.’”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> (Reported by Abu Dawud through a Sahih Sanad)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) said, “<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not enter to the Mushrikin (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) in their churches on the day of their festivals, for Wrath descends upon them</strong></span>.” He (may Allah be pleased with him) also said, “<span style="color:#008000;">Keep away from the enemies of Allah on their festivals.</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported that `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with them both) said, “<span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who settles in the land of the non-Muslims and celebrates their Nayruz (New Year’s Day) and their Mahrajaan (two non-Islamic Persian festivals), and keeps imitating them until they die in that state, will be gathered with them on the Day of Resurrection</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Fourth</span></strong>: Muslims are prohibited from observing the festivals of the Kafirs for many reasons, some of which are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Imitating them in some of their festivals will give them delight and complacency in their falsehoods.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Imitation and similarity in external matters will inevitably leads one to imitating them and behaving like them in internal matters such as their corrupt beliefs, and being slowly and subtly won over to their way of thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. One of the gravest ensuing corruptions is that imitating the Kafirs in external matters generates a kind of love, friendship and loyalties that are incompatible with Iman (Faith), as Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 51" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Takenotthe"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Auliyâ’), then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust)</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Mujadalah, 58: 22" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="You(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85)"></a>Y<span style="color:#008000;">ou (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Fifth</strong></span>: Based on the above, it is not permissible for a Muslim who believes in Allah as their Lord, Islam as their religion, and Muhammad as their Prophet to celebrate any festival that has no basis in the Din of Islam, and that includes the so-called new millennium. Neither are they permitted to attend such festivals or take part in them, or to help others do so in any way whatsoever, because this is sin and transgression of the limits set by Allah. Allah (Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 2" target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Violatenot"></a><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is Severe in punishment</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Sixth</strong></span>: It is not permissible for a Muslim to cooperate, in any way, with the Kafirs with regard to their festivals &#8211; including the new millennium under discussion &#8211; by publicizing and announcing them, or propagating them by any means, whether through the mass media, or by setting up digital clocks and notice boards, manufacturing clothing and memorabilia, printing cards or school notebooks, announcing sales, offering prizes, organizing sport events, or producing special slogans or logos.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Seventh</strong></span>: It is not permissible for Muslims to consider the festivals of the Kafirs &#8211; including the millennium &#8211; to be happy occasions or blessed times for taking the day off work, getting married, starting a business or beginning new projects, etc. It is not permissible to believe that these days are more special than other days; because these are just like any other days.This is a corrupt belief that does not change the reality of these days in the slightest. Such beliefs are nothing but sin upon sin. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Eighth</strong></span>: It is not permissible for a Muslim to congratulate the Kafirs on their festivals, as this implies a kind of approval of their false beliefs and makes them happy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for offering congratulations on the special ritualistic occasions of Kufr (disbelief), this is agreed to be Haram (prohibited), such as congratulating them (the Kafirs) for their festivals and fasts by saying, ‘Happy or blessed festival to you’ and the like. Even if the one who says so escapes committing Kufr, it is still Haram. It is like congratulating someone for prostrating to the Cross; in fact it is even more sinful in the Sight of Allah and more hateful than congratulating someone for drinking Khamr (intoxicants), killing a soul, or committing adultery, and so on. Many of those who have no respect for their Din fall into this error; they do not realize the abhorrence of their action. Anyone who congratulate a person for committing an act of disobedience, Bid‘ah (innovation in religion) or Kufr exposes themselves to the Hate and Wrath of Allah.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Ninth</strong></span>: It honors the Muslims to abide by the <strong>Hijri (lunar) calendar</strong> which is based on the date of Hijrah (migration) of their Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to Madinah, upon which the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them) consensually agreed, and they dated events according to it without celebrating it. Muslims have followed in their footsteps and passed on this heritage for fourteen centuries to our present day. Therefore, it is not permissible for a Muslim to abandon the Hijri calendar and adopt the calendar of any other nation on earth, such as the Gregorian. This means exchanging that which is better for that which is worse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We, therefore, advise all Muslims to have Taqwa (fear/wariness of offending Allah) and to act in obedience to Allah, keep away from sins, and to exhort one another to persevere in this and be patient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let every believer be true to their soul and strive to save it from the Wrath of Allah and His Curse in this world and the Hereafter by actualizing their knowledge and Iman. They should take Allah as their Guide, Helper, Lawgiver, and Protector, for He is the Best Protector and the Best Helper. Indeed, sufficient is your Lord as a Guide and Helper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let them also repeat the Du‘a’ (supplication) of the Prophet (peace be upon him):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><a target="blank" rel="nofollow" name="OAllah!LordofJibril,Mika%E2%80%99il,"></a><span id="19858"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">O Allah! Lord of Jibril, Mika’il, and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and the earth, Knower of the Unseen and the Seen, You will judge between Your servants concerning that over which they used to differ. Guide me to the truth of that wherein they differed, by Your leave, for You guide whomsoever You will to the Straight Path</span>.”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">The second question of Fatwa no. <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">7807</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q 2: Is the call for rapprochement between religions (Islam &#8211; Christianity &#8211; Judaism) a legitimate one? Is it permissible for a Muslim believer to support it? I heard that this is done by some scholars in Al-Az-har and other Islamic institutions. Is the call for rapprochement betweenAhl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) and theShiites, Druze, Al-Isma`iliyyah, Al-Nusayriyyah and such sects useful for Muslims? Is reconciliation between them possible, although all of these sects entail Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), offense to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and hostility towards Islam and Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah? Is this rapprochement permissible according to Shari`ah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: <span style="color:#ff0000;">First</span>: </b>the roots of Iman (faith) which Allah has revealed to His Messengers in the Holy Books: Tawrah (Torah), Injil (Gospel), Zabur (Psalms), and the Qur&#8217;an; and which the Messengers Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses), &#8216;Isa </span>(<span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">Jesus</span></span>),<span class="HarfBody"> and other Messengers (peace be upon them) called to, are all the same. The former ones of them told the latter about them; and the latter confirmed what the former said, even if they differed in the branches, each according to the circumstances of their own era and the benefit of the people at their time. This is the wisdom and mercy of Allah, as He says, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>The Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say), &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers&#8221; &#8211; and they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).</em>&#8220;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" />(Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 285).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah also says, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><em><span style="color:#ff6600;">And those who believe in Allâh and His Messengers and make no distinction between any of them (Messengers), We shall give them their rewards; and Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful</span></em>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> (Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;, 4: 152). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah also says, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" />And (remember) when Allâh took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#ff6600;">Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah (understanding of the Laws of Allâh), and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him</span></em>.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allâh said: <em><span style="color:#ff6600;">&#8220;Do you agree (to it) and will you take up My Covenant (which I conclude with you)?&#8221; They said: &#8220;We agree.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Then bear witness; and I am with you among the witnesses (for this).&#8221;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" />Then whoever turns away after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious: those who turn away from Allâh’s Obedience).<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" />Do they seek other than the religion of Allâh (the true Islâmic Monotheism &#8211; worshipping none but Allâh Alone), while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></span></em> (Surah Al-&#8216;Imran, 3: 81-83). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah also says, <em><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#ff6600;">Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;We believe in Allâh and in what has been sent down to us, and what was sent down to Ibrâhîm (Abraham), Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael), Ishâq (Isaac), Ya‘qûb (Jacob) and Al-Asbât [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya‘qûb (Jacob)] and what was given to Mûsâ (Moses), ‘Isâ </span></em></span><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em>(<span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">Jesus</span></span>)</em></span><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><em> and the Prophets from their Lord.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">After mentioning Ibrahim&#8217;s call for Tawhid (monotheism) and the Messengers who were contemporary with him, Allah says, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><em><span style="color:#ff6600;">They are those whom We gave the Book, Al-Hukm (understanding of the religious laws), and Prophethood. But if these disbelieve therein (the Book, Al-Hukm and Prophethood), then, indeed We have entrusted it to a people (such as the Companions of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) who are not disbelievers therein.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" />They are those whom Allâh had guided. So follow their guidance. Say: &#8220;No reward I ask of you for this (the Qur’ân). It is only a reminder for the ‘Alamîn (mankind and jinn).&#8221;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></span></em> (Surah Al-An&#8217;am, 6: 89-90).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah also says, <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><em><span style="color:#ff6600;">Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrâhîm (Abraham) are those who followed him, and this Prophet (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and those who have believed (Muslims).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah also says, <em><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#ff6600;">Then, We have sent the revelation to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم saying): &#8220;Follow the religion of Ibrâhîm (Abraham) Hanif (Islâmic Monotheism &#8211; to worship none but Allâh) and he was not of the Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters and disbelievers).<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /></span></em> (Surah Al-Nahk, 16: 123). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">He also says, <span style="color:#ff6600;"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><em>And (remember) when ‘Isâ </em></span></span><em><span style="color:#ff6600;">(<span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">Jesus</span></span>)</span></em><span class="HarfBody"><em><span style="color:#ff6600;">, son of Maryam (Mary), said: &#8220;O Children of Israel!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">He also says,<span style="color:#ff6600;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><em>And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) the Book (this Qur’ân) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Muhaymin (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">It is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said,<span style="color:#ff9900;"> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.org/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" align="middle" border="0" /><em><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">I am the nearest of all the people to &#8216;Isa ibn Maryam </span></em></span></span><span style="color:#ff9900;"><em><span id="ContentParagraph">(</span><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">Jesus</span></span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">, </span></em></span><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#ff9900;"><em><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">son of Mary) in this world and in the hereafter.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The Prophet (peace be upon him) applied this practically when he concluded a peace treaty with Quraysh in the year of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Hudaybiyah, </span>with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Jews </span>in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah </span>before the Battle of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Khandaq </span>(the Trench) and the Battle of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Khaybar, </span>and with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Christians of Rome </span>in the Battle of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Tabuk. </span>This had the greatest impact and the most wonderful results; peace spread, lives were saved, the truth prevailed in the world, people embraced Islam in crowds, and everyone began to work for the benefit of this world and the Hereafter. Thus, the result was prosperity, power, and the spread of Islam and peace.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">History and reality are the strongest proof of this for the impartial and sane people who are free from fanaticism and sophistry. Therein is indeed a reminder for those who have a heart or listen heedfully. Allah is the One Who guides to the straight path. He is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b><span style="color:#ff0000;">Fifth</span>, </b><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Druze, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Al-Nusayriyyah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Al-Isma`iliyyah </span>and those who follow them such as<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Babists </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">and Baha&#8217;is </span>have manipulated the religious texts; legislated for themselves what Allah has not permitted for them; and imitated<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Jews </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Christians </span>in their distortions out of following the desire imitating the first leader of Fitnah (trial):<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">`Abdullah ibn Sab&#8217; Al-Himyary, </span>the head of Ibtida&#8217; (heresy), misguidance, and spreading conflict among the Muslims. His evil spread widely; many sects were deceived by him, so they turned to Kufr after having embraced Islam; and controversy spread among Muslims. Thus, the call for rapprochement between such sects and the Muslims is useless and futile, as they resemble<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Jews </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Christians </span>in their misguidance, Kufr, envy towards the Muslims and conspiring against them, even if their ways and intentions are different. Thus, they apply the same policy of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Jews </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Christians </span>with the Muslims. For some reason, a group of Egyptian Azhari scholars attempted to make this rapprochement with the Iranian, Rafidi scholars of Qum after the Second World War.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Some of the sincere great scholars were deceived by this call, as their hearts were too pure and they were inexperienced in life. So, they issued a magazine called &#8220;Al-Taqrib&#8221;. However, the truth was uncovered soon after, and this call ended in failure. This is not strange, as the inclinations are different, the ideas are distinct, and the &#8216;Aqidahs are contrasting. There is no way to reconcile the contraries.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Ibn Baz Fatwas &#8211; (Part No. 1; Page No. 206,207)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Copper bracelets [1]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[1]This is another answer to a question about copper bracelets made to cure rheumatism</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz to my honorable brother, may Allah safeguard you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have received your noble letter, may Allah be pleased with you. I have also reviewed the enclosed documents on the properties of the copper bracelet recently made to cure rheumatism. I have considered the whole matter more than once and discussed it with a number of university lecturers. We exchanged opinions on the juristic ruling on the copper bracelet in question, but there were different opinions on the matter; some regard it permissible as it has properties of curing rheumatism, whereas others see that it is better not to wear it, on the ground that wearing it is like the practice of the people of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance), who used to wear copper amulets and bracelets, thinking that they were a cure for many diseases and a reason for the safety of the person wearing them against envy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who wears an amulet, Allah will not fulfill their need, and anyone who wears a seashell, Allah will not give them peace</span>. [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another narration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who hangs an amulet has committed Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). </span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imran ibn Al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) also narrated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) saw a man with a brass bracelet on his hand. He (peace be upon him) asked him, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; The man replied, &#8216;A protection from weakness.&#8217; He (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;Cast it off, for verily it will only increase your weakness; and if you die wearing it, you will never succeed.&#8217; </span>[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another Hadith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) in one of his journeys sent a messenger to check the camels of the caravan, and ordered the cutting of all string necklaces hung around the necks of the camels which were thought by the people of Jahiliyyah to benefit and protect their camels. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Hadiths and others show that a Muslim must not wear amulets, bracelets, strings, bones, beads or other things that are used by some people to prevent or remove evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In my opinion, it is better not to wear or use this copper bracelet to block any means to Shirk, and to not let the heart be attached to such things, and to direct Muslims with their hearts toward Allah Alone trustingly and confidently, and to restrict oneself to lawful means that are indisputably permissible. Surely, what Allah has made lawful and accessible is sufficient and dispenses with any need for what is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who guards themselves against doubtful matters keeps their religion and honor blameless, and anyone who indulges in doubtful matters indulges in unlawful matters, just as a shepherd who pastures his animals around a sanctuary will soon (transgress upon it and) pasture them in it. </span>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Leave what causes you doubt and turn to what does not cause you doubt. </span>[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Undoubtedly, wearing a copper bracelet is similar to what was practiced by the people of Jahiliyyah. Wearing it constitutes either a prohibited matter of Shirk or a means leading to Shirk or at least a doubtful matter.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is better for a Muslim not to wear it and resort to lawful medical treatment. This is the opinion that seems correct to a group of scholars, shaykhs, and myself as well with regard to this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah (Exalted be He) to guide you and us to what pleases Him, grant us good understanding of His Religion, and protect us against all that opposes His Laws. Indeed, He is Able to do all things. May Allah safeguard you. As-salamu `alaykum.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 2396</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some callers to Allah (Exalted be He) told us that a Muslim should not wipe over his face after making Du`a&#8217; (supplication), because this is a form of Bid`ah (innovation in religion), as they say. They further say that if the Mu&#8217;adhin (caller to Prayer) says while performing Iqamah (call to start the Prayer): &#8220;The time of Salah (Prayer) has come&#8221;, it is not permissible for prayers to say: &#8220;May Allah establish it and cause it to continue.&#8221; Kindly give us the legal opinion in this regard.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: First, the slave&#8217;s calling upon his Lord and asking Him for his needs is valid and encouraged, and <strong>raising the hands while performing Du`a&#8217; (supplication)</strong> to beseech Allah (Exalted be He) and turn to Him, is an established act of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning <strong>wiping over the face after making Du`a&#8217;</strong>, there is Hadith which is classed as Da`if (weak) and is related by Ibn Majah from the narration of Salih ibn Hassan Al-Nadry on the authority of Muhammad ibn Ka`b Al-Qurazhy from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <em>When you supplicate Allah, do so with the palms of your hands, not with their backs. After you have finished, wipe your face therewith</em>. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith is Da`if due to the weakness of Salih ibn Hassan. He was classified as a weak narrator by Ahmad, Ibn Ma`in, Abu Hatim, and Al-Daraqutny. Al-Bukhari said that his narrated Hadith are rejected, and the same was said by Abu Nu`aym Al-Asbahany who said that his (Salih&#8217;s) Hadith are rejected and he is Matruk (a narrator whose Hadith transmission was discarded due to unreliability). Ibn Hibban said: He used to listen to songs and singers and also used to narrate fabricated Hadith while falsely ascribing them to trustworthy narrators. It is also said by Ibn Al-Jawzy concerning this Hadith, it is unauthentic because of the presence of Salih ibn Hassan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another Hadith in this regard related by Al-Tirmidhy in his Sunan: Abu Musa Muhammad ibn Al-Muthanna and Ibrahim ibn Ya`qub and others said: We were told by Hammad ibn `Isa Al-Juhany on the authority of Hanzhalah ibn Abu Sufyan Al-Jumahy from Salim ibn `Abdullah from his father, from `Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: <span style="color:#993300;"><em>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) raised his hands for supplication, he would not lower them until he had passed them over his face</em></span>.[2] Muhammad ibn Al-Muthanna said in the Hadith he narrated: “<span style="color:#800000;"><em>He did not put them back down until he had wiped them over his face</em>.” [3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu `Isa said: This is a Sahih Gharib (a Hadith with a single narrator usually at the beginning of the chain of narration) Hadith which has only one narration by Hammad ibn `Isa and he is the only narrator of it although his narrations are few. Hanzhalah ibn Abu Sufyan is a Thiqah (trustworthy) narrator, as judged by Yahya ibn Sa`id Al-Qattan. However, the Hadith has in its Sanad (chain of narrators) Hammad ibn `Isa who is a weak narrator as well as being the only narrator of the Hadith as mentioned by Al-Tirmidhy in his Sunan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As Du`a&#8217; is a prescribed `Ibadah (worship), and there is no authentic evidence from the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him), whether in his words or actions to support that; rather, only Da`if narrations, it is preferable to abandon that act in favor of the authentic Hadith in which there is no mention of wiping over the face after finishing Du`a&#8217;.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second, the basic rule concerning acts of worship is that they are Tawqifiy (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion), and Allah (Exalted be He) is only to be worshipped in the manner that He ordained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, it has not been authentically narrated from the Prophet (peace be upon him) upon hearing the Iqamah, that he said: &#8220;May Allah establish it and cause it to continue&#8221;. But this was narrated by Abu Dawud in his Sunan from a weak narrator. He said: We were told by Sulayman ibn Dawud Al-`Ataky who said: We were told by Muhammad ibn Thabit who said: I was told by a man from the Levant (the region covering Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine) on the authority of Shahr ibn Hawshab from Abu Umamah or from some of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) that Bilal started to declare Iqamah, and when he said, &#8220;The time of Salah has come,&#8221; the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;May Allah establish it and cause it to continue.&#8221; The reason behind the weakness of that Hadith is that its Sanad had an unknown narrator whose narration is not considered reliable. Therefore, the saying &#8220;may Allah establish it and cause it to continue&#8221; is not prescribed, because it was not authentically reported; rather, it is preferable on the part of anyone hearing the Iqamah to say as the person who declares it says, because it takes the same ruling as Adhan (call to Prayer). The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, When you hear the Mu&#8217;adhin (caller to prayer), repeat what he says.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The second question of Fatwa no. 1474</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Q2: Is it permissible for a person to offer an Ud-hiyah (sacrificial animal offered by non-pilgrims) on behalf of a dead person?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: All Muslims have agreed upon its permissibility. So, it is permissible to offer Ud-hiyah on behalf of a dead person because of the generality of the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When a man dies, his acts come to an end, but three, recurring charity, or knowledge (by which people) benefit, or a pious son, who prays for him (for the deceased).</strong>[1]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">(Narrated by Muslim, Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, Al-Nasa&#8217;y and Al-Bukhari in his book Al-Adab Al-Mufrad on the authority of Abu Hurayrah) </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Offering Ud-hiyah on behalf of the dead is also considered a Sadaqah Jariyah (ongoing charity) because it benefits the person offering it, the dead person and other people.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Q: What is the opinion of your Eminence regarding the opinion of the one who says that Sawm in the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah is Bid`ah (innovation in religion)?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is an ignorant person who should be taught.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (peace be upon him)ordered that good deed should be done in them and fasting is one of the good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are no days during which the righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these ten days (i.e. The first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah)</strong></span>.&#8221; They asked him: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Messenger of Allah, not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah?</strong></span>&#8221; He (peace be upon him) replied: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah, except in case one goes forth with his life and his property and does not return with either of it.&#8221;</span></strong> Narrated by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih Book of Hadith. [1]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Though it is not certain whether the Prophet (peace be upon him) fasted them or not, yet it should be relied on what the Prophet said because saying is much more significant than practice. When saying is accompanied by practice, this will affirm the Sunnah. The Sunnah of the Prophet are divided into saying, practice, and approving. Though each of them forms the Sunnah, the saying is the most significant and strong of them. Then, the practice comes next and then approval follows.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are no days during which the righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these days</strong></span>.&#8221; [2] By these days the Prophet means the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. Thus, if one fasts or gives to charity during them, one will be doing a great good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is ordained during these days also to recite Takbir (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;), Tahmid (saying: &#8220;Al-hamdu lillah [All praise is due to Allah]&#8221;), and Tahlil (saying: &#8220;La ilaha illa Allah [There is no god except Allah]&#8221;) because he (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;There are no days that are greater before Allah or in which good deeds are more beloved to Him than these ten days, so recite a great deal of Tahlil, Takbir, and Tahmid during them</strong></span>.&#8221;[3]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: <strong>Among the qualifications necessary for a Da`y is that he should have patience, kindness, and gentleness with forbearing temperament as the prophets (peace be upon them) were.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never should a Da`y be rushing, violent, or unduly strict. Rather, he has to be patient, forbearing and kind while practicing Da`wah. To this effect, we have stated some evidence earlier. For example, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.”</strong> [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: And by the Mercy of Allâh, you dealt with them gently. In the story of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allâh).”</strong>[Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O Allah, whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is hard upon them, be hard upon him, and whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is kind to them, be kind to him.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muslim, Sahih, Book on rulership, no. 1828; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 6, p. 93.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory for you, slaves of Allah, to be kind in your Da`wah, and not to be harsh with people. Do not make people turn away from Islam because of your harshness, ignorance or violent, harmful approach. It is thus obligatory for you to be forbearing, gentle, pleasant and lenient in speech so that your words may have an effect on the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect on one toward whom your Da`wah is directed. As such, people will receive your Da`wah better, will be affected by it and will show appreciation. On the contrary, harshness causes disaffection, alienation, and division, not unity.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#752722;" class="has-inline-color">The Transcribed Text from the audio:</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In the name of Allah, The Most Beneficent, The Most Merciful. I testify that there is no true God worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s true slave and messenger. May Allah&#8217;s salah and salaam be upon the noble prophet, the believers of his family and the noble companions and those who follow on their path until the Day of resurrection. I ask Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) to make us from those who follow their path until the Day we meet Him (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) while pleased with us.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">We continue with the discussion on correct creed. What we are going to cover now is correct creed with the respect to karaamaat and the miracles.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It is from the creed of Ahlul sunnah and from the basic foundations of their creed is to believe in the karaamaat. Karamaat means charisma that occur by the Auliya&#8217;, those righteous who are close to Allah.This forms part of the principles of the creed of Ahlul sunaah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Who is the Walee? The walee is defined in the Qur&#8217;an: ٱلَّذِینَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ یَتَّقُونَ  These are the auliya&#8217;, those who believe and are pious, complying with the commands of Allah and  are abstaining from his prohibitions, these are Auliya, the friends of Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎). These are the righteous who are close to Allah.  This is defined clearly in Surah Yunus in chapter 10 verse 62 and 63. </p>



<p>Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ) says</p>



<p>أَلَاۤ إِنَّ أَوۡلِیَاۤءَ ٱللَّهِ لَا خَوۡفٌ عَلَیۡهِمۡ وَلَا هُمۡ یَحۡزَنُونَ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;No doubt verily the Auliya&#8217; no fear shall come upon them&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>Who are they? </p>



<p>Then comes the definition:    </p>



<p><strong>ٱلَّذِینَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَكَانُوا۟ یَتَّقُونَ</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>&#8220;Those who believe in Tawheed and feared Allah much (by abstaining from evil deeds and sins and by doing righteous deeds).&#8221;</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the karamaah is a matter that transcends the conceivable or customary or natural, Allah makes occur on the hands of one of His auliya&#8217; as He chooses as a help on some religious matter or a worldly matter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the karamaah does not reach the level of the miracles, which is to the prophets and the messengers.So all those ordinary occurrences and habits which Allah manifests through the Auliya&#8217; in terms of various knowledges, spiritual experiences, powers, influences, and those that are mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an like in surah al kahf the people of the cave and also regarding former communities and about the initial period of the sahaabah and the successors of this ummah and also those that all exist in this ummah till today and will continue to remain till the Day of Judgement. Allah makes them manifest on the hands of the friends of Allah. The happenings of the karaamaat, the charisma through the followers guidance of Allah&#8217;s messenger is true and these karaamaat as we said is an unusual event which Allah manifests through one of His auliya&#8217; for supporting a mundane or a spiritual matter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the difference between karaamaat and miracles, miracles mean mujizat implies that miracles is the claim of prophethood and messengership but karaamaat does not imply this.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And there are a number of points of wisdom and aims in the manifestation of karaamaat and the important among these are as follows:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>(1)</strong> They are like miracles which prove the perfection of the power of Allah and the dominance of His will. They are like miracles in the sense that whatever Allah wills, He is the Greatest performer of it. Allah has an addition to this methods and known causes other methods also which are beyond the access of the human knowledge nor can the human sense organs their reason.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>The story of the people of the cave</strong> (ashabul kahf) is one of such evidences, including that sleep that Allah imposed upon them for a long time along with protecting their bodies from being disintegrated.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Another of these is the <strong>provision being given to Maryam</strong> (alaihassalam), the daughter of &#8216;Imran, in the arches on which zakariya had left astonished and said &#8220;where do you get it from these provisions?&#8221; She said &#8220;from Allah.&#8221;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And likewise the fact Maryam becoming pregnant and the <strong>birth of Jesus alayhis salaam without a father</strong>.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And<strong> talking by Jesus while still in cradle </strong>and this did not occur only with Jesus, meaning there are those who spoke in the cradle other than Jesus as authentically reported in Bukhari and Muslim from the hadith of Abu Huraira (radhiyallaahu anhu) from the prophet (ﷺ) who said that three ones are only who spoke in the cradle, three only, Jesus is one of them.<br /><br />The second one: There was a man amongst the children of Israeel, his name was <strong>Jurayj</strong>, this man was praying one time and his mother came and called upon him, she needed something from him. So he talked to himself “shall I respond or shall I continue the prayers?” So she invoked and said “O Allah! don&#8217;t make him die until he sees the faces of the woman who solicits sex. And while he was in his place of worship a woman came and she talked to him into illegal sexual intercourse and he refused. So she went to a shepherd and asked him for the same thing and she seduced him into that.  She gave birth to a child and she went to say that this is the  child of Jurayj, so the people came to him and broke the door of his place of worship and brought him down, insulted him. So he went to make ablution and prayed to Allah concerning this child from this prostitute.  So He came to the child and talked to the child and said “Who is your father?” The child spoke in the cradle and said “the shepherd”. So everyone was amazed and astonished and they came apologised and said &#8220;we will build your place of worship from gold&#8221; He said &#8220;no, just build it from mud.&#8221;<br /><br />And the third one: one woman was suckling her child and this took place <strong>a woman from children of Israeel</strong>, a man who was on his mount passed by.  So she liked that man and said “O Allah! make my son like him this”, the child left her breast and directed himself towards the rider and said “O Allah! don&#8217;t make me like him” and then he came back to suckle. And Abu Huraira said: while the prophet was reciting the hadeeth to them as if I remember looking at the prophet ﷺ suckling his finger. Then a slave-girl passed by the woman and then she said “O Allah! don&#8217;t make my son like her” he left her breast and said “O Allah! make me like her”  So she talked to her child “why?” and he said that rider was a tyrant from the tyrants and this girl they say that she was a thief, stole certain things and that she committed adultery while she was innocent.<br /><br />So this hadeeth tells us of some of these karaamaat and from this we know that three spoke in the cradle Eesa (alayhis salaam), the child who spoke to Jurayj and this child of this woman from the children of Israeel.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Also from this is the story of the man in surah Al Baqarah whom Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) made him die for a hundred years then resurrected him.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And the story of the three who from the children of Israeel who went to a cave and a huge rock came and blocked the entrance of the cave and they invoked Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) each by his own righteous deed and Allah made the rock move until they had a clearance to leave and save them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">And there are many other instances and that the karaamaat exist in this ummah until Day of resurrection because of it is belief and righteousness.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Now if anyone comes up with an extraordinary matter, transcends the norm this can not be a purification for this person that he is a friend of Allah until his actions refer to the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah and it becomes evident that he is a follower of the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah openly and outwardly manifesting his Worship of Allah in accordance to the Sunnah.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The friends of Allah are true and existing and they have merits as in the hadeeth of Sahih Bukhari: Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) says “<strong>whoever stand in enmity towards any of the auliya&#8217; then he is at war with Him (glorious and exalted be He)</strong>.”</p>



<p>The karaamaat of the auliya&#8217; are in fact the miracles of the prophets, for the auliya&#8217; receive these karaamaat by following the guidance of their prophets and acting accordingly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The karaamaat of the auliya&#8217;, and now we know the definition of auliya&#8217;, it is that glad tidings in which Allah has given them in the world itself. The Bushra which is called tidings means every such thing which proves their being protectors, supporters, friends and having good end in here and hereafter.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">As we said earlier the karaamaat still exists in the ummah and will be found until the Day of resurrection and observation is the best argument to prove it.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The philosophers have denied the karaamaat of the friends of Allah even as they have denied the miracles of the prophets.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The Mu&#8217;tazila sect and some of Ash&#8217;ari sects have also denied the occurrence of the karaamaat claiming these are like miracles but this is a false claim as we have mentioned that it does not imply a claim of Prophethood in no way.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">One must remain vigilant from the <strong>Dajjal</strong>, the false liars of these innovators and the deeds of the misguided people and satanic show of  extraordinary occurrences who call themselves <strong>sufi</strong>, such as entering into the fire, striking one&#8217;s body with weapons, catching hold of snakes and foretelling about the unseen and so forth.These are not karaamaat. The karaamaat are performed by the auliya&#8217; of Allah and these are not the auliya&#8217; of Allah but these are shayateen in the form of men.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">We ask Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَىٰ‎) to protect us from all false Creed and all innovations and to guide the ummah to follow the path of the prophet ﷺ and the righteous predecessors.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Karamat-ul-Awliya’</strong><br />The fourth question of Fatwa no. <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">9027 </span><br />The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><b></b><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Q 4:</b><b> Do the Awliya&#8217; (pious people) perform Karamahs (extraordinary events caused by Allah for or through a pious person)? </b>Can they change anything in the heavens or on earth? Do they intercede with Allah for others while they are in Barzakh (period between death and the Resurrection) or not?</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b><b>Karamah </b>is an extraordinary event which Allah (Exalted be He) bestows on a pious person as an honor to protect him against harm, benefit him, or help him defend people&#8217;s rights. </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">But a pious person cannot perform these events whenever he wishes just as the prophet could not perform miracles by himself whenever he wished. It is Allah Alone Who helps them to do all these things. </span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-`Ankabut, 29: 50" target="_blank" name="Andtheysay:Whyarenotsigns"></a>And they say: &#8220;Why are not signs sent down to him from his Lord? Say: &#8220;The signs are only with Allâh, and I am only a plain warner.&#8221;</span></strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">Also pious people are not empowered with any superiority to change things in the heavens or on earth except for what Allah enables them just like all other humans. They can make changes in things like farming, building, trading, and such works which ordinary humans do&nbsp;</span><span class="HarfBody">with Allah&#8217;s Will. In Barzakh, pious people cannot intercede for anyone whether alive or dead, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say: “To Allâh belongs all intercession.&#8221;</span></strong></span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Allah also says: </span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody"><strong><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Zukhruf, 43: 86" target="_blank" name="Andthosewhomtheyinvokeinstead"></a><span style="color:#000000;">And those whom they invoke instead of Him have no power of intercession &#8211; except for those who bear witness to the truth knowingly (i.e. believed in the Oneness of Allâh, and obeyed His Orders), and they know (the facts about the Oneness of Allâh).</span></strong></span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Moreover, He says: </span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission</span></strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">Whoever believes that pious people govern the universe or that they know the Ghayb (Unseen), is a Kafir (disbeliever), as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">To Allâh belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is therein, and He is Able to do all things.</span></strong></span></p>



<p><span class="HarfBody">Also Allah (Glorified be He) says:</span></p>



<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-Naml, 27: 65" target="_blank" name="Say:Noneintheheavensandthe"></a>Say: “None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (Unseen) except Allâh”</span></strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Glorified be He) removes all ambiguity whatsoever and declares the truth in a clear-cut manner when addressing the Prophet (peace be upon him):&nbsp;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q1: In this country, car insurance is mandatory by law. If a one has a car accident, is it permissible to submit a claim for the car repairs on the insurance?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If it is compulsory and a person has no choice, they should not take more than what they paid because this is a form of gambling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if a person pays ten thousands to an insurance company, they should only take ten thousands only and if they pay four thousands, they should take four thousands only; for it is not permissible to accept any profit. If one receives an additional amount it should given it in charity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: An employee works at a company surrounded by more than three Masjids (mosques). He always offers Salah (Prayer) at the Masjid, but his colleagues offer it in the company. They urge him to join them rather than go to the Masjid. Some Muslim brothers advised him to offer Salah with them to preach and deliver lessons after offering Salah and also lead them in Salah, as he is the most knowledgeable of Sunnah, although one of their colleagues has memorized a greater portion of the Qur&#8217;an than him. Should he listen to them or continue to offer Salah at the Masjid, paying no attention to what they say?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The employees in this company should offer Salah in any of the nearby Masjids like their colleague, as he is the one doing the right thing by offering Salah at the Masjid, for the Sahih Hadiths (authentic Hadiths) reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) denote the obligation of offering Salah in congregation in the Masjid with regard to men. Accordingly, it is not permissible to miss congregational Salah in the Masjid except for a Shar&#8217;y (Islamically lawful) excuse.</p>

<p>–</p>
<p>Allaah, Ta’aala, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">أُحِلَّ لَكُمْ لَيْلَةَ الصِّيَامِ الرَّفَثُ إِلَى نِسَائِكُمْ هُنَّ لِبَاس ٌ لَكُمْ وَأَنْتُمْ لِبَاس ٌ لَهُنَّ عَلِمَاللَّهُ أَنَّكُمْ كُنتُمْ تَخْتَانُونَ أَنفُسَكُمْ فَتَابَ عَلَيْكُمْ وَعَفَا عَنْكُمْ فَالآنَ بَاشِرُوهُنَّ وَابْتَغُوا مَا كَتَبَ اللَّهُ لَكُمْ وَكُلُوا وَاشْرَبُوا حَتَّى يَتَبَيَّنَ لَكُمُ الْخَيْطُ الأَبْيَضُ مِنَ الْخَيْطِ الأَسْوَدِ مِنَ الْفَجْرِ ثُمَّ أَتِمُّوا الصِّيَامَ إِلَى اللَّيْلِ وَلاَ تُبَاشِرُوهُنَّ وَأَنْتُمْ عَاكِفُونَ فِيالْمَسَاجِدِ تِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ فَلاَ تَقْرَبُوهَا كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللَّهُ آيَاتِه ِ لِلنَّاسِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَّقُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is made lawful for you to have sexual relations with your wives on the night of As-Saum (the fasts). They are body covering for you and you are the same for them. Allaah knows that you used to deceive yourselves, so He turned to you (accepted your repentance) and forgave you. So now have sexual relations with them and seek that which Allaah has ordained for you (offspring), and <strong>eat and drink until the white thread (light) of dawn appears to you distinct from the black thread (darkness of night)</strong>, then complete your Saum (fast) till the nightfall. And do not have sexual relations with them (your wives) while you are in I’tikaaf in the mosques. These are the limits (set) by Allaah, so approach them not. Thus does Allaah make clear His Ayaat to mankind that they may become Al-Muttaqun.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Al-Baqarah, ayah 187)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>How to fight the Eastern and Western cultural invasion [1]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the gravest danger that Muslim societies are facing nowadays is the so-called cultural invasion with its different weapons, including all media means, printed and broadcast alike. Invaders have realized in the modern age that the old ways have become ineffective. Nations fight courageously to defend their religion, homelands and their heritage. Usurping by violence and terrorism is an inherently refused concept, especially in modern times after the spread of awareness among the people. The world has become like a small village and many organizations were established to defend the rights of nations, refuse political invasion, and claim the right to self-determination. Every nation has the right to have sovereignty over its own territory, invest its resources, and rule its territories according to its own standards. Nations also adopt different beliefs, creeds and ruling systems, which made invaders leave these countries after fierce, bloody wars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, before leaving those countries, the invaders thought of many ways and prepared many plots based on thorough investigation, full awareness of the aims and effectiveness of those plans, and the ways that should be followed to accomplish them. Their aims revolved around designing highly deceiving curriculums of weak ties with religion, focusing on spreading their culture and instilling in the souls of most of the people the admiration of their material achievements in different aspects of life. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When people, especially teenagers and young students, are impressed by this superficial brilliant achievements and inventions in the world, some of them who are totally impressed choose to complete their education in European and American universities</strong></span>. There they are surrounded with doubts and sorts of lusts systematically presented by orientalists and atheists, using well-organized, perverted, cunning schemes, where they face the Western lifestyle with all its corruption, dissolution and obscenity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rarely does a person remain safe from these weapons, being accompanied with enticement and lack of religion or authority. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>After completing their study and returning to their countries, those people assume important posts and become agents for the colonialists and apply their demands and implement their plots precisely, even with harsher means than those used by the colonialists themselves</strong></span>. This has taken place, indeed, in many countries that were occupied by invaders. The way to safety from this danger lies in establishing universities and institutes in different specializations, in order to limit the missions abroad and teach all forms of knowledge in all universities and institutes. This should be accompanied with paying attention to Islamic subjects and culture, in order to keep the `Aqidah (creed) of the students intact, and protect their morals and future, so that they take part in building their society on a Shari`ah (Islamic law) basis and according to the needs of the Islamic Ummah (nation). We should restrict educational missions abroad to certain forms of knowledge that are not available at home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah guide us to all what benefits the people and the countries, and protects the Muslims against anything that might harm them in their `Aqidah and morals. He is the Most Generous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, <strong>we need to take more care of curricula, add a perfect Islamic touch to them, and establish more scientific institutions to help the people study at home instead of traveling abroad</strong>. <strong>We should also choose teachers and managers perfectly; all of them should be of good morals, sound `Aqidah, reputation, jealousy on Islam, power and honesty.</strong> Whoever enjoys these traits is guaranteed and will most probably do their best to explain information to the students in a correct way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if it is a necessity to send some students to learn abroad due to the lack of some professional institutions, especially in the field of industry, an objective committee should be formed to choose the most suitable students in terms of religion and morals and who are well-versed in Islamic culture and have an Islamic spirit. The committee can also choose a knowledgeable, righteous supervisor, who is active in practicing Da`wah (calling to Islam), to accompany the mission, practices Da`wah there, supervises and guides the students, and refutes any doubts they may come across.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They should be given even a short course before traveling to be aware of all the problems they might encounter abroad</strong>, and clarify the Shari`ah viewpoint and wisdom behind such issues according to the Qur&#8217;an, the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet), and the opinions of scholars. This includes, for instance, the rulings on slavery, polygyny in general, polygyny of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in particular, Talaq (divorce pronounced by a husband), the wisdom behind both offensive and defensive Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah), and such doubts that are mentioned by the enemies of Allah to Muslim youths, so that they would be fully ready to refute any such issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for facing the invasion of print and broadcast media, which have afflicted the Muslim Ummah in the modern age and have come to occupy most of the time of Muslims in spite of the deadly poison and the misleading promotion they usually contain, it is one of the most important tasks to protect Islam and the Islamic culture from its evil plotting. We should make sure that the Du`ah (callers to Islam) dedicate themselves to writing useful researches, periodicals and articles; practicing Da`wah, replying to different forms of cultural invasion and exposing their falsehood. The enemies have dedicated all their resources and potentials, founded many organizations and applied different means to deceive Muslims. Their misconceptions should be refuted and Islamic `Aqidah, legislation, rulings and morals should be clarified and explained in a nice, attractive way using suitable modern ways; wisdom and good discourse of preaching, arguing in a gentle way via all mass media as much as possible. Islam is the perfect religion that encompasses all goodness, guarantees happiness to all people, good progress, sound development, peace, security, prosperous life and winning in this world and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims are afflicted by all this as they do not stick to their religion as they should have, with most of the people not understanding its reality, because of being not interested; ignorant of it; negligent of many scholars in clarifying its advantages, wisdoms and secrets; lack of honesty and patience in inviting others to it; and not bearing harm and using the modern ways. Thus, discrepancy took place. Most of the people have become ignorant of the Islamic rulings. They have become deluded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that the last generation of this Ummah will not succeed except with what brought success to the first generation &#8211; that is, to follow the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) to these idolaters (pagan Arabs) of your folk:] </strong><strong>Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord (the Qur’ân and Prophet Muhammad’s Sunnah), and follow not any Auliyâ’ (protectors and helpers who order you to associate partners in worship with Allâh), besides Him (Allâh). Little do you remember! </strong>[Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And verily, this </strong>(i.e. Allâh’s Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses 151 and 152)<strong> is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqûn </strong>(the pious &#8211; see V.2:2)<strong>.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>And this is a blessed Book (the Qur’ân) which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allâh (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you may receive mercy (i.e. be saved from the torment of Hell). </strong>[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), Who is the Most Truthful, has promised us a great victory and successful outcome in return for this in His Statement: &#8230;and<strong> (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them). </strong>[Surah Al­Rum, 30: 47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaqûn [the pious &#8211; See V.2:2], not the least harm will their cunning do to you. Surely, Allâh surrounds all that they do. </strong>[Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 120]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieves after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).</strong>[Surah Al-Nur, 24: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm</strong>.[Surah Muhammad, 47: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) in this regard. When the Salaf (righteous predecessors) applied these noble Ayahs, whether in words, actions, or beliefs, Allah granted them victory over their enemies, made them rulers of the world, spread justice through them, and made them leaders of the Ummah and Imams of guidance. When the latter generations faltered in this (Allah&#8217;s Orders) their conditions declined, according to Allah&#8217;s Statement: <strong>Verily, Allâh will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allâh).</strong>[Surah Al-Ra`d, 13: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah make the Muslims, whether people or governments, return to their faith in a proper way; grant them comprehension of it, cause them to apply it, make them unanimous on Al-Haqq (the Truth), guide them to cooperation in righteousness and piety, and enjoining each other to Al-Haqq and persevering upon it. He is the All-Hearing, Ever Near. May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwas of the Permanent Committee&gt;Group 2&gt;Volume 2: `Aqidah&gt;The Sects&gt;Ahmad Deedat&#8217;s &#8220;Al-Qur&#8217;an the Miracle of Miracles&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 19040</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Ahmad Deedat said in his book &#8220;Al-Qur&#8217;an the Miracle of Miracles&#8221; that Qur&#8217;an includes many references to the number 19 and its multiplications. He gave many examples and here are some of them: </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The word &#8220;اسم&#8221; (name) is mentioned 19 times in the Qur&#8217;an. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The word &#8220;الله&#8221; (Allah) is mentioned 2698 (19 x 142) times in the Qur&#8217;an. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The word &#8220;الرحيم&#8221; (The Most Merciful) is mentioned 114 (19 x 6) times in the Qur&#8217;an. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The letter &#8220;ن&#8221; (Nun) is mentioned 133 (19 x 7) times in Surah Al-Qalam. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">He also made reference to the study conducted by Dr. Rashad Khalifah in his book &#8220;Al-Qur`an Taqdim Mar&#8217;y li-Mu`jizah&#8221;. Here are some examples of the points he raised: </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The first Qur&#8217;anic revelation is composed of 19 words which include 76 (19 x 4) letters. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">&#8211; The first Surah (Qur&#8217;anic chapter) revealed in the Qur&#8217;an includes 19 Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and 285 (19 x 15) letters, etc. </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Please give us your Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) in this regard. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This study is among the fabricated falsities of a sect called Al-Batiniyyah Al-Baha&#8217;iyyah. It is based on glorifying the number 19. There is no doubt that this study is false, as it involves manipulating the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and distracting people from pondering  its true meanings.</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li style="text-align:justify;">This malicious group holds many false beliefs such as some of its leaders claiming prophethood.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">Its followers believe in <strong>Hulul</strong> (a Sufi term meaning indwelling) and <strong>Ittihad</strong> (a Sufi claim of union with Allah), </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">deem Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah) to be unlawful and </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">call for the unification of religions plus many other things.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span style="line-height:1.5;">So, it is the duty of Muslims to beware of falling into this evil group and of being affected by its ideas or books. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">We ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to save us from their plotting and to protect Muslims from their evils, for He is All-Powerful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 5: Is it permissible for a Muslim who believes in one God to participate in the wedding ceremonies of Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), and help them arrange such ceremonies on account of a blood or marriage relationship, or the like? Also, is it permissible to attend their funerals, without praying for their dead, and the burial? Is it permissible to sit and commiserate with them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ans:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is not permissible to share in their occasions, which involve Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) or Bid`ah (innovation in Islam). </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Moreover, it is not permissible to follow their funeral processions; because this is a type of forbidden association with them.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 17727</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some Arab newspapers and magazines dedicate pages to the horoscope, talking about zodiac signs such as Aries, Taurus, Gemini and others. They claim that people born under these signs will probably be moody because the zodiac conflicts a lot during this period. There are many things written in these pages, a copy of which is attached to the message and many Muslim youth read them. Please clarify the Islamic ruling on zodiac signs and your advice to Muslims and to those responsible for the magazines.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is considered the same as <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>divination</strong> </span>used by fortune-tellers to inform people if they will be happy or miserable and if they should be optimistic or pessimistic. This is a prohibited idea dating back to the days of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance). It is not permissible to practice, follow or spread these ideas. It is even more misleading and misguiding to Muslims to spread such ideas in newspapers, as they involve claiming to know Ghayb (the Unseen), which is the sole Right of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Who says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say</strong>: &#8220;<strong>None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (Unseen) except Allâh, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected</strong>.&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Naml, 27: 65]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.&#8221; </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 59]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah even denied that His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) knew the Ghayb. <span style="line-height:1.5;">Allah says, </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="line-height:1.5;">&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): </span>I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allâh, nor (that) I know the Unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me.</strong>&#8221; <strong>Say</strong>: &#8220;<strong>Are the blind and the one who sees equal? Will you not then take thought?</strong>&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 50]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And I do not say to you that with me are the Treasures of Allâh, nor that I know the Ghaib (Unseen), nor do I say I am an angel, and I do not say of those whom your eyes look down upon that Allâh will not bestow any good on them. Allâh knows what is in their inner-selves (as regards belief, etc.). In that case, I should, indeed be one of the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers, oppressors).&#8221;</strong> <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Hud, 11: 31]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Anyone who acquires a branch of the knowledge of astrology has acquired a branch of magic (of which they acquire more as long as) they continue to do so.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and Hadiths in this regard. Muslim scholars unanimously agree on this well-established ruling prohibiting astrology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Thus, it is the duty of every Muslim seeking the best for themselves and their religion to avoid this form of manipulating people&#8217;s minds and beliefs, to fear Allah regarding themselves and their nation and not to spread misleading ideas among Muslims</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>On the other hand, Muslim rulers (may Allah grant them success) should prevent this practice and punish those who spread it according to the Islamic prescribed punishment.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

Therefore, it is not legally permitted to say that this act of worship is permissible with regard to its origin, number, manner or place without legal evidence for saying so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not know any Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) where he did this, either from his sayings, doings or what gains his consent. All blessings are in following his guidance. The guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is established with authentic proofs that denote what he (peace be upon him) did after Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer). The successors, the Companions of the Prophet and those who followed them in righteousness followed his example in this regard. Whoever innovates anything other than the guidance of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), his acts will be rejected. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He who did any act for which there is no sanction from our behalf, that is to be rejected</strong></span>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imam who makes Du`a&#8217; (supplication to Allah) after Taslim and the followers pronounce Ta&#8217;min (saying: &#8220;Amin&#8221;) after his Du`a&#8217; should be asked to bring evidence that proves his deeds. Otherwise, his acts will be rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we will give an outline about the guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him) after Taslim. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) pronounced Taslim, he used to ask Allah for forgiveness three times and say: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Allah, You are the Grantor of security, and security comes from You. You are Blessing, O You Who have majesty and nobility)!&#8221; </strong>[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awza`y was asked about the manner of the Prophet&#8217;s asking for forgiveness. He answered: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">He said: &#8216;I seek the forgiveness of Allah. I seek the forgiveness of Allah</span></strong>.'&#8221; This is the narration of Muslim, Al-Tirmidhy and Al-Nasa&#8217;y. But Al-Nasa&#8217;y said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to say that upon finishing his prayer, and then mentioned the Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration reported by Abu Dawud: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>After finishing his prayer, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) used to ask Allah for forgiveness three times and say: O Allah! You are Peace</strong></span>.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration reported by Abu Dawud and Al-Nasa&#8217;y on the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<strong>When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) pronounced salutation, he used to say: O Allah: You are peace, and peace comes from You, blessed are You, Possessor of Glory and Honor</strong>.&#8221;[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari and Muslim reported on the authority of Warrad the scriber of the servant of Al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah that he said that Al-Mughirah ibn Shu`bah dictated to me a letter to Mu`awiyah that When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) finished the prayer and pronounced salutation he uttered (this supplication): <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah. He is alone, Who has no partner. To Him belongs the sovereignty and to Him praise is due and He is Potent over everything. O Allah! No one can withhold what You give, or give what You withhold, and the riches cannot avail a wealthy person with You. </strong>[5]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim reported in his Sahih on the authority of `Abdullah ibn Al-Zubayr (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: He used to say at the end of every prayer after pronouncing salutation (these words): <strong><span style="color:#000000;">There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah. He is alone. There is no partner with Him. Sovereignty belongs to Him and He is Potent over everything. There is no might or power except with Allah. There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah and we do not worship but Him alone. To Him belong all bounties, to Him belongs all Grace, and to Him is worthy praise accorded. There is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah, to Whom we are sincere in devotion, even though the unbelievers should disapprove it</span></strong>. <strong>He added: The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to say so after pronouncing salutation at the end of every prayer. </strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration reported also by Muslim the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">He who recites after every prayer: Subhan-Allah (Allah is free from imperfection) thirty-three times; Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah) thirty-three times; Allahu Akbar (Allah is Greatest) thirty-three times; and completes a hundred with: La ilaha illallahu, wahdahu la sharika lahu, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu, wa Huwa `ala kulli shai&#8217;in Qadir (there is no true god except Allah. He is One and He has no partner with Him. His is the sovereignty and His is the praise, and He is Omnipotent), will have all his sins pardoned even if they may be as the foam on the surface of the sea</span></strong>.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who wants to know more supplications should read supplications in the comprehensive books like Jami` Al-&#8216;Ousoul, Majm` Al-Zawa&#8217;d, Al-Matalib Al-`Aliyah Bi Zawa&#8217;d Al-Masanid Al-Thamaniyah and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Among the qualifications necessary for a Da`y is that he should have patience, kindness, and gentleness with forbearing temperament as the prophets (peace be upon them) were.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never should a Da`y be rushing, violent, or unduly strict. Rather, he has to be patient, forbearing and kind while practicing Da`wah. To this effect, we have stated some evidence earlier. For example, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: And by the Mercy of Allâh, you dealt with them gently. In the story of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allâh).&#8221;</strong> [Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allah, whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is hard upon them, be hard upon him, and whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is kind to them, be kind to him.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Muslim, Sahih, Book on rulership, no. 1828; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 6, p. 93.]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">So, it is obligatory for you, slaves of Allah, to be kind in your Da`wah, and not to be harsh with people. Do not make people turn away from Islam because of your harshness, ignorance or violent, harmful approach. It is thus obligatory for you to be forbearing, gentle, pleasant and lenient in speech so that your words may have an effect on the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect on one toward whom your Da`wah is directed. As such, people will receive your Da`wah better, will be affected by it and will show appreciation. On the contrary, harshness causes disaffection, alienation, and division, not unity.</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The first question of Fatwa no. 7425</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: There is a card which facilitates financial transactions in Western countries, as it helps a person to do without carrying cash with them. A person can purchase any goods they want with this card, then at the end of each month they receive a bill with the sum of money they have to pay for what they bought using this card, and they pay the full amount without any increase. This process protects one&#8217;s money from being stolen. But there is a condition for receiving this card. Depending on the terms of the card, one may pay interest charges for every day of delay on the amount that they do not pay within twenty five days. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible to deal with this card taking into account that a person can avoid dealing with Riba (usury/interest) if they pay the bill during the twenty five days grace period?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If the reality is as you have mentioned, then such dealing is not permissible <strong>as this contract contains Riba (usury/interest)</strong> because you stipulate paying Riba in case of delaying payment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: It is known that many people are pessimistic about the month of Safar regarding many affairs. Such people, for example, do not conclude <strong>marriage contracts</strong> during Safar. Moreover, many people believe that it is not permissible to <strong>break a stick, knot ropes, or entwine fingers</strong> when concluding a marriage contract for this leads to failure of the concerned marriage and disharmony between the spouses. Since all the foregoing are beliefs bearing on ‘Aqidah (creed), could you please advise and clarify the ruling on it? May Allah guide us all to all that He loves and is pleased with.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Pessimism about Safar is not permissible. It is a characteristic of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance)</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safar &#8211; just like all other months &#8211; does not bring good or evil, as good is only from Allah (Glorified be He) and evil is predestined by Him. Moreover, it is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) annulled the concept of pessimism when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is no ‘Adwa (contagion, disease transmission naturally by itself not by the Decree of Allah), nor is there any Tiyarah (evil omen), nor is there any Hamah (pre-Islamic superstitious belief that the bones of a dead person turn into an owl), nor is there Safar (the month of Safar was believed to bring bad luck during Jahiliyyah).</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same applies to pessimism about entwining fingers, breaking a stick, etc., when concluding a marriage contract. Such beliefs are false, baseless, and thus they should not be adopted by a Muslim. May Allah grant us all success!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on some people who sway from right to left and backwards and forwards while reciting the Qur&#8217;an? Please advise, may Allah reward you.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Swaying while reciting the Qur&#8217;an is one of the habits that should be abandoned. It contradicts the etiquettes required when reciting the Qur&#8217;an. When reciting or listening to the Qur&#8217;an, a person should listen carefully and not play with things so that the listener and the reciter ponder over the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an and their hearts be submissive to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Scholars mentioned that this is one of the habits of the Jews when reciting their Book, and we are forbidden to imitate them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: <span style="color:#993300;">Does performing ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) during the months of Hajj have any particular virtue different from performing it in other months?  </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The best month to perform ‘Umrah is during Ramadan, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Umrah (performed) in Ramadan is equal to Hajj (in reward). <span style="color:#808080;">[1]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Agreed upon its authenticity by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another narration by Al-Bukhari:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is equivalent to performing Hajj with me.<span style="color:#808080;"> [2]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the narration by Muslim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is equivalent to Hajj or Hajj performed with me (in reward). <span style="color:#808080;">[3]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that it is equivalent to Hajj or (indicative of uncertainty on the part of the Hadith narrator) equivalent to Hajj performed with the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, comes the <strong>‘Umrah in Dhul-Qa‘dah</strong>, for all the ‘Umrahs which the Prophet (peace be upon him) performed took place in Dhul-Qa‘dah. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow <span style="color:#808080;"> [4]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>May Allah grant us success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Treatment with Hijamah versus medical denial</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Useful note</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Treatment with Hijamah (cupping) and doctors&#8217; denial of its effectiveness:</strong> Hijamah has great effect on health. It is stated in the Hadith of Isra&#8217; (Night Journey): <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>Whenever the Prophet (peace be upon him) passed by a host of angels they would instruct him to command his Ummah (the Muslim nation) to use Hijamah&#8221;</strong></span>. There are waste products that remain in the blood from substances circulated and secreted throughout the body. Unless such waste products are gradually cleared little by little, they would cause great harm to people risking their lives. Since the human body continuously produces substances that are surplus to its requirements, Hijamah has been introduced. Yet, doctors see it ineffective, and this is not strange, for they lack great deal of knowledge about many matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is fair to give each person their right, and doctors should be given their due rights relating to their profession. Yet treatment of diseases is beyond comprehension and restriction, and doctors are not experienced in a lot of methods outside their area of specialization. Allah (Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little</strong></span>. (Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, 17: 85) Doctors often deny particular matters prescribed by Shari`ah (Islamic law) due to their great ignorance of their effectiveness. This is because many of them are westernized, have studied under western teachers, or they mainly derive their knowledge from western sources of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their denial of many of the matters prescribed by Shari`ah is not, however, based on scientific principles, but rather a blind pursuance of those who deny prophethood and imperceptible matters such as existence of Jinn (creatures created from fire) and the effect of the envious eye. For instance, they diagnose possession by Jinn as nervous disorders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Issued by His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al Al-Shaykh, may Allah be merciful to him]</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Q: It is known that the scholars disagree as to whether it is obligatory to pay Zakah (obligatory charity) on jewelry that is worn, intended to be worn, or borrowed.What is Your Eminence’s opinion on this issue? Supposing that it is obligatory to pay Zakah on them, is there a Nisab (the minimum amount on which Zakah is due) for this? If there is a Nisab, it seems from the Hadith that indicate the obligation of giving Zakah on jewelry &#8211; where the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) warned against the punishment of Fire awaiting those who do not pay the Zakah &#8211; that there is no Nisab. How is this resolved? [1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is a famous controversy among the scholars as to whether it is obligatory to pay Zakah on gold and silver jewelry that is worn, intended to be worn, or borrowed. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The preponderant opinion is that it is obligatory, according to the general evidence on the obligation of Zakah on gold and silver</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also authentically reported that `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: <span style="color:#008000;">A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) with her daughter, on whose hand were two heavy bangles of gold. He (peace be upon him) asked, “Do you pay Zakah on these?” She said, “No.” He (peace be upon him) said, “Would it please you if Allah were to encircle you on the Day of Resurrection with two bracelets of Fire because of them?” She threw them down and said, &#8220;They are (I have given them away) for the sake of Allah and His Messenger.&#8221;</span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also authentically <span style="color:#008000;">reported from Um Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was wearing some gold ornaments, so she asked, “O Messenger of Allah! Is this Kanz (hoarded wealth, the Zakah of which has not been paid)?” He (peace be upon him) said, “Anything that reaches the amount at which Zakah is payable and its Zakah is paid is not considered Kanz.”</span> [3] The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not tell her that there is no Zakah on jewelry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these Hadith refer to jewelry that reach the Nisab, when they are combined with other evidence, as Hadith explain one another just as Qur’anic Ayahs (verses) explain one another, and also Hadith explain Ayahs and make their generality specific and their absoluteness limited, because all of them are revelation from Allah (Glorified be He). Whatever comes from Allah is not contradictory; in fact they confirm and explain one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is necessary that a Hawl (one lunar year calculated from the time a property reaches the minimum amount upon which Zakah is due) must be completed (on jewelry) as is the case with other categories of Zakah wealth, such as money, commercial commodities, and livestock. May Allah grant us success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa : 19665</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q : Should the <strong>Hawl</strong> (<span style="color:#808080;">one lunar year calculated from the time a property reaches the minimum amount upon which Zakah is due</span>) for the Zakah (obligatory charity) on money and commercial commodities be considered according to the Hijri (lunar) year or the Gregorian solar year, as there is a <strong>difference of 11 days</strong> between both? Ifthe calculation of Zakah is made according to the Hijri year, what is the solution for organizations that issue their budgets and calculate their Zakah according to the solar year. Is it permissible to delay paying the due Zakah on commercial commodities beyond the Hijri year, as several contracting organizations delay the issuance of budgets six months after the passing of the year of Zakah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A : <strong>Zakah is due on property after the passing of 12 months according to the Hijri calendar</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage</span>. [Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 189]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is impermissible to delay the payment of Zakah beyond the fixed time unless a legal excuse preventing the payment is verified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8230;pay the due thereof (its Zakât, according to Allâh’s Orders 1/10th or 1/20th) on the day of its harvest</span> [Surah Al-An`am, 6: 141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8230;and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât</span>.[Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This command indicates immediate response.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Ruling on paying Zakah for building Masjids</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on paying Zakah (obligatory charity) money for helping to build a Masjid (mosque) whose construction was halted due to lack of financial resources?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A: </b>According to the opinion of the majority of Muslim scholars and the Ijma` (consensus) of our Salaf (righteous predecessors), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Zakah is not to be paid for constructing Masjids, buying books, etc</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, Zakah must be spent on the eight categories which are mentioned in the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) of Surah Al-Tawbah, i.e. the poor, the needy, those employed to collect (the funds), to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islâm), to free captives, for those in debt, in the cause of Allah, and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is worth mentioning that scholars are of the view that the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>category of &#8220;in the cause of Allah&#8221; refers only to Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah)</strong></span> and this does not include constructing Masjids, schools, roads, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Please advise me by giving me a Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) as to whether it is permissible to pay Zakah (obligatory charity) outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the known categories of Zakah recipients, in the same way as it is done inside the Kingdom. We appreciate your assistance and may Allah protect you. Wa‘alaykum as-salam warahmatullah wabarakatuh (And may Allah’s Peace and Blessings be upon you!)</p>
<p><strong>A question asked to His Eminence. He replied on 3/9/1410 A.H.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for the Zakah payer to send Zakah to a country other than where they are living, <strong>if this is for a Shar‘y (Islamically lawful) benefit</strong>, according to the more correct of the two opinions held by the scholars, <strong>such as </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">sending it to the Mujahidun (strivers/fighters in the Cause of Allah),</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">to the poor who are in greater need than those in their country, or</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">for being their relatives, as this combines maintaining the ties of kinship and Zakah.</li>
</ul>
<p>May Allah guide everyone to that which pleases Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">A lecture entitled, &#8220;<strong>Zakah: Its status in Islam</strong>&#8220;, which His Eminence gave in<br />
Al-Jami Al-Kabir, Riyadh<b><br />
</b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all creation. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon His Slave, Messenger, Khalil (beloved, close elect) and truthful conveyer of the Divine Revelation, our Prophet, Imam and Master Muhammad ibn `Abdullah, his family, and Companions and whosoever follows his example and seeks his guidance until the Day of Resurrection. To continue:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The topic of the lecture as the presenter said is (<strong>Status of Zakah in Islam</strong>). Every Muslim individual who possesses the least knowledge of Islam knows that Zakah, being the third pillar of Islam, holds a great status in Islam. Zakah has been mentioned in connection with Salah (Prayer) in many places of the Qur&#8217;an. The Prophet (peace be upon him) also mentioned Zakah next to Salah in numerous Hadiths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât and bow down (or submit yourselves with obedience to Allâh) along with those who bow down (in prayer)&#8221;  </strong>[</span>Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 43]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;And perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) that you may receive mercy (from Allâh)&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#000000;">[</span><span style="color:#000000;">Surah Al-Nur, 24: 56]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another place, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;But if they repent, perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât) and give Zakât, then they are your brethren in religion&#8221; </strong>[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 11]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In yet another place, Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allâh, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât) and give Zakât, and that is the right religion&#8221; </strong></span>[Surah Al-Bayyinah, 98: 5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e., Al-Bukhari and Muslim) on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdullah ibn `Umar ibn Al-Khattab</span>(may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version, the Hadith reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Islam was based on five pillars: worshipping Allah Alone and disbelieving that there is any other Gods, performing Salah (Prayers), giving Zakah&#8230;</strong></span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Chapter on Islam is founded on five (fundaments), no. 16]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates the great position which Zakah holds in Islam. It is mentioned next to Salah both in the Qur&#8217;an and Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Salah is considered the cornerstone of Islam and the second greatest pillar next to only the Shahadah (testimony of faith).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says regarding Salah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 238" target="_blank" name="Guardstrictly(fiveobligatory)" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salawât (the prayers) especially the middle Salât (i.e. the best prayer &#8211; ‘Asr ).

</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is also reported to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#000000;">That which differentiates us from the disbelievers and hypocrites is our performance of Salah. He who abandons it, becomes a disbeliever. </span></span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) is reported to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">What makes one a disbeliever and a polytheist is abandoning prayers.</span></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on calling one who neglects Salah a disbeliever, no. 82]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Zakah is the sister pillar of Salah</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salah is a physical act of worship in which the Muslim stands before Allah supplicating to Him, mentioning His Name and reciting Ayahs of the Qur&#8217;an. It has such a great effect on hearts. If performed properly, Salah will restrain one from committing indecent acts and will serve as a means to attaining happiness, safety and salvation. It will also set their heart aright and bless their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day the Prophet (peace be upon him) was speaking to his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) about Salah and he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Whoever observes it regularly, it will be a source of light, authoritative proof and a means of salvation on the Day of Resurrection, and whoever does not observe it regularly, it will not be a source of light, authoritative proof and a means of salvation and on the Day of Resurrection he will join the company of Fir`aun (Pharaoh), Haman, Qarun (Korah), and Ubay ibn Khalaf.</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Section on the Hadiths narrated by the Companions who narrated a large number of Hadiths, Section on the Hadiths narrated by `Abdullah ibn `Amar ibn Al-`As, no. 6540.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Imam Ahmad and others with a good Sanad (chain of narrators).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Commenting on the above Hadith, some scholars said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;On the Day of Resurrection one who abandons Salah will join the company of Pharaoh, Haman Qarun, and Ubayy ibn Khalaf on account of his imitating them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The reason is that if he abandons it for the sake of holding a prestigious position, he will be behaving like<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Fir`aun (Pharaoh) </span>who, being an enemy to Musa (Moses, peace be upon him), transgressed and behaved arrogantly taking advantage of his royal position. T</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">he same is true with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Haman, </span>Pharaoh&#8217;s minister,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> </span>who, taking advantage of his position, behaved arrogantly and refused to follow Musa (Moses, peace be upon him).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">One who abandons it for the sake of collecting wealth will join the company of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Qarun (Korah) </span>who was addicted<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> </span>to the collection of wealth and lusting after his desires. He behaved arrogantly and disobeyed Prophet Musa. Thus, Allah caused the earth to swallow him up together with his dwelling. He was destined to enter Hellfire.<span style="line-height:1.5;">Those who behave after the manner of Qarun will enter Hellfire with him. We seek refuge in Allah from this. </span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">One who abandons Salah on account of being busy, conducting buying and selling transactions will be behaving after the manner of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="line-height:1.5;"> Ubay ibn Khalaf, </span><span style="line-height:1.5;">the Makkan merchant,</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="line-height:1.5;"> </span><span style="line-height:1.5;">and will thus join his company in Hellfire. We seek refuge in Allah.</span></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Zakah and Salah are equally important.</strong> Those who abstain from paying it on account of miserliness and greed for wealth will join the company of Allah&#8217;s enemy who preferred collecting wealth to showing obedience to Allah and His Messenger. It is reported that <a name="WhentheProphet(peacebeupon"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112839" class="tip"></span>when the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent Mu`adh to Yemen, he said: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Invite them to bear witness that there is no God but Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah. Should they accept your invitation, then tell them that Allah has prescribed upon them to offer five Prayers a day. Should they obey you, tell them that Allah has prescribed upon them to pay Zakah which is collected from the rich among them and given to the poor.&#8221;</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Section on Banu Hashim, the beginning of the Section on the Hadiths narrated by `Abdullah ibn `Abbas, no. 2072; Al-Bukhari, Book on Zakah, Chapter on taking Sadaqah from the rich and giving it to the poor&#8230;, no. 1496; and Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on calling people to the testimony of faith&#8230;, no. 19.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that Zakah was prescribed as an act of sympathy and kindness to the poor. It is an obligation due from one&#8217;s wealth which they are obliged to ensure its delivery to those who deserve it. This is based on the Hadith of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ibn `Umar </span>(may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> <a name="Ihavebeencommandedtofight"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112840" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#000000;">I have been commanded to fight against people until they testify that there is no God but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, perform the Prayer, and pay Zakah. If they do that, their blood and property are guaranteed protection on my behalf except when justified by law, and their affairs rest with Allah.</span></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Book on faith, Chapter on Allah&#8217;s Saying: &#8220;If they turn in repentance and establish the prayer&#8221;, no. 25; and Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on the command to fight people until they profess that there is no God but Allah, no. 22.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This and other similar Hadiths indicate the lawfulness to fight those whose miserliness makes them abstain from paying Zakah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>During Abu Bakr&#8217;s lifetime, war was waged against those who refused to pay Zakah.</strong></span> This is because the blood of a Muslim is protected against being shed only when they establish Salah and pay Zakah. That is why when some Arabs refrained from paying Zakah following the Prophet&#8217;s demise, the Sahabah engaged in fighting against them so that they could pay it off. After the Prophet&#8217;s demise, some Muslims apostatized from Islam. Some of them said that had Muhammad been truly a Prophet of Allah, he would not have passed away. They forgot the fact that all prophets preceding him had also passed away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some others refused to pay Zakah. At this point<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Bakr </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) delivered a sermon encouraging the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) to fight the apostates until they came back to Islam.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>argued with him saying: &#8220;How will you fight those who bear witness that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah?&#8221;<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Bakr </span>replied: &#8220;We have been commanded to fight against people until they testify that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they do that, their blood and property are guaranteed protection on our behalf except when justified by law.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr went on to say: &#8220;Is not Zakah one of Allah&#8217;s Rights? By Allah, I will keep fighting those who differentiate between Salah and Zakah. By Allah, if they refuse to give me as much as a she-kid which they used to give during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah, I will fight them on its account. Then<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>said: &#8220;It was nothing but Allah Who had guided<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Bakr </span>to fight and I came to realize that he was right.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sahabah unanimously agreed on fighting the Murtads (apostates). They fought against them vigorously until they came back to the fold of Islam. Only those among them who were destined to die as Murtads were killed at the hands of Muslims. We seek refuge in Allah from this. The ones killed included <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><strong>Musaylimah Al-Kadhab</strong> (the head of the apostates who claimed himself a Prophet after the death of Prophet Muhammad), </span>some of his followers, some people from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Banu Asad, </span>and others. As they refused to come back to Islam, Muslims continued to fight them until they were killed. Other Murtads were guided back to Islam by the Will of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To sum it up: Zakah is of great importance in Islam. It is the third greatest pillar next to Salah and Shahadah. Muslims are duty bound to deliver it to those who deserve it. If the Muslim ruler orders that Zakah be paid off to him to undertake the process of distributing it, his order must be executed. If he does not demand that, the believer has to distribute it to the poor and other people who deserve it. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has defined the categories of Zakah recipientsin the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) where He (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8220;As-Sadaqât (here it means Zakât) are only for the Fuqarâ’ (poor), and the Masâkin (needy) and those employed to collect (the funds), and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islâm), and to free the captives, and for those in debt, and for Allâh’s Cause, and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allâh. And Allâh is All-Knower, All-Wise. </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 60]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first and second categories of Zakah recipients include <strong>Faqirs</strong> (the poor) and the <strong>Miskins</strong> (the needy): These two have been defined as people who do not possess enough money. The Faqir is the person who does not have sufficient wealth to fulfill his needs or the needs of his dependents, such as food, drink, clothing and housing. The Miskin may be someone whose standard of living is better than the Faqir. However, their ruling is the same in all matters. They should be given an amount of Zakah which covers their basic needs for one whole year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third category of Zakah recipients includes <strong>those employed to collect Zakah</strong>: Collectors of Zakah include the people who travel around to collect it, or those who are responsible for maintaining it, or the scribes who record it in its register. Such people are given an amount from Zakah according to the effort they exert in collecting and maintaining it. The Muslim ruler can estimate the amount given to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth category includes <strong>the hearts that are newly inclined to Islam</strong>, This category includes chiefs, masters and men of high standing whose word is listened to by their people. When they enter Islam, their people are expected to follow in their footsteps. When they refuse to accept Islam, the same will be the attitude of their people. They are given a portion of Zakah with the purpose of strengthening their Iman (faith), or winning the hearts of their counterparts, or seeking their help in defending Islam against its enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth category includes the <strong>freeing of slaves and captives of war</strong>: Zakah is to be given to slaves so that they can set themselves free from the bondage of slavery. In this regard, Zakah is given to the type of slaves known as <strong>Mukatabs</strong> (slaves with an agreement to buy their freedom). According to the correct view, one who delivers Zakah may buy slaves with the money of Zakah for the purpose of freeing them. It is also permissible that he uses the money of Zakah in buying Muslims who have fallen captive to the Kafirs (disbelievers). Thus Zakah is delivered to the Kafirs as a ransom to release the Muslim captives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sixth category includes <strong>those in debt</strong>: These are the people who borrow money from others to provide the basic needs of their dependents or to reconcile between Muslims. They offer to pay the money in order to bring about reconciliation between Muslims who are at enmity with each other. One who offers to pay money for that purpose should be given an amount of the Zakah even if he is rich. Zakah is also given to insolvent debtors who are incapable of paying off their debts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh category includes paying Zakah <strong>in the cause of Allah</strong>: in this category Zakah is given to equip Mujahidun (persons fighting in the Cause of Allah) with necessary weapons and cavalry if Bayt-ul-Mal (Muslim treasury) is short of providing them with this. Therefore, they are given a portion of Zakah which enables them to fight against the enemies of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth category includes the <strong>wayfarers</strong>: wayfarers are people who move from one country to another. They may happen to run out of provisions due to the long distances they travel when journeying or being attacked by highway robbers or due to any other reason. They must be given a portion of Zakah which enables them to return home safely even if they are naturally rich people. They must be given an amount of Zakah that helps them return to their country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zakah has such a great effect when delivered to those eight categories of recipients. It helps them perform the duties of Allah and relieves them of their sufferings like paying off their debts if they are in debt or freeing themselves from the bondage of slavery if they are slaves or fighting in the cause of Allah if they are Mujahidun or assisting the wayfarers.It is out of Allah&#8217;s mercy that He makes His poor and rich Slaves co-operate with one another in righteousness and piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Payment of Zakah is a way of giving thanks to Allah</strong> because of the blessings He bestows upon them. Allah is the true Bestower of favors and blessings. It is the duty of every Muslim to pay out their Zakah as an act of showing gratitude to Allah. A Muslim should thank Allah for making him a deliverer and not a recipient of Zakah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The upper hand is better than the lower one&#8230;</strong></span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Book on Zakah, Chapter on Sadaqah should only be given by the wealthy, no. 1428; and Muslim, Book on Zakah, Chapter on the statement that the upper hand (that which gives) is better than the lower hand (that which receives), no. 1034]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The upper hand is the one that delivers Zakah while the lower hand is the one which receives it. The Muslim should thank Allah for providing them with wealth which they are duty bound to give a portion of to Allah&#8217;s Slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Zakah also purges the soul of the deliverer and purifies his wealth as well</strong>. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 103" target="_blank" name="TakeSadaqah(alms)fromtheir" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it&#8221;</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 103]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>You will be rewarded on account of paying Zakah both in this life and the Hereafter. </strong>Your money is purified and preserved when you pay it out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is also a means of purifying the soul</strong>. This has been referred to in the above Ayah which reads: &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 103" target="_blank" name="TakeSadaqah(alms)fromtheir" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslim gives their fellow poor Muslims from the wealth that Allah has bestowed on them, they will be abundantly rewarded by Allah for relieving them of their distresses.This act of yours will make them hold you in high esteem. It may be that they will make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) for you which may be a reason for your happiness and salvation in this life and the Hereafter. A Muslim is not harmed when they pay only a little amount of the many bounties that Allah has bestowed on them. They give these amounts to the children, old people and poor ones. The Muslim will receive great rewards from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allah has threatened those who refuse to pay Zakah out of miserliness.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And those who hoard up gold and silver [Al-Kanz: the money, the Zakât of which has not been paid] and spend them not in the Way of Allâh, announce unto them a painful torment</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 35" target="_blank" name="OntheDaywhenthat(Al-Kanz:" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>On the Day when that (Al-Kanz: money, gold and silver the Zakât of which has not been paid) will be heated in the Fire of Hell and with it will be branded their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs, (and it will be said unto them): <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;This is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves. Now taste of what you used to hoard.&#8221;</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 34-35]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the evil consequence of those who withhold payment of Zakah. They will be thrown into Hellfire where the wealth they amassed and refused to pay its Zakah will be a source of their agony on the Day of Resurrection. This will be a fitting retribution for their refusal to fulfill the right of Allah. While the wealth which a person does not give its due Zakah is labeled as &#8220;<strong>hoarded wealth</strong>&#8220;, that money whose due Zakah is paid is free of blame.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> <a style="color:#000000;" name="Whateverreachesaquantityon"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112843" class="tip"></span>Whatever reaches a quantity on which Zakah is payable is not a treasure (kanz) when Zakah is paid</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Abu Dawud, Book on Zakah, Chapter on what is Kanz and Zakah on jewelry, no. 1564]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever you pay the Zakah due from the wealth in your possession, it will not be labeled as hoarded wealth and vice versa.If you refuse to pay Zakah due from it, it will be a source of your agony on the Day of Resurrection. It is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>

Then he will be shown his final abode, either to Paradise or to Hell. </span></span></strong></p>

And he would be shown his last abode either to Paradise or to Hell. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">He who possesses cows and sheep and does not pay their Zakah (in another wording of the Hadith what is due on him regarding them) will be thrown on the Day of Judgment in a vast desert plain and they will trample him with their hoofs and gore him with their horns. As often as the last of them passes him the first of them would be made to return to him again during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years. Then he would be shown his last abode either to Paradise or to Hell.</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on Zakah, Chapter on sin of one who does not pay Zakah, no. 987.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith indicates how severe the punishment is of one who refuses to pay Zakah out of miserliness. On the Day of Resurrection, their wealth will be a source of their grief and agony whether it be money, food, fruit, camels, cattle or sheep. They will be used as tools of punishment on the Day of Resurrection. The Prophet indicated how they will be punished with their own wealth. The same is true with regard to gold and silver and other things of the sort. We ask Allah to grant us safety and protection from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It is our duty and the duty of all Muslims to enjoin one another to pay Zakah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are duty bound to enjoin one another to fulfill Allah&#8217;s Rights, strive hard to do that and remind those who are negligent of paying Zakah. Reminding people of this benefits the believers. Zakah, Salah and fasting are all obligatory duties, yet one may be heedless of that because of the gravity of his sins which darken their heart and cause them to continually disobey Allah. Satan and his helpers also make their deeds fair-seeming to them until they become completely unmindful of Allah and the Hereafter. They fall victim to the worship of Satan and start to accompany evil people. Their hearts become obsessed with the love of wealth and lustful desires. They refuse to befriend righteous people and prefer to follow the path of deviant fellows. Therefore, it is the duty of all Muslims to remind those heedless Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-Dhariyat, 51: 55" target="_blank" name="Andremind(bypreachingtheQur%E2%80%99%C3%A2n," rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>And remind (by preaching the Qur’ân, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), for verily, the reminding profits the believers</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Dhariyat, 51: 55]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So remind them (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) &#8211; you are only one who reminds </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;"> [Surah Al-Ghashiyah, 88: 21]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A believer should remind his fellow believing brother. He should not assume that their fellow brothers are well aware of the consequences of refraining from paying Zakah. Whenever they see that their brothers have started to be neglectful of Allah&#8217;s duties, they must start advising them and reminding them of Allah through the use of kind words and gentle preaching. They should seem to beworried about them and concerned with their salvation and happiness. A true Muslim brother is one who keeps advising, reminding and directing you to the straight path. He never keeps himself away from you nor flatters you. Rather, he gives you counsel and admonishes you. He reminds you to be mindful of Allah. He shows you the path of salvation so that you can follow it and warns you of treading the path of perdition so that you can steer clear of it. You should never give up hope of advising him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;&#8230;and never give up hope of Allâh’s Mercy&#8221; </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Yusuf, 12: 87]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Despair not of the Mercy of Allâh&#8221;</strong></span> <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 53]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reality proves that there have been many disobedient Muslims who continued to be heedless of Allah&#8217;s Commandments for years. Then, the time came when they were guided back to the straight path at the hands of righteous Muslims who kept encouraging them to perform deeds of righteousness. They started to awaken from their heedlessness and pray to Allah for the sake of those who guided them. As Allah shows them true guidance, they return to the path of truth and repent to Him of all their past sins. In this way, Allah forgives them and atones their previous misdeeds. So, I advise you, my dear brothers, not to give up hope.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone has told me just after Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer that he had come from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Masjid Al-Nusiry </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Masjid Al-Turky </span>while the marketplaces there were filled with people who did not offer Salah and were busy conducting buying and selling transactions. He started to weep and said: &#8220;This is intolerable.&#8221; Therefore, I see that we are in need of advising and co-operating with one another. It should not be said that authorities in charge would undertake this duty. It is true that these authorities shoulder great responsibility and that they have to be held accountable if they ever fail to play their role properly. We ask Allah to grant them help and success.Muslim rulers shoulder great responsibility in this regard. Every Muslim whether educated, scholar, or judge shares their prescribed responsibility of disapproving evil acts and enjoining good ones. The more Muslims co-operate with one another and enjoin one another to hold fast to the truth, the less evil will spread. Marketplaces are filled with many Muslims who neglect offering Salah (Prayer) and sit outside Masjids (mosques) while their fellow Muslims are in the process of offering it. These people must be reminded of their negligence of Salah and passers-by must disapprove of this heinous act of theirs. They may be warned in such words as &#8220;Do you not fear Allah? How come you are sitting like this while your Muslim brothers are offering Salah.&#8221; One should join their fellow Muslims in Salah even if they are on a journey.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">The Prophet (peace be upon him) passed by a man who did not move while the prayer was beginning. He asked him, &#8220;Are you not a Muslim?&#8221;</span> </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Imam Ahmad, the beginning of the Section on the Hadiths narrated by Al-Madinah narrators, the Hadith narrated by Mihjan Al-Diyaly, no. 15960; and Al-Nasa&#8217;y, Book on Imamate, Chapter on performing an obligatory Salah again in a congregation, no. 857]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He ordered him to join Salah with other Muslims even after he had already prayed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">After the Prophet had offered the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer in Mina in the year of the Farewell Hajj, some people said to him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Here are two people who have not offered the Fajr Prayer with us.&#8221; He asked that they be brought to him. They came trembling with fear. The Prophet (peace be upon him) inquired: &#8220;What prevented you from offering Salah with us?&#8221; They said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! We offered it in our camp&#8221;. The Prophet said: &#8220;Never do this again.If you have prayed in your houses and then you come to the Masjid (mosque), then pray with the congregation. It will be regarded as supererogatory Prayer for you&#8221;.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Section on the Hadiths narrated by Levanters narrators, the Hadith narrated by Yazid ibn Al-Aswad, no. 17020; and Al-Tirmidhy, Book on Salah, Chapter on a man offers Salah alone and then joins the congregation, no. 219]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone, who has already offered an Obligatory Prayer alone, goes to the Masjid and sees that the Congregational Prayer is not yet finished, they have to join the Muslims. If they happen to join the Imam in the first Rak`ah (unit of Prayer), then they will make Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer) with him. If they miss some Rak`ahs, they have to make up for them after Taslim. When the Prophet was asked about some Muslim rulers who delay offering Salah until later times, he said to the questioner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Observe the prayer at its proper time and if you can, do it along with them, and do not say that you have already observed prayer for it would be a supererogatory prayer for you.</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on Masjids and places for Salah, Chapter on disapproval of delaying Salah from its prescribed time&#8230;, no. 648; Al-Nasa&#8217;y, Book on Imamate, Chapter on performing Salah with wrongful rulers, no. 778; and Abu Dawud, Book on Salah, Chapter on if an Imam delays Salah after its prescribed time, no. 431.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims should reprimand those who sit in the streets at prayer time. Should one of them argue that he has already offered Salah, he must be ordered not to sit near the Masjid and to hide from people or join them in Prayer which will be regarded as supererogatory for him. He must be ordered to do this in order not to discourage people from offering Salah.He must be told to hasten to offer it with his fellow Muslims. It will be regarded as supererogatory Prayer if he has already offered it alone. The Imams at different Masjids should spend equal or similar times in offering Salah so that those who abandon Salah might not claim that they have prayed at such and such Masjid. Muslims are duty bound to co-operate in righteousness and piety and enjoin one another to hold steadfastly to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah describes those of His servants who are winners that they enjoin one another to hold to the path of truth and to endure it patiently. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-&#096;Asr, 103: 1" target="_blank" name="ByAl-%E2%80%98Asr(thetime" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><strong>By Al-‘Asr (the time). </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-&#096;Asr, 103: 2" target="_blank" name="Verily,manisinloss" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Verily, man is in loss, </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-&#096;Asr, 103: 3" target="_blank" name="Exceptthosewhobelieve(inIsl%C3%A2mic" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Except those who believe (in Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al-Ma‘ruf) which Allâh has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al-Munkar which Allâh has forbidden], and recommend one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allâh’s Cause during preaching His religion of Islâmic Monotheism or Jihâd).</strong> <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Asr]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) informs us that this type of people are the real winners who will attain happiness on account of their possession of the following four characteristics. Firstly, they have sincere belief in Allah and His Messenger. Secondly, they work deeds of righteousness which means that their Iman is fruitful. Iman is not just what resides firmly in the heart as it has to be confirmed by deeds. For example, it is not just enough to believe in the obligatory nature of Salah while neglecting to offer it, or to believe in the obligatory nature of Zakah while refusing to pay it, or to believe in the obligatory nature of fasting while abstaining from it. Iman has to be demonstrated both in words and in deeds. The real winners are those who combine between true Iman, righteous deeds and enjoining one another to do good and to remain steadfast. These are the real winners as they have firm belief in Allah and His Messenger. They declare the Oneness of Allah and His Messenger. They also believe in the Truth revealed by Allah and conveyed by His Messenger. Then, they practiced that really after their belief undertaking the obligations that Allah ordained and leaving the Prohibitions that He forbade. They also advised one another to hold fast to the truth without negligence or weakness, enjoining each other to the truth and cooperating with one another in righteousness and benevolent acts. They preached Islam, enjoined what is right and forbade what is wrong patiently as these matters cannot be attained without observing patience. Whoever seeks these merits has to keep patient and seek the help of Allah; beseeching Allah for His Help, thank Him, do the best in doing His Commandments, advising for His Sake, enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong, reminding people of Allah forbearingly. Undoubtedly, you have to bear troubles as it is the way of Paradise that is surrounded with troubling hardships. The Prophet (peace be upon him) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong>Paradise is surrounded by hardships and Hell-Fire is surrounded by temptations.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on Paradise, description of its boon and inhabitants, first chapter, no. 2823]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">There are many obstacles lying in the way to Jannah (Paradise). These obstacles have to be overcome with patience. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatest of these obstacles include following desires of the self, surrendering to the temptations of Shaytan (devil) and keeping company with evil friends. While the Shaytan makes bad deeds fair-seeming to the doer, his soul is naturally prone to evil and the evil company he keeps corrupts his manners.This evil company brings harm to him by causing him to deviate from the right path. Therefore, one should patiently endure breaking their relationship with them. One should also develop a kind of steadfast adherence to obeying the Commands of Allah and disobeying the incitements of Shaytan. One should have firm determination that helps them not to fall victim to their whims and desires which lead to eternal dwelling in Hellfire. Therefore, you will realize the true meaning of felicity by following the commands of Allah, refusing to follow your whims and desires and holding fast to the path of guidance and steadfastness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Muslim man or woman is duty bound to hasten to performing congregational Salah (Prayer) at its appointed time. They should put aside everything that distracts them from offering Salah like work or sleep. Undoubtedly, some Muslims find this difficult to do. However, once one starts to tame themselves by exercising <strong>self-restraint</strong>, they will sense a feeling of pleasure overwhelming their hearts each time they offer Salah. Self-restraint will help make their souls amenable to them. Thus, the heart is revived each time the Prayer time becomes due. One will also sense a feeling of comfort upon offering Salah to which they will hasten with pleasure. They will sense the same feelings when doing other good deeds. However, if one neglects offering Salah surrendering themselves to whims and desires, Satan will play tricks on them and their heart will become weak to the point that they will feel that Salah is burdensome,because the heart becomes weak due to its submission to desires, devil, and tempting ways of laziness and harmful neglect when a servant argues, in his defense of his falsehood, saying, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful.. Allah is All-Forgiving and All-Generous while he forgets that Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Declare (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) unto My slaves, that truly, I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful. &#8220;And that My Torment is indeed the most painful torment. </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Hijr, 15: 49-50]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also forgets that Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Forgiver of sin, the Acceptor of repentance, the Severe in punishment, the Bestower (of favours). Lâ ilâha illâ Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), to Him is the final return.</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Ghafir, 40: 3]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah forgives and is merciful to those who turn to Him in repentance, yet He inflicts severe punishment on those who neglect His Rights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant all Muslims success and guidance. May He guide us and you to that which pleases Him. May He also guide us to His Straight Path, teach us what is beneficial to us, and assist us in obeying Him and fulfilling His Rights. May Allah make us all among those who co-operate in righteousness and piety and those who enjoin one another to hold steadfastly to the truth. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) is Most Generous and Most Gracious. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Advising women who listen to music<br />
</b>Nur `Ala Al-Darb Program, Tape no. 11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b></b><b>Q: Kindly advise those women who listen to songs.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b></b>I advise all men and women not to listen to music, because they bring about evil consequences. Songs are presented on TV, broadcast on the radio, and recorded on cassettes. All Muslim men and women are thus required to beware the evil of these songs. Instead, they should listen to the Qur&#8217;an, Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him) or Islamic lectures which benefit them in this life and the Hereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">As for songs and music, their evil is great as they may cause Muslims to deviate from their religion. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Songs and music may <strong>sow seeds of hypocrisy in the heart</strong>, at which point one begins to develop a dislike for everything that is good and become fond of every other thing that is evil. This is the true meaning of hypocrisy in addition to its literal meaning of pretending to be a Muslim while concealing Kufr (disbelief). Therefore, music is one of the means that invites to hypocrisy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Having the habit of listening to music may lead to hating the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an, being heedless of beneficial advice, or listening to Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Moreover, one may be deluded into committing obscenities and corruption. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Thus, it is the duty of faithful men and women to be cautious of evil of songs and music.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states in the Glorious Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing, etc.) to mislead (men) from the Path of Allâh without knowledge, and takes it (the Path of Allâh, or the Verses of the Qur’ân) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire). </strong></span>(Surah Luqman, 31: 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when Our Verses (of the Qur’ân) are recited to such a one, he turns away in pride, as if he heard them not &#8211; as if there were deafness in his ear. So announce to him a painful torment. </span></strong>(Surah Luqman, 31: 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Commentators of the Qur&#8217;an interpret <strong>&#8220;idol talk&#8221;</strong> to mean <strong>singing</strong> and it is equally applied to every sound produced by musical instruments and diversions. This is the view held by most scholars of the Qur&#8217;an (may Allah have mercy on them).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Commenting on the above Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse),<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `<strong>Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud </strong></span>(may Allah be pleased with him) swore: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;By Allah! The reference in this Ayah is to singing.&#8221; </span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">He would swear and say: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;Singing causes the seeds of hypocrisy to grow in the heart like water causes seeds of plants to grow.&#8221; </span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">This means that singing causes one to hate good and to love evil; to hate listening to the Qur&#8217;an and to love songs and diversion and other things of the sort. This is a type of hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">A hypocrite pretends to be associated with Islam. He pretends to be a believer while in fact he conceals Kufr. He pretends to love the Qur&#8217;an while in fact he does not. Music causes one to hate listening to the Qur&#8217;an or listening to someone calling to the way of Allah. It encourages the love of falsehood, speaking evil and obscene words. It not only causes the heart to deviate from the straight path but also to develop a fondness for what Allah (Glorified be He) has declared prohibited. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><strong>This has been proven by experience. Those who are in close contact with singers know how corrupt and spoiled they are because of their love of music and song</strong>. This brings about great evil to those who are accustomed to it. There is no power or might except with Allah.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The third question of Fatwa no. 2442</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 3: <strong>What is the ruling on acting the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them) in school theaters?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Council of Senior Scholars previously reviewed this question and issued a decree as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allah (Exalted be He) has praised and set clear the high status of the Sahabah. Thus, acting any of them on stage or on the screen is contrary to this Divine praise and is <strong>detrimental to the high status and honor</strong> which Allah has bestowed upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Representing any of them in this way <strong>exposes them to mockery and ridicule</strong>. Actors are usually people who have no room for righteousness, piety, and Islamic morals in their lives. Moreover, those who put on plays are doing so as a means to earn money, and no matter how much they try to avoid it, it will involve some lying and backbiting. Acting the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) may have an <strong>effect on their status in the hearts and minds of the Muslims, or diminish the reverence they have for them, and paves the way for arousing doubts in Muslims about their religion and disputes over the personalities of the Sahabah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also necessarily implies that one of the actors will play the role of Abu Jahl and other disbelievers, thus he will have to <strong>utter words insulting Bilal, and insulting the Messenger (peace be upon him) and the Message of Islam</strong> that he brought. Undoubtedly, this is a great evil. This act may be targeted to confuse the Muslims about their creed, the Book of Allah and Sunnah of their Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If it is claimed that this serves the interest of calling people to Islam and spreading noble Islamic morals and etiquette through showing exact biographies of those Sahabah is simply an assumption and wishful thinking. Whoever knows the real nature and aims of actors will realize that this kind of acting is in sharp contrast to the real nature of the actors, their standards, lives, and behaviors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. It is basically stated in the principles of Shari`ah (Islamic law) that <strong>if a certain matter is definitely or probably harmful, it will be forbidden</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Acting the Sahabah may serve some interest, but the harm done by this is far greater than any good that might be achieved.</span> Accordingly, to protect those interests and ward off harm, and to preserve the honorable status of the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), we must not allow that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Saying Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Azhim upon finishing recitation of the Qur&#8217;an</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b></b><b>Q: I often hear that</b><b> saying Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim upon finishing recitation of the Glorious Qur&#8217;an </b>is an act of Bid`ah (innovation in religion). Other people told me that there was nothing wrong with it. Supporting their view, they quote the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) which reads:<b> <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 95" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85):"></a>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;Allâh has spoken the truth; follow the religion of Ibrâhîm (Abraham) Hanîfa (Islâmic Monotheism, i.e. he used to worship Allâh Alone) &#8221; </b>Some educated people also told me that whenever the Prophet (peace be upon him) wanted a Qur&#8217;an reciter to end his recitation, he would just say &#8220;That is enough&#8221;. Never did he use to ask him to say Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim. Therefore, would you kindly give a detailed explanation of the relevant ruling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b>Habitual saying of Sadaqa Allahu Al-Azhim upon concluding recitation of the Glorious Qur&#8217;an is not supported by any proof in the Shari`ah (Islamic Law) and should, therefore, not be used as a common practice. It belongs to the category of Bid`ah particularly when someone believes it to be an act of Sunnah. Such a practice must be given up.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">As for the Ayah which reads: &#8221; <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 95" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85):"></a>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;Allâh has spoken the truth &#8221; it has nothing to do with saying this expression. The Ayah simply means that the Prophet (peace be upon him) is commanded by Allah (Exalted be He) to make it clear to people that the revelations contained in the Tawrah (Torah), the Injil (Gospel) and all other heavenly revealed Scriptures are true.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">By the same token, clear revelations contained in the Glorious Qur&#8217;an are true. However, this does not establish a proof for the desirability to conclude reading of some Ayahs or a certain Surah of the Qur&#8217;an by saying: Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim. Neither the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor any of his Sahabah (Companions, may Allah be pleased with them) were authentically reported to have done such a practice. <a name="TheProphetoncelistenedtoIbn"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="110824" class="tip"></span>The Prophet once listened to Ibn Mas`ud reading Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;. Upon reaching the Ayah which reads: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 41" target="_blank" name="How(willitbe)then,whenWe"></a>How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as a witness against these people? &#8221; The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him:&#8221;That is enough&#8221;. Ibn Mas`ud said: &#8220;When I turned to him, I saw his eyes shedding tears.&#8221;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> The Prophet (peace be upon him) was moved to tears because the Ayah reminded him of the great horror of the Day of Resurrection. The Ayah reads: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 41" target="_blank" name="How(willitbe)then,whenWe"></a>How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) &#8221; <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 41" target="_blank" name="How(willitbe)then,whenWe"></a>&#8230;as a witness against these people &#8221; i.e. The Muslim people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">In short, there exists no evidence in the Shari`ah that makes it desirable to conclude recitation of the Qur&#8217;an by saying: Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim. This expression has to be left unsaid so that one would be following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them). However, there is nothing wrong if someone happens to say this expression unintentionally. Since Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) always speaks the truth, this expression of Sadaqa Allahu Al-Azhim has to be thought of as an absolute expression which should not be limited to a given time, place, or situation. Therefore, habitual recitation of this expression whenever one finishes reading the Qur&#8217;an has no evidence in its support as has been early mentioned.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> Fatwa no. 3828</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I am a Muslim woman in my twenties. I was married about a year and a half ago and thanks to Allah, I had a baby six months ago delivered naturally. A week after delivery, I began to suffer from severe depression, which had never happened to me before. I lost interest in everything, even taking care of the baby. I went to a psychiatrist and took medication until recently, but it was of no use and I became tired of long treatment. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I ask Allah that you find an Islamically approved treatment for my distress and psychological depression, or the best remedy, so that I can return to my normal state and take care of my husband and baby, and be able to manage the affairs of my home. I heard sometime ago the Hadith, which states: The water of Zamzam is for whatever it is drunk for. I hope from Allah, then you, to clarify the meaning of this Hadith. Does it apply to my psychological case, or is it only for physical diseases? If Zamzam water is useful, by the Will of Allah, in treating my case, how can I get it? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Put your <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>trust in Allah</strong></span> and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>expect good from Him</strong></span>. Entrust your affairs to Him and do not despair of His Mercy and Benevolence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no disease for which Allah has not also sent down the cure. You should make use of means and continue to consult specialized doctors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Recite <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Surahs Al-Ikhlas, Al-Falaq and Al-Nas</strong></span> three times, blowing into your hands after each recitation and wiping your face and whatever parts of your body you can. Repeat this procedure day and night and before going to sleep.<span style="line-height:1.5;">Recite </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Surah Al-Fatihah</strong></span><span style="line-height:1.5;"> anytime of day or night, and </span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong style="line-height:1.5;">Ayat-ul-Kursy</strong></span><span style="line-height:1.5;"> (the Qur’anic Verse of the Throne, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255) before going to sleep. This is the best Ruqyah (Qur’an and supplications recited over the sick seeking healing) to protect oneself from evil. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">You should also <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>appeal to Allah with the Du‘a’</strong> </span>(Supplication) to be said at times of distress: </span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">لَا إلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ الْعَظيمُ الْحَلِيمْ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ رَبُّ العَرْشِ العَظِيمِ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا الله رَبُّ السَّمَوّاتِ ورّبُّ الأَرْضِ ورَبُّ العَرْشِ الكَريم</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#008000;">La ilaha illa Allah al-`azim al-halim, la ilaha illa Allah rabbul-`arshi al-`azim, la ilaha illa Allah, rabbul-samawaati wa rabbul-ardi wa rabbul-`arshi al-karim </span>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#008000;">(There is no god but Allah, the Most Great and the All-Forbearing. There is no god but Allah, the Lord of the Great Throne. There is no god but Allah, the Lord of the heavens and the earth and the Lord of the Noble Throne). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">You may also heal and protect yourself through the <strong>Ruqyah</strong> of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him): </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#008000;">&#8220;Remove the affliction, O Lord of mankind, and bring about healing as You are the Healer. There is no healing but Your Healing; a healing that leaves behind no ailment&#8221; </span>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">There are also many other Adhkar (invocations and remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis), Ruqyahs, and supplications stated in the Books of Hadith and Al-Nawawy mentioned them in his book Riyad Al-Salihin and Al-Adhkar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what you mentioned about <strong>Zamzam water</strong> and the statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him): <em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Zamzam water is for whatever it is drunk for. </span></strong></em>[3] This Hadith was related by Imam Ahmadand Ibn Majah on the authority of Jabir ibn `Abdullah from the Prophet (peace be upon him). It is a Hadith Hasan (a Hadith whose chain of narration contains a narrator with an exactitude weaker than that of authentic hadiths, but it is still free from eccentricity or blemish) and general in application. What is more authentic than it is the statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him) about Zamzam water: <em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is blessed; it is a food that nourishes and a cure for sickness.</strong></span></em> [4] (Related by Muslim and Abu Dawud; this is the wording of Abu Dawud) If you would like some Zamzam water, you can ask anyone performing Hajj from your country to bring you some.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Ruling on offering Salah without a turban</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Is it permissible to offer Salah (Prayer) without a turban? Is it permissible for the Imam (the one who leads congregational Prayer) to pray without a head cover? Is wearing a cap sufficient? Please support your answer with evidences. May Allah protect you. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is nothing wrong with offering Salah without a turban because the head [with regard to men] is not included in `Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered in public), and it is not obligatory to cover it when offering Salah, whether the person praying is an Imam, a Munfarid (person offering Prayer individually), or a Ma&#8217;mum (person being led by an Imam in Prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if wearing a turban is customary then it is best to do it, especially when offering Salah with others. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes), while praying [and going round (the Tawâf of) the Ka‘bah,]</span></em></strong> The turban is considered a type of adornment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is well known that men who are Muhrims (pilgrims in the ritual state for Hajj and `Umrah) offer Salah bareheaded, because they are not allowed to cover their heads while in Ihram (ritual state for Hajj and `Umrah). Hence it is known that there is nothing wrong with offering Salah bareheaded. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah guide all to acquire beneficial knowledge and act upon it! He is the All-Hearer and All-Respondent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Baaz Fatwas &#8211; <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaSubjects.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;HajjEntryID=0&amp;HajjEntryName=&amp;RamadanEntryID=0&amp;RamadanEntryName=&amp;NodeID=3329&amp;PageID=1687&amp;SectionID=14&amp;SubjectPageTitlesID=23811&amp;MarkIndex=1&amp;0#ToofferSalah(Prayer)withoutaturban" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.net</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 10: Some people wear a turban, some wear a Qulunsuwah (cap), and many offer Salah (Prayer) with bare heads, I mean men. Which manner is the best in reward? We appreciate your advice, may Allah reward you with the best. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is desirable for a Muslim to wear his full garment when going to Prayer, the head cover included; because Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) enjoined His servants to adorn themselves when going to Salah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes), while praying [and going round (the Tawâf of) the Ka‘bah,]</strong></span></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Besides, it has not been reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he offered Salah without a head cover</strong></span>. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In fact, he used to always wear a turban, and the practice of Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the best guidance.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on some people who say: &#8220;O Allah, I worship You out of my love for You. If I worship You fearing Your Hell, let me enter it and if I worship You seeking to enter Your Paradise, let me enter Your Hell&#8221;? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Worshiping Allah just by loving Him is the Manhaj (methodology) of misguided Sufis, which is of their own invention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Loving Allah is the highest degree of Ibadah (worship), but not the sole act of Ibadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Manhaj of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) is to worship Allah through love, fear, hope and other expressive forms of `Ibadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Invoke your Lord withhumility and in secret</strong></span>.&#8221; [Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says about His Prophets:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before Us.&#8221;</span></strong><span style="color:#000000;"> [</span><span style="color:#000000;">Surah Al-Anbiya&#8217;, 21: 90]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says about the angels:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And they stand in awe for fear of Him.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Anbiya&#8217;, 21: 28]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 50]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) elaborating on this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

<p><em>The following are the excerpts from Fatwas of Ibn Baz &#8211; read the full article at <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=139&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.net</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>This was published in the magazine of the Islamic University in Madinah, the fourth edition, the sixth year, Rabi` Al-Thany, 1394 A.H., pp. 175-182.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah. May peace be upon the Last Prophet, his family, and his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Muslim related in his Sahih (Book of sound Hadiths) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;If anyone invokes blessings on me once, Allah will bless him ten times&#8221; </strong></span></em>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Do not make your houses graves and do not make my grave a place of celebration but invoke blessings on me, for your blessings reach me wherever you may be&#8221; </span></strong></em>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (May peace and blessings be upon him) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;May his nose soil with dust in whose presence mention is made of me and he does not supplicate for me&#8221; </strong></span></em>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since invoking peace and blessings on the Prophet (peace be upon him) is permissible in Salah during Tashahhud (a recitation in the sitting position in the second/last unit of Prayer) and permissible in Khutbah (sermon), invocations, seeking forgiveness, after Adhan (Call to Prayer), upon entering, and leaving the Masjid (mosque), when uttering his name and in other positions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed to write the form of invoking peace and blessings when writing His name in a book, a message, or an article, because of the proofs mentioned above. It is permissible to write the full form in order to apply what Allah has commanded and the reader would remember it when passing by it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should not reduce it to the acronym e.g. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(P)</strong></span> that stands for peace or <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(PBUH)</span></strong> that stands for (peace be upon him) or the like abbreviations that may be used by some writers.Such an act is against the ordinance of Allah (May He be Praised and Glorified) which are mentioned in His Book by His saying: <em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Send your Salât on (ask Allâh to bless) him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islâmic way of greeting (salutation i.e. As-Salâmu ‘Alaikum)</span></strong></em>.[Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 56] It does not have the same privilege of writing (peace be upon him) in full form. The reader may not watch out or may not understand the meaning, bearing in mind that referring to it is disapproved by the religious scholars who even warned against it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Salah said in his book: &#8220;`Ulum al-Hadith&#8221; i.e. The sciences of Hadith, known as &#8220;Muqadimat Ibn Al-Salah&#8221; in the twenty fifth type of his book: (Al-Hadith wa Kayfiyat Dabt-ul-kitab wa Taqyiduh). He said that which means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ninth: A person must keep writing the form of sending Salat and taslim i.e. &#8220;peace and blessing be upon the Messenger of Allah&#8221; in full form upon mentioning him. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A person must not be weary of repeating it, because it is one of the greatest benefits which the Hadith students and writers may overlook</strong></span>. Whoever disregards this, he will be deprived of a great reward. We have seen good visions for the people who write the form in full, because it is a form that a person writes as a Du`a&#8217; (supplication), not a part of the narration to make it dependent on the source of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Similarly, the same is true with regard to praising Allah (Glorified be He) upon mentioning His Name such as (Glorified and Exalted be He), (Blessed and Exalted be He), and the like&#8230;</strong></span> (Until he says): then a person should avoid two shortcomings:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">First: Writing it in incomplete form by two letters or the like.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Second: Writing it in short form by meaning such as (wa sallam i.e. blessings).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated from Hamzah Al-Kinany (may Allah be merciful to him) that he used to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to record the Hadith and I used to write down upon mentioning the name of the Prophet (salla-Allah-u-`alaihi i.e. May Allah&#8217;s peace be upon him) without writing (wa sallam). Thereupon, I saw the Prophet (peace be upon him) in a vision saying to me: Why do you not complete the form of invoking peace and blessingson me? He continued: Ever since, I did not write it in short form like this (salla-Allah-u-`alaihi) but in this form (salla-Allah-u-`alaihi-wa-sallam i.e. May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon him). Ibn Al-Salah added: I said: it is also reprehensible to write (`alaihi-s-salam i.e. peace upon him) and Allah knows best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His authority, the encyclopedic scholar Al-Sakhawy (May Allah be merciful with him) said in his book (Fath-ul-Mughith Sharh Alfiyat Al-Hadith by Al-`Iraqy) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O writer, avoid (referring to it) i.e. peace and blessings upon the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) by writing only two letters or the like as done by Al-Kattany and the ignorant of the non-Arabs and ignorant students. They write instead of (May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon him), <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(p) </span></strong>or <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(pb) </span></strong>or <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(pbuh)</span></strong> and that entails decrease in reward, because it is unlike the proper manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Suyuty (May Allah be merciful with him) said in his book (Tadrib Al-Rawy Fi Sharh Taqrib Al-Nawawy):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reprehensible to write the short form of peace and blessings here and in every position where invoking peace and blessings is required as mentioned in the commentary of Sahih Muslim and others because of Allah&#8217;s saying: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>Send your Salât on (ask Allâh to bless) him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islâmic way of greeting (salutation i.e. As-Salâmu ‘Alaikum)</em></span>.[Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 56] Until he says: It is reprehensible to refer to it with one or two letters as those people who write (pbuh), he must write it in full form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of quote, adapted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My advice for every Muslim; reader or writer, is to <strong><span style="color:#000000;">seek for the best reward</span></strong> and stay away from what <strong><span style="color:#000000;">may invalidate or reduce it</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to grant us success to that which pleases Him, for He is the Most Generous. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following are the excerpts from  A speech delivered by His Eminence at Al-Jami` Al-Kabir in Riyadh on 27/4/1400 A.H., published in His Eminence&#8217;s book &#8220;Collection of Miscellaneous Fatwas and Articles&#8221;, vol. 9, pp. 128-141. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Read the full speech  at <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=1375&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.net</a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If Allah wills to do good to a person, He makes them comprehend Din &#8216;religion&#8217;.</strong></span></em>&#8221; (Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This important Hadith shows us the excellence of comprehending Din.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Comprehending religion</strong> includes understanding the Qur&#8217;an, the Sunnah, and Islam. Islam covers the basics of Shari`ah, Allah&#8217;s Ordainment&#8217;s, His Prohibitions, a servant&#8217;s duty towards Allah and other servants and Allah&#8217;s fear, glorification, and watchfulness. In fact, the first step towards attaining knowledge is fearing Allah (Exalted be He), honoring His Sanctities, and watching Him in all deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever does not <strong>fear or be aware of Allah</strong> (Exalted be He) in their deeds, all their knowledge will be worthless. However, true beneficial knowledge and understanding of Din that leads to happiness is that which instills Allah&#8217;s Awe in a Muslim&#8217;s heart, directs them to honor Allah&#8217;s Sanctities, pushes them to obey Allah&#8217;s Orders and abstain from His Prohibitions, and urges them to call to Allah (Exalted be He) and to clarify Shari`ah to people. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So, anyone who is granted comprehension in religion in this way, Allah (Exalted be He) has indeed wanted to do them good.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, anyone deprived of these blessings will be among the ignorant, misguided and negligent who renounce attaining the knowledge that Allah (Exalted be He) has made obligatory. They will be among those whom Allah (Exalted be He) has not wanted to do good to them. Further, Allah (Exalted be He) talks about Kafirs (disbelievers) who turn away from the purpose of their creation, to teach us that it is our duty, as Muslims, to haste to comprehend religion and ask about any unclear matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But those who disbelieve turn away from that whereof they are warned</span></em>.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Ahqaf, 46: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, but turns away from them, forgetting what (deeds) his hands have sent forth.&#8221;  </span></em></strong>[Surah Al-Kahf, 18: 57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, it is the duty of a Muslim to seek for attaining knowledge in religion, to attend to, reflect on, and benefit from the Qur&#8217;an and pay great attention to, study, apply, and memorize the Sunnah as much as possible. When a person neglects these two basics, it is an indication that Allah (Exalted be He) did not will good for him. They are doomed since their heart is corrupt and deviating from the path to guidance. We ask Allah to protect and keep us away from whatever displeases Him!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear Muslims, it is incumbent upon us to learn our religion and know its rulings and to attend to, meditate, reflect on, recite, and apply the Qur&#8217;an. In addition, we should give great care to, memorize, apply and study the Sunnah along with asking about ambiguous matters. Muslims should ask those who have more knowledge to find out the correct answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So ask the people of the Scripture, if you do not know</strong></span></em>.&#8221; [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, a Muslim can attend knowledge lessons and benefit from them and study with other knowledgeable Muslims to benefit from them and add to himself. In this way, a Muslim can attain comprehension of religion and avoid the characteristics of the negligent and heedless.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;If Allah wills to do good to a person, He makes him comprehend the Din.&#8221; </strong></span></em>[1]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some of our Muslim brethren hold birthday parties for themselves and their children, what is the ruling on such festivals? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The basic principle regarding acts of <strong>Ibadah</strong> (worship) is that they are <strong>Tawqifiy</strong> (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion), and as such, no one is allowed to worship Allah in a way other than which He ordained, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected. </span></em>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected. </span></em>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Birthday parties are an act of Bid&#8217;ah (innovation in religion) that should not be done for any person, regardless of their rank or role in life. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most honorable of all creation and the best of all Messengers (peace be upon them), i.e. Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullah (peace be upon him) was never reported to have held a festival for the day he was born, or even instructed his Ummah (nation based on one creed) to celebrate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the best of this Ummah after its Prophet (peace be upon him) are the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), but none of them is reported to have made a festival for the Prophet&#8217;s birthday, or for any of them (may Allah be pleased with them), and all goodness is to be found in following their pathand patterning oneself after the teachings of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, such Bid`ah pave the way to<strong> imitate the Jews, Christians and other Kafirs</strong> (non-Muslims) in terms of their newly invented festivals. Allah is the One sought for help!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth question of Fatwa no. 8598</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 4: Does rolling up the sleeves count as part of the tucking up that is not allowed during Salah?If it is part of that tucking up, does the ruling differ if I start praying with my sleeves rolled up, meaning, I do not roll them up during the Salah, or does it make no difference?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not permissible to roll up the sleeves or to fold them up before the Salah or during it</strong></span> to avoid that they will touch the ground when performing Sujud (prostration), because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <span style="color:#008000;">I have been commanded to pray on seven bones and <strong>not to tuck up my hair or my clothes</strong></span>.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth: Morals and etiquette of the Da`ys to Allah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The morals and qualities necessary for a Da`y (caller to Islam) are highlighted by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) in many occurrences in the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>First: Devotedness.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory for a Da`y to be so devoted to Allah that he neither intends to show off, nor wants a good reputation or praise from people. Rather, he should only call to Allah to please Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;This is my way; I invite unto Allâh (i.e. to the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islâmic Monotheism).&#8221; </strong>[Surah Yusuf, 12: 108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And who is better in speech than he who [says: “My Lord is Allâh (believes in His Oneness)&#8221;</strong> [Surah Fussilat, 41: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you have to be devoted to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). It is the most important virtue and the greatest quality that has to characterize your way of Da`wah (call to Islam), i.e. seeking Allah and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Second: Knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Invite people to Allah with firm knowledge. You should not be unaware of or ignorant about what you call people to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;This is my way; I invite unto Allâh (i.e. to the Oneness of Allâh &#8211; Islâmic Monotheism) with sure knowledge.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Yusuf, 12: 108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge is a necessary obligation. You should not call people while you are ignorant nor talk about a topic you are unaware of. An ignorant person destroys and never constructs, spoils and never reforms. You, servants of Allah, have to fear Allah and never say anything about Him without knowledge. Likewise, you should never preach something unless you have sure knowledge and insight into what Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) said about it. Sure knowledge is indispensible and essential for a seeker of knowledge or a Da`y to be fully conversant with and have a deep knowledge of all the aspects of what he calls people to. He must also be sure of the proofs that substantiate his topic. Once he is sure of the truth of his points, he should then call people to them, regardless of whether it is a call to do something or to abandon something, i.e. an act of obedience to Allah and His Messenger or an act forbidden by Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call should be based on sure knowledge and insight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Among the qualifications necessary for a Da`y is that he should have patience, kindness, and gentleness with forbearing temperament as the prophets (peace be upon them) were.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never should a Da`y be rushing, violent, or unduly strict. Rather, he has to be patient, forbearing and kind while practicing Da`wah. To this effect, we have stated some evidence earlier. For example, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: And by the Mercy of Allâh, you dealt with them gently. In the story of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allâh).&#8221;</strong> [Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allah, whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is hard upon them, be hard upon him, and whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is kind to them, be kind to him.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Muslim, Sahih, Book on rulership, no. 1828; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 6, p. 93.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory for you, slaves of Allah, to be kind in your Da`wah, and not to be harsh with people. Do not make people turn away from Islam because of your harshness, ignorance or violent, harmful approach. It is thus obligatory for you to be forbearing, gentle, pleasant and lenient in speech so that your words may have an effect on the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect on one toward whom your Da`wah is directed. As such, people will receive your Da`wah better, will be affected by it and will show appreciation. On the contrary, harshness causes disaffection, alienation, and division, not unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Among the necessary etiquettes and attributes a Da`y should or even must have is to act upon what he is calling people to. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should be a good example for those whom he invites to Allah &#8211; that is, he should not call people to something which he himself does not do, or call people to abandon something that he himself does. This is the behavior of the losers &#8211; we seek Allah&#8217;s Refuge from this. But the winning believers call to the truth, act upon it, practicing it actively and vividly and never do what they forbid people to do. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do? Most hateful it is with Allâh that you say that which you do not do.&#8221;</strong>[Surah Al-Saff, 61: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted be He) also saysrebuking the Jews for enjoining righteousness while forgetting to practice it themselves:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Enjoin you Al-Birr (piety and righteousness and each and every act of obedience to Allâh) on the people and you forget (to practise it) yourselves, while you recite the Scripture [the Taurât (Torah)]! Have you then no sense?&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>On the Day of Resurrection, a man will be brought and thrown in Hellfire. His intestines will then pour forth and he will revolve around them like a donkey revolves around a millstone. The people of Hell would gather around him and say, &#8216;O so and so, what happened to you? Did you not use to command us to adhere to righteousness and forbid us to do wrong?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;Yes. But I used to enjoin righteousness but I did not practice it myself and I used to forbid wrong but I committed it.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Book on the beginning of creation, no. 3267; Muslim, Sahih, Book on asceticism and heart-softening narrations, no. 2989; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 5, p. 207.&#8217;)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This will be the case with whoever calls to Allah, enjoins good and prohibits evil while his words are contrary to his actions &#8211; we seek Allah&#8217;s Refuge from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, from among the most important and greatest attributes a Da`y has to be characterized by is to act upon that which he calls people to and not to do things that he prohibits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Da`y should have excellent behavior, good reputation, patience, persistence, sincerity and diligence in guiding people to goodness and keeping them away from falsehood. He should supplicate to Allah to guide the people whom he invites. He should supplicate for the people he invites to Allah, such as by saying, &#8220;May Allah guide you and open up your heart to accept the truth.&#8221; Thus, you should call and guide him, forbear his misbehavior and even supplicate to Allah to guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On hearing people saying about the tribe of Daws that they disobeyed, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allah, guide Daws and bring them (to Islam).&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Jihad and military expeditions, no. 2937; Muslim, Sahih, Book on merits of the Companions, no. 2524; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 2, p. 243.&#8217;)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, you should supplicate to Allah for those you call to truth so that Allah may guide them and open up their hearts to the truth. You should show patience and persistence and do not lose hope. Moreover, you should say only that which is good and never rebuke or say bad words that might cause people to turn away from truth. However, if someone commits aggression and injustice, they will be given different treatment. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And argue not with the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), unless it be in (a way) that is better (with good words and in good manner, inviting them to Islâmic Monotheism with His Verses), except with such of them as do wrong&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-`Ankabut, 29: 46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the one who commits injustice through opposing the Da`wah with evil and enmity is to be dealt with in a different manner. If possible, such a person should be imprisoned or receive similar disciplinary punishment, which depends on the kind of injustice he commits. But as long as he causes no harm, you should be patient,seeking Allah&#8217;s Reward, and to argue with him in ways that are best. Anyway, if such a person causes you any personal harm, it is to be endured with patience as did Allah&#8217;s messengers and those who followed them in piety and righteousness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to grant us all the power to practice Da`wah in the best manner. May He reform our hearts and actions and grant us understanding of and holding fast to Islam. May Allah also make us among those who are guided, who guide others, are righteous and teach others righteousness. Surely He (Glorified and Exalted be He) is the most Supreme, the Most Noble. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon His Slave, Messenger and Prophet Muhammad, his family, Companions and all those who follow him in goodness until the Day of Judgment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Q: I hear people saying that using Miswak (tooth-cleansing stick) in the Masjid is impermissible. Is this true?  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Using the Miswak is an affirmed act of Sunnah. It should be used when necessary upon performing <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wudu&#8217; (ablution), Salah, reciting the Qur&#8217;an, changing the mouth smell</strong></span>, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It may be used inside or outside the Masjid, as no text supports the prohibition of using it inside the Masjid when necessary. Moreover, it finds further support in the general meaning of the following Hadith, “<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Were it not for the fear that it might be hard for my Ummah (nation), I would have ordered them to use Miswak for every Salah</span></strong>.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, a person should be careful not to overdo the Miswak in the Masjid lest they should vomit or bleed in the Masjid.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Do the Jinn (creatures created from fire) appear to some humans and hold friendships with them? Is jinni a devil?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Jinn do appear to some people. The Jinn are individual beings, not part of the human. It is well-known among scholars that the Jinn are the children of the Satan, in the same way that the humans are the children of Adam, so the Satan is the Jinni who refused to prostrate to Adam. He is the father of all Jinn. Some of them are kind, and others are wicked Kafirs (disbelievers) similar to the Kafirs among human beings. Among them are the Fasiqs (someone openly and flagrantly violating Islamic law), Kafirs, righteous Mu&#8217;mins (believers), and disobedient ones. They are groups and sects as humans, some people are in contact with them, they speak to them and are spoken to by them, some people can see them, but in most cases they are not seen. This is as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:<em><span style="color:#008000;"> </span></em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, he and Qabîluhu (his soldiers from the jinn or his tribe) see you from where you cannot see them&#8221;</span></strong><em><span style="color:#008000;"> (</span></em>Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means that they see us from where we cannot see them. This does not mean that we cannot see them at all; we can see them, but not from where they see us. However, they appear to some people in the desert and in houses, and they converse. We have been informed by a group of scholars of many incidents where the Jinn attend informative lectures and ask questions about different topics although they were not seen, some people have seen the Jinn in the desert and in other places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is not permissible to worship them instead of Allah (Exalted be He), or seek their support. It is not permissible also to ask them for help in harming Muslims, nor is it permitted to ask about the Ghayb (the Unseen).</strong></span> In fact a person should take precautions against these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for calling them to Allah if possible, teaching them what will benefit them, advising them, preaching to them and reminding them of Allah, these are all permissible things. However, seeking their help and support, making vows for them, or getting closer to them by slaughtering in fear of their evil is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">‘And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in sin and transgression</span>.</strong> (Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that they increased their sins and transgression. This Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) has two Tafsirs (explanation of the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an): the <strong>first meaning</strong> is that the Jinn increased the humans in fear of them, and the <strong>second meaning</strong> is that the humans increased the Jinn in their evil and transgression and kufr (disbelief) because when the Jinn saw that humans were scared of them they became arrogant and increased their harm of humans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Either way <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>it is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not</span> permissible to ask them for help, or assistance, or is it permissible to make vow to them, ask them to help with something, invoke them to cure the sick, and so on</strong></span>. However, if one is able to speak to them, he can advise, remind, and call them to Allah. He should also teach them what will bring them benefit. There is nothing wrong with doing that with Jinn in the same way it is done with humans.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer to a <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=801&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Question</strong> </a>Posed to Permanent Committee :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: `Eid (festival) means in Arabic gatherings that Ta&#8217;ud (comes again) on a habitual manner. It may come again in a year, a month, or a week. Therefore, the word &#8216;Eid means a day that comes again like `Eid-ul-Fitr (the Festival of Breaking the Fast) or Friday, the gathering on that day and the acts done as acts of worship or habits on that day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: Anything that is meant to worship Allah, seek to be closer to Him to get reward through doing so or any thing meant to be similar to disbelievers and the like is a Bid`ah that is included in the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected.</span>&#8221; This Hadith was reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. <strong>Celebrating the Prophet&#8217;s Mawlid, Mother&#8217;s Day, and National Day fall into this category.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one includes an act of worship that was not legislated by Allah. Moreover, it contains similarity to the Christians and other disbelievers. <strong>The second and the third are prohibited as it is imitating disbelievers</strong>. Whatever is in the interest of the Ummah (nation) and arranging its affairs as the Week of the Traffic, arranging the times of studying, holding meetings with employees to arrange work and the like are not acts of worship, they are of the innovated habits that are not included in the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected.&#8221;</span> Then, there will be no blame for doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 14777</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I am a married woman with children and I am a practicing Muslim &#8211; all praise be to Allah &#8211; but my husband smokes<strong> Shisha (hookah, water pipe)</strong>. I have advised him, in vain, to give it up. In fact, he has sworn by Allah that he will stop smoking it, but he has not done so. After this, I took an oath by Allah that, if he did not stop smoking, I would go to my parents, but he has not stopped and I have not gone to my parents. What should I do with my husband? What is the ruling on the oath that I took? What is the ruling on smoking Shisha? I hope that you will answer my letter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>First</strong>: smoking shisha is Haram (prohibited) because it is an obnoxious habit and includes many harmful effects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: It is Wajib (obligatory) on your husband to fulfill his oath and stop smoking Shisha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: You have done well to advise your husband to stop smoking Shisha. You should continue doing so and make Du‘a’ (supplication) to Allah for Him to guide your husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the oath that you broke, you have to make Kaffarah (expiation) for it and you should not go to stay with your parents.The Kaffarah is to feed ten Miskin (needy people), to clothe them, or to free a believing slave. If you are unable to do any of these things, you should observe Sawm (Fasting) for three days.<br />
May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Ruling on smoking and using hookah &#8211; Shaykh Ibn Baaz</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the ruling on smoking and using hookah? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Smoking and using hookah are prohibited, because they contain evil and much harm. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) made lawful for His servants all kinds of lawful and good things and made unlawful to them all kinds of evil things, as He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says to His Prophet (peace be upon him): <span style="color:#008000;">They ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) what is lawful for them (as food). Say: &#8220;Lawful unto you are At-Tayyibât [all kind of Halâl (lawful-good) foods which Allâh has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]</span>. Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says with regard to the description of His Prophet (peace be upon him): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibât (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabâ’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)&#8221;  </span>Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 157</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No type of smoking is from the lawful good things, but they are from the evil things due to their much harm. They are not from the lawful-good things which Allah (Exalted be He) permitted; therefore, they should be abandoned and o<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>ne should beware of approaching them and should strive against his evil soul to avoid these evil things, because the soul persists in evil, except those relieved by Allah&#8217;s Mercy.</strong></span> It is the duty of the believer to strive against his soul to set aside whatever harms him from these and other evil things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A 2005 WHO report states that smoking using a waterpipe poses a serious potential health hazard and is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. The average hookah session typically lasts more than 40 minutes, and consists of 50 to 200 inhalations that each range from 0.15 to 0.50 liters of smoke. <strong>In an hour-long smoking session of hookah, users consume about 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke of a cigarette</strong>. The chemical compositions of cigarette smoke and hookah smoke are different, however, as the workings of the charcoal in the modern hookah causes the tobacco mixture to be heated to a lower temperature, as opposed to the higher temperature in a cigarette where the tobacco is directly burnt. Consequently, the potential health effects of hookah smoke are expected to be very different.<sup id="cite_ref-Saad_58-0" class="reference"><br />

May Allah guide us all and grant us the means to make sincere repentance from all sins. Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace, Mercy and Blessings of Allah be upon you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a>&#8220;</a><span id="This was published on Sunday 7/5/1408 A.H. and this collection, vol. 13, p. 69."></span> :As you know, may Allah bestow His Mercy upon us all, that the ruler of Muslims, may Allah protect and guard him, gave directions for offering the <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">Rain Prayer </span></span>in the morning of Monday, 7 Jumadal-Ula, 1408 A.H., because <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>season is late this year and has not fallen in many places at its annually scheduled time. Muslims are in dire need of it, and they are desperately asking Allah to overwhelm them with His Mercy [Exalted and Sublime Be He], His Bounty and Kindness. He (Exalted and Glorified be He) has guided them to invoke and implore Him so that He grants them their needs with His Grace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most Glorified, assured them of answering their supplications, as He (Exalted and Glorified be He) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Ghafir, 40: 60" target="_blank" name="AndyourLordsaid:^InvokeMe,"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord said: &#8220;Invoke Me, I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islâmic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!</span>&#8220;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 186" target="_blank" name="AndwhenMyslavesaskyou(OMuhammad"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In other verses, He (Exalted and Glorified be He) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 55" target="_blank" name="InvokeyourLordwithhumility"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" style="color:#008000;" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 56" target="_blank" name="Anddonotdomischiefontheearth,"></a>And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order, and invoke Him with fear and hope. Surely, Allâh’s Mercy is (ever) near to the good-doers</span>&#8221; .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the early Muslims always turned to Allah seeking His Help in times of distress or adversity. He answered their invocations and granted them of His Bounties and Benevolence as He (Exalted and Glorified be He) said regarding the Battle of Badr,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 9" target="_blank" name="Remember)whenyousoughthelp"></a><span style="color:#008000;">(Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): &#8220;I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other (following one another) in succession</span>.&#8221;&#8221; .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When drought intensified in<span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Madinah </span>and its suburbs, Muslims requested the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to pray for <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain</span></span>. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> raised his hands while giving the Friday Sermon and prayed for <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>and repeated his supplication twice</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On another occasion he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out with them to the desert where he led them in<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> two Rak&#8217;ahs <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">prayer </span></span>similar to the &#8216;Eid <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">prayer</span></span></strong></span>. He supplicated his Lord asking Him for <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain</span></span>. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In this <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">prayer </span></span>he raised his hands and repeated the invocation many times and then inverted his garment.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Muslims also raised their hands in <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">prayer </span></span>and supplicated Allah. Then Allah sent down abundant <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain</span></span>, bestowed His Mercy upon them and removed their distress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted and Glorified be He) said: &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 21" target="_blank" name="IndeedintheMessengerofAll%C3%A2h"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allâh and the Last Day, and remembers Allâh much</span>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>most important means</strong></span> of obtaining Allah&#8217;s Mercy and being blessed with <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>is fearing Allah [Exalted and Sublime Be He], turning to Him in repentance from all sins, promoting all what is right and forbidding all what is evil, cooperating in matters of piety and righteousness, holding mutual consultation for the sake of Allah, advising each other with the truth and being steadfast in implementing it, being compassionate to the poor and the needy, consoling them and being generous to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted and Glorified be He) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 96" target="_blank" name="Andifthepeopleofthetowns"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwâ (piety), certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth</span>&#8221; till the end of the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He,Most Glorified, said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Talaq, 65: 2" target="_blank" name="Thenwhentheyareabouttoattain"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Talaq, 65: 4" target="_blank" name="Andthoseofyourwomenashave"></a><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted and Glorified be He) also said in another verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 56" target="_blank" name="Anddonotdomischiefontheearth,"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, Allâh’s Mercy is (ever) near to the doers of good</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 71" target="_blank" name="Thebelievers,menandwomen,are"></a><span style="color:#008000;">The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden); they perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give the Zakât, and obey Allâh and His Messenger. Allâh will have His Mercy on them. Surely Allâh is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</span>&#8220;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these noble verses, He (Exalted and Glorified be He) explained that fearing Allah, being kind to Allah&#8217;s servants and keeping upright and straight on the path of Allah are of the means of bringing about Allah&#8217;s Mercy to His servants, His kindness to them, sending down <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>and removing their distress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, fear Allah O servants of Allah! Be kind to His servants, and advise one another with truth and be steadfast and patient in doing so; cooperate among yourselves in acts piety and righteousness, promote what is right, forbid what is evil and repent altogether from all your sins. Hence your Sustainer (Exalted and Glorified be He) will encompass you with His Mercy upon you and send down blessed <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>for you. He will also give youwhatever you desire and withhold from you whatever you dislike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Almighty said: &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Nur, 24: 31" target="_blank" name="Andtellthebelievingwomento"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And all of you beg Allâh to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) advised us saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a name="Whoeverisnotmercifultoothers"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="405861"></span>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Whoever is not merciful to others will not be treated mercifully&#8221;</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Hadith he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a name="TheMostCompassionate(Allah)"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="405862"></span><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Compassionate (Allah) has mercy on those who are compassionate to people. If you show mercy to those on the earth, He Who is in the heaven will show mercy to you</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">&#8221; .</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;anic verses and Prophetic Hadiths urging people to observe piety, uprightness, mercy and kindness to those in need are many and well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah to rectify the affairs of all Muslims; to grant them sincere repentance from all sins; to send down the <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>for them out of His Grace and Bounty; to reconcile and unite their hearts on piety and good deeds; to protect everyone from the evils of their selves and to purify them from their sinful acts; to rid them of misguidance of tribulations; to support His Deen; to make His word the uppermost; to guide our rulers to what is good and beneficial forpeople and countries; to correct the behavior of their advisors and enable them to do all kinds of good. Indeed, He is the Grantor of all this and is the Most Omnipotent. Peace, Mercy and Blessings of Allah be upon you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b></b><b>Q 6: I have some non-Muslim and Muslim neighbors about whom I have some reservations. What is the ruling on exchanging visits with them?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b>Visits exchanged in such circumstance are a good thing enjoined by Islam when they are <strong>for the purpose of guidance, advice, and cooperation in righteousness and piety</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<a style="color:#008000;" name="Allah(GlorifiedandExaltedbe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="11401" class="tip"></span>“Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, ‘My Love is due to those who love one another for My Sake, who sit with one another for My Sake, who visit one another for My Sake, and who are generous to one another for My Sake.’”</span>&#8220;</span> (Related by Imam<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Malik </span>[may Allah be merciful to him] with a Sahih (authentic) Sanad (chain of narrators)][1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Also, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<a name="TherearesevenwhomAllahwill"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="11402" class="tip"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">There are seven whom Allah will shade with His Shade on the Day when there will be no shade but His Shade&#8230;”</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span> among them he (peace be upon him) mentioned: &#8220;<a name="Twomenwholoveeachotherfor"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="11402" class="tip"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">Two men who love each other for the sake of Allah, meeting for that and parting upon that.</span>”</span>&#8221; [2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The example given is that of two men, but the ruling is general and applies to two men or two women. Thus, if a Muslim visits another Muslim or non-Muslim for the purpose of calling them to Allah, teaching them and guiding them to goodness without seeking worldly gain or taking the Commands of Allah lightly, this is a good act.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">It is good for a Muslim woman to visit her sister in Islam and advise her to avoid Tabarruj (woman’s public display of her adornment or charms), unveiling the face or taking lightly what Allah prohibits. Similarly, it is good to visit her Christian or non-Christian female neighbor, such as a Buddhist woman or the like, to advise, teach, or instruct her. Actually, this comes under the heading of the Prophet’s words: &#8220;<a name="Religionissincerity(well-wishing)."></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="23000688" class="tip"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">Religion is sincerity (well-wishing). Religion is sincerity. Religion is sincerity.</span>”</span>&#8220;[3]  <strong>If she responds positively, all praise is to Allah; if she does not then you should give up the visits which do not serve any useful purpose.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Visiting for the purpose of gaining worldly benefits, playing, exchanging idle talks, eating or the like is not permissible to be made to non-Muslims, whether they are<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Christians </span>or others. Such visits may corrupt one’s religious commitment or morals, because the Kafirs (disbelievers) are enemies to us and we do not feel love towards them [as a reaction for their Shirk, disbelief, rejection of truth, enmity, sinning, transgression against Allah, etc. Ed]. Thus, we should not take them as protectors or confidants. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">However, visits are required when they are made for the purpose of calling to Allah, urging to do goodness, and warning against evil. In Surah (Qur’anic chapter) Al-Mumtahinah, Allah (Glorified be He) says: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: &#8220;Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh: we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allâh Alone&#8221;&#8221; </span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[</span><span id="ContentParagraph">Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60: 4]</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwa no. 20842</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Most mobiles have musical ring tones. Is it permissible to use these musical tones instead of the regular ring tone?  Could you kindly advise and direct us to what is beneficial for Muslims? May Allah reward you and protect you from harm! </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not permissible to use musical tones</strong></span> on mobiles or other devices, because listening to musical instruments is prohibited as indicated by Shar‘y (Islamic legal) evidence. It is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>enough to use the regular ring tone</strong></span>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>An extract from my letter I sent to His Excellency Shaykh</b><b> Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy </b><b>concerning</b><b> the difference between `Ibadah and obedience</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On 2/4//1392 A.H.,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy </span>sent me a letter no. 1526, dated 2 Safar, 1392 A.H. explaining his case and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Tufayl&#8217;s, </span>his successor in the leadership of Islamic Group. I replied in the same year when I was the President of the Islamic University in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah </span>and the following is some of my reply:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some brothers from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Milbar </span>living in the country told me that Your Eminence opine that <em>`Ibadah is clarified by obedience and that when someone obeys another, he worships him. `Ibadah is also interpreted as enslavement and idolization. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar ibn Ahmad Al-Millibary, </span>owner of Al-Salsabil Magazine, wrote to me concerning this issue asserting what is mentioned about you and the Group. He sent me a copy of a survey pertaining to this question. You will find an enclosed copy of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This question appears strange for me so I determined to write to you before I receive your letter to know whether these statements which are attributed to you are true. So, please let me know your opinion. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I see that obedience has a wider scope than `Ibadah. Every act of `Ibadah a person does in compliance with Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah is seen as obedience, but not every act of obedience to anything other than Allah (Exalted be He) is seen as `Ibadah</strong></span>. This matter needs more elaboration. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Obedience to Allah (Exalted be He) is seen as `Ibadah when a person seeks to please Him. However, it may be valid or corrupt depending on whether the requirements of `Ibadah are met.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Please tell me in details your view on this question. It adds further explanation that `Ibadah may be denied when tainted with Shirkas Allah says concerning Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Kafirun, 109: 3" target="_blank" name="NorwillyouworshipthatwhichIworship"></a>&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Nor will you worship that which I worship</span></strong>.&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Kafirun, 109: 3</span> . Ibadah is negated because of their acts of Shirk. It is known that they worship Allah (Exalted be He) during times of hardships through showing Tawhid, performing Hajj and `Umrah, offering Sadaqah and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since these acts of `Ibadah are spoiled by Shirk, disbelief in the Hereafter and other kinds of disbelief during times of prosperity, it is permissible to negate the `Ibadah of people who show it. Furthermore, I would like to explain another point.<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> The person who obeys the authorities or rulers in something forbidden by Allah (Exalted be He) is not seen worshipping them when he does not believe in the permissibility of obedience to anyone in something opposing Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah. They rather obey these rules out of fear of their evils or vain desires while they know that they are sinful. Due to their act of obedience, such persons are sinners, not Mushriks, unless they obey such rulers in matters which do not involve Shirk. Examples of these matters include striking, killing, and taking someone&#8217;s money unjustly.</strong></span> There are many other examples that come under this heading. I think this view is known by the people of knowledge whose status is below yours. I find it imperative to ask you about this and know your detailed opinion so that I can refute any claim against you and support you with sure knowledge and show the truth concerning the Islamic Group to any one who seeks it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If what is attributed to you is true, we can discuss it thoroughly and examine the problematic issues using the evidence. The truth is the long-sought aim of everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah (Exalted be He) to grant us success to do what pleases Him and to comprehend His Religion and to adhere to it. May Allah purify our hearts and deeds and make the truth our long-sought aim wherever we are, for He is the Most Generous. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b></b><b></b><b>Q: Could you please tell us about the reward that Allah prepares for the patient in this world and in the hereafter and those who are obedient to Him (Exalted be He)?</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b>Allah (Glorified be He) created mankind and Jinn (creatures created from fire) to worship Him Alone and not to associate any partner with Him. He (Exalted be He) thus says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;And I (Allâh) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone).&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody" style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Dhariyat, 51: 56</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"> &#8220;O mankind! Worship your Lord (Allâh), Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become Al-Muttaqûn (the pious &#8211; See V.2:2).&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 21</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The `Ibadah (worship) that mankind and Jinn are created for and commanded to do is to obey Allah (Exalted be He), avoid His prohibitions, and mention Him abundantly. The essence of `Ibadah is to believe in Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and to manifest this through making Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to Allah Alone, fearing Allah Alone, longing for His Mercy, and being sincere to Him in all forms of `Ibadah such as Salah (Prayer), Sawm (Fast), and so on.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) promises His obedient slaves that He will bestow upon them abundant goodness and praised rewards in this world and in the hereafter. Allah (Exalted be He) promised them that He will grant them Jannah (Paradise) and dignity in the Hereafter. Thus, Allah (Exalted be He) says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"> &#8220;So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for Al-Muttaqûn (the pious)&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Hud, 11: 49</span></span><strong><span class="HarfBody"><br />
</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) also says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;&#8230;but give glad tidings to As-Sâbirûn (the patient).&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 155</span></span><strong><span class="HarfBody"><br />
</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"> &#8220;Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly! To Allâh we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 156</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;They are those on whom are the Salawât (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.&#8221; </strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 157</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning.&#8221; </strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 10</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Whoever works righteousness &#8211; whether male or female &#8211; while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islâmic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter).&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 97</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;<a style="color:#000000;" name="Nobodyisgivenablessingbetter"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="15206" class="tip"></span>Nobody is given a blessing better and greater than patience.</span>&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[1]</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;<a style="color:#000000;" name="Wonderfularetheaffairsofa"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="10537" class="tip"></span>Wonderful are the affairs of a believer, for there is good in every affair of them. If they have an occasion to feel delight, they thank &#8216;Allah&#8217;, thus there is good for them in it; and if they suffer from an affliction, they endure it patiently, which is good for them. This is not the case with anyone else except a believer.</span>&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[2]</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the patient person has a praised reward in this world and in the hereafter or he will be rewarded in Jannah and dignified in the hereafter. It is worth mentioning that such a reward will only be given to the patient person who shows patience regarding being pious, adherence to obedience of Allah, and enduring the hardships that they encounter in this world; poverty, illness, and so on. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to Allâh, etc.) that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Al-Birr is (the quality of) the one who believes in Allâh, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 177</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;&#8230;and who are patient in extreme poverty and ailment (disease) and at the time of fighting (during the battles). Such are the people of the truth and they are Al-Muttaqûn (the pious).&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 177</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Generally speaking, patience and piety always lead to praised consequences. Allah (Exalted be He) tells the believers regarding their enemy: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">&#8220;But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaqûn [the pious &#8211; See V.2:2], not the least harm will their cunning do to you. Surely, Allâh surrounds all that they do.&#8221; </span></strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 120</span></span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q : A brother from Dar&#8217;a, Syria asks: What is the correct opinion about the stories narrated from one of the famous leaders of Sufism, Al-Sayyid <strong>Ahmad Al-Rifa&#8217;y</strong> that he visited the Mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in Al-Madinah and supplicated at the Prophet&#8217;s grave. The Messenger (peace be upon him) then stretched his hand out to him and he kissed it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">This is a widespread belief among the followers of his Tariqah (Sufi order). It is a belief they hold firmly, even though he lived in the 6th century A.H. How true is this story?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">A : This is false and baseless, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) died as decreed by Allah (Glorified be He) who says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30" target="_blank" name="Verilyyou(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Verily you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will die, and verily they (too) will die.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> [Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">According to a Sahih Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah has angels roaming around the land; if they find anyone greeting me, they carry back these greetings to me.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">There is no one who sends greetings upon me but Allah will restore my soul to me so that I may return his greeting.</span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) said: <a name="Themostexcellentofyourdays"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">The most excellent of your days is Friday; so invoke more blessings on me on that day, for your blessings will be submitted to me.</span> The people asked: O Messenger of Allah, how can it be that our blessings will be submitted to you while your body is decayed? He replied: <span style="color:#008000;">Allah, the Exalted, has prohibited the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets. </span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths which say similar things but it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that he would shake hands with anybody</strong></span>. This indicates that this story is false. Even if we were to assume that it is true, then it could be that this was a <strong>shaytaan</strong> (devil) who shook hands with him in order to deceive him and lead him and others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What all Muslims have to do is to fear Allah and adhere to His Shari`ah, which is indicated in His Noble Book and in the Sunnah of His trustworthy Messenger, and beware of anything that goes against that. May Allah reform the Muslims and grant them understanding of His religion and cause them to adhere to His Shari`ah, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The Prophet (peace be upon him said): <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#008000;">Five kinds of animals are harmful and may be killed even in the Haram (all areas within the Sacred Sanctuary of Makkah): The crow, the kite, the scorpion, the mouse, and the rabid dog </span></span></span><strong><span id="ContentParagraph">[1]<a href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/" target="_blank"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#008000;">.</span></span></a></span></strong><span class="HarfBody">According to another authentic narration, the viper was mentioned among the animals that may be killed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">This authentic Hadith reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) indicates the <strong>permissibility of killing harmful creatures, such as ants, cockroaches, mosquitoes, flies, and predators</strong>. </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">However, when harm is perceived, they take the same ruling of the harmful animals mentioned in the Hadith. May Allah grant us success.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: <span style="color:#993300;">We received a question from Makkah and it reads: Some Du`ah (callers to Islam) and lecturers say at the end of their lecture, &#8220;Whatever is good is from Allah while evil and sin are from ourselves and Satan.&#8221; What is the ruling on saying that? Please, enlighten us. May Allah enlighten you!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>There is nothing wrong &#8211; I see &#8211; with saying that, as it is the truth</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A lecturer, teacher, preacher or anyone else giving advice should observe Taqwa (fear/wariness of offending Allah) and seek the truth. If they do well, it is due to Allah&#8217;s Favor on them and if they err, it is due to their negligence and Satan. Allah (Glorified be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) are free from such error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah is the Grantor of success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Fatwas of Ibn Baz &gt; Volume 8 &gt; A note concerning a false report circulated by some ignorant people</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah. May Allah&#8217;s Blessings and Peace be upon the slave and Messenger of Allah, our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have come across a false report that is being disseminated by some ignorant people who have little understanding of the religion of Allah.<b> The text of this report is as follows:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><b> </b><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Peace and blessings be upon the noblest of the messengers, our Master Muhammad (peace be upon him), and upon his family and Companions! Allah (Exalted be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#993300;" title="Surah Yunus, 10: 62" target="_blank" name="Nodoubt!Verily,theAuliy%C3%A2%E2%80%99of"></a><span style="color:#008000;">No doubt! Verily, the Auliyâ’ of Allâh [i.e. those who believe in the Oneness of Allâh and fear Allâh much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden), and love Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)], no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve.</span> Allah is Most Truthful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">My Muslim brother, my Muslim sister. A thirteen-year-old girl was inflicted with hard illness and the doctor failed to treat her. One night her sickness grew worse and she wept until sleep overtook her. In her dream, she saw Sayyidah<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Zaynab </span>(may Allah be pleased with her). She put some drops in her mouth, and when she woke up she was completely healed from her sickness. Sayyidah<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Zaynab </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) asked her to write this story thirteen times and distribute it to the Muslims to demonstrate the power of the Creator, may He be Exalted, and how it is manifested in His signs and His creation, Exalted be He above all that they associate with Him. The girl did what she was asked to do, and this is what happened:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>1 – The first copy </b>fell into the hands of a poor man, who wrote it out and distributed it. Thirteen days later, the Lord willed that this poor man should become rich.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>2 – The second copy </b>fell into the hands of a worker who ignored it. Thirteen days later he lost his job.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>3 – The third copy </b>fell into the hands of a rich man, who refused to write it out. Thirteen days later, he lost all the riches that he possessed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">Hasten, O Muslim brother or sister, after reading this story, to copy it out thirteen times and distribute it to people, so that you may get what you wish for from the Most Generous Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings upon our Master Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I read this false report, I thought it is necessary to point out that the benefits and good things that the author claims will come to those who copy and distribute it, and the bad things that will happen to those who ignore it and do not disseminate it further, are all lies and baseless. Rather, they are fabrications of the liars and charlatans. They want to divert the Muslims from putting their trust in their Lord alone, with no partner or associate, to bring them benefits and ward off harm, as well as taking the permissible means as prescribed in the Shari`ah (Islamic law). They also want them to put their trust in someone or something other than Allah to bring benefits and ward off harm and to take false means that are not permitted or prescribed in the Shari`ah, which lead them to become attached to something other than Allah and to worship someone other than Him. Undoubtedly, this is one of the plots of the enemies against the Muslims, who want to divert them away from their true Din (religion) of Islam by any means possible. The Muslims should beware of these plots and not be deceived by them. The Muslim should pay no attention to this false report and similar reports which appear from time to time. Warnings have been issued about several of them in the past. It is not permissible for a Muslim to copy out this and similar reports, or to distribute them under any circumstances. Rather, doing so is an evil action and a person who does that is committing a sin; there is the fear that he will be punished in this world and in the Hereafter, because this isBid`ah (innovation in religion) whose evil is great and whose punishment is severe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This report is a kind of reprehensible Bid`ah and is one of the means that lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and overestimation of Ahl-ul-Bayt (members of the Prophet&#8217;s extended Muslim family) and others among the dead; calling upon them instead of Allah, seeking their help, and thinking that they can bring benefit or ward off harm from those who call upon them and seek their help. It is also a kind of telling lies about Allah. Allah (Glorified be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 105" target="_blank" name="Itisonlythosewhobelievenot"></a><span style="color:#008000;">It is only those who believe not in the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh, who fabricate falsehood, and it is they who are liars</span>. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <a name="Hewhoinnovatesthingsinour"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="18424" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#008000;">He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected.</span></span> (Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Muslims who receive this letter should tear it up, destroy it, warn people against it and pay no attention to any promises or warnings that it may contain, because these are false reports that have no sound basis and nothing good or bad will result from it. But the one who invents it, those who copy it out and distribute it, and those who promote it and disseminate it among the Muslims are all sinful, because all of that comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression which Allah has forbidden in His Book, where He (Glorified be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 2" target="_blank" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Violatenot"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwâ (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is Severe in punishment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to keep us and all the Muslims safe and sound from all evil. Allah is Sufficient for us and He is the best to deal with those who fabricated this report and similar reports, and introduced into the religion of Allah things that have nothing to do with it. We ask Allah to deal with them as they deserve, for telling lies about Allah, disseminating falsehood, calling people to the means that lead to Shirk and exaggeration about the dead and distracting them with something that will harm them and will not benefit them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sincerity towards Allah and His slaves demands that we point this out. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon His slave and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;">Content &gt; Volume 8 &gt; Answers to some questions submitted by students to His Eminence &gt; How to wake up for Fajr Prayer everyday  </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q : <span style="color:#993300;">What are the methods I can use in order not to miss the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer? I go to bed early but wake up after sunrise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Every Muslim has to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>fear Allah</strong></span> (Exalted be He) and offer the Five Obligatory Daily Prayers at their appointed times. He has to try all means that help him in this regard. One of the means that he can try in order to offer the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer in congregation is to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>sleep early</strong></span> and to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>set the alarm</strong></span> for the Fajr prayer time. In this way he will be able to arise at the right time and attend the congregational Prayer. He should also<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ask Allah (Exalted be He) to help him</strong></span> wake up at Fajr time. Another means he can try is to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>recite the Dhikr (remembrance of Allah)</strong></span> which is said upon sleeping. This way, Allah (Exalted be He) will help him wake up to offer Fajr Prayer in congregation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q 4: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for people who suffer from jinn possession to seek the help of soothsayers in order to kill or exorcise the jinn possessing them?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for them to do so because <strong>sorcery</strong> and <strong>soothsaying</strong> can only be performed with the aid of <strong>devils</strong> whose help is attained when the performer attributes them as partners to Allah in worship. A soothsayer is known to have contact with the jinn who inform him of what is going on at certain places. For example, so-and-so died in the Levant (the region covering Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine) and the like matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Devils pass information about future events to each other until it finally reaches the soothsayer. When he passes this information to an ignorant person, the latter comes to believe that the soothsayer or fortuneteller possesses knowledge of <em>Ghayb</em> (Unseen) where in fact the source of this information is Devil. A soothsayer may also seek the help of powerful devils to exorcise another devil possessing the person. This can only be done if the possessed person fulfills their desire that they be worshipped beside Allah or that the possessed person makes vows for their sake or slaughters animals for the sake of drawing near to them. Once their desire is fulfilled, the Shayateen start to threaten the possessing devil with death or imprisonment unless he surrenders to their commands. At that point, the possessing devil will have no choice but to obey his master devils and then leave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is not a valid excuse to seek the help of soothsayers on the basis that some people benefit from their help</strong>. Those who worship jinn seek to get benefit from them even though the jinn themselves may cause them greater harm by possessing them or robbing their property. Thus, it is not a valid excuse to join jinn in the worship of Allah on the pretext of seeking their benefit to cure the illnesses of humans. During the pre-Islamic era, people used to speak to the idols. The Shayatin would incarnate the idols and would speak with people whom they tempted into worshipping them beside Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The third question of Fatwa no. 6430</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q3: What is the ruling on a Muslim who boards a crowded plane and is forced to one of the following cases?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">1. A group of women surround him; two on each side, one in front of him and a fourth one behind him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> 2. He sits face to face with a non-Mahram (not a spouse or an unmarriageable relative) woman, Arab or other.</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> 3. He sits beside a non-Mahram woman who may be very old.</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> 4. His seat faces the flight hostess who sits in her seat for a short period after takeoff and before landing of the plane. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Sometimes, there are no empty seats left on the plane, or the passengers refuse to exchange seats so that the crew cannot do anything to help him change an inappropriate situation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>If traveling by plane is necessary and the cases you mentioned are inevitable, you should choose the case which involves less Fitnah (temptation) based on the rule of applying the lesser of two harms or evils. Additionally, you should lower your gaze as much as possible.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>However, if traveling by plane is not necessary and you have other alternatives, you should avoid that to guard your faith.</strong></span></p>
<p>May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>
