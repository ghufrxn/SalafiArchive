<p style="text-align:justify;">This following is notes from the tele-lecture…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise belongs to Allāh; to Him alone belong all greatness. He is the Glorified, the One Who no one besides Him owns all the Greatness and Power. The dominion belongs to Him and all praise belongs to Him. All of the affairs are in His Hands; everything comes from Him and everything shall return to Him. He is to be praised and He is the All-Great. He is near His servants with His Knowledge and is aware of everything they say do and think; absolutely nothing is a secret from Him. He knows everything that is in their souls and is aware of what they do in private and in public. He is the Only One Who gives and withholds; He is the One Who debases and the One Who raises others. The One Who makes some people noble and lowers others; the One Who gives life and causes death. There is nothing and no one who deserves worship except Him. He &#8211; The Exalted &#8211; said about Himself: “<strong>To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, and He is the Most High, the Most Great</strong>.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>All praises and thanks be to Allāh, Who (Alone) created the heavens and the earth, and originated the darkness and the light, yet those who disbelieve hold others as equal with their Lord. He it is Who has created you from clay, and then has decreed a stated term (for you to die). And there is with Him another determined term (for you to be resurrected), yet you doubt (in the Resurrection). And He is Allāh (to be worshipped Alone) in the heavens and on the earth, He knows what you conceal and what you reveal, and He knows what you earn (good or bad).</strong>” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى) sent His Messenger as one who would give glad tidings and warn the people; he was a shining light who called others to Allāh. He was at the forefront of those who were humble; he was humble to Allāh, the Lord of all that exists. He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: “<strong>Do not excessively praise me as the Christians excessively praised ‘Īsā Ibn Maryam; I am only a slave, so say the slave of Allāh and His Messenger</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) used to visit the sick, attend funerals and would accept invitations when people invited him. He used to ride a donkey and eat bread made out of barley and he would dip it in old oil when people would invite him. He performed Ḥajj on a very weak animal and was wearing clothing that was not even worth four dirhams and in spite of this he said: “<strong>O Allāh make this a Ḥajj in which there will be no showing off</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When his Companions (عنھم الله رضي) saw him, they loved him more than anyone else and in spite of this they would never stand up for him when he entered because they knew he disliked that. He used to milk his own animal with his hands, fix his shoes with his own hands and he served himself in his house, and he was the one whom the entire Arabian Peninsula was under his control yet he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: “Whoever is humble for Allāh, Allāh would raise him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) knew that establishing Tawḥīd and directing all forms of worship to Allāh is might and whoever does this is the mighty person and has reached the highest rank for the human being; a rank that no one else can reach except by fulfilling Tawḥīd. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) nurtured his Companions upon this principle and he knew that having arrogance prevents the perfection of Tawḥīd.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Arrogance and Tawḥīd cannot perfectly join in one soul; it contradicts the perfection of Tawḥīd. Tawḥīd necessitates that a servant humbles himself before his Lord and likewise he is humble to the created beings. The humble person who has fulfilled Tawḥīd does not see himself as being better than anyone else. He knows that the bounty is in the Hand of Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى) and he does not see himself as having prestige over anyone else because this prestige comes from none other than Allāh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a servant completes Tawḥīd and builds this foundation of Tawḥīd, he will do so revering and worshipping Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى) , having a complete and perfect love for Allāh which will cause him not to compete with Allāh in His Greatness and Majesty, which is befitting to nothing and no one other than Allāh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said teaching his Companions: “No one will enter Jannah if he has within his heart even a mustard seed of arrogance.” It was said: “O Messenger of Allāh, men like to have nice clothing and shoes.” So the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) responded: “<strong>Indeed Allāh is Beautiful and He loves beauty. Arrogance is rejecting the truth and disdaining the people</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: “<strong>Whoever drags his garment out of arrogance, Allāh will not even look at him on the Day of Resurrection</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also informed us saying: “<strong>The arrogant people will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection as small as ants and they will be covered with humiliation</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another ḥadīth the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: “Once a man was walking in a garment he was very impressed with and was combing the front of his hair (he was arrogant about his clothing and hair). Allāh caused the earth to swallow him and he will continue to be swallowed until the Day of Resurrection.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you know O servant of Allāh that you were created from nothing but dirt and will return to dirt, you should not put yourself above your level and give yourself any status you do not deserve. If you know this you would know that this only returns to the affair of Tawḥīd. That a person is only as good as he is in actions in worshipping his Lord and the only reason each person was created was to single out his Lord in worship. If you know this, it would cause you to fear giving your weak self any status it does not deserve or any position it has not earned. Allāh has made signs for the people of Īmān and signs for the people of arrogance. Allāh has made punishments for those who are arrogant on the earth without right just as He has made rewards for those who are humble. From the greatest of punishments for those who are arrogant is as Allāh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I shall turn away from My Āyāt (verses of the Qur’ān) those who behave arrogantly on the earth, without a right, and (even) if they see all the Āyāt (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they will not believe in them. And if they see the way of righteousness (monotheism, piety, and good deeds), they will not adopt it as the Way, but if they see the way of error (polytheism, crimes and evil deeds), they will adopt that way, that is because they have rejected Our Āyāt (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) and were heedless (to learn a lesson) from them.”</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The signs that Allāh will turn away from the arrogant people are both the signs in nature, which are evidence to His Oneness and likewise the signs and verses of His Book. He will turn them away such that they will look at the evidence all around them in nature, which point to the fact that the Creator is One and that He alone should be worshipped, they could have the evidence right in front of them in the Qur’ān and read it but not understand it. Because of their arrogance Allāh would turn their hearts away from pondering the truth, and this is the greatest of punishments &#8211; having a blind heart; having a covering over the heart such that the truth is presented to a person and they cannot even recognize it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is befitting for the servant to keep in mind is that he is a slave who has been commanded to make his entire life for the Sake of Allāh. He was created to worship his Lord and he was not created to have arrogance and make himself better than others or try to become the ruler over others and compel others. Whenever someone’s soul whispers to him that he is better than others and he has these thoughts of arrogance, he is to remember how great Allāh is. That He (Allāh) is the Only One Who is worthy of this Greatness, and by doing so the person humbles himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imām Ibn al-Qayyim (الله رحمھ) mentions about the people of Īmān that when they feel within themselves that they are better than others, they remember how great and exalted their Lord is and that He is the Only One deserving this Greatness. And they should remember how angry He becomes with whoever tries to compete with Him in this Greatness. By doing so the servants humble themselves in their hearts and souls and they get rid of these feelings of arrogance. This is the peak of having humility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Allāh blesses someone and allows them to gain some understanding of the Dīn, allows them to learn some of the legislative rulings or He blesses them to be a devout worshiper or one who remembers Allāh often or blesses him to be one who fasts often or stands the night in prayer or any of the other acts of worship and because of that blessing the servant feels that he is better than those who do not perform these acts of worship, he feels that he has a higher status than other people because of this blessing he has been given, he should realize that this is part of having insufficient knowledge of Allāh and His Names and Attributes and having a lack of reverence for Allāh (سبحانه و تعالى).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take a minute and ponder with me, O my brother about the story of Qārūn and how he was arrogant and thought he was better than everyone else. Allāh mentions his story in Sūrah Qaṣaṣ:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Verily, Qārūn (Korah) was of Mūsā’s (Moses) people, but he behaved arrogantly towards them. And We gave him of the treasures, that of which the keys would have been a burden to a body of strong men.When his people said to him: ‘Do not be glad (with ungratefulness to Allāh’s Favours). Verily! Allāh likes not those who are glad (with ungratefulness to Allāh’s Favours). But seek, with that (wealth) which Allāh has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of legal enjoyment in this world, and do good as Allāh has been good to you, and seek not mischief in the land. Verily, Allāh likes not the Mufsidūn (those who commit great crimes and sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischief-makers, corrupts). He said: ‘This has been given to me only because of knowledge I possess.’ Did he not know that Allāh had destroyed before him generations, men who were stronger than him in might and greater in the amount (of riches) they had collected. But the Mujrimūn (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, etc.) will not be questioned of their sins (because Allāh knows them well, so they will be punished without account).”</strong> [4] “<strong>So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling place. Then he had no group or party to help him against Allāh, nor was he one of those who could save themselves.”</strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After mentioning this story Allāh reminds His servants and gives them a get principle when He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>That home of the Hereafter (i.e. Paradise), We shall assign to those who rebel not against the truth with pride and oppression in the land nor do mischief by committing crimes. And the good end is for the Muttaqūn.</strong>” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ponder upon this with me, O my bother &#8211; may Allāh bless you &#8211; two great statements in which the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) clarified to you the virtue of being humble for the Sake of Allāh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of them is: “<strong>Whoever leaves alone some clothing out of humbleness for the Sake of Allāh and he is able to wear that clothing, Allāh will call him on the Day of Resurrection in front of all of the creation and give him the choice to wear whichever of the garments of īmān he wishes.”</strong> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by this ḥadīth is whoever is living amongst people who are middle class and they dress in a way that is normal (they do not wear very poor clothing or very fancy clothing) and this person himself is able to wear the clothing of the rich people but so that he fits in with the others and so that their hearts are not hurt when they see him wearing clothing they are not able to wear, he dresses as they do. Whoever does this out of humility for the Sake of Allāh will get this great reward. He will be called in front of the creation on the Day of Judgement and will be given the choice to wear whichever of the garments of īmān he wishes. However, if a person is living amongst people who wear nice clothing, he should wear the same as they wear because, “Indeed Allāh is Beautiful and He loves beauty.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second ḥadīth that I would like you to ponder with me about is the statement of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم): <strong>“Shall I not inform you of the people of Jannah?” His Companions said: “Please do.” He said: “Every weak person (i.e. he is not arrogant); if this person swears in the Name of Allāh then Allāh will make whatever he swears to come true.” He then said: “Shall I not inform you of the people of the Hellfire?” They said: “Please do.” He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: “Every person who is rough, harsh and arrogant (in the way that he walks; the one who struts arrogantly when he walks).”</strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would like to conclude &#8211; may Allāh bless you &#8211; by informing you of some of the means to gain this humility, to make ourselves humble for the Sake of Allāh. In doing so I will site some of the statements of Imām Ibn al-Qayyim in his book Ar-Rūh in which he said that humility comes from having knowledge of Allāh and knowing His Names and Attributes and the characteristics of Majesty that belong to Him. Likewise, it comes from revering Him, loving Him and giving Him His due respect. This humility also comes from a person knowing himself and knowing the details of his own shortcomings and knowing how very imperfect he is and knowing all of his mistakes and the outcomes of all of his mistakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result of knowing these things a person becomes humble. His heart breaks in front of Allāh and he lowers the wing of humility to the servants of Allāh. He does not consider himself to be better than anyone else and he does not consider himself to have any rights over anyone else. Rather, he believes that everyone is better than him and that he owes something to everyone else. This state of being humble is something that Allāh only gives to those whom He loves and those who are close to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allāh to make us all from those who are humble for the Sake of Allāh and who are humble towards the servants of Allāh. And we ask Allāh to make us from those who love Him and those whom He loves. We ask Him to make us from those who are merciful towards the other servants of Allāh and we ask Him to forgive all of our shortcomings and sins and to grant us success in achieving what He loves and is pleased with. And we ask Him to cause us to live upon Islām, Tawḥīd and the Sunnah and to die following nothing but Islām, Tawḥīd and the Sunnah. And Allāh is the Highest and Most Great, and He knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shaykh</em> started off by saying that the <em>shayateen</em> from mankind and <em>jinn</em> have misguided many of the slaves of <strong>Allaah</strong> by three mighty deviations that are nothing but lies upon <strong>Allaah</strong>.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Taking people away from the texts i.e The Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and the <em>Sunnah</em> of <em>Muhammad</em> <em>(sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> to the opinions, desires and allegiances.</li>
<li>Glorifying ignorance amongst the people so much so that it became an objective that the majority of the people be upon that mannerism of ignorance.</li>
<li>Glorifying or thinking of some scholars as being holy and infallible.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result, it is necessary to clarify the straight path of <strong>Allaah</strong> and thus the <em>Shaykh</em> outlined some principles needed by the student of knowledge that he/she can use as a light on the path towards his/her <strong>Lord</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These principles include:-</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Allaah</strong> has clarified to the people the path of truth and the way to know the truth.</li>
<li>It is a must to bring the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and <em>Sunnah</em> of <em>Muhammad</em> <em>(sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> above and beyond the intellect and analogy of the people.</li>
<li>It a must to understand the book and the <em>Sunnah</em> upon the understanding of the<em> salaf-us-saalih.</em></li>
<li>It is a must to know that the truth is being upon the understanding of the <em>salaf-us-saalih</em> or anybody upon that understanding i.e the scholars of this <em>deen</em> that have followed the first generations in <em>ihsaan</em>(perfection).</li>
<li>We must believe that the truth is always present in every time and every generation and it is not possible that you would have a time, generation or century in which there is no person guiding the people to the truth.</li>
<li>It is a must to know that even though the scholars are those who are guiding the people to the truth, it doesn’t mean that they are infallible and cannot or may not go against the truth even in one single matter.</li>
<li>Whoever tries to seek the proof from the book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, he should never ever leave it for the statement of anybody else regardless of who that person may be but rather he must follow the book of <strong>Allaah</strong> and the <em>Sunnah</em> of <em>Muhammad (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em>.</li>
<li>The truth is independent of any man but the truth cannot be known except through the men who transmit it.</li>
<li>If the proof contradicts the statements of men, it is <em>waajib</em> upon us to bring forward the proof ahead of the statements of men.</li>
<li>Whoever is ignorant of the proofs of the <em>Quraan</em> and <em>Sunnah</em> and understanding of the <em>salaf-us-saalih</em>must go back to the rulings of the scholars.</li>
<li>Nobody after the Messenger of <strong>Allaah</strong> <em>(sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> can be obeyed in everything he commands and forbids.</li>
<li>It is not permissible to say that every <em>mujtahid</em> (one who has the tools and strives to derive rulings from the <em>Quraan</em> and <em>Sunnah</em>) is correct. The truth is only one and cannot be more than one.</li>
<li>The people of the <em>Sunnah</em> will suspect/accuse the opinions of people but will never accuse/suspect the religion of <strong>Allaah</strong>.</li>
<li>It is not permissible for anybody to delve into <em>ijtihaad</em> during times of calamity except if he is well qualified and has the capacity to be upon <em>ijtihaad</em>.</li>
<li>It is not correct to use as a proof against those who are calling to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> with the understanding of the <em>salaf-us-saalih</em> that the four <em>imaams</em> of the four <em>madhahib</em> have more precedence to be followed than the pious predecessors of this <em>Ummah</em>.</li>
<li>The people of the <em>Sunnah</em> will refute and correct whoever goes against the proofs of the Book and the<em>Sunnah</em> even if the one who went against the proofs is a <em>Shaykh</em> of the <em>Sunnah</em>.</li>
<li><strong>IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE</strong>: It is a must to warn against the people of innovation and desires, to warn against their statements, and this is the way of the companions of <em>Muhammad (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> and those who followed them from the <em>Taabi’oon</em> and those who follow them in <em>ihsaan</em> till the Day of Judgment.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shaykh</em> brought an abundance of proofs from the <em>Quraan</em> and <em>Sunnah</em> as well as the statements of our pious predecessors in explaining the aforementioned points.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A must listen for those who wish to acquaint themselves with the truth!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask <strong>Allaah</strong> to make us align ourselves to the truth and the people of truth and rid us of the sickness of blind following anyone, and to make us avid followers of Muhammad <em>(sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam).</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa Billaahi Tawfeeq</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Wa SallAllaahu wa Sallaama wa Barak &#8216;alaa Nabiyanna Muhammad wa &#8216;alaa &#8216;Alyhi wa Sahbyhi wa Sallam</em></p>
