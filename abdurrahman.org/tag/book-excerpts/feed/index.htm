										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus whoever spends something today will benefit from it tomorrow and whoever does not spend will come to find nothing, and he will have a great loss in the house of dwelling (in the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Salaf said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>O son of Adam, you will only live on the Day of Judgment in what you have built, and you will find on that day what possessions you have prepared in your life</strong>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A women entered upon &#8216;A&#8217;ishah (radiy Allaahu anha), and her hand was paralysed. She said, “O mother of the Believers, I went to sleep yesterday and my hand was healthy, and I woke up and it was paralysed. ‘A’ishah said, “How is that?” She said, “I had wealthy parents, and my Father used to pay zakat, host guests, and give to beggars, and he did not see any good except that he would do it. As for my mother, she was stingy, and did nothing good with my Father’s wealth. Then my Father died, and my mother died only two months after him. So I saw my Father in a dream last night, and he was wearing two yellow garments and in front of him was a flowing river. I said, “Father, what is this?’ He said, “Whoever does good in this life will see it, this is what Allah has given me.” I said, “What has happened to my mother?” He asked, “Your Mother dies?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, “She has been turned away from me, so look for her on your left” So I turned to my left, and I saw my mother standing naked, covering her lower half with a rag and in her hand was a piece of fat. She was calling out, “My sadness, my thirst&#8217; When she became tired she would rub the fat with her hand and then lick it, while in front of her was a flowing river. I said, ‘O mother, why are you crying out of thirst, and there is a flowing river in front of you?’ She said, ‘I am not allowed to drink from it.’ I said, Can I give you some of the water?’ She said, ‘I wish you would do that.’ So I filled my hand with water and let her drink, and when she swallowed it I heard a voice on my right, ‘Whoever has given this woman water, may his hand be paralysed,’ and they repeated it twice. Then I awoke and my hand was paralysed, and I am not able to do anything with it. ‘A’ishah asked: ‘Did you recognise the rag she was wearing?’ I said, ‘Yes, O Mother of the Believers, it was exactly the same one I saw her wearing, for I had never seen my mother give anything as charity, except that one day my Father slaughtered a bull. So a beggar came to ask for some, so my mother gave him a bone that had some fat on it. And I saw one day that a beggar asked her for charity, so she gave him that exact rag.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A&#8217;ishah (radiy Allaahu anha) said, Allah is the Most Great! Allah has told the truth, and the Messenger has delivered the message.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَهُ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;So whoever does an atom&#8217;s weight of good will see it,<br />
And whoever does an atom&#8217;s weight of evil will see it&#8221;</strong></span><br />
[al-Azalzalah (99): 7-8]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(36. Verily, the number of months with Allah is twelve months (in a year), so was it ordained by Allah on the Day when He created the heavens and the earth; <strong>of them four are sacred</strong>. That is the right religion, so <strong>wrong not yourselves therein</strong>, and fight against the Mushrikin idolaters collectively as they fight against you collectively. But know that Allah is with those who have Taqwa.)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Soorat at-Tawbah 9:36</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Year consists of Twelve Months</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Bakrah said that the Prophet said in a speech during his Hajj,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The division of time has turned to its original form which was current when Allah created the heavens and the earth. The year is of twelve months, out of which four months are sacred: Three are in succession Dhul-Qa`dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between Jumada (Ath-Thaniyah) and Sha`ban.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then asked, (What is the day today&#8217;) We said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better. He kept quiet until we thought that he might give that day another name. He said (Isn&#8217;t it the day of Nahr) We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He further asked, (Which month is this) We again said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better,&#8221; and he kept quiet and made us think that he might give it another name. Then he said,(Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijjah) We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked, (What town is this) We said, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know better,&#8221; and he kept quiet until we thought that he might change its name. He asked, (Isn&#8217;t this the (Sacred) Town) We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verily! Your blood, property and honor are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this month of yours and in this city of yours. Verily, you will meet your Lord and He will question you about your actions. Behold! Do not revert to misguidance after me by striking the necks of one another. Have I conveyed It is incumbent upon those who are present to inform those who are absent, because those who are absent might comprehend (what I have said) better than some who are present.)</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a small book collected by Shaykh `Alam ad-Din As-Sakhawi, entitled, Al-Mashhur fi Asma&#8217; Al-Ayam wash-Shuhur, he mentioned that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Muharram is so named because it is a sacred month. To me, it was so named to emphasize its sacredness.</strong></span> This is because the Arabs would switch it around. One year they would say it was a sacred month, the following year they would say that it was not. The author said, &#8220;&#8230;and <strong>Safar</strong> is so named because they used to leave their homes during that month for fighting and traveling. When saying `Safir&#8217; a place, it means to leave it&#8230; <strong>Rabi` Al-Awwal</strong> is called that because they used to do Irtiba` in it, that is to maintain one&#8217;s property&#8230; and <strong>Rabi` Al-Akhir</strong>, was so named for the same reasons. <strong>Jumada</strong> is called that because the water would dry up (Jamud) then&#8230;.They say <strong>Jumada Al-Uwla</strong> and <strong>Al-Awwal</strong>, or Jumada Al-Akhar or Al-Akhirah. <strong>Rajab</strong> comes from Tarjib, meaning to honor. <strong>Sha`ban</strong> because the tribes would separate and return to their homes. <strong>Ramadan</strong> was so named because of the severity of the Ramda&#8217; &#8211; that is &#8211; the heat, and they say that the branch Ramadat when it is thirsty&#8230;And the saying that it is a Name of Allah is a mistake, for there is no proof or support for that&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Sacred Months</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(of them four are sacred).</strong></span> The Arabs used to consider these months sacred during the time of Jahiliyyah, except for a group of them called Al-Basl, who held eight months of the year to be sacred as way of exaggeration in religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Three are in succession; Dhul-Qa`dah, Dhul-Hijjah and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar which comes between Jumada (Ath-Thani) and Sha`ban).</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said &#8220;Rajab of Mudar&#8221; to attest to the custom of Mudar, in saying that Rajab is the month that is between Jumada and Sha`ban, not as the tribe of Rabi`ah thought, that it is between Sha`ban and Shawwal, which is Ramadan in the present calendar. The four Sacred Months were made four, three in succession and one alone, so that the Hajj and `Umrah are performed with ease. Dhul-Qa`dah, the month before the Hajj month, was made sacred because they refrained from fighting during that month. Dhul-Hijjah, the next month, was made sacred because it is the month of Hajj, during which they performed Hajj rituals. <strong>Muharram, which comes next, was made sacred so that they are able to go back to their areas in safety after performing Hajj</strong>. Rajab, in the middle of the lunar year, was made sacred so that those coming from the farthest areas of Arabia are able to perform `Umrah and visit the House and then go back to their areas safely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(That is the right religion),</span> that is the Straight Law, requiring implementing Allah&#8217;s order concerning the months that He made sacred and their true count as it was originally written by Allah. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein)</span> during these Sacred Months, for sin in them is worse than sin in other months. Likewise, sins in the Sacred City are written multiplied,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and whoever inclines to evil actions therein (in Makkah) or to do wrong, him We shall cause to taste from a painful torment) 22:25. <strong>Similarly, sin in general is worse during the Sacred Months</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abi Talhah narrated that Ibn `Abbas said, Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Verily, the number of months with Allah&#8230;),</span> is connected to</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein),</span> &#8220;In all (twelve) months. Allah then chose four out of these months and made them sacred, emphasizing their sanctity, making sinning in them greater, in addition to, multiplying rewards of righteous deeds during them.&#8221; Qatadah said about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(so wrong not yourselves therein)</span>, <strong>&#8220;Injustice during the Sacred Months is worse and graver than injustice in other months. Verily, injustice is always wrong, but Allah makes things graver than others as He will.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah has chosen some of His creation above others. He chose Messengers from angels and from men. He also chose His Speech above all speech, the Masajid above other areas of the earth, Ramadan and the Sacred Months above all months, Friday above the other days and Laylatul-Qadr (The Night of Decree) above all nights. Therefore, sanctify what Allah has sanctified, for doing so is the practice of people of understanding and comprehension.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Fighting in the Sacred Months</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(and fight against the idolators collectively),</span> all of you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(as they fight against you collectively.)</span>, all of them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(But know that Allah is with those who have Taqwa)</span>, and know that initiating battle during the Sacred Months is forbidden. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(O you who believe! Violate not the sanctity of the symbols of Allah, nor of the sacred month.)</span> 5:2,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The Sacred Month is for the Sacred Month, and for the prohibited things, there is the law of equality (Qisas). Then whoever transgresses the prohibition against you, you transgress likewise against him)</span> 2:194, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Then when the Sacred Months have passed, kill the idolators&#8230;)</span> 9:5. As for Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And fight against the idolators collectively as they fight against you collectively)</span>, it includes permission for the believers to fight the idolators in the Sacred Month, if the idolators initiate hostilities therein. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The Sacred Month is for the Sacred Month, and for the prohibited things, there is the law of equality (Qisas))</span> 2:194, and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And fight not with them at Al-Masjid Al-Haram, unless they (first) fight you there. But if they attack you, then kill them.)</span> 2:191.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Messenger of Allah laying siege to At-Ta&#8217;if until the Sacred Month started, it was a continuation of the battle against Hawazin and their allies from Thaqif. They started the fighting and gathered their men for the purpose of conducting war. The Messenger of Allah marched to meet them and when they took refuge in At-Ta&#8217;if, the Prophet laid siege to them so that they descend from their forts, but they inflicted casualties on Muslims. The siege continued for about forty days, during which a Sacred Month began, and the siege continued for several days in that month. The Messenger broke the siege and went back (to Makkah). So fighting that carries over into it the Sacred Month is not the same as initiating warfare during it, Allah knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“That a person is put to trial with everything that Allaah has forbidden, besides Shirk, is better than that he looks at Kalaam (theological rhetoric).” He also said, “If people knew what (misleading and destructive) desires are contained within theological rhetoric they would certainly flee from it as they would from a lion,”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">he also said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever showed boldness in approaching theological rhetoric will never prosper.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Ibn Qudaamah in his Burhaan fee Bayaanil-Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Scholars of ash-Shaash said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Every knowledge save that of the Qur’aan is a pre-occupation</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Except for the Hadeeth and Fiqh (understanding) of the Deen</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Knowledge is only that about which it is said,</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Haddathanaa &#8230;‘ (So and so narrated to us)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> And what is besides that</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> Are but whisperings of the Shayaateen (devils)”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Yoosuf, the companion of Aboo Haneefah said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Whoever sought knowledge by kalaam (theological rhetoric) will turn a heretical apostate,” and Ahmad ibn Hanbal (d. 241H) said, “The person of theological rhetoric will never prosper. And never do you see anyone looking into theological rhetoric except that in his heart is a desire for creating mischief.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both narrations are reported by Ibn Qudaamah in his Burhaan fee Bayaanil-Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] Muhammad Ibn Seereen (d. 110H) said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They (i.e., the Companions and the Taabi’een) used to consider themselves upon the path (of truth) so long as they held onto the narrations.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Laalikaa’ee in his Sharh Usolil It’iqaad, no. 110.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaadh ibn Yahyaa said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no path which is more straight and direct (in leading) to Paradise than the path of the one who travels upon the aathaar (narrations).”</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second Ayah: His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Had We sent down this Qur&#8217;an upon a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rending asunder by the fear of Allah&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Hashr 59:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mountain is among the hardest of what there is, the rocks by which the mountain becomes firm are exemplary in hardness. Allah, Exalted is He, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;When, after that, your hearts were hardened and became as stones or even worse in hardness&#8221;</strong></span> (Al- Baqara 2:74)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down upon the mountain, you would surely see this mountain humbling itself and cleaving out of the fear of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Humbling&#8221; &#8211; that is, submissively.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from its severe fright of of Allah, &#8220;Rending asunder&#8221; it cleaves and tears apart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is sent down upon our hearts, and our hearts &#8211; except as Allah wills &#8211; contract and become hard, neither opening nor accepting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who believe, when the Ayat (of the Qur&#8217;an) are sent down to them, it increases their faith; but as for those who have a disease in their hearts; it adds filth to their filth; and it is Allah whose refuge is sought!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of that is that their hearts become more inflexible and hardened and it adds filth to their filth. We seek refuge in Allah from that</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down to the mountain, it would cleave and humble itself due to the greatness of Allah&#8217;s Words sent down upon it</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this, there is evidence that the mountains have senses, because it humbles itself and cleaves. The matter is like that. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said concerning Uhud: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is Uhud, a mountain that loves us, and which we love</strong></span>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this Hadith, we also recognize the refutation against those who affirm that there are metaphors in the Qur&#8217;an. Those who always raise their flag, using this Ayah as proof:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Then they found therein a wall wanting to collapse&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Kahf 18:77)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying: &#8220;How can the wall want?&#8221; We say: Subhan Allah! The Knowing, and The Aware says : &#8220;Wanting to collapse&#8221; and you are saying that it does not want! Is this sensible?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not your right, after this, that you sav: &#8220;How could it want?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This makes us ask ourselves: Are we given the knowledge of everything?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is that we are not given knowledge, except a little.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not possible for us to object to the statement of the One Who knows the hidden and the witnessed: &#8220;Wanting to collapse&#8221; by saying: &#8220;The wall does not have an Iradah (a want)! And It does not want to collapse!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the evils of metaphors, because it implies a negation of what the Qur&#8217;an affirms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not Allah, Exalted is He, Who says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify Him and there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise. But you understand not their glorification</span></strong>&#8221; {Al-Israa&#8217; 17: 44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do they glorify Him, without wanting to?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says: &#8220;<strong>Tusabbih Lahu (they glorify Him)</strong>&#8220;: the Lam is to specify. Thus, it means sincerely. Is it imaginable to have sincerity without an Iradah (volition, objective, will)? Therefore, they will, and everything wills, for Allah says: &#8220;<strong>And there is not a thing but glorifies His Praise</strong>.&#8221; I think it is clear to all of us that this is one of the ways of expressing generality, because In (here) means Ma (not), which negates. Also, &#8220;<strong>A thing</strong>&#8221; is an indefinite pronoun used in the context of negation. &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But glorifies His Praise</strong></span>&#8221; by that, it includes everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O my Muslim brother, if you see that your heart is not moved by the Qur&#8217;an, accuse yourself, because Allah has informed that if this Qur&#8217;an were to be sent down upon a mountain, it would cleave, and the Qur&#8217;an is recited to your heart, yet and it is not moved. We ask Allah to aid us, and you.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter Four: Forgetting The Unpleasant Things That Have Passed</strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">8.Among the necessary causes of happiness and cessation of grief and worry,is striving to remove the things that bring about grief,and acquire those that bring about happiness.This is achieved by forgetting the unpleasant things that have passed and he has no power to bring them back,and knowing that occupying his mind wit them is meaningless;in fact it is stupidity,bordering and lunacy.Therefore he has to struggle with his mind not to think of them.He should also struggle with his mind not to worry over the future,not to pay attention to illusions of poverty,fear or other unpleasant things he is imagining will descend on him in the future.He should know that nobody knows what will happen in the future,whether good or evil,or pleasure or pain;this is in the Hands of Allah alone.The slave has no control over it.His only due is to struggle to accomplish what will benefit him in the future,and ward off harm from him.He should also know that when the slave turns his mind away from worrying over the future in his affairs,and relies on his Lord for its betterment,and is satisfied that his Lord will do that for him,when he does all that,his heart will be tranquil,and his condition will be good,and his worries and anxieties will vanish.</p>



<p>9.Among the most beneficial things to do concerning the future of one&#8217;s affair is to be saying the prayer that the Prophet,sallAllahu alaihi wa sallam,used to say:</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;O Allah!Make my religion,which is my strength and invincibility,good for me;and make my world,wherein is my livelihood,good for me;and make my hereafter,which is my final abode,good for me.And make my living an increase for me in all that is good,and make my death a repose for me from every ill</strong>.[Muslim reported it]</p>



<p>[Note: Learn this Dua @&nbsp;<a href="http://authentic-dua.com/2015/10/09/o-allaah-safeguard-my-deen-dunya-and-aakhira/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://authentic-dua.com/2015/10/09/o-allaah-safeguard-my-deen-dunya-and-aakhira/</a>]</p>



<p>And also his saying:</p>



<p><strong>&#8220;O Allah! It is Your mercy that I have hope in,so do not leave me to myself even for the blink of an eye,and make good my affairs,all of them;there is no god worthy of being worshipped but You.&#8221;</strong></p>



<p>[Abu Dawud reported it,with a sound chain of transmission]</p>



<p>If the slaves says this du&#8217;a,which entails seeking the betterment of his future both in terms of his religion and his worldly affairs,if he says that with a mindful and aware heart,and a true and sincere intention,coupled with an earnest struggle to achieve it,Allah will definitely materialize for him what he asked for and had hope in and struggled to achieve.As a result of this,his worry will change to happiness and delight.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ghamm</strong> Occurs Due To Misfortunes that happened in the past while <strong>hamm</strong> occurs due to an expected misfortune in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When someone has the feeling of grief in regard to his past sins, his grief will benefit him, because he is rewarded for it. Whoever worries about a good deed he wishes to do, his worry will benefit him as well. However if someone grieves for something that he missed from this world, then [he should know] that the missed thing will not return and that grief harms, so practically he is adding harm to harm, as I have mentioned in the previous chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A resolute person should protect himself from what brings about grief, and that is losing an object he loves. Therefore, whoever has many objects that he loves, his grief increases, and whoever decreases his objects of love his grief decreases accordingly. Someone may say, when I have no objects of love I also still have grief, we affirm this but we say to him; your grief over not having a loved one is not even a tenth of the grief experienced by the one who has lost a loved one. Have you not noticed that the one who does not have a child lives in grief but not as much as the one who lost his child?! Moreover when a person becomes accustomed to what he loves and enjoys it for a long period of time, it takes over his heart, therefore when he loses it he will feel the bitterness of his loss which will be greater than all the satisfaction he had during his lifetime. This is because the loved one is corresponding to the self just as health corresponds to it, which causes the self not to find satisfaction except in it, for its absence disturbs it. This is why the self grieves for its loss much more than it rejoices in its presence, because the inner self believes that what it had was its given right to possess. Therefore a wise person should monitor the closeness between himself, his beloved to ensure it remains moderately balanced, however if he requires that which brings about grief [i.e. loving some object or person], this causes grief then the cure is first to believe in predestination and that whatever Allah predestines is going to happen. He should then know that life is founded on distress, all constructed buildings shall eventually be ruined, all gatherings shall eventually depart, and whoever wants the lasting of what does not last is like he who wants what does not exist to exist. Therefore he should not ask of life what it was not created for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A poet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It [worldly life] is founded on distress yet you want it, Free of harm and distress </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should imagine that what befell him is multiplied, for this is when what he suffers will be easier on him. It is a habit of smart porters to put something heavy on top of what they are carrying, and then after taking a few steps, to remove the heavy object as that makes what they are carrying feel lighter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also wait, in times of prosperity for an attack of tribulation, so that if any tribulation befalls him, he should think of what remains instead of what he has lost so that when part of that befalls him it becomes very easy on him. Such as when some- one loses some money so he counts what remains, and then considers the remaining as a profit. Or if someone imagines that he loses his eyesight, so that when he has ophthalmia, it becomes easy on him to bear this illness, likewise with the rest of harmful matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A poet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The prudent imagines in himself,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>his tribulations before they befall him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>If they suddenly befall him,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>they do not surprise him because he had already imagined them.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And the ignorant trusts the days,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>and he forgets the demise of those who came before him.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So when trials of times surprise him,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>with some trials he becomes lost</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Though if he was strict in his affairs,</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>patience would have taught him boldness</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A member of the righteous predecessors said, &#8220;I saw a woman, whose youthfulness surprised me, I said, &#8216;[There is no doubt] This face has never suffered from sorrow or sadness.&#8217; She said, Do not say that! For I do not know anyone who has suffered from what I have suffered. I had a husband who bought a sacrificial animal and slaughtered it, and we had two sons. The eldest told the one younger than him, &#8216;Come and I will show you how our father slaughtered the ewe/ So he slaughtered his brother. When we started to look for him, he ran away and my husband died while looking for him/ I said, &#8216;So how are you handling your sorrow?&#8217; She said, &#8216;If I could find aid in sorrow I would have employed it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Section One: Treating Sorrow, Sadness and Grief</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sorrow, sadness and grief may befalls one due the prevalence of blackness, which should be treated with what will remove this blackness; which are the things that bring about joy. Grief freezes the blood while happiness heats it until its intrinsic heat is raised, both of them (happiness and grief) can harm, and may lead to death, if they are not immediately kept within moderate levels.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q. 504. After completing his &#8216;Umrah, a man found some filth in his Ihram garments; what is the ruling on this?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. If a person performed Tawaf and Say for &#8216;Umrah, and after that, he found some filth in his Ihram garments, then his Tawaf is valid, his Say is valid and his &#8216;Umrah is valid. This is because if a person has some filth on his garment, and he does not know about it, or he knew about it but he forgot to wash it, and then he prayed in that garment, then his prayer is valid. Similarly, if he made Tawaf in this garment, then his Tawaf is valid. The evidence for that is the Saying of Allah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error&#8221;</strong> [Al-Baqarah 2:286]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This evidence is general, and it is considered a great rule from among the rules of Islamic Law. There is a specific evidence in the matter, and that is that one day, the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) led his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them, in prayer and it was his practice to pray in his shoes, but he removed his shoes and the people removed their shoes too. After he had finished praying, he said to them: What was wrong with you?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8220;We saw you removing your shoes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;Jibril came to me and informed me that there was something harmful or some dirt on them&#8221;  [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is, some impurity. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not repeat the prayer, even though at the beginning of his prayer, he had worn shoes on which there was some impurity. This proves that if a person prayed in a garment in which there was impurity due to forgetfulness or ignorance, his prayer is valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a question here: If a person eats camel meat and he stands up and prays without performing ablution, believing that he had eaten mutton, should he repeat his prayer if he found out? We say: He should repeat the prayer after performing ablution. If someone asked: Why do you say that a person who prayed in a polluted garment due to ignorance should not repeat the prayer, while one who eats camel meat due to ignorance, should repeat it? We say: Because we have a useful and important rule, which is, commands are not cancelled due to ignorance or forgetfulness, whereas prohibitions are cancelled due to ignorance and forgetfulness. The evidence for this rule is the saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever slept through a prayer or forgot it, he must offer it as soon as he remembers it.&#8221;</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when he made the Taslim after performing two Rak&#8217;at in one of his afternoon prayers and he forgot the remainder of the prayer, he completed it when he remembered it. This is an evidence that those things which are commanded are not cancelled due to forgetfulness, because the Prophet ordered the one who forgot his prayer to offer it as soon as he remembers it, and the obligation to pray it was not removed due to forgetfulness. Also, he completed the prayer and he did not cancel the remainder of it due to forgetfulness. The proof that commands are not cancelled due to ignorance, is that a man came and offered a prayer in which he was not at rest, then he came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and greeted him and he said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Go back and offer prayer for you have not prayed.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He repeated it three times and the man kept praying and coming to him, but he would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Go back and offer prayer, for you have not prayed.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) taught him to pray correctly. So,this man abandoned an obligatory act due to ignorance, because he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;By Him Who sent you with the truth, I cannot pray better than this, so teach me.&#8221; If an obligation was cancelled due to ignorance, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would have excused him; and this rule is important and beneficial for the seeker of knowledge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise and thanks are to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, and I send prayers and blessings on our Prophet, Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>How Should a Person Pray in an Airplane?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 . He should offer the voluntary prayers in an airplane while he is sitting in his seat in whatever direction the airplane was facing, indicating the bowing and prostrating (by inclining his head), making the prostration lower than the bowing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He should not offer the obligatory prayers in an airplane, unless he is able to face towards the Qiblah throughout the whole of the prayer and he is also able to bow, prostrate, stand and sit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If he is unable to do that, he should delay the prayer until he lands at the airport and then pray on the ground. If he fears that the time for the prayer will expire before the airplane lands, he should delay it until the time of the next prayer. This is the case if it is one of those prayers that may be combined with another, such as Zuhr with &#8216;Asr or Maghrib with &#8216;Isha&#8217;. If he fears that the time for the next prayer will expire, he should pray them both in the airplane before the time ends and perform whatever conditions, pillars and obligations of the prayer he is able to. For example: If the airplane took off just before sunset and the sun set while he was in the air, then he should not offer the Maghrib prayer until the airplane lands at the airport, he disembarks, and then prays on the ground. But if he fears that the time for offering the Maghrib prayer will expire, he should delay it until the time of &#8216;Isha&#8217; and offer them both together, combining them and delaying the Maghrib prayer until the time of the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer after he descends. But if he fears that the time for the isha prayer will expire &#8211; and it expires at midnight &#8211; he should offer them before the time expires in the airplane.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The manner of performing the obligatory prayer in the airplane is to stand facing the Qiblah and make the Takbir. Then he recites Sural Al-Fatihah and the words which it is prescribed to recite before it, such as the opening supplication (Du&#8217;a Al- Istiftah) and some Qur&#8217;anic Verses after it. Then he should bow, then straighten up from bowing, and relax in a standing position, then prostrate, then straighten up from prostration, and relax in a sitting position, then prostrate again, then do likewise in the remainder of the prayer. If he is unable to prostrate, he should sit and indicate the prostration while sitting, and if he does not know the Qiblah, and no one reliable can inform him of it, he should use his judgement and try to ascertain it, then pray according to his judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. The prayer of the traveller in an airplane is shortened, so he performs the four Rak&#8217;ah prayer as two Rak&#8217;ahs like other travellers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#993300;">How Should a Person Who is Travelling by Airplane Assume Ihram for Hajj and &#8216;Umrah?</span></p>
<p>1 . He should perform Ghusl in his house and remain in his normal clothing, or if he wishes, he may don the garments of Ihram.</p>
<p>2. Once the airplane is close to passing over the starting point, he should don the garments of Ihram, if he has not done so already.</p>
<p>3. When the airplane passes over the starting point, he should make the intention for commencing the rites and say the Talbiyyah according to his intention either Hajj or &#8216;Umrah.</p>
<p>4. If he assumes Ihram before passing over the starting point as a precaution, being fearful of remissness or forgetfulness, then there is no objection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a very regrettable thing with regard to this matter which is the carelessness of some women concerning travelling by airplane without a Mahram.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are very negligent in this matter: One finds women travelling by airplane alone, and their <strong>justification</strong> for doing this is that they say that her Mahram escorted her in the airport from which the airplane took off and the other Mahram will meet her in the airport at which the airplane lands, and that in the airplane she is safe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This justification is weak in reality, because the Mahram who accompanies her does not admit her onto the airplane, he only admits her to the departure lounge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It may also be that the airplane is delayed in taking off and so this woman remains lost, or the airplane might take off and then be unable to land at the intended airport due to some reason or another, and so it lands at some other place, else and so this woman will be lost. Or, the airplane might land at the intended airport, but the Mahram who is supposed to meet her does not arrive due to one reason or another, such as illness, sleep or a car accident which prevents him from getting there, or something else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if all of these things did not happen, and the airplane landed at the correct time of arrival and the Mahram who was supposed to meet her was present, there might be some man sitting next to her on the airplane who does not fear Allah, the Most High and does not respect the worshippers of Allah, and he might be attracted to her and she to him, which might lead to Fitnah (temptation, trial) and unlawful deeds, as is well known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is incumbent upon a woman to fear Allah, the Almighty, the All-Powerful and not to travel except with a Mahram. It is also incumbent upon women&#8217;s male guardians whom Allah has made protectors and maintainers of women to fear Allah, the Almighty, the Ail-Powerful, and to avoid being negligent to those they are Mahrim for, and losing their zeal and their religion, for a person is responsible for his family. Because Allah, the Most High has made them a trust for him; He, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you believe! Ward off yourselves and your families against a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones, over which are (appointed) angels stern (and) severe, who disobey not, (from executing) the Commands they receive from Allah, but do that which they are commanded.&#8221;</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Advice for those about to perform Hajj</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Fourthly.</b> And be very careful not <strong>to walk directly in front of anyone praying in the Haraam </strong>mosque, not to speak of other mosques and prying places as the Prophet said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“If the one walking between the hands of one praying knew what were upon him then it would be better for him to stand still for forty (…) than that he should walk between his hands.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is a general text covering everyone walking in front, and everyone praying – and there is no authentic Hadith to make any exception for the one doing so in the Haraam Masjid – and you should pray therein like any other place towards a sutrah – according to the general nature of the Hadith regarding that – and there are also some narrations from the Companions particularly about the Masjid-ul-Haraam – which I have mentioned in ‘The Original’.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p>Is it permissible to offer two Witr prayers in one night?</p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p>No one should offer two Witr prayers in one night because the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There cannot be two Witr prayers in one night.[1]</strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) also said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Make the end of your prayer at night Witr. [2] </strong></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And he (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever feared that he will not get up at the end of the night should perform Witr at the beginning of it. And whoever desired to stand at the end of it should pray Witr at the end of the night.</strong></span> [3]</p></blockquote>
<p>If it is easy for the Muslim to perform the night prayer at the end of the night, he should seal his prayer with one Rakah of Witr. Whoever found difficulty in this should perform his Witr at the start of the night.</p>
<p>And if Allaah makes it easy for him (after that) to stand in prayer, he should offer what he can in units of two Rakahs, and he need not repeat the Witr, for the first Witr is sufficient for him, according to the aforementioned Hadith which is:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There cannot be two Witr prayers in one night. [4]</strong></span></p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q. 400. If a person breaks his fast due to some excuse, and then the excuse is removed during the day, should he fast for the remainder of the day?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. He is not obliged to fast. This is because it has been made lawful for this man to break his fast on this day based upon an evidence from the Islamic Law. The Islamic Law allows one who is compelled to take medication for example, to take it, but if he takes, he breaks his fast. Therefore the prohibition of the day does not apply to him, because it has been permitted for him to break his fast, but he is required to compensate for it<span style="color:#808080;"><a style="color:#808080;" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2015/06/25/whoever-breaks-his-fast-with-an-excuse-then-that-person-is-not-obliged-to-fast-for-the-rest-of-the-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">,</a></span> and for us to require him to fast without any benefit is legally incorrect. So as long as this man does not benefit from fasting, it is not incumbent upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this would be a man who sees someone drowning in the water and he says: If I drank, it would be possible for me to save him, and if I did not drink, it would not be possible for me to save him, so he drinks and then saves him and he eats and drinks for the remainder of the day. This man is not prohibited from eating and drinking on this day, since it has been made lawful for him not to fast in accordance with the Islamic Law. Therefore, he is not required to fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, if there was a sick person, would we say to him: Do not eat unless you are hungry and do not drink unless you are thirsty? Meaning: Do not eat or drink except due to necessity. We would not say this to him, because it is permissible for the sick person to break his fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, every person who breaks his fast in Ramadan in accordance with some legal evidence is not obliged to fast, and vice versa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever breaks his fast without an excuse, then he must fast, because it is not lawful for him to break his fast and he has transgressed the prohibition of that day without permission from the Islamic Law. So, we must compel him to fast the remainder of the day and to make up for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah knows better.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q. 398. What are the permissible excuses for breaking the fast?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. The permissible excuses for breaking the fast are: <strong>Illness</strong> and <strong>travel</strong>, as mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among other excuses is that a woman is <strong>pregnant</strong> and she fears for herself or her child. Another excuse is that a woman is <strong>breast-feeding</strong> and she fears for herself or her breast-fed child if she fasts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another excuse is that a person needs to break his fast in order to save the life of someone. For example, he finds a drowning person in the sea, or someone who is surrounded on all sides by fire, and he needs to break his fast in order to save him &#8211; in that case, he may break his fast and save him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another such case would be if a person needed to break his fast in order to strengthen himself for Jihad in Allah&#8217;s Cause, that would also be a permissible cause for him to break his fast, because the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said to his Companions, may Allah be pleased with them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>You will meet the enemy tomorrow morning, so breaking the fast stronger for you, so break your fast</strong>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if there is a permissible excuse for breaking the fast, and a person breaks his fast due to it, it is not necessary for him to fast for the remainder of that day. Therefore, if it transpired that a person had broken his fast in order to save a person&#8217;s life, he should continue to eat and drink, even after saving him. This is because he broke his fast for a reason which permits him to break his fast, so it is not necessary for him to fast in that case, because the prohibition of breaking fast on that day has been removed due to the permissible cause for breaking the fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, we support the most authoritative opinion in this matter, which is that if a sick person became well during the day and he was not fasting, it is not necessary for him to fast, and if a traveller arrived during the day at his hometown and he was not fasting, it is not necessary for him to fast, and if a menstruating woman became clean during the day, it is not necessary for her to fast. This is because all of these people broke their fasts for legitimate reasons, and so on that day, there was no obligation upon them to fast, due to the lawful permission for breaking it at that time, so it is not necessary for them to fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is as opposed to the case where it is confirmed that the month of Ramadan has begun during the day in that case, it is necessary to fast. The difference between the two cases is clear, because if the evidence appears (that Ramadan has begun) during the day, it has been confirmed that fasting on that day is obligatory for them, but they are excused for the time before the evidence became clear to them due to their ignorance of it. This is why, if they knew that this day was a day of Ramadan, it is obligatory for them to fast. But as for those other people whom we have described, it is permissible for them to break their fast, even though they are aware (that it is Ramadan) and the difference between them is clear.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Q. 405. If a traveller arrives in Makkah and he is fasting, should he break his fast in order to gain strength to perform &#8216;Umrah?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. We say that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) entered Makkah on the twentieth of Ramadan in the year of the conquest of Makkah and he was not fasting, and he led the people of Makkah in a two Rak&#8217;ah prayer and he said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Oh, people of Makkah! Complete the prayer (i.e. pray four Rak&#8217;ahs), for we are travellers</strong></span>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed in Sahih Al-Bukhari that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) did not fast for the remainder of the month, because he was a traveller, so the journey of a person performing &#8216;Umrah does not end with his arrival in Makkah, and he is not obliged to fast if he arrives while not fasting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Some people might continue to fast even while they are travelling, thinking that to fast while travelling in the present day is not difficult for people. So, they will continue fasting even while travelling, then they arrive in Makkah and feel tired, and so they say to themselves: Should I continue my fast and delay the &#8216;Umrah until after I have broken my fast, or should I break my fast in order to perform the &#8216;Umrah immediately upon arrival in Makkah. We would say to them in these circumstances: It is better for you to break your fast in order to perform &#8216;Umrah immediately upon arrival in Makkah, in order to perform this rite. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Because when the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) entered Makkah and he was performing his religious rites, he would go straight to the Masjid, even making his camel kneel outside the Masjid, entering it in order to perform the rites, for he was so preoccupied with it. Therefore, for those who perform &#8216;Umrah, breaking your fast in order to perform &#8216;Umrah briskly is better than remaining in a state of fasting, then performing your &#8216;Umrah after you have broken your fast at night.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that he was fasting on his journey to the battle for the conquest of Makkah, and the people came to him and said: &#8220;Oh, Messenger of Allah! Fasting has become difficult for the people and they are waiting to see what you will do.&#8221; And this was after &#8216;Asr, but the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) called for water and drank it while the people were watching. [2] So, the Prophet broke his fast during his journey, indeed, he broke his fast at the end of the day, and all of this was in order to make it clear to his people that this was permissible. Fasting while travelling, as some do, in spite of difficulty, contradicts the Sunnah; of this there is no doubt. To this applies the statement of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>It is not righteousness to fast while on a journey.</strong></span> &#8221; [3]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q. 359. <strong>Is it correct for a person who is in debt to give charity? And what legal obligations are lifted from the debtor? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. Charity is a form of spending which is commanded by the Islamic Law, and it is a form of Ihsan towards Allah&#8217;s worshippers, if it is given where it is needed. A person will be rewarded for his charity, and every man will be in the shade of his charity on the Day of Resurrection and it is accepted whether a person is in debt or not, as long as the conditions for its acceptance are met.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These conditions are that it is given <strong>purely and sincerely for Allah</strong>, the Almighty, the All-Powerful&#8217;s sake, that it is from <strong>honest earnings</strong>, and it is given <strong>where it is needed</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these conditions are fulfilled, then the charity is accepted, according to the legal evidences; and it is not a condition that a person be free of debt. <strong>But if the debt covers all that he has, then it is not wise, nor is it logical that he should give charity while charity is recommended, not obligatory and that he should leave the debt which is an obligation on him. He should begin first with the obligation, then give charity</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars have disagreed regarding the situation if a person gives charity when he has a debt covering all of his wealth: Some of them say that it is not permissible because it harms his creditor, and it causes this obligatory debt to remain unpaid. Some of them say that it is permissible, but that it contradicts what is more worthy.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In any case, it is not fitting for a person whose debt covers all that he has, to give charity until he has settled his debt, because an obligation takes precedence over a voluntary act of worship.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the legal obligations that are lifted from one who is indebted until such time as he pays it, they include Hajj, because Hajj is not incumbent upon a person who is in debt until he has paid it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for Zakah</strong>, scholars have differed regarding whether its obligation is lifted from the debtor until such lime as he pays the debt or not.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Among the scholars are those who say that the obligation of Zakah is lifted on the amount which is equivalent to the debt, whether the wealth is evident or not.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Among them are those who say that the obligation to pay Zakah is not lifted on the amount which is equivalent to the debt; rather he must pay Zakah on the whole amount which he possesses. If there is a debt incumbent on him, the Nisab is decreased.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are those among them who discriminate, saying that if the wealth is concealed, wealth which is not seen and is not perceptible, such as money and trading merchandise, then the obligation to pay Zakah is lifted on the amount which is equivalent to the debt, while if the wealth is in the form of perceptible things, such livestock and the produce of the earth, then the obligation to pay Zakah is not lifted.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The correct view in my opinion is that the obligation to pay it is not lifted, regardless of whether the wealth is perceptible or not, and that every person who has wealth in his hand upon which Zakah is payable must pay his Zakah, even if he is in debt. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because Zakah is incumbent upon wealth, according to the Words of Allah, the Most High:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it, and invoke Allah for them. Verily your invocations are a source of security for them; and Allah is All- Hearer, All-Knower&#8221;</strong></span> [At-Tawbah 9:103]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the words of the Prophet to Mu&#8217;ath bin Jabal, may Allah be pleased with him, when he sent him to Yemen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Inform them that Allah has made incumbent upon them the payment of Zakah on their wealth; it is taken from the wealthy among them and distributed among their poor.&#8221;</strong> </span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith is in Sahih Al-Bukhari with this wording. By this evidence from the Book (of Allah) and the Sunnah, the two things are separate, and there is no conflict between Zakah and a debt, because a debt remains an obligation and Zakah is incumbent upon wealth. So, each of them is incumbent in a place wherein the other is not incumbent, so there is no conflict between them, and no contradiction, and thus a <strong>debt remains the responsibility of its owner and Zakah remains incumbent on wealth</strong>, and he must pay it from the wealth in all circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[2] Reported by Al-Bukhari in the Book of Zakah, in the Chapter: The Obligation of Zakah ( 1 395 ); and by Muslim in the Book of Faith, in the Chapter: Calling to the Shahadatan and the Laws of Islam (19).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q. 381. Is every person who extends his hand for Zakah deserving of it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. Not every person who extends his hand for Zakah is deserving of it, because there are those among mankind who extend their hands for money while they are wealthy. This type of person will come on the Day of Resurrection while his face will not have a bit of flesh on it, [1] may Allah protect us from that. He will come on the Day of Resurrection, on the Day when the witnesses will stand and the bones of his face will be visible, may Allah protect us from that, and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;He who begs the riches of others to increase his own wealth is asking only for burning coals (in the Hereafter), so let him ask a little or much.&#8221;</strong></span> [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would like to take this opportunity to warn those people who ask people in an importune manner when they are in possession of wealth. Indeed, I warn everyone who accepts Zakah when he is not entitled to receive it. I say to him: If you took Zakah to which you are not entitled, you are only consuming ill-gotten gains, may Allah protect us from that, and a person should fear Allah, for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever tries to make himself self-sufficient, Allah will make him self-sufficient; and whoever abstains from asking others, Allah will make him content&#8221;</strong></span> [3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if a man extends his hand to you, and you believe it is most likely that he is entitled to it, and you gave him, then the Zakah will be counted, and you will have discharged your obligation, even if it became apparent after that that he was not entitled to it. There is no need to think that you have to pay the Zakah again (to someone else).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence for this is the story of the man who gave money in charity, and he gave charity first to a <strong>prostitute</strong> and the people began to talk, saying: &#8220;Have you given money tonight to a prostitute?&#8221; He said: &#8220;All praise and thanks are to Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he gave charity on the second night and it fell into the hands of a <strong>thief</strong> and the people began to talk, saying: &#8220;Have you given money tonight to a thief?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he gave charity on the third night to a <strong>rich man</strong> and the people began to talk, saying: &#8220;Have you given money tonight to a rich man?&#8221; He said: &#8220;All praise and thanks are to Allah for the prostitute, the thief and the rich man.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it was said to him (by an angel): &#8220;Your charity has been accepted; as for the prostitute, haply (i.e perhaps) she may content herself with what you have given her and it may prevent her from committing illegal sexual intercourse, while as for the thief, haply he may content himself with what you have given him and he may refrain from stealing, while as for the rich man, haply, he may reflect and give charity&#8221; [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, my brother, look at the honest intention, what is its effect: Therefore, if you gave the person who asked you, and then it became apparent that he was wealthy and you had given him something, believing that he was poor, it is not necessary for you to repay the Zakah.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Use of Haid (Menses) Inhibitors is permissible under two conditions: FIRST: There is no associated harm on the woman.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Use of Haid (Menses) Inhibitors is permissible under two conditions:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FIRST</strong>: There is no associated harm on the woman. Because Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;aala) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { ولا تُلقُوا بأيديكُم إلى التَّهلُكَة } (البقرة، 195<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And do not throw yourselves in destruction&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 195).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { ولا تَقتُلوا أنفُسَكُم إنَّ الله آانَ بكم رحيماً } (النِّساء، 29<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And do not kill yourselves surely Allah is Most Merciful to you&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SECOND</strong>: If its use affects the husband in one way or another, then his permission should be first sought. For example, if a woman is going through her Idda and the husband is obligated to spend upon her, then she is not allowed to prolong her Idda (by using Haid inhibitors) in order that she can receive more of his spending. She should request his permission. Similarly it is not permissible to use such inhibitors without the husband&#8217;s approval if it is known that the inhibitors will prevent her becoming pregnant. It is better not to use these inhibitors except under the above conditions and when there is a real need for that, because leaving the matter as natural as possible is better for the balance of health and safety of the woman.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Use of Haid (Menses) Stimulants is permissible under two conditions:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FIRST</strong>: There must be no abuse of its use. For example, to excuse herself from certain mandatory acts of worship like using stimulants right before the month of Ramadan so as to be excused from fasting or from prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SECOND</strong>: The use of stimulants must be permitted by the husband because the presence of Haid prevents him from having full enjoyment with his wife. Also, if she was divorced, then this will quickly drop off the husband&#8217;s right of returning her because it will hasten the end of her Idda. This applies to the case when the declared divorce is of the type known as Revocable Divorce in which the husband has the right to return his wife before the end of her Idda.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">Questions &amp; Answers</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Haid Inhibitors</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q1: What is the ruling regarding on the use of Haid-inhibitory pills during the month of Ramadan?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As long as there is no harm in their use and as long as the husband permits this, then it is permissible to use these pills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it came to my knowledge that these measures can harm the woman, especially when it is known that the release of blood by menses is a natural process. To prevent this natural way may cause certain harm to the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the use of these pills can effect the regulation of the periodical cycle itself and that leaves her in doubt and confusion regarding the offering of her prayer and whether she is able to have sexual intercourse with her husband or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this and other associated reasons, I cannot say that the use of these pills is unlawful but I do not like it and do not encourage it. I say that the woman should accept what Allah had ordained for her and should consider the answer of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to his wife &#8216;Aisha when she had her menses after she made Ihram for Umra. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) asked &#8216;Aisha: &#8220;May be that you got your menses?&#8221;. &#8216;Aisha replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) then said,&#8221;This is the thing which Allah has ordained for all the daughters of Adam&#8221; [62]. The woman should then be patient and seek the reward from Allah. If she is unable to perform Salat and fasting because of her menses, the door is still opened for her to celebrate the praises of Allah, give charity and do good to people and such acts are great acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[62] Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English) V.1, P. 182, Hadeeth # 302.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Five &#8211; ISTIHADAH</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ISTIHADAH is the vaginal bleeding of a woman such that it may not stop or it may stop but for a short period of time (a day or two in each month).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) <strong>Bleeding that does not stop:</strong> &#8216;Aisha (radyAllaahu &#8216;anha) related that: &#8220;Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish said to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">I do not become clean (i.e., bleeding is not ending)</span> and in one narration &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">I got persistent bleeding (in between the periods) and I do not become clean</span>&#8221; [49].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) <strong>Bleeding that stops for a short period of time</strong>: Humnah bint Jahsh came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">My menstruation was great in quantity and severe</span>&#8220;[50].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Several States of Istihadah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ONE</strong>: The woman has a known period of normal cycles of menses prior to Istihadah. The woman in this case refers to her previously known period of menses and during this period she applies all the rules regarding Salat, Fasting etc. Bleeding in days other than this reference period is considered as Istihadah with all associated rules being applicable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: A woman used to get normal bleeding for six days at the beginning of each month. She then started to have prolonged bleeding. For this woman her <strong>Haid (Menses)</strong> period should be the &#8220;first six days of every month&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following extra vaginal bleeding is her Istihadah. This is in accordance with the Hadeeth of &#8216;Aisha (radyAllaahu &#8216;anha) who narrated that: &#8220;Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;I got persistent bleeding (in between the periods) and do not become clean. Shall I give up prayers? He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) replied: No, this is from a blood vessel. <span style="color:#008000;">Give up the prayers only for the days on which you usually get the menses and then take a bath and offer your prayers</span>&#8220;[51].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Saheeh Muslim, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Umm Habeebah bint Jahsh who had a prolonged flow of blood to &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">refrain (from prayer) during your menstrual period, then wash and pray</span>&#8221; [52]. Having done this she should pray and pay attention to any flowing blood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>TWO</strong>: The woman does not have a known period of normal cycles of menses prior to Istihadah. To be able to distinguish between her blood from normal menses and her Istihadah blood, she should watch for some characteristics of these two types of blood. <span style="color:#ff6600;">Haid blood may be characterized by thickness, darkness or certain distinct odor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: a woman sees a continuous blood flow but she sees it dark for the first ten days and red for the rest of the month. Or it looks thick for the first ten days and soft for the rest of the month, or for the first ten days it has the characteristic odor of Haid blood and it becomes odorless for the rest of the month. So her Haid period is the dark blood flow for the first example, the thick blood for the second and the one with the distinct odor for the third. The bleeding that follows is considered Istihadah. It is related that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Fatimah bint Abi Jahsh: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">When the blood of menses comes, it is black and can be recognized; so when that comes, refrain from prayer, but when a different type of blood comes, perform ablution and pray, for it is (due only to) a vein</span>.&#8221; [53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THREE</strong>: The woman does not have a known period of Haid and lacks the distinctive characteristics mentioned above!. Blood flow is continuous carrying the same quality or flowing with abnormal qualities that make it hard to distinguish the Haid bleeding from that of the Istihadah bleeding. In this case, women encountering this prolonged and undetermined type of flow should consider their Haid period to be the period encountered by most women: 6-7 days of Haid flow per month, starting from the time she sees the flowing blood. Other than this period, the blood flowing should be considered as Istihadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: A woman sees her blood for the first time on the fifth day of the month and it continues to flow while she is unable to distinguish any difference in color, odor or thickness of blood. Her Haid period should be six or seven days starting on the fifth day of each month. This is in lieu of the Hadeeth of Hamnah bint Jahsh (radyAllaahu &#8216;anha). She said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Messenger of Allah I am a woman who menstruates in great quantity and it is severe, so what do you think about it? It has prevented me from praying and fasting&#8221;</span>. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I recommend that you should use cotton, put it on your private part, for it absorbs the blood. She replied: &#8220;It is too copious for that&#8230;&#8221; In this Hadeeth, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;This is a stroke of the devil, so observe your menses for six or seven days, Allah alone knows which it should be; then wash and when you see that you are purified, and quite clean, pray during twenty three or twenty four days and nights and fast, for that will be enough for you.&#8221;</span> [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) &#8220;for six or seven days&#8221; is not meant to give Hamnah bint Jahsh the choice but just for her to examine and find out who (amongst other women) is closer to her in age, body structure, number of children, etc. the woman that mostly resembles her condition has a Haid period of six days, then she should consider this period as her reference. The same is true if the Haid period was seven days.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The One Who Resembles The Mustahadah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that something (e.g. surgery) may cause the flow of blood through the vagina. There are two types of this case:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) It is not possible for her to have menses following surgery e.g. removal of the uterus or its blockage. Under this case, the ruling of Istihadah cannot be applicable. If the woman sees blood, then the laws governing the <strong>yellowish discharge</strong> (see above) apply. Hence she should not refrain from performing prayers or fasting. It is not prohibited for her husband to have sexual intercourse with her and it is not obligatory upon her to have a bath. She must, however, wash, clean, and make ablution at the commencing time of the obligatory prayers and when she intends to offer the optional prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) It is not certain that her menses will stop following surgery. It is possible that she may have menses. In this case the rulings applicable on a Mustahadah (woman going through Istihadah) are also applicable on this condition in lieu of the Hadeeth of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">It is from a blood vessel, so when the real menses begins give up your prayers and when it (the period) has finished wash the blood off your body (have a full shower) and offer your prayers.&#8221;</span>[55] The saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;when the real menses begins&#8221; indicates that the rules for the Mustahadah woman are applicable upon the woman who, potentially, may have menses (with a beginning and an end). The woman, however, without a potentially occurring menses, her blood is a vessel blood.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Rulings About The Mustahadah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Earlier it was explained when the blood is considered a menses (Haid) blood or Istihadah blood. The rulings applicable for menses and Istihadah depend upon the type of the flowing blood. Rulings about menses were discussed earlier. The rulings about Istihadah are the same as those applicable to a clean woman except for the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) It is obligatory upon the Mustahadah to perform Ablution for each prayer, because of the order of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish: &#8220;Then make Ablution for every Salat&#8221; [56], meaning that she should make ablution only when the prescribed time of Salat begins and not before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) Prior to ablution she should wash the traces of blood and covers her private part with a pad of cotton to absorb the blood. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Humnah bint Jahsh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I recommend that you should use cotton, for it absorbs blood.&#8221; She said: &#8220;it is too copious for that&#8221;. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said; &#8220;then take a cloth.&#8221; She replied, &#8220;it is too copious for that.&#8221; He said: &#8220;then Talaj&#8217;jami&#8221; i.e., to prepare a holding around the waist that will maintain the cotton pad tightly attached to her private part. Nothing that comes out should then harm her because the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Fatimah bint Hubaish: &#8220;Refrain from Salat during the days of your normal menses then wash and make ablution for every Salat and then pray &#8220;even if blood drops onto the mat!&#8221; (Related by Imam Ahmad and Ibn Majah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Sexual Intercourse: Scholars disagreed about its permissibility. The correct opinion is that it is permissible because many women (ten or more) had their Istihadah at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Allah and His Messenger did not prevent spouses from engaging in sexual intercourse. In fact, the saying of Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) :</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { فاعتَزِلُوا النِّساء في المَحيض } الأية (البقرة، 222<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Keep away from women during menses&#8221;</span><br />
(Qur&#8217;an 2: 222),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">is an evidence that it is only obligatory to keep away from sexual intercourse with women only during menses. And since offering prayers is allowed while in Istihadah, then there should be no difficulty in having sexual intercourse. To prevent sexual intercourse based upon Qiyass (analogy) with the state of Haid is incorrect, because the two situations are not the same. Deduction of rulings by Qiyass is invalid whenever there are existing variations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">And also from the business transactions that are forbidden is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Deceptive Sale, which is when you deceive your Muslim brother by selling him a product that has defects and you know about these defects yet you do not inform him about them</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this kind of sale is not permissible and it is from deception, swindling and fraud. It is obligatory on the seller to make these defects clear to the seller and to let him know about them. But if he fails to inform him about them, then this is from deception and swindling, which Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) forbade in his saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">The two persons conducting a business transaction are in a state of goodness for as long as they do not separate from one another. So if they are both honest and open with one another, they are blessed in their transaction. But if they lie and conceal (the truth) from one another, the blessing of their transaction is wiped out.</span>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon us, O servants of Allaah, to be sincere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “The Religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity.” They (the Companions) said: “To who O Messenger of Allaah?” He said: “To Allaah, to His Book, to His Messenger, to the Muslim leaders and the Muslim general masses.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim must be sincere. What is meant when one is sincere towards something is that he is free or absolved from certain things. So being sincere means being free from cheating (for example).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">One time the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) passed by a person selling some food in the marketplace who had his food in a pile. So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) put his noble hand inside the pile of food and found some wet portions in the bottom of the pile. So he said: “What is this O owner of the food?” He said: “The sky has affected it” – meaning the rain has damaged some of it. So Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Then won’t you make it visible so that the people can see it? Whoever cheats us (i.e. swindles Muslims) is not from us.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is considered one of the fundamental principles in conducting business transactions between the Muslims. <strong>So it is not permissible for a Muslim to conceal the defects</strong>. If his merchandise has a defect then he must make it visible so that the buyer sees it and is aware of it, and so that he could acquire the item for a price that is appropriate for this defect. He must not acquire the item for the price it would be if it were flawless, for then the seller would be deceiving, cheating, fooling and swindling, based on the saying of Allaah’s Messenger: “Then won’t you make it visible so that the people can see it? Whoever cheats us is not from us.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So O servants of Allaah! How much of swindling do you see in these days? How many times do you see people placing the defective items in the bottom of the containers and cases while placing the good items on the top – whether vegetables or food items? They purposely put the defective item in the bottom while putting the flawless item on the top. This is trickery, which is done intentionally. We ask Allaah to pardon and forgive us and you, and that He make our rizq (sustenance) Halaal and that He make our earnings Halaal. And we ask Him to provide us from His vast Bounty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah suffice us with what You have made Halaal over that which You made Haraam, and (suffice us) with Your Bounty over that of others besides You. And forgive us, have mercy on us and accept our repentance. Verily, You are the One who accepts Repentance, the Bestower of Mercy. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Allaah’s Messenger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: During Menses, it is not unlawful to celebrate Allah&#8217;s Praises (Saying Takbeer, Tasbeeh, and Tahmeed),[29] saying Bismillah before acting upon something (eating, drinking, etc..), reading Hadeeth, Islamic discussions, invocation upon Allah (Dua&#8217;), and listening to the recitation of Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed by &#8216;Aisha (radhi Allaahu anha) that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;lean on my lap and recite Qur&#8217;an while I was in menses&#8221;</span> (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Umm &#8216;Atiyya reported that she heard the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Unmarried young virgins and the mature girl who stay often screened or the young unmarried virgins who often stayscreened and the menstruating women should come out and participate in the good deeds as well as the religious gathering of the faithful believers but the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).&#8221;</span> [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: The reciting of the Qur&#8217;an by a menstruating woman either via direct looking or silently (in her heart) without the actual uttering by the tongue is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of the scholars are with the opinion that it is not prohibited for her to utter the Qur&#8217;anic recitation. Imam Bukhari, Ibn Jareer At- Tabaree and Ibn Al-Munthir, Imam Malik, and Imam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee (in one of his earlier sayings) are with the opinion that it is permissible for her to recite the Ayah (verse in the Qur&#8217;an).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shayekul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;Basically, there is no Sunnah to prevent her from reciting Qur&#8217;an. The &#8220;hadeeth&#8221; that: &#8220;A menstruating woman and the one who is in state of Jannabah [32] should not recite anything of the Qur&#8217;an&#8221;, is a weak hadeeth as agreed upon by the knowledgeable scholars of Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact women at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to have their monthly cycles of menses.Had the recitation of Qur&#8217;an been prohibited for them (as it is the case with Salat) then the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would have made it clear to his Ummah (Islamic community) and his wives would have known about it and they would have dissipated this knowledge to the people. Because no one had related a prohibition by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about this issue, then it cannot be made unlawful especially when it is known that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not prohibit it at the time when menses was very much present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, recitation by the tongue is not Haram (legally unlawful).[33] This author said: &#8220;having known the dispute between the scholars about this matter, then it is more proper for the menstruating woman not to recite Qur&#8217;an by the tongue except when it is necessary e.g. if she is a teacher or if she is preparing for an exam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] Takbeer: saying Allahu Akbar (Allah is The Greatest); Tasbeeh: saying Subhana Allah (Most Glorified is Allah); Tahmeed: saying Al Hamdulil&#8217;lah: All Praise is due to Allah.<br />
[30] Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English) V.1, P.179, Hadeeth # 296.<br />
[31] Agreed upon Hadeeth. In Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic- English), V. 1, P. 192, Hadeeth # 321.<br />
[32] Jannabah: Is the state in which a man (or a woman) has sexual discharge during sexual intercourse or in a dream, etc. In this state a Muslim is not allowed to pray or do other kinds of worships unless and until he (she) performs Ghusl (have a full shower) or do Tayammum if he/she cannot use water for any reason.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that it is required upon everyone that commits a sin to rush towards repenting from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Repentance with regard to the <strong>rights of Allaah</strong> must meet three conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1. One must stop committing that sin immediately,</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>2. He must feel remorse and sorrow for having done it, and</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>3. He must resolve to not return to committing that sin again.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Repentance with regard to the <strong>rights of humans</strong> must meet these same three conditions (listed above), as well as a fourth one, which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">4. Taking back any oppression that was inflicted on someone or asking for his forgiveness or absolvment from that.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory on a person who has committed backbiting to seek repentance according to these four conditions, because backbiting involves the rights of people, so he must seek the forgiveness of the person he has backbitten.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it sufficient for one to just say: &#8220;I have backbit you, so please absolve me from (this) sin&#8221; or must he inform him also of what he said about him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two views on this according to the Shaafi&#8217;ee scholars:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First:</strong> His clarifying what he said (when backbiting) is a condition. So if he is absolved without informing him of what he said, the pardon is not valid, just as if he were to absolve him from (stealing) unidentifiable money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second:</strong> His informing him (of what he said) is not a condition, because this is something that one will not be able to tolerate and thus forgive. So his knowing (exactly what was said) is not a condition, contrary to the example of the (stolen) money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first opinion is the strongest, since people have the ability to grant forgiveness for certain types of backbiting but not other types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if the one who has been backbitten is either dead or absent, then one is excused from seeking to be absolved from it. However, the scholars say: He should supplicate much for that person and ask forgiveness for him, as well as do many good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that it is preferable for the one who has been backbitten to absolve the backbiter from his sin, but it is not an obligation on him to do so. This is because it is giving away and forfeiting one’s right, so the choice is his. However, it is strongly recommended (muta’akkidah) for him to absolve him so that his Muslim brother can be free from the harm of this sin and so that he can be successful in receiving Allaah’s great reward of Forgiveness and Love. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Those who repress their anger and pardon people. Verily, Allaah loves the good doers.”</span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 134]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proper way he should take in making himself allow the pardoning is by reminding himself that: “This matter has already happened and there is no way to remove it now. So it is not right for me to make him miss his chance of getting reward and absolving my Muslim brother.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives (others), that is truly from the things recommended by Allaah.”</span> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Show forgiveness!”</span> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 199]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ayaat similar to what we mentioned above are many. And in the authentic hadeeth, the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> “And Allaah remains in the assistance of (His) servant so long as the servant remains in the assistance of his (fellow) brother.”</span> [Saheeh – Reported by Muslim (2699)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;<em>Whosoever is sought to be pleased, yet is not pleased is a devil</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of the past would recite:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It was said to me: Such and such person has spoken badly of you And when a youth sets out to humiliate, it is a shame So I said: He has come to us and issued an excuse The blood-money (i.e. recompense) for a sin – to us – is the apology.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what we have mentioned here concerning the encouragement for one to absolve and forgive a person from backbiting is what is correct. As for what has been reported on Sa&#8217;eed bin Al-Musayyib that he said: “I will not forgive the one who has oppressed me” and on Ibn Sireen that he said: “I will not forbid it on him and then make it allowable for him, because Allaah has made backbiting forbidden on him and I will never make permissible what Allaah has made forbidden” then it is either unauthentic or erroneous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since a person that pardons someone is not making something forbidden permissible. Rather, he is only forfeiting a right that is established for him. The texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah indicate clearly that it is recommended to forgive and forfeit one’s rights, which are specific to this case. Or perhaps Ibn Sireen&#8217;s words can be taken to mean: “I will never permit myself to be backbitten.” This would be correct, for indeed if a person says: “I seek my honor back from the one who backbitten me”, he is not allowing for it to be done. Rather, he is forbidding everyone from backbiting him, just as he forbids others from being backbitten.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth: “Are you not able to be like Abu Damdam – when he would go out from his home, he would say: ‘I am giving my honor away in charity for the people.’” Meaning: I will not seek justice from those who oppress me whether in this world or the Hereafter. This is useful in removing a transgression that existed before the absolvement, but as for what occurs after it, there must be a new absolvement made after that. And with Allaah lies the success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Know that in the same way that backbiting is forbidden for the one who speaks it, it is likewise forbidden for the one who listens to it and approves of it</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is obligatory on the one who hears an individual embarking on committing the prohibited form of backbiting, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>to forbid him</strong></span> from doing it as long as he does not fear any open harm resulting from that. But if he does fear (harm) from that, then he is obligated to <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>reject the backbiting with his heart</strong></span> and to <strong><span style="color:#993300;">detach himself</span></strong> from that gathering if he is able to do so. If he has the ability to reject it with his tongue or to cut the backbiting off by changing the topic, then that becomes required of him. And if he does not do that, then he has committed an act of disobedience (i.e. sinned).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he is forced to stay in that gathering in which backbiting is taking place, and he fears from forbidding it, or he forbids it but it is not accepted from him and he cannot find a way to separate himself from them, then he is <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>prohibited from listening</strong></span> and paying attention to the backbiting. Instead, his way out should be by <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>making remembrance of Allaah (dhikr)</strong></span> with both his tongue and heart or just his heart. Or he should <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>think about something else</strong></span> in order to preoccupy himself from having to listen to it. After having done this, his hearing it without listening or paying attention to it will not harm him, while he is in this mentioned state. If he is able, after this, to withdraw from them and they are still backbiting, then separating oneself is an obligation. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when you see those who engage in false conversations about Our verses by mocking at them, then turn away from them until they engage in a different topic of speech. But if the Devil causes you to forget, then after remembering, do not sit in the company of those people who are the wrong-doers.”</span> [Surah AlAn’aam: 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been reported that <strong>Ibraaheem bin Adham</strong> was once invited to a waleemah (wedding feast), so he attended it and found people there who were mentioning a man that didn’t come, saying: &#8220;He is truly lazy.&#8221; So Ibraaheem said: &#8220;I brought this upon myself, such that I attended a place in which people are backbiting one another.&#8221; So he left from there and did not eat for three days. What has been recited of poetry with regard to this is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“And restrain your ears from hearing vile speech<br />
Just as you restrain your tongue from speaking it<br />
Because when you listen to this vile speech<br />
You are a partner to the one saying it, so reflect.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What Should One Do When He Hears His Shaikh, Friend Or Someone Else Being Backbitten?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that it is upon the one who hears a Muslim being backbitten to oppose it and prevent the one doing the backbiting. If he is not able to prevent him with his speech, then he should stop him with his hand. If he is neither able to do so with his hand or with his tongue, then he should get up and leave that gathering. And if he hears his teacher (shaikh) being backbitten – or anyone else who has a right over him, or if the person (being backbitten) is from the people of righteousness and nobility, then his concern with what we have mentioned above should be greater.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim believes that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and the last Prophet. Allaah (Azza wa Jal) says: <span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allaah and the last of the Prophets</span>. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Ahzaab, 33:40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah entrusted Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with the final and complete message of Islam, calling mankind to worship none but Allaah. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the best of the Messengers and the best of mankind. He, has no share at all of Ruboobiyyah (lordship) nor any share of Divinity. Contemplate the saying of Allaah regarding Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say, O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), it is not within my power to bring benefit nor to keep away harm except as Allaah wills; and if I knew what the future holds I could amass a great deal of wealth and harm would not befall me. But I am just a Messenger from Allaah sent by Him to warn those who disobey Him of His punishment, and to give glad tidings of His reward fro those who truly believe in Him and are obedient to Him.</span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-A’raaf, 7:188].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">I am just a human like yourselves, I forget just as you forget. So, if I forget, then remind me.</span>” [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The belief that Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the Messenger of Allaah necessitates that</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the true Messenger of Allaah; he did not lie nor was he belied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-The Muslim should follow his teachings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3-The Muslim believes in all of the reports which he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) related regarding the past, present and future and that these reports were revealed to him by Allaah (Azza wa Jal) and was not something which he knew on his own.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4-We comply with his commands</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5-We stay away from what he forbade</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6-We defend the Sharee’ah with which he was entrusted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7-We comply with all that the he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) brought from the Sharee’ah as if it were from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In the sight of the mystic Soofis,</strong></span> the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is looked upon in ways that oppose the path which Allaah (Azza wa Jal) intended for the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This could be summarized in the following points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-Many Soofis stress the concept of what they call <strong>Al- Haqeeqah Al-Muhammadiyyah</strong> or the <strong>“Perfect Man” (Al- Insaan Al-Kaamil)</strong>. In the world of Soofism, Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil is the “barrier” qualified with both the Essence of Allaah and the essence of creation. And he is the one who comprises all the worlds of the Divine and that of creation, the complete and the partial. He deserves the Names of the Thaat (Allaah’s Essence) and the Divine Qualities. The Soofee mystics refer to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as being the “Perfect Man” or the “Al- Haqeeqah Al-Muhammadiyyah”: The Thaat (Essence of Allaah) in its first designation; to him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) belongs all of the Most Beautiful Names [of Allaah] and that he is Al-Ism Al-A’tham (Allaah’s Greatest Name). From Muhammad, the entire creation, this world and the Hereafter, was brought to exist!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is most fully described by ‘Abdul al-Karim Al-Jeeli (d.820Hj/1417 C.E.), a Soofee of the school of Ibn ‘Arabi, in his book Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil. [29] In this book he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Know, may Allaah guard and protect you, that Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil (the Perfect Man) is the Qutub (the axis) around which the spheres of existence from beginning to end revolves. And he is one since the being of existence and forever and ever. Furthermore, he takes on various forms and appears in churches&#8230;his original name which belongs to him is Muhammad&#8230;I met him while he was in the image of my sheikh Sharaf-ud-Deen Ismaa’eel Al- Jhubratee&#8230;the secret behind this matter is him being able to take the form of every image&#8230;” [30]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the same creed of Ibn ‘Arabi and the advocates of <strong>Wahdat Al-Wujud</strong>, those who claim that Allaah is the essence of all that exits. They consider the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as the first created being and from him originated rest of creation and that he himself is the God who is above the Throne. Such concept is similar to the philosophical concept of the “<strong>first cause</strong>” or the “<strong>first active intellect</strong>” from whom the creation emanated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-Some Soofis hold to the same concept as above but do not say that the essence of Muhammad is above the ‘Arsh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3-Many Soofis claim that <strong>the light of Muhammad</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the first being, and that he is the most honorable of creation, and for his sake Allaah has created the universe. They do not explicitly say that the creatures originated from him. [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most Soofis, however, concur that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the <strong>essence of emanation of all knowledge</strong>. Some of them consider that this emanation is eternal, meaning that it is present even before the existence of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). That is why a large sector of the Soofis believe that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) <strong>knows the Ghayb</strong> and that nothing escapes his knowledge in the heavens and on the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have also innovated many practices aimed at showing their so-called love of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) including <strong>celebrations of the Prophet’s birthday</strong> and his journey of <strong>Israa’ and Mi’raaj</strong>, his <strong>Hadrah</strong>, [32] and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They even <strong>call upon the Prophet</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم) seeking aid and help believing that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) responds and answers such Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such concepts, beliefs, and practices concerning the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) are corrupt and contradict the Message of the Qur’aan and Sunnah as well as the way of the true believers, the Sahaabah and those who followed them on the path of righteousness, may Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE SECOND FOUNDATION:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by the “knowledge” that is mentioned in the ayaat and the ahaadeeth is knowledge of the Religion. As for the universal, physical and material sciences, then these are all a collective obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These sciences fall under Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And prepare against them all you can of power, including steeds of war…”</span> [Surah Al- Anfaal: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also fall under the principle: “There is no harming (of oneself) or harming others.” And they fall under the principle: “That which is necessary for the fulfilment of an obligation becomes itself obligatory.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This principle consists of the following matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The statement: “<strong>This is obligatory for every Muslim or student of knowledge to know</strong>” cannot be applied unrestrictedly to any of the types of knowledge except for the Islamic sciences. An example of this is what is known nowadays as “<strong>Knowledge of Current Affairs</strong>”, which focuses on following reports and information from newspapers and magazines, and which some people say is: “An obligatory form of knowledge that every student of knowledge is required to learn!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The type of knowledge that the Salaf praised and which they intended by their statements is nothing else but <strong>knowledge of the Religion</strong>. This is the knowledge that was intended in statements such as that of Mu’aadh (radhi Allaahu anhu), when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Learn knowledge, for indeed learning it for the sake of Allaah is awe (of Him), seeking it is worship, studying it is glorification (of Allaah), researching it is Jihaad, teaching it to those unaware of it is charity, and giving it out to one’s family builds ties. It is a friend in privacy, a companion in solitude, a guide in times of ease, an aide in times of difficulty, a counselor to the friends (of Allaah), a close-relative to the strangers, and a lighthouse for the path to Paradise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah raises people by way of it, thus making them noble leaders, emulated chiefs in matters of good, and guides to goodness whose footsteps are followed and whose deeds are highly regarded</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, from the things that this principle entails is that: The knowledge that Allaah, His Messenger and the predecessors, such as the Sahaabah and the Taabi’een have praised is nothing else but knowledge of the Religion. As for all of the other forms of knowledge, they were not the ones intended in the praise for “knowledge” found in these ayaat, ahaadeeth and statements of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So knowledge of medicine, engineering, chemistry, and physics is not what was intended in the ayaat and ahaadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we come to understand this, we must ask: “What is the ruling on learning these other sciences?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: It falls under the <strong>collective obligations</strong>, Acquiring knowledge of these sciences falls under (the principle): “That which is necessary for the fulfillment of an obligation becomes itself obligatory.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Acquiring knowledge of these sciences falls under the statement of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">And prepare against them all you can of power, including steeds of war…</span>” [Surah Al- Anfaal: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the ruling on these sciences. If some people take on the responsibility of learning them, the obligation becomes removed from everyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under the requisites of this principle is what I mentioned to you previously – that it cannot be unrestrictedly stated that these sciences or their likes are obligatory for every Muslim to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for all the more reason, <strong><span style="color:#333300;">it is incorrect to unrestrictedly say that the knowledge of that which is associated with newspapers and magazines is from the “knowledge” that every student is obliged to learn</span></strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Posted from al-ibaanah e-Book – <a title="Guarding the Tongue : Imaam an-Nawawee" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/08/guardingtongueimamnawawi/">Guarding the Tongue : Imaam an-Nawawee</a> </em><br />
<em><a href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/08/guardingtongueimamnawawi">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/08/guardingtongueimamnawawi</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that although backbiting is forbidden, it becomes permissible under certain circumstances when done for a beneficial reason. That which makes it allowable is a valid and legitimate goal, which cannot be achieved except by doing it (i.e. the backbiting). These goals can be broken down into six categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Oppression</strong></span> &#8211; It is permissible for the one who is oppressed to complain about his situation to the ruler or the judge or anyone else who holds authority or has the ability to grant him justice against his oppressor. He should say: &#8220;Such and such person wronged me&#8221; and &#8220;he did such thing to me&#8221;, and &#8220;he coerced me in this manner&#8221; and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Seeking assistance in changing an evil and returning a sinner back to what is correct</strong></span> &#8211; One should say to the individual whom he expects has the ability to put an end to the evil: &#8220;Such and such person did this, so prevent him&#8221; or something to that effect. His objective should be to look for a way to ultimately put an end to the evil. If he does not intend this as his goal, then it is forbidden (for him to mention it).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Seeking a fatwa (religious ruling)</strong></span> &#8211; One should do this by saying to the muftee (scholar capable of issuing a fatwa): &#8220;My father&#8221; or &#8220;my brother&#8221; or &#8220;such and such person wronged me in this way.&#8221; &#8220;Does he have the right to do so?&#8221; &#8220;How shall I go about putting an end to it and obtain my right while repelling oppression from myself?&#8221; and so on. Likewise, one may say: &#8220;My wife did such and such to me&#8221; or &#8220;my husband did such and such a thing&#8221; and so on. This is permissible due to the necessity for it, however, to be more cautious, it is better for one to say: &#8220;What do you say about a man who has done such and such thing?&#8221; or &#8220;concerning a husband&#8221; or &#8220;concerning a wife who did such and such&#8221; (without saying “my”), etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By doing this, the goal is achieved without having to resort to specifying anyone. However, specifying an individual by name is permissible (in this circumstance), based on the hadeeth of Hind (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa), which we shall mention later, by the Will of Allaah, in which she told Allaah’s Messenger: &#8220;Indeed, Abu Sufyaan (her husband) is a stingy man.&#8221; And the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم did not forbid her from saying this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>4. Warning and Advising the Muslims against Evil</strong></span> &#8211; There are several perspectives to this, of which one is: Declaring someone unreliable in the field of narrating hadeeth and giving testimony. This is permissible to do, according to the Ijmaa&#8217; (consensus of the Muslim scholars). Rather, it becomes obligatory due to the need for it. Another case is when an individual desires to enter into a relationship with another person either through marriage, business, the consignment of property, the consigning of something to him or any other of the daily affairs. It is obligatory on you to mention to that individual what you know about the person he wants to get involved with, with the intention of advising him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If your objective can be achieved by simply saying: &#8220;It is not good for you to engage with him in business transactions” or “in a relationship through marriage&#8221; or by saying: &#8220;You should not do this&#8221; or anything similar to that, then adding more to this, such as by mentioning his bad characteristics is not permissible. And if the objective cannot be reached, except by specifically explaining that person’s condition to him, then you may mention that to him in detail. Another case is when you see someone buying a product from an individual who is known for stealing or fornicating or drinking or other than these. It is then upon you to inform the buyer of this, on the count that he is not knowledgeable of it already. And this case is not specified to this example only. Rather, it also applies to when you have knowledge that the commodity that is being traded is defective. It is then obligatory upon you to clarify this matter to the buyer, if he is not aware of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another case is when you see a student going to an innovator or a deviant, seeking to attain knowledge from him, and you fear that it may affect the student. In that situation, you must advise him about the state of that innovator, on the condition that your intention only be for the sake of advising. And this is something in which regard many people fall into error, for perhaps the person speaking may do this (advising) because he is jealous (of the person he is warning against). Or perhaps the Devil may deceive him about this matter, causing him to believe that what he is doing is advising and showing compassion, so he believes this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One last case is when a person has some leadership role, which he does not fulfill properly either because he is not fit for it or because he is a sinner or neglectful, etc. So in this case, one must mention this to those who have general leadership over this person, so that he can be removed and someone fit can be put in charge. Or those who have charge over him can know this about him so that they can deal with him accordingly and not be deceived by him, and so that they can make the right efforts to encourage him to be upright or to replace him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5. When one openly exposes his acts of evil or his innovation</strong></span> &#8211; An example of this is when someone has openly exposed his consumption of alcohol, or his illegal confiscation of people’s money and raising of their taxes unjustly and his usurping command wrongfully. It is thus permissible for one to talk about what that individual has made public. But it is forbidden to mention any of his other defects, unless they fall under one of the categories in which we have mentioned that backbiting is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6. Defining someone</strong> </span>&#8211; If someone is known to the people by his nickname, such as “the bleary eyed one”, “the one who limps”, “the deaf guy”, “the blind guy”, “crosseyed”, “flat-nosed”, and other than that, then it is permissible to particularize him as such, with the aim of identifying him. However, it is forbidden to apply that to him, when one’s intention is to degrade him. If he can be identified with another (more appropriate) type of name, then that is more preferable. These are the six cases in which the scholars have stated that backbiting is permissible, if it is done in accordance to the guidelines we mentioned above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidences for the permissibility of backbiting can be found in authentic and well-known ahaadeeth. Furthermore, there is an agreement of the scholars concerning the allowance of backbiting in these six cases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Saheehs of Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim that &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;A man sought permission of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم to enter (his house), so he said: &#8216;Permit him to enter, and what an evil brother to (his) relatives he is.'&#8221;</span> [26] Al-Bukhaaree uses this hadeeth as evidence for the permissibility of backbiting the people of mischief and doubts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu) narrated: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم divided a portion (of war booty amongst the people), so a man from the Ansaar said: &#8216;I swear by Allaah, Muhammad did not intend the face of Allaah by this (i.e. he was not fair).&#8217; So I went to Allaah’s Messenger and informed him of this. His face changed (i.e. he became mad) and said: &#8216;May Allaah have mercy on Moosaa. He was indeed abused with greater than this, but he was patient.'&#8221;</span> [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In some of the reports of the hadeeth, Ibn Mas&#8217;ood said: &#8220;I said: I will not raise another hadeeth to him again, after this.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaaree uses this hadeeth as proof that a person is allowed to inform his brother of what is being said about him. &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) reported that Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم once said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I do not think that this person and that person know anything at all about our Religion.&#8221;</span> [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Laith bin Sa’ad, one of the narrators of the hadeeth&#8217;s chain said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;They were two individuals from among the hypocrites (at his time).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zayd bin Arqam (radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We set out on a journey with the Prophet and the people suffered great difficulty (due to a lack of provisions). So &#8216;Abdullaah bin Ubay [29] said to his companions: &#8216;Don&#8217;t spend on those who are with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger so that they may disperse and go away from him.&#8217; He said: &#8216;If we return to Madeenah, surely, the more honorable will expel the lowly ones from it. So I went to the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم and informed him of that. He sent for &#8216;Abdullaah bin Ubay and asked him, but &#8216;Abdullaah bin Ubay swore that he did not say so. So the people said: &#8216;Zayd told a lie to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8217; And what they said distressed me very much. Later Allaah revealed the confirmation of my statement in His saying; ‘When the hypocrites come to you&#8230;’ [Surah Al-Munafiqeen]”</span> [30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also there is the hadeeth of Hind (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa), the wife of Abu Sufyaan, in which she said to the Prophet: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed, Abu Sufyaan is a stingy man.</span>&#8221; [31] And also the hadeeth of Faatimah Bint Qays (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa), when the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said to her (with regard to her accepting marriage proposals from two suitors): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">As for Mu&#8217;awiyah, then he is utterly poor. And as for Abu Jahm, then he does not cease to remove the stick from his shoulder (i.e. he beats his wives).</span>&#8221; [32]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, may He be Blessed and Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-3-38.png" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This is the time when Zakariya invoked his Lord, saying: <strong>&#8216;O my Lord! Grant me from You, a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocations.</strong>&#8216;&#8221;</span> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says quoting Zakariya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-19-5.png" alt="" width="437" height="37" /><br />
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-19-6.png" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>And verily, I fear my relatives after me, since my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself a walee (righteous worshipper) who will inherit me and inherit the posterity of Ya&#8217;qoob. And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased.</strong>”</span> [Surah Maryam: 5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shanqeetee said in Adwaa-ul-Bayaan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah&#8217;s statement in this noble verse: &#8216;So give me from Yourself a walee&#8217; – what is meant by the word walee here is a son specifically and not any other type of walee (righteous person). This is based on proof found in Allaah&#8217;s saying while relating the same story: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;This is the time when Zakariya invoked his Lord, saying: &#8216;O my Lord! Grant me from You, a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation.</span>&#8221; [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also indicates that what is meant (by the word walee, i.e. righteous person) here is a child by His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-21-89.png" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And remember Zakariya when he cried to his Lord: &#8216;O my Lord, leave me not single! You are the best of the inheritors.&#8221;&#8217;</span> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 89] &#8216;Leave me not single&#8217; means: &#8216;Alone and without a child.&#8217;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[End of Ash-Shanqeetee&#8217;s words] [Adwaa-ul-Bayaan (3/365)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is for this reason that from amongst the supplications of the believers – &#8220;those from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and overlook their evil deeds, they shall be among the dwellers of Paradise – a promise of truth, which they have been promised” – is that which Allaah has mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-46-15.png" alt="" width="466" height="105" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;My Lord! Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful for Your Favour which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds, such as please You, and make my offspring good. Truly, I have turned to You in repentance, and truly I am one of the Muslims.”</span> [Surah Al-Ahqaaf: 15]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Their Attributes and Characteristics</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First Characteristic:</strong></span> They are young in age. [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 5057) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Characteristic:</strong></span> They have foolish minds &#8211; i.e. intellects. [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 5057) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> They come out from the Religion just as an arrow comes out from the hunted game. Then they do not return back to it. [Muslim (no. 2496) from the hadeeth of Abu Dharr (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">They shoot out from the Religion just as an arrow shoots out from the hunted game</span>.&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 5058) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another report it states: &#8220;They shoot out from Islaam&#8230;&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 5057) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Sixth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They have a weakness when it comes to understanding the Religion of Allaah. This is why it has been reported that &#8220;They recite the Qur&#8217;aan but it does not surpass&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2456)] &#8220;&#8230;or go past their throats.&#8221; [Al- Bukhaaree (no. 5058) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, it states: &#8220;&#8230;their pharynxes (hulooq).&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2455) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;&#8230;their collar bones (taraaqeehim).&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 6934) from Sahl bin Haneef (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;They will make their tongues eloquent with the Qur&#8217;aan.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 937) from Abu Bakrah (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;They will recite the Qur&#8217;aan with their tongues but it will not go past their collar bones.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2470) from Sahl bin Haneef (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: &#8220;They will hold it (i.e. the recitation) to be for them, when it is against them.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 916) from &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;They will think&#8230;&#8221; instead of &#8220;They will hold&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2467) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, he صلى الله عليه و سلم said: &#8220;They will call to the Book of Allaah, but they will have nothing to do with Allaah.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 941) from Abu Zaid Al-Ansaaree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration of the hadeeth, the Khawaarij and what they undergo when reciting the Qur&#8217;aan was mentioned to Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhi Allaahu anhu), so he said: &#8220;They are not as extreme in their striving as the Jews and the Christians were, but yet they went astray.&#8221; [Ash- Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 27-28)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration, Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: &#8220;They believe in His clear verses, but go astray concerning His unclear verses 10 &#8211; No one knows their hidden meanings except Allaah. And as for those firmly rooted in knowledge, they say: &#8216;We believe in it.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: &#8220;They are in a confused and drunken state. They are neither Jews nor Christians nor Magians, so that they may be excused.&#8221; [Ash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 28)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Seventh Characteristic:</strong> </span>They are excessive in performing acts of worship, as occurs in the hadeeth in which the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم spoke to his Companions about them, saying: &#8220;Your prayer is nothing as compared to their prayer. Your fasting is nothing as compared to their fasting. And your reciting the Qur&#8217;aan is nothing as compared to their reciting.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2467) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration of this hadeeth, it states: &#8220;You will look down at your prayer as compared to their prayer&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2455) from Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: &#8220;&#8230;(and you will look down) at your deeds as compared to their deeds.&#8221; [Sharh Usool &#8216;Itiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah (8/1231)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Eighth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They are the worst of creation and creatures. [Muslim (no. 2469) from the hadeeth of Abu Dharr (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu &#8216;Abdillaah Ahmad bin Hanbal (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;The Khawaarij are an evil people. I don&#8217;t know of any people on the earth that are worse than them.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Abu Bakr Al-Khallaal (no. 110)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Ninth Characteristic:</span></strong> Their distinguishing attribute is that they shave their heads. [Muslim (no. 2457) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration of the hadeeth, it states: &#8220;At-Tasbeet.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 4765) from Anas bin Maalik radhi Allaahu anhu ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tasbeet means: Removing the short hair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Tenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They will kill the people of Faith and leave alone the worshippers of idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, it states: &#8220;They will kill the people of Islaam&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2451) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Eleventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They will become so deeply absorbed (i.e. ta&#8217;ammuq) in the Religion [11] to the point that they will leave from it. [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 930) from &#8216;Abdullaah bin &#8216;Amr (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twelfth Characteristic:</strong></span> They disparage their rulers and claim them to be upon misguidance, as &#8216;Abdullaah bin Dhil-Khuwaisrah did with the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They call the people to the Book of Allaah but have nothing to do with it. [12] [Abu Dawood (no. 4765) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al- Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) and Anas bin Maalik (radhi Allaahu anhu)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They do not believe that the people of knowledge and virtue hold a special position. This was why they perceived that they were more knowledgeable than &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib, Ibn &#8216;Abbaas and the rest of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with all of them. [Al-Khawaarij Awwalul-Firaq fee Taareekh-il- Islaam (pg. 38)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by ta&#8217;ammuq is: Relying and using as proof that which the religious texts do not substantiate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They go to extremes in worship. So they perform acts of worship to the extent that those who see them become amazed with them and they become amazed with themselves. 13 [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 945) from the hadeeth of Anas bin Maalik (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;And I have not seen a people that are stricter in their exertion (of worship) than them. Their hands are like the calluses of camels and their foreheads are marked due to the traces of prostration.&#8221; [Majma&#8217;-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id (6/240)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="more-34135"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Sixteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhi Allaahu anhu) held them to be the worst of creation. He (radhi Allaahu anhu) said about them: &#8220;They took ayaat that were revealed concerning the disbelievers and applied them to the believers.&#8221; Al-Bukhaaree reported this narration under the &#8220;Chapter: Killing the Khawaarij and Heretics after establishing the proof against them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: &#8220;And Allaah will never lead a people astray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them what they should be avoiding.&#8221; [Surah At-Tawbah: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Seventeenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They will set out (to fight) against the best group amongst people.&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 6933)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Eighteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> Allaah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And among them are some who accuse you (O Muhammad) in the matter of the (distribution of) alms&#8230;&#8221; [Surah At- Tawbah: 58] was revealed concerning &#8216;Abdullaah bin Dhil-Khuwaisirah At-Tameemee, the founding father of the Khawaarij. [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 6933) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Nineteenth Characteristic:</strong> </span>Their prayer does not go past their throats. [Muslim (no. 2467) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Twentieth Characteristic:</span></strong> There is a great reward for he who kills them. &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;If the army that encounters them knew what was ordained for them upon the tongue of their prophet, they would only rely on that action.&#8221; [Abu Dawood (no. 4768)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, it reads: &#8220;Whoever fights them has more right to Allaah than them.&#8221; [Abu Dawood (no. 4765) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) and Anas bin Maalik (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration, it states: &#8220;Toobaa is for he who kills them and is killed by them.&#8221; [Abu Dawood (no. 4765) from Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) and Ahmad (no. 19172) from &#8216;Abdullaah bin Abee Awfaa (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Umaamah (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;They are the worst of those who are killed under the surface of the sky. And the best of those who are killed is he who is killed at their hands.&#8221; And (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;These individuals were Muslims but became disbelievers.&#8221; [Ibn Maajah (no. 176)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-First Characteristic:</strong></span> They shed unlawful blood &#8211; whether their own by way of suicide or others by transgressing against them by way of murder. [Muslim (no. 246) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> As &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;They will speak the truth with their tongues, but it will not go past this from them.&#8221; &#8211; And he pointed to his throat. &#8220;They are from the most despised of Allaah&#8217;s creation to Him.&#8221; He (radhi Allaahu anhu) said this when they told him: &#8220;There is no rule except for that of Allaah&#8217;s.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2468) from the statement of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> They are the first ones who split away from the unified body of Muslims and declared them to be disbelievers due to (their committing of) sins. [Majmoo&#8217;-ul-Fataawaa of Shaikh-ul-lslaam Ibn Taimiyyah (3/349 and 7/279)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> They beautify their speech but produce vile actions &#8211; after mentioning the differing and division in the ummah. [Abu Dawood (no. 4765) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> Every time a new generation springs forth from them, it gets cut off (i.e. from the Jamaa&#8217;ah). [Ibn Maajah (no. 174) from Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong></span> There will emerge from amidst them the Dajjaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a narration it states: &#8220;&#8230;from their treachery&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one manuscript: &#8220;&#8230;from their ranks&#8230;&#8221; And that refers to a great army. [Ibn Maajah (no. 174) from the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They are from those in whose hearts is a deviation, as has been interpreted from the saying of Allaah: &#8220;But as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation, they follow what is unclear thereof&#8230;&#8221; [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 7] and His saying: &#8220;On the Day when some faces will be brightened and some faces will be darkened&#8230;&#8221; [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 106] that the ones who are intended by these verses were the Khawaarij. [Ahmad (no. 22313) from Abu Umaamah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Eighth Characteristic:</strong></span> They declare a Muslim to be a disbeliever due to every sin. And they say: &#8220;The leave the fold of Eemaan and enter into disbelief.&#8221; [Sharh al-&#8216;Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah (pg. 298) with the verification of Ahmad Shaakir]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Ninth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They hold that the Muslims who commit major sins will reside eternally in the Hellfire. [Sharh al-&#8216;Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah (pg. 360) with the verification of Ahmad Shaakir]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirtieth Characteristic:</strong></span> They hold it as an obligatory duty to rebel against the leader if he opposes the Sunnah. [Al-Milal wan-Nihal (1/115)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-First Characteristic:</strong></span> They are the worst of people in deriving rules based on analogy. [14] [Al-Milal wan-Nihal (1/1 16)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> They deem the subjects disbelievers &#8211; those absent as well as those present &#8211; if their leader commits disbelief. This is done by the Baihasiyyah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij. [Al-Milal wan-Nihal (1/126)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> They declare those who don&#8217;t agree with their views to be disbelievers, and they consider their blood lawful for shedding. The also permit the killing of the women and children that oppose them. This is done by the Azaariqah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij. [Lawaami&#8217;-ul-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah (1/86)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> They hold that Faith (Eemaan) is: Knowledge of Allaah and of what the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم came with. So whoever commits something that he is not sure of as to whether it is lawful or unlawful, he is a disbeliever, since he was obligated to have researched into the matter. This is done by the Baihasiyyah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij. [Lawaami&#8217;-ul-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah (1/87)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> They hold that it is obligatory to fight against the ruler alone as well as whoever is pleased with his rule. As for those who reject the ruler, then it is not permissible to fight against them unless they support the ruler, attack the beliefs of the Khawaarij or serve as guides for the ruler. 15 This is done by the &#8216;Ujaaradah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They say: &#8220;Every sin that a person commits makes him a disbeliever, since he is ignorant of Allaah. This is done by the Makramiyyah al- Munshaqqah from the Tha&#8217;alabiyyah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> There will be from among them those who will be with the Dajjaal during the Last Days. It was said to &#8216;Alee radhi Allaahu anhu: &#8220;All praise be to Allaah who rescued the servants from them.&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Nay. I swear by the One in whose Hand my soul is, there are still some of them that remain in the loins of men and verily, there are those amongst them who will be with the Dajjaal. [Lawaami&#8217;-ul-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah (1/86)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Eighth Characteristic:</strong></span> They do not respect the sanctity of places or times, as occurred with the Qaraamitah and those who came after them until this very day of ours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Ninth Characteristic:</strong></span> They do not hold that an oppressive ruler has the right to leadership. [Maqaalaat al-lslaamiyeen (1/204)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fortieth Characteristic:</strong></span> They cling onto the apparent meanings of the Qur&#8217;aanic texts. Even though they don&#8217;t intend to oppose it, however, they understand from it that which the texts do not indicate. Due to this, they have claimed that the prophets committed major and minor sins based on Allaah&#8217;s statement: &#8220;Verily, We have given you a manifest victory &#8211; So that Allaah may forgive you of your past and future sins.&#8221; [Surah Al-Fat&#8217;h: 1-2] So according to them, the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم may commit disbelief then repent. [Al-Khawaarij &#8211; &#8216;Aqeedatan wa Fikran wa Filasufatan (pg. 54)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-First Characteristic:</strong></span> They reject the Sunnah if there is not some explicit text in the Qur&#8217;aan that supports it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-lslaam Ibn Taimiyyah (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;They do not take anything from the Sunnah except for that which can be interpreted in its general sense, not including those texts that contradict what is apparently stated in the Qur&#8217;aan, according to them. So they do not believe in stoning the fornicator nor do they believe that there is a minimum (stolen) amount, which constitutes stealing.&#8221; [Majmoo&#8217;-ul-Fataawaa (13/48)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> They lie in wait on the roads for the purpose of attacking the passers-by and spilling their blood without any justification from Allaah. [Al-Mustadrak of Al-Haakim (2/153) and Majma&#8217;-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id (6/236) from the speech of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> Not one of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم could be found amongst them (i.e. to support them). [Al-Mustadrak of Al-Haakim (2/150)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> There are many amongst them that differ with one another. This is why they have divided into so many sects, some of which set out to fight against the other and at times, some of which deliver speeches against the other. Allaah spoke truthfully when He said: &#8220;If it (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) were from other than Allaah, you would have found many differences in it.&#8221; [Surah An-Nisaa: 82] [Al- Khawaarij- Aqeedatan wa Fikran wa Filasufatan (pg. 54)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> They are the dogs of the inhabitants of Hell. [Sharh &#8216;Itiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah (8/1232)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong></span> They outwardly manifest the attributes of calling to good and forbidding evil, redirecting the religious texts concerning that towards disputing with the rulers, rebelling against them and fighting against those who oppose them. [Ash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 22) and Al-Khawaarij Awwalul-Firaq fee Taareekh-il-lslaam (P9- 37)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They speak using the speech and words of the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin al-Husayn (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;It is not befitting for one who sees the tireless efforts of a Khaarijee that has rebelled against a ruler &#8211; whether just or tyrannical &#8211; thus setting out against him, rallying a group against him, unsheathing swords and deeming it lawful to fight against Muslims &#8211; it is not befitting for him to be deceived by such a person&#8217;s recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan nor by the length of his standing in prayer, nor by his perseverance in fasting, nor by his good words concerning knowledge, so long as he holds the views of the Khawaarij.&#8221; [Ash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 28)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Eighth Characteristic:</strong></span> They permit oppression against the Prophet M- [Al- Bukhaaree (no. 6933) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) and Majmoo&#8217;-ul- Fataawaa of Ibn Taimiyyah (19/73)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Ninth Characteristic:</strong></span> They use as evidence verses from the Qur&#8217;aan that deal with the wa&#8217;eed (Allaah&#8217;s threat of punishment) while abandoning the verses concerning the wa&#8217;ad (Allaah&#8217;s promise for forgiveness). [Al-Khawaarij Awwalul-Firaq fee Taareekh-il-lslaam (pg. 38)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fiftieth Characteristic:</strong></span> They are hasty in applying rulings. [Al-Khawaarij Awwalul- Firaq fee Taareekh-il-lslaam (pg. 146)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-First Characteristic:</strong></span> They make rulings and accusations against the hearts. This includes issuing rulings on one&#8217;s decisions and notions. [Al-Khawaarij Awwalul- Firaq fee Taareekh-il-lslaam (pg. 147)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> Among them is he who has doubts concerning the well-established historical events. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 133)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> They call to illiteracy and they make war against education, claiming that it is not possible to combine between the religious sciences and the practical secular sciences. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 134)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> They call to splitting away from the Muslim community. So they boycott the schools, institutes, universities, government positions and residing with Muslims. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 137)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> From among them is he who believes that a person who holds that the consensus (Ijmaa&#8217;) of the scholars is proof is a disbeliever. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 143)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong></span> Among them is he who disparages the Companions and rejects their statements. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 144)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They oppose those scholars that make blind- following permissible for the common person and the beginner student, claiming that blind-following (taqleed) is a cause for disbelief and the destruction of the nation of Islaam. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 146-147)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Eighth Characteristic:</strong></span> They kill themselves in suicide operations basing that on false arguments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] This is a characteristic that is common with all innovators, since they go astray with regard to Allaah&#8217;s unclear verses. They do not try to combine between the clear and unclear verses, as those firmly-grounded in knowledge do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] What is meant by ta&#8217;ammuq is: Relying and using as proof that which the religious texts do not substantiate</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Meaning: They will seek to use evidences from the Book of Allaah but err in their manner of deriving the basis of proof from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Being amazed with oneself is one of the causes that lead the people of innovation astray. And it is one of the pathways that the Devil uses to enter into the affairs of worshippers, Mujaahideen and ascetics, so long as they do not adhere to the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] I say: This is with respect to the later ones among them. As for the initial Khawaarij, then they rarely performed analytical deduction. Rather, they would apply their poor understanding to the religious texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] How similar does tonight resemble last night, for everyone that warns against their ways is accused (by them) as regards his Religion. They deem it permissible to fight against the police and security officers who are the cause for maintaining peace and safety.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaikh-ul-lslaam Ibn Taimiyyah said in his book AI-&#8216;Aqeedat-ul-Waasitiyyah:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Among the Principles of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah is maintaining pure hearts and tongues towards the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), as Allaah has described them in His saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;And those who come after them say: &#8216;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Faith. And put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord, You are indeed full of kindness, most Merciful.&#8217;</span> [Surah Al-Hashr: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (from their principles is) obedience to the Prophet with regard to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Do not revile my Companions! For by the One whose Hand my soul is in, if one of you were to give away the size of mount Uhud in gold for charity, it would not equal a mudd of one of them nor even half of it.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They accept what is stated in the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah and the Consensus concerning their (the Companion&#8217;s) virtues and high status. And they give preference to those who spent their wealth and fought (in the Way of Allaah) before the Victory, which refers to the Treaty of al-Hudaibiyah, over those who gave their wealth and fought after it. They give precedence to the Muhaajireen over the Ansaar. And they believe that Allaah said to the people who fought in (the Battle of) Badr &#8211; who numbered over three hundred people: <strong>&#8216;Do whatever you wish, for I have already forgiven you.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they believe that no one who pledged their allegiance to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) under the tree will enter the Hellfire, as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) informed us. In fact, Allaah was pleased with them and they were pleased with Him. And they were more than one thousand four hundred people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They designate to Paradise whoever the Messenger of Allaah testified will be in Paradise, such as the Ten (Companions), Thaabit bin Qays bin Shammas and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They confirm what has been reported in tawaatur form on the Commander of the Believers, &#8216;Alee Ibn Abee Taalib and others that: The best of this ummah after its Prophet are Abu Bakr; then &#8216;Umar. Then they place &#8216;Uthmaan third and &#8216;Alee fourth, may Allaah be pleased with all of them. This is as is indicated in the athaar (reports from the Sahaabah) and as was unanimously agreed upon that &#8216;Uthmaan had precedence (over &#8216;Alee) for being pledged allegiance to (for the Khilaafah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of this, after unanimously agreeing to the precedence of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, some of Ahl-us-Sunnah have disagreed with regard to &#8216;Uthmaan and &#8216;Alee as to which of them is better. So a group of them gave precedence to &#8216;Uthmaan and then remained silent, and placed &#8216;Alee as the fourth. And another group gave precedence to &#8216;Alee. And yet another group remained neutral. But the affair of Al-us-Sunnah settled upon giving precedence to &#8216;Uthmaan and then &#8216;Alee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regardless, this issue of &#8216;Uthmaan and &#8216;Alee is not from the principles by which the one who disagrees concerning it becomes misguided (and deviant), according to the majority of the (scholars of) Ahl-us-Sunnah. Rather, the issue in which the one who opposes becomes misguided is the issue of the Khilaafah &#8211; and it is that they (must) believe that the Khaleefah after Allaah&#8217;s Messenger was Abu Bakr, then &#8216;Umar, then &#8216;Uthmaan, then &#8216;Alee. And whoever attacks the Khilaafah of any one of them, then he is more astray than the donkey of his people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then he mentioned that they have love and affection for the Members of the Household of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and that they preserve the Will (final requests) of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger concerning them. And that they have affection for the Wives of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, the Mothers of the Believers and believe that they will be his wives in the Hereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They absolve themselves from the way of the Rawaafid &#8211; those who hate the Companions and revile them &#8211; and from the way of the Nawaasib &#8211; those who abuse the Members of the (Prophet&#8217;s) Household &#8211; through speech or action. And they refrain from (delving into) the disputes that occurred between the Companions. And they say: These narrations that have been reported concerning their faults have in them some that are false, some that have had things added to them, some that have had parts omitted from them, and some that have been changed from their original state. As for those narrations that are authentic (concerning their faults), then they (the Companions) are excused (and forgiven) &#8211; either they made Ijtihaad and were correct or they made Ijtihaad and were wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, they do not believe that each of the Companions is infallible and free from committing major or minor sins. Rather, they are capable of committing sins in general, however, they possess from precedence and virtues that which necessitates that they be forgiven for whatever (sins) they commit &#8211; if they did commit any. This is even to the point that they will be forgiven for evil deeds the likes of which those who come after them will not be forgiven for. This is because they possess good deeds that wipe out the evil deeds, the likes of which will not be for those after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established from the saying of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that they are the best of generations and that if one of them were to give a mudd (of gold) in charity it would be better than if someone who came after them were to give the whole of Mount Uhud in gold. And if it was the case that one of them committed a sin, then either he repented from it or he performed some good deed that wiped it out. Or he will be forgiven for it due to the virtue of his precedence or because of the intercession of Muhammad H, of which the Companions have the most right among people of receiving. Or perhaps he was tested by some affliction in this world, by which it was expiated from him. So if this is with respect to the sins that were actualized (by them), then what about the matters in which they did Ijtihaad? If they were correct they will have two rewards and if they were incorrect they will have just one reward and their error will be forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the amount of (bad) deeds committed by some of them, that is forsaken yet forgiven, is tiny in comparison to their virtues and good qualities, such as their belief in Allaah and His Messenger, their Jihaad for His Cause, their performance of Hijrah, their support (of the Religion), as well as their beneficial knowledge and good deeds. And whoever studies the history of the &#8216;people&#8217; (i.e. the Sahaabah) with knowledge and insight, and studies the merits that Allaah bestowed unto them, he will come to know with full certainty that they are the best of creation after the prophets. There was not nor will there be anyone like them. They are the safwah (chosen elite) from all the generations of this nation (of Muslims), which is itself the best and most honorable of all nations with Allaah.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Know that having bad thoughts about someone is forbidden just like having bad speech about him</strong>. So just as it is forbidden for you to speak to others about the defects of a person, it is likewise forbidden for you to speak to yourself about that and to hold bad thoughts for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe, avoid much (types) of suspicion. Verily some (forms) of suspicion is a sin.</span>” [Surah Al-Hujuraat: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Hurairah (radhi Allaahu anhu) reported that Allaah’s Messenger (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Beware of suspicion, for indeed suspicion is the most untruthful form of speech.&#8221;</span> [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ahaadeeth with this same understanding I have mentioned here are many. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>What the backbiting of the heart means, is: When the heart has firm conviction and holds bad thoughts about someone. But as for the notions that occasionally display in one&#8217;s mind or when one talks to himself, then as long as these thoughts do not remain established and continuous in him, it is excused according to the consensus of the scholars</strong></span>. This is since he has no choice in the matter as to stop it from occurring nor can he find any way to liberate himself from it when it does occur. This is the understanding of what has been authentically established (in the texts).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed, Allaah has permitted for my ummah that which their souls whisper to them, so long as they do not speak it out (audibly) or act upon it.”</span> [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars say: “<strong>This refers to the notions that form in one&#8217;s mind, but do not become settled or established there</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they said: “This is regardless if the notion consists of backbiting, disbelief or so on (i.e. it is pardoned, so long as it does not settle). So (for example) whoever&#8217;s mind becomes flooded with thoughts of disbelief, but they are only thoughts, without him intending to have them carried out, and he then rids himself of these thoughts right after they occur, he is not a disbeliever nor is there any sin on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have already stated previously, in the chapter on the (internal) whisperings, the authentic hadeeth, in which the Companions said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! Some of us find things in our thoughts that are too tremendous to speak of.&#8221; So he (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;That is the confirmation of Faith.&#8221;</span> [41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this goes for the other reports we have mentioned in that chapter that bear the same understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for these thoughts being excused is due to what we have stated previously that these thoughts are impossible to prevent. Rather, one is only able to prevent those thoughts from becoming settled and established in one’s mind. This is why the heart’s being resolute and determined on these thoughts is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whenever these thoughts, which consist of backbiting or any other sin, present themselves in your mind, it is an obligation on you to repel them, turn away from them and mention some excuse or explanation that will change what seems apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We stated previously that if someone is presented with a notion of bad thoughts for another person, he should cut off those bad thoughts. But this is unless there is some (religiously) legislated benefit that leads to thinking (about that person) in this manner. So if such a reason exists, holding these thoughts about his deficiencies is permissible, as well as warning against them, as can be seen in the jarh (criticism) of certain witnesses, narrators and others we have mentioned in the Chapter on “What Type of Backbiting is Permissible.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[39] Saheeh – Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (10/484 of al-Fath) and Muslim (2563)<br />
[40] Saheeh – Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (5/160 of al-Fath) and Muslim (127 and 202)<br />
[41] Saheeh – Reported by Muslim (132); Translator’s Note: This hadeeth shows the Companions’ zeal and enthusiasm in commanding themselves with good and forbidding themselves from evil, such that they would even fight against the evil notions that passed through their minds. But as it is impossible to prevent such thoughts from occurring every now and then, they asked the Prophet (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) about this. His response to them meant that their trying to repel these thoughts showed their strong Eemaan (Faith) and love for good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The Following is posted from the E-Book : &#8220;<a title="Selected Examples from the Characteristics of the Extremist Khawaarij – Aadil bin ‘Alee Al-Furaydaan" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/30/selected-examples-from-the-characteristics-of-the-extremist-khawaarij-aadil-bin-alee-al-furaydaan/">Selected Examples from the Characteristics of the Extremist Khawaarij</a>&#8221; &#8211; by&nbsp;Aadil bin ‘Alee Al-Furaydaan ,Read and Reviewed by The Noble Scholars Saalih Al-Fawzaan &amp; Muhammad Al-Khumayyis</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Definition of the Khawaarij and a Warning against Them:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Khawaarij is the plural of Khaarijee, and that refers to a person that removes himself from the obedience of the true ruler, outwardly proclaims opposition to him and incites the people against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Guideline for Identifying a Khaarijee:</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) outwardly proclaims rebellion against the Muslim rulers or</p>
<p>(2) holds Muslims to be disbelievers due to major sins, apart from Shirk, or</p>
<p>(3) justifies the views of the Khawaarij and considers it permissible to shed the blood of Muslims in the name of Jihaad in the Way of Allaah and in the name of changing an evil,</p></blockquote>
<p>then these are all factors for identifying the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Their Origin:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the martyrdom of the Muslim Khaleefah, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattaab رضي الله عنه, the door to fitnah was broken, as is mentioned in the hadeeth. Then with the murder of the third Khaleefah, ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan رضي الله عنه in 35H, due to a conspiracy from Ibn Saba’ and those who were deluded by him, the fitnah (strife) was re-established – and we continue to see its evil effects up to this very day of ours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Naturally, ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib رضي الله عنه was given the oath of allegiance as the next Khaleefah after him, and so most of the Muslims gave their pledge of allegiance to him. However, Mu’aawiyah رضي الله عنه and those who were with him from the inhabitants of Syria did not give in to that, citing the reason for that as being the obligation of quickly bringing to justice those responsible for the murder of ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan رضي الله عنه. ‘Alee would tell Mu’aawiyah: “Enter into that which the people have entered into (of allegiance). And leave me to judge them. I will judge them with the truth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, ‘Aa’ishah, Talhah and Az-Zubair رضي الله عنه&nbsp;set out for Basrah upset and seeking justice for the blood of ‘Uthmaan رضي الله عنه.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee رضي الله عنه tried to convince ‘Aa’ishah, Talhah and Az-Zubair of the pressing importance of first declaring allegiance to the ruler and then to seek retribution for the murder of ‘Uthmaan رضي الله عنه. The matter finally became resolved in their mutual agreement to that. However, on the following day, the callers to mischief mobilized their forces and began skirmishes and clashes on both sides. So the peace-makers from both groups thought that the other group had deceived the other, and fighting broke out. The battle that ensued, which later came to be known as the <strong>Battle of the Camel</strong>, ended with the death of Talhah, Az-Zubair and ten-thousand members from each group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this, ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib رضي الله عنه set out to fight against Mu’aawiyah رضي الله عنه and the inhabitants of Syria. This is since he had called them to give the allegiance, however, Mu’aawiyah رضي الله عنه refused to give it, claiming that they must first avenge the murder of ‘Uthmaan رضي الله عنه. ‘Alee took this action of Mu’aawiyah as a rebellion against the religious rulership. So there occurred (between the army of the two of them) the <strong>battle of Siffeen</strong>. When ‘Alee and those with him were close to achieving victory, the army of Mu’aawiyah placed copies of the mus-haf high over the tips of their spears and appealed to the Book of Allaah for judgement…’Alee considered this to be a trick on their part, but he was coerced to accept the decision (for peace between the two fighting parties) on the part of some members of his army, especially the Qur’aanic reciters, out of their concern for the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the heels of this legislative decision (between the two factions), there appeared amongst the ranks of ‘Alee’s army some who opposed this decision. This opposition eventually ended up in their disobedience to the ruler and their rebelling against him. Rather, it even led them to declare ‘Alee رضي الله عنه a disbeliever as well as anyone that agreed with his decision. And they raised high their slogan: “There is no rule except for that of Allaah’s.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee رضي الله عنه tried to reconcile with them by presenting them with arguments and proofs, and some of them returned back due to Ibn ‘Abbaas رضي الله عنه debating with them. So when the advice was not accepted by the remaining individuals that persisted in their rejection and fanaticism, ‘Alee mobilized against them and fought them. [4] This was known as the <strong>battle of Nahrawaan</strong>. ‘Alee رضي الله عنه was able to annihilate all of them except for a small portion among them that escaped to other lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After ‘Alee was murdered at the hands of some members from the Khawaarij, the danger of the Khawaarij increased. The scattered remnants of their army joined forces and spread their poison to the youth of the ummah to the point that they took on the shape of a force within the Islamic state that threatened its security and the security of the unified body of Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This group did not cease attacking the Muslims from that time until now, as the Prophet صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم informed us. And they give themselves misleading names, when in reality they are just extensions of the first Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this current time, there have appeared many groups [5] that have adopted the ways and methods of the Khawaarij, and they have accepted many of their ideas and principles. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This is one of the beneficial additions from Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan.<br />
[4] So ‘Alee رضي الله عنه did not fight them first, rather, it was only until they first shed innocent blood and commenced fighting with him.<br />
[5] Such as the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer wal-Hijrah, the Jamaa’ah Tawaqquf wa Tabayyun and other groups.<br />
[6] Such as deeming it permissible to shed unlawful blood and take unlawful wealth under the pretense of Takfeer. This refers to the rebellious and military groups..</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First Advice: Praise and Thank Allaah for Granting you this Blessing</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since it is indeed a tremendous blessing, which Allaah bestows on whom He wills from His servants. So act well in showing thanks for it and in using it. And remember:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many people are there that are submerged in misconceptions? One misconception drives him to the east while another drives him to the west – he doesn’t know how to free himself from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And how many people are there that are immersed in vain desires, being imprisoned by them and not knowing when he will be set free?</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So give thanks to Allaah, O repentant one, and know that this blessing comes from Allaah alone. You had no will or might in the matter, except due to Allaah, the Most Kind, the All Aware.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was the One who was kind to you and guided you and did not cause you to die while you were immersed in misconceptions and vain desires. So to Him belongs the Praise in this world and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He was the One who directed you and facilitated for you the way to those who directed you towards the methodology of the Salaf as-Saalih. So how numerous are the blessings He has bestowed upon you and me. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And if you were to count the blessings of Allaah, you would never be able to account for all of them.”</span></strong> [Surah Ibraaheem: 34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So beware, beware, O my brother who has repented, of falling into self-amazement and self-delusion, or of considering yourself above Allaah’s blessing. Allaah says:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “You were the same before, until Allaah bestowed His blessing on you.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 94]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware, beware of ridiculing or mocking others, such as those who are afflicted with that which Allaah freed you from. Instead, praise Allaah that He saved you and did not test you with what He is testing them. And when you see one of these people who are afflicted (with misconceptions and vain desires) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“All praise be to Allaah who saved me from what you are being afflicted by and who blessed me over many of those whom He created.”</span></strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Show compassion for them and be merciful to them. And present to them what Allaah has given you from good and guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And know, may Allaah grant you success, that you must follow the means that will ensure the correctness of your repentance with seriousness, eagerness, honesty and sincerity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">[4] Reported by At-Tirmidhee in his Jaami&#8217; from the narration of Abu Hurairah, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu. In its chain of narration is found ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar al-&#8216;Umaree, who is weak. However, the hadeeth has supporting witnesses (from other narrations), which strengthen it to the grade of “hasan, due to other narrations.</span></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is posted from : <strong><a title="Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf – Ahmad Ash-Shihhee" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/10/01/magnificent-points-of-advice-for-those-who-have-turned-to-the-way-of-the-salaf-ahmad-ash-shihhee/">Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf </a></strong>– Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad Ash-Shihhee. This book was read to Allaamaah Rabee&#8217; al-Madkhalee who gave some good instructions regarding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Advice: Do not take Knowledge except from one who is known to be upon the Sunnah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muhammad bin Sireen (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Verily, this knowledge is Religion. So look into (i.e. investigate) whom you take your Religion from</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: <span style="color:#008000;">“They (the Sahaabah) did not used to ask concerning the isnaad (chain of narration), but when the fitnah occurred, they began saying: ‘Name your men for us.&#8217; So the People of the Sunnah would be looked to and so their hadeeth would be accepted. And the People of Innovation would be looked to and so their hadeeth would not be accepted.&#8221;</span> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when one of these repentant individuals neglects these principles and guidelines, he becomes an open target for these misconceptions and he becomes a play object for many of those who (falsely) ascribe themselves to knowledge and Salafiyyah. So all it takes is for a person to claim knowledge or manifest his connection to the scholars from Ahlus-Sunnah, and you will find the repentant youth flocking around him, without thoroughly examining the reality of his condition and without looking into his history (i.e. background). But When he sees that his followers have become many and those who love him have become engrossed with him, he begins to reveal what he was concealing and what (way) he really inclined to. So now you see him calling to (holding) leadership in the field of Da&#8217;wah and pitching a tent for gathering everyone (i.e. regardless of beliefs). Or you see him doing other things that are in opposition to the principles of Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the point where the repentant individuals begin to become confused and divided into two or even three categories &#8211; those who agree, those who are against and those who are neutral. This confusion only comes about due to two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: The repentant individual&#8217;s lack of devoting attention to beneficial knowledge, especially knowledge of the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa&#8217;ah, since Knowledge protects the one who has it from deviations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Did you not see how knowledge protected Abu Bakrah (rady Alllaahu &#8216;anhu) in the Campaign of the Camel (Jamal),[9] when the people put the Mother of the Believers, ‘Aa&#8217;ishah (rady Allaahu &#8216;anhaa) forth (for the campaign). So what protected Abu Bakrah (rady Allaahu anhu) was a hadeeth he heard from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, who said when news reached him of the death of Kisraa and the appointment of his daughter (as the leader): “A people that leave their affairs to be governed by a woman will never prosper.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So When the fitnah occurred, Abu Bakrah remembered this hadeeth and it protected him from that, such that he said: “Allaah protected me with something that I heard from the Messenger of Allaah When Kisraa died. He (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: Who did they put to succeed her?&#8217; They said: &#8216;Her daughter.&#8217; So he (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8216;A people that leave their affairs to be governed by a woman Will never prosper.&#8217; So when &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah approached, i.e. Basrah, I remembered the statement of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and so Allaah protected me by it.&#8221; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: A lack or returning to the People Of Knowledge, Since the most deserving to be asked are the People of Knowledge and their students from Ahlus-Sunnah wal- Jamaa&#8217;ah, those who have knowledge of this individual whom the people seek to study under. so this person Should be enquired into:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is he from the Salafee students of knowledge or not?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And did he undergo valid educational studies, Such that he has the right to be sought knowledge from or no?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">SO if the answer is in the negative, then the issue comes to an end, all praise be to Allaah. And if the answer is positive, then he can be Studied under and benefited from, but without going to extremes in that matter. Rather, he should be given his due place and status.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an important point, which is: Differentiating between the enlightened Scholars, those Who are referred to in issues related to knowledge and current events, such as the two Imaams, Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee and ‘AbduI-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin Baaz (rahimahumaAllaa) and those enlightened scholars Who remained after them, such as the Mashaayikh, Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen, Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, our Shaikh, Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee and others who are at their level amongst the people Of knowledge and fatwaa from AhlusSunnah waI-Jamaa&#8217;ah. So these individuals have their own level and position&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And between the prominent students of knowledge, whose knowIedge is known and whose following of the Sunnah is apparent by way of their books and the commendations of the scholars for them. SO these individuals also have their own level and position&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And between those who are less than them, from the students of knowledge, Whose Salafiyyah is Known and Whose ability to teach is recognized.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] These last two narrations were reported by Imaam Muslim in his Introduction to his Saheeh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Translator&#8217;s Note: The Campaign of the Camel occurred after the murder of Uthmaan, radyAlllaahu &#8216;anhu. when there was much turmoil amongst the Muslims. ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib radullaahu &#8216;anhu was given the bav&#8217;ah (oath of allegiance) as the succeeding Khaleefih and he decided to wait for the turmoil to simmer down before seeking revenge from the assassin of ‘Uthmaan. So the Muslims Were divided into those who were With him on this decision and those Who wanted justice for his murder right away. A group was formed to go and voice their case to ‘Alee and they rallied several of the Sahaabah including ‘Aa‘isha radhi Allaahu &#8216;anhaa‘ So she participated in the campaign riding on a camel (hence the name Jamal). When the parties at Basrah, a peaceful agreement was decided, yet due to some misunderstanding and confusion battle broke out and many lives were lost. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (7099), An-Nasaa‘ee (5403) and At-Tirmidhee (2365), and the wording mentioned here belongs to him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the statement of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Islaam began as something strange and will return to being strange, as it began</strong>&#8220;,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Imaam Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee</strong></span> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for this, then it does not mean that Islaam will go away, but rather it means that the Ahl-us-Sunnah [21] will go away, up to the point that there will not remain in a land, any from them except one person.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this understanding, there can be found in the statements of the Salaf much praise for the Sunnah and their describing it as being strange, and describing its adherents and followers as being few.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Hasan Al-Basree (rahimahullaah)</strong> </span>used to say to his companions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Oh Ahl-us-Sunnah! Be gentle with one another and may Allaah have mercy on you. For indeed, you are from amongst the fewest of people.&#8221; [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Yoonus Ibn &#8216;Ubayd (rahimahullaah)</strong></span> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is not a thing more stranger than the Sunnah. And what is more stranger than it, is the one who knows it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Sufyaan Ath-Thawree (rahimahullaah)</strong></span> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Treat the Ahl-us-Sunnah kindly, for verily, they are strangers.&#8221; [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The understanding of the term &#8220;Sunnah&#8221; to these scholars, was the way of the Prophet &#8211; that which he and his companions were upon &#8211; free from <strong>Doubts (Ash-Shubuhaat)</strong> and <strong>Desires (Ash-Shahawaat)</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, Al-Fudayl Ibn Tyaad (rahimahullaah) used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Ahl-us-Sunnah is he who knows what is entering his stomach from the halaal&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because the consumption of halaal is from the greatest aspects of the Sunnah, which the Prophet and his companions were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it remained the custom of the majority of the later scholars, from the scholars of hadeeth and other fields, that the Sunnah consisted of what was free from Doubts in regards to Creed. This was especially the case with issues such as the belief in Allaah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and other issues such as Al-Qadar (Divine Pre-Ordainment) and the merits of the Sahaabah. They compiled literary works concerning this knowledge and named them books of &#8220;Sunnah&#8221;. This knowledge was only labeled with the name &#8220;Sunnah&#8221;, because its significance was tremendous and all those who opposed it were on the brink of destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the complete Sunnah, then it is the path that is free and safe from Doubts and Desires, as has been stated by Al-Hasan, Yoonus Ibn &#8216;Ubayd, Sufyaan, Al-Fudayl and others besides them. Due to this, its adherents are described as strange because of their small number and rarity in the Last Days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it has been mentioned in some of the previously stated reports that they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;A righteous people surrounded by people abounding in much evil. Those who disobey them are greater in number than those who obey them.&#8221;</strong> [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this is an indication of the smallness of their amount in number and in the amount of those who answer and accept their call. We also are made aware of the greatness in number of those who oppose them and disobey them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why it is reported in numerous ahaadeeth, praise for the one who sticks firmly to his Religion during the Last Days. And that he who does so will be like one who holds tightly onto hot pieces of coal. <strong>And that the one who acts upon it, will receive fifty times the reward more than those before him</strong>. [25] This is because he will not find any supporters in doing good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>These strangers are of two categories</strong>: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of them are those <strong>who rectify themselves</strong> when the people have become corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second category contains those <strong>who rectify what the people have corrupted of the Sunnah</strong>. And this (latter one) is the most highest and virtuous of the two categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] What is meant by the term Ahl-us-Sunnah are all the Muslims who strictly follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad. They learn it, act upon it, enforce it and teach it to others. They consist of the scholars, their students and those that follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] This report was recorded by Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee. Badr Al-Badr indicated its weakness in his notes to Kashf-ul- Kurbah. However, a similar narration to this one has been recorded by Ad-Daarimee (1/72) and its wording is: &#8220;For verily, Ahl-us-Sunnah are the least of people in number who have preceded, and they are the least of people in number who remain.&#8221; This narration is authentic. See Dr. Nasr Al-&#8216;Aql&#8217;s book Maflioom Ahl-is- Sunnati wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah (pg. 84)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] This narration was recorded by Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee in his Sharh Usool &#8216;Itiqaad Ahl-is-Sunnah (1/64) and it was mentioned from him by Ibn Al-Jawzee in Talbees Iblees. Dr. Nasr Al-&#8216;Aql mentioned it in his book Mafhoom Ahl-is-Sunnati wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah (pg. 85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24] Musnad Ahmad (2/177) and its checking has been stated previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25] This saying is based on the following hadeeth of the Prophet: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, after you there will come times requiring patience. (In those days) the one who holds fast to that which you are upon will have the reward of fifty amongst you. He will receive the reward of fifty (i.e. the one holding onto the way of the companions in later times)</strong></span>.&#8221; Reported by Al-Marwazee in As-Sunnah (no. 35), At-Tabaraanee in Al-Kabeer (17/117), Abu Dawood in his Sunan (no. 3441), At-Tirmidhee (no. 3057), who declared it saheeh, and Ibn Maajah (no. 4014). Imaam Al-Albaanee authenticated it in As-Saheehah (no. 494)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(37. It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is <em><strong>Taqwa</strong> </em>from you that reaches Him. Thus have We made them subject to you that you may proclaim Allah&#8217;s greatness for His guidance to you. And give glad tidings to the doers of good.) </span>&#8211; Suratul Baqarah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says: this sacrifice is prescribed for you so that you will remember Him at the time of slaughter, for He is the Creator and Provider. Nothing of its flesh or blood reaches Him, for He has no need of anything other than Himself. During the time of Jahiliyyah, when they offered sacrifices to their gods, they would put some of the meat of their sacrifices on their idols, and sprinkle the blood over them. But Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah,)</strong> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn Jurayj said, &#8220;The people of the Jahiliyyah used to put the meat of their sacrifices and sprinkle the blood on the House, and the Companions of the Messenger of Allah said, &#8220;<strong>We have more right to do that</strong>.&#8221; Then Allah revealed the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allah, but it is Taqwa from you that reaches Him.)</strong> That is what He will accept and reward for, as mentioned in the Sahih,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Allah does not look to your appearance or your colors, but He looks to your hearts and deeds.)</strong> And in the Hadith; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(Indeed charity falls in the Hand of Ar-Rahman before it falls in the hand of the one asking.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Thus have We made them subject to you)</strong> meaning, `for this purpose We have subjugated the Budn for you,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(that you may proclaim Allah&#8217;s greatness for His guidance to you.)</strong> means, that you may glorify Him for guiding you to His religion and His way which He loves and is pleased with, and has forbidden you to do all that He hates and rejects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And give glad tidings to the doers of good.)</strong> means, `give good news, O Muhammad, to those who do good,&#8217; i.e., whose deeds are good and who remain within the limits prescribed by Allah, who follow that which has been prescribed for them, who believe in the Messenger and follow that which he has conveyed from his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Note) The Udhiyyah is Sunnah Mustahabbah One animal is sufficient on behalf of all the members of one household. Ibn `Umar said, &#8220;<strong>The Messenger of Allah continued to offer sacrifice for ten years</strong>.&#8221; This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi. Abu Ayyub said: &#8220;At the time of the Messenger of Allah , a man would sacrifice a sheep on behalf of himself and all the members of his household, and they would eat from it and feed others, until the people started boasting ﴿by sacrificing more than one﴾ and things reached the stage that you see now.&#8221; This was recorded by At-Tirmidhi, who graded it Sahih, and by Ibn Majah. `Abdullah bin Hisham used to sacrifice one sheep on behalf of his entire family; this was recorded by Al-Bukhari. Concerning how old the sacrificial animal should be, Muslim recorded from Jabir that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Do not sacrifice any but mature animals, and if that is not possible, then sacrifice a young sheep.)</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A person’s craving after status is even more destructive than his craving after wealth. Seeking after worldly status, position, leadership and domination causes more harm to a person that his seeking after wealth – it is more damaging and harder to avoid since even wealth is expended in seeking after leadership and status. Craving after status is of two types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Type of Craving for Status</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is seeking status through authority, leadership, and wealth and this is very dangerous – since it will usually prevent a person from the good of the Hereafter and nobility and honour in the next life, Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“That home of the Hereafter We shall assign to those who seek neither haughtiness nor any corruption on earth. The good end is for the pious.”</span></em> [Al-Qasas (28):83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is rare that a person seeks after position in this world by seeking authority and is guided to and granted what is good for him. Rather he is entrusted to his own self, just as the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said to `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Samurah, radiyallaahu `anhu, “O `Abdur-Rahmaan! Do not ask for authority since if you are given it due to requesting it then you are abandoned to it, but if you are given it without requesting it then you will be aided in it.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Salaf said, “ No one seeks after authority and then behaves justly in it.” Yazeed ibn `Abdillaah ibn Mawhib was a just judge and one of the righteous people and he used to say, “Whoever loves wealth and status and fears adversity will not behave with justice.” There occurs in Saheeh al-Bukharee from Aboo Hurairah, radiyAllaahu`anhu, from the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that he said, “You will be keen to attain authority and it will be a source of regret on the Day of Resurrection. So what an excellent wet-nurse it is and what an evil weaner.” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Al-Bukhaaree) also reports from Aboo Moosa al-Ash`aree, radiyAllaahu `anhu, that two men said to the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), ‘O Messenger of Allaah! Appoint us to some position of authority.’ So he said, ‘We do not appoint to authority in this affair of ours one who requests it, nor one who is keen to have it.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that craving after status and position inevitably causes great harm before its attainment due to the striving necessary to attain it, and also afterwards due to the person’s strong desire to hold onto it which produces injustice, haughtiness and other evils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Aboo Bakr al-Aajurree</strong>, who was one of the wise scholars and teachers at the start of the fourth century, wrote at treatise about the manners and the sentiments of the scholars and it is one of the best works on this topic. One who studies it will know from it the way of the scholars of the Salaf, and will know the innovated ways contrary to their way. So he describes the evil scholar at length, from this description is that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘He has become infatuated with love of this world, and with praise, honour and position with the people of this world. He uses knowledge as an adornment just as a beautiful woman adorns herself with jewellery for this world, but he does not adorn his knowledge with action upon it.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="more-29224"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then mentions a lengthy speech and then says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“So these characteristics and their like predominate in the heart of one who does not benefit from knowledge, so whilst he carries these attributes his soul will come to have love of status and position – so that he loves to sit with kings and the sons of this world. The he loves to share in their opulent lifestyle, sharing their lavish attire, their comfortable transport, servants, fine clothing, delicate bedding and delicious food. He will love that people throng to his door, that his saying is listened to, and that he is obeyed – and he can only attain the latter by becoming a judge (qaadee) – so he seeks to become one. Then he is unable to attain it except at the expense of his Religion, so he debases himself to the rulers and their helpers, serving them himself and giving them his wealth as a tribute. He remains silent when he sees their evil actions after entering their palaces and homes. Then on top of this he may praise their evil actions and declare them good due to some false interpretation in order to raise his position with them. So when he has accustomed himself to doing this over a long period of time and falsehood has taken root in him – then they appoint him to the position of judge (qaadee) and in so doing slaughter him without a knife.”</em> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they have bestowed such a favour upon him that he is obliged and has to show his gratitude to them – so he takes great pains to make sure that he does not anger them and cause them to remove him from his position. But he has no concern about whether he angers his Lord, the Most High, so he misappropriates the wealth of orphans, widows, the poor and the needy, and wealth bequested as waaf (religious endowment) for those fighting Jihaad and the nobles of Makkah and al-Madeenah, and wealth which is supposed to be of benefit to all the Muslims – but instead he uses it to satisfy his clerk, chamberlain and servant. So he eats that which is haraam and feeds with that which is haraam and increases that which is a proof against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So woe to the one whose knowledge which the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) sought refuge from and ordered us to seek refuge from. This is the knowledge which the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) mentioned, saying, <span style="color:#008000;">“Those amongst the people receiving the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection is the scholar who is not given benefit through his knowledge by Allaah.”</span> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to say, <span style="color:#008000;">(Allaahumma innee a’oodhubika minal arba’i, min `ilmin laa yanfa`u, wa min qalbin laa yakhsha`u, wa min nafsin laa tashba`u, wa min du`aa in laa yusma`u) “O Allaah I seek Your refuge from knowledge which does not benefit; from a heart which does not fear; from a soul which is never satisfied; and from a supplication which is not heard.”</span> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaahumma inne as`aluka `ilman naafi`an, wa a`oodhubika min `ilman laa yanfa`u)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“O Allaah I ask You for beneficial knowledge, and I seek Your refuge from knowledge which does not benefit.”</span> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was said by Imaam Aboo Bakr al-Aajuree, rahimahullaahu ta`aala who lived at the end of the fourth century [17] and corruption increased and multiplied greatly since his time – and there is no might and no strength except by Allaah’s will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the subtle afflictions caused by love of status is seeking after and aspiring positions of authority – this is something whose reality is hidden and obscure. It is not understood except by those who have knowledge of Allaah, those who love Him and who are at enmity with those ignorant one’s from His creation who desire to compete with Him with regard to His Lordship and Divinity and right to worship, despite their despicability and the contemptible position they have before Allaah and in the eyes of His chosen servants who have knowledge of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is just as <strong>al-Hasan (al-Basree)</strong>, rahimahullaah, said about them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Even if the hooves of mules clatter for them and riding beasts strut for them, yet still the humiliation of sin rests upon their necks. Allaah has refused except that He will humiliate those who are disobedient to Him.” </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that love of status attained by having one’s orders and prohibitions obeyed and enacted, and by merely the attainment of a position above the people and to have importance over them, and that it be seen that the people are in need of him and seek their needs from him – then the soul of this person is seeking to compete with Allaah in His Lordship and His Divinity and right to worship. Some such people may even seek to put the people into such a condition of need that they are compelled to request their needs from them, and to display their poverty before them and their need of them. Then he is inflated with pride and self-importance because of that, whereas this befits none except Allaah alone. He who has no partner. Allaah, the Most High, Says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you (O Muhammad (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)). And We seized them with extreme poverty (or loss in wealth) and loss in health with calamities so that they might believe with humility.”</span></em> [Al-An`aam (6):42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also occurs in some narrations that Allaah, the Most High, sends adversity upon His servant in order to hear him call upon him with full humility. There also occurs in the narrations that when the servant whom Allaah loves supplicates to Allaah, the Most High, then He, the Most High, says, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“O Jibreel! Do not hasten to carry out his need, for I love that I should hear him calling with full humility.”</span></em>[18] So these matters are worse and more dangerous than mere injustice and are more sinister, and they are a part of shirk – and shirk is the greatest injustice and transgression with Allaah. It is reported in the Saheeh from the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) that he said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah, the Most High, says, ‘Pride is my cloak and majesty is my lower-garment so whoever vies with Me regarding them I will punish him.’”</span></em> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also happened that one of the people of the past was a judge and he saw in a dream that someone was saying to him, “You are a judge and Allaah is a Judge.” So he awoke in a distressed state and removed himself from the position of a judge and abandoned it. Some of the pious judges used to prevent the people from calling them ‘Judge of judges’ (Qaadiyyul-Qudaat) since this name resembles the name ‘King of kings’ which the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) censured that one should use as a title, and ‘Judge of judges’ is like that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also related to this is the one having status and authority loves that he is praised and commended for his actions and seeks that from the people. Those who do not comply with this suffer as a result. It may even be that his actions are actually more deserving of blame than of praise, or he manifests something that is apparently good – and loves to be praised for it, yet in reality he is intending something evil and is happy that he is able to deceive the people and fool them about it. This falls under the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done, think not that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment.”</span></em> [Aal-‘Imraan (3):188]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since this Aayah was sent down regarding those who have these attributes, and this attribute (i.e. seeking praise from the creation and loving it and punishing those who do not give it) is not fitting except for Allaah, alone, having no partner. This is why the rightly guided leaders used to forbid people to praise them for their actions and any good which if they did, and they would order that rather praise be given to Allaah alone, having no partner – since all blessings are from Him.<!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>`Umar ibn Abdul &#8211; `Azeez</strong>, rahimahullaah, was very particular about this and he once wrote a letter to be read out to the people performing Hajj. It contained an order that they should be treated well and that oppression of them should stop, and in it there occurred, “And do not praise anyone for this except Allaah, since if He abandoned me to my own desiresI would be just like the others.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a also a well-known narration about what occurred with him concerning the woman who requested from him that he should provide an allowance for her orphaned daughters. She had four daughters and he gave an allowance to two of them and she praised Allaah. Then he gave an allowance to the third so she thanked him, so he said, “We were giving an allowance to them as long as you were giving praise to the One to whom it is due, but now order this third one to share her allowance with the fourth,” or as he said, radiyAllaahu `anhu. He wanted to make it known that the position of leadership is only established so that Allaah’s commands are carried out, and so that the servants can be commanded to obey Allaah, the Most High, and forbidden from those things which Allaah has prohibited, and so that the leader acts with sincerity towards Allaah’s servants by calling them to Allaah. His intention is that the Deen should in its entirety be for Allaah, and that honour be for Allaah. Along with this he is fearful that he is himself falling short with regard to the rights of Allaah, the Most High. So as for those who love Allaah, then the limit of their desire with regard to the creation is that they should also love Allaah, obey Him and single Him out with all worship and recognise His Divinity alone. (Then how about one who seeks to vie with Him in this?!) Rather this type of person does not desire any reward or any thanks from the creation, but hopes for reward for his actions from Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“It is not (possible) for any human being to whom Allaah has given al-Hukma (knowledge and understanding of the laws of Religion etc.) and Prophethood to say to the people: “Be my worshippers rather than Allaah’s.’ On the contrary (he would say): ‘Be you rabbaaniyyoon (learned men of Religion, who practice what they know and also preach to others) because you teach the Book, and you study it.’ Nor would he order you to take angels and Prophets for lords (gods). Would he order you to disbelieve after you have submitted to Allaah’s Will?”</span></em> [Aal-`Imraan (3):79-80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “<em><span style="color:#008000;">Do not exaggerate in praising me as the Christians praised the Messiah, the son of Maryam. Indeed I am only a slave. So say the slave of Allaah and His Messenger.</span></em>” [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) also used to criticise anyone who did not keep to this manner of address with regard to him, just as he (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Do not say, ‘Whatever Allaah has willed and Muhammad has willed, ` but rather say, ‘Whatever Allaah has willed, then what Muhammad has willed.’”</span> </em>[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also replied to a person who said, “Whatever Allah and yourself have willed,” by saying, <em><span style="color:#008000;">“Have you made me a rival for Allaah! Rather say, ‘Whatever Allaah alone has willed.’”</span></em> [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this khulafaa who have succeeded the Prophets, and their followers – the just rulers and their successors, and their judges, never used to call to glorification of themselves but rather to the glorification of Allaah alone and that He is to be singled out with worship and divinity. From them were those who did not wish for leadership at all except as an aid to calling to Allaah alone. Some of the righteous people who accepted the position of judge said, “Indeed I accepted this in order to use it to help me in ordering the good and forbidding the evil.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the Messengers and their followers would persevere in the face of injury and harm which they suffered whilst calling to Allaah, and in carrying out Allaah’s commands they were put into the severest hardship by the people and yet they bore it with patience. Indeed being pleased with that, since one who has love may find pleasure in any harm he meets whilst seeking to please the one whom he loves. Just as `Abdul-Maalik ibn `Umar ibn `Abdul-Azeez used to say to his father when he was the khaleefah and he had keen desire that the truth and justice be established, “O father I would have loved that we had been forced into boiling cooking pots for the sake of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another righteous person said, “I would have loved that my flesh were cut away with scissors if it meant that all the creation would obey Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic.” This saying of his was related to a certain wise person, so he said, “If what he was speaking of was sincere concern for the creation, otherwise I do not know.” Then he fainted. The meaning of this is that the one who said this had true and sincere concern  for the creation and pity for them, fearing Allaah’s punishment for them, so he would have loved that they could have been saved from Allaah’s punishment at the expense of his ownself. It could also be that he was considering the Majesty and Greatness of Allaah and the glorification, honour, obedience and love due to Him, so he wished that the creation would fulfil that even if it meant the most severe harm to himself. This is the state of mind of the distinguished ones who love Allaah and have knowledge of Him and keep Him in mind. This is what caused the man to faint.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, also described in His Book those who love Him as being those who fight Jihaad in His cause and do not fear the blame of those who seek to blame.[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning this someone said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I find that being blamed whilst pursuing what you desire is delightful, For having love for your remembrance let those who wish  to blame me do so.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Reported by Ahmad and al-Bukhaaree (transl.9/194/no.260)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (transl.9/196/no.262) and others. Note: His saying, “It will be a source of regret.” Means one who does not behave correctly having attained it – and the proof of this is what Muslim reports from Aboo Dharr who said, ‘I said, “O Messenger of Allaah! Will you not appoint me to some position?” He said, “You are weak and it is a trust and on the Day of Resurrection it will be a source of humiliation and regret, except for one who fulfils its obligations and carries out the duties required from him.” (Saheeh Muslim, transl.3/1015/4491). An-Nawawee said, “This is a great reason to avoid positions of authority especially those who are weak – and this refers to those who are not suitable and those who do not act justly in the position – then he will regret his negligence when he is humiliated on the Day of Resurrection. However one who is suitable for the position and behaves justly in it – then there is a great reward as shown in a number of reports. However entering into it carries a great danger therefore the great scholars avoided it. His saying, “What a good wet-nurse” (i.e. the one who feeds the baby at breast) meaning in this world, and “What an evil weaner” meaning after death – since he will be taken to account for it. So he is like one who is weaned away from breast milk before he can manage without it – so this causes his destruction. And it is said, “What a good wet nurse” due to the status, wealth, authority, attainment of physical and imagined enjoyment which it produces whilst one has it, but “What an evil weaner”, meaning when one is removed from it by death or other causes – due to the even consequences one faces in the Hereafter.” (Abridged and edited from Fathul-Baaree of Ibn Hajar (13/125-126)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (transl.9/196/no.263) and Muslim (transl. 3/1014/no.4489)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Alluding to the saying of the Prophet (salAllahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), “He who is appointed as a judge has been killed without a knife.” Reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl.3/1013/no.3564) and at- Tirmidhee who declared it hasan. I say: its isnaad is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] Reported by Ibn `Abdul-Barr in Jaami` Bayaanil-`Ilm (1/162) and al-Aajuree (pp.93-94) and at- Tabaraanee in as-Sagheer (1/1831) and others and its chain of narration is very weak since it contains `Uthmaan ibn Miqsam al-Burree who was accused of lying and fabrication. It is however reported as being the saying of Abud-Dardaa only, with an authentic chain of narration. It is reported by ad- Daarimee (1/82) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] Reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl. vol.1/p.401/no.1543) and others, all with the wording, “O Allaah I seek Your refuge from four: from knowledge which does not benefit…” The hadeeth was declared to be saheeh by al-Haakim and adh-Dhahabee agreed, and it has supports from a number of the Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] Reported with this wording by al-Aajuree (p.134) and Ibn Hibbaan (no.2426). It also reported by Ibn Maajah (no.3843) and Ibn `Abdul-Barr (1/162) with the wording, “Ask Allaah for beneficial knowledge and seek Allaah’s refuge from knowledge which does not benefit.” Its chain of narration is hasan (good) and there is similar narration from Umm Salamah reported by Ibn Majah and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Al-Aajurree, rahimahullaah, died in the year 360H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] The meaning of this is reported in the hadeeth qudsee which is mentioned by Shaikh Muhammad al- Madanee in his book al-Ittihaafaatus-Sunniyyah fil-Ahaadeethil-Qudsiyyah (no.438) – and he mentioned that Ibn `Asaakir reported it with a chain of narration containing Ishaaq ibn `Abdillaah ibn Abee Farwa who is abandoned as a narrator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] Reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl.3/1141/no.4079) and Ibn Maajah from the hadeeth of Ibn Maajah, except that their wording ends, “…So whoever vies with Me regarding any of them…” and in a wording, “…. Anything from them, I will fling him into Hell-Fire.” And in a wording, “…the Fire.” Its chain of narration is saheeh. Muslim (transl. 4/1381/no.6349) also reports one version of the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (transl.vol.4, p.435, no.654) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] Reported by ad-Daarimee (2/295) with this wording and its chain of narration is saheeh. It is also reported with the wording, “Do not say, ‘Whatever Allaah and so and so have willed.’ but rather say, ‘Whatever Allaah has willed and then what so and so has willed.’” It is reported by Ahmad, Aboo Daawood (transl. vol.3, p.1386, no.4962) and others and its chain of narration is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] Reported by Ahmad, Al-Bukhaaree in al-Aadabul-Mufrad (no.783) and others, and its chain of narration is hasan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Sick person is required to purify himself with water, performing ablution from minor impurity and <i>Ghusl</i> from major impurity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If he is unable to purify himself using water, due to weakness or fear of increasing his illness, or delaying his recovery, then he may perform <i>Tayammum</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The way to perform <i>Tayammum</i> is to strike the clean earth with his hands once, then wipe his whole face with them, then wipe his hands, one with the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. If he is unable to purify himself, the another person should assist him in making the ablution, or performing the <i>Tayammum</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. If a certain part of the body which is to be purified is afflicted by a wound, he should wash it with water; but if washing it with water will cause harm to him, then he may wet his hand with water and then wipe over it. If wiping over it may also cause harm he may perform <i>Tayammum</i> for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. If he has a severe fracture in any of his limbs, which is covered with a dressing or cast, he may wipe over it with water, instead of washing it, and it does not require <i>Tayammum</i>, because the wiping takes the place of washing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. It is permisable to make <i>Tayammum</i> using a wall, or anything else which is clean and contains dust. If the wall is covered with anything which is not from th earth such as paint, then one should not make <i>Tayammum</i> with it, unless there is dust over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. If the <i>Tayammum</i> is not made on the earth or a wall or anything else containing dust, there is no objection to the collecting of dust in container or a hankerchief, in order to make <i>Tayammum</i> with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. If a person performs <i>Tayammum</i> for prayer, and remains in a purified state until the time of the next prayer, then he may pray with the <i>Tayammum</i> he made before and he does not need to repeat it for the second prayer, since he remains purified and nothing has invalidated it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. The sick person is obliged to cleanse his body from all manner of impurity, but if he is unable to do so, he may pray as he is, and his prayer will be correct and he does not need to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 The sick person is required to pray in clean clothes, and if they became soiled, they must be cleaned or replaced with clean ones. If this is not possible, he may pray as he is, and his prayer will be correct and he does not need to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. The sick person is obliged to pray upon something clean and if it becomes soiled, he must wash it, change for something clean or cover it with something clean. If he is unable to do so, he may pray there, and his prayer will be correct and he does not need to repeat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. It is not permissible for the invalid to delay the prayer due to his inability to achieve purification; rather, he should purify himself as much as he is able, then perform the prayer on time, even if there is some impurity on his body, his clothes or his place of prayer, which he is unable to remove.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, the Lords of the Worlds, and may peace and blessings of Allaah be upon the noblest of the Prophets and Messengers, our Prophet, Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions. As for what follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, Allaah, the Most Glorified, Most High has legislated purification for every prayer, because the elimination of impurity and the removal of pollution &#8211; whether on the body, the clothes or the place of prayer &#8211; are two of the conditions of prayer. So when the Muslim wishes to pray, he must perform the well known ablution <i>(Wudhu)</i> to purify himself from minor impurity, or make Ghusl if the impurity is of the major kind. And before making ablution, <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> must be performed with water, or <i>Istijmar</i> by the one who has urinated or defecated in order that the purification and cleansing be complete. What follows is an explanation of some of the rulings related to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with water is obligatory every time something is discharged from the bowel and bladder, such as urine or faeces. But it is not necessary for the sleeper or one who passes wind to perform <i>Istinja&#8217;</i>. He is only required to perform ablution, because <i>Istinja&#8217;</i>is only prescribed for the removal of impurity, and there is no impurity in this situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Istijmar</i> is performed using stones, or another material in its place (such as wood, paper etc.) It must consist of three clean stones, as proved by the Hadith of the Prophet<i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> which states that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;Whoever performs Istijmar, let him make it </i><i>Witr</i> (i.e. use an odd number of stones).&#8221;</span> [Abu Dawud no.35 and Ibn Majah no. 337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If any of you goes to defecate, he should take with him three stones, for they will be sufficient for him.&#8221;</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim narrated that he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> forbade <i>Istijmar</i> with less than three stones. It is not permissible to make <i>Istijmar</i> with animal droppings, bones or food or anything which contains some forbidden material. It is preferred for a person to perform <i>istijmar</i> with stones, or the like such as tissues etc. After which, he should use water, because the stones remove the essence of the pollution, but the water purifies the area and is therefore more thorough. A person has a choice of <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with water, or<i>Istijmar</i> with stones or the like. It is reported on the authority of Anas, may Allaah be pleased with him, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;The Prophet </i><i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> entered the toilet and I and a young boy like me carried materials, including water and <i>&#8216;anaza</i> (a short spear) and he would perform <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with the water.&#8221;</span> [al-Bukhari no.152 &amp; Muslim no.271.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported on the authority of &#8216;Aishah, may Allaah be pleased with her, that she said to a group of women:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Order your husbands to clean themselves following defecation with water, for I am too embarrassed to do so, and the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam) used to do so.&#8221;</span></em> At-Tirmidhee said that it was authentic [At-Tirmidhee no.19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person wants to use only one of them (i.e. stones or water), it is preferred to choose water, because it cleans the area removing the essence and the traces and it is more thorough in cleansing. If he chooses to only use stones, he should content himself with three, if it cleanses the area, but if it is not enough, he may use four or five (or more) until he has cleaned the area, but it is better to finish with an odd number, based upon the saying of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Whoever performs Istijmar, let him make it Witr.&#8221;</span></em> [Abu Dawud no.35 and Ibn Majah no. 337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissable to make the <i>Istijmar</i> with the right hand, according to the <i>Hadith</i> of Salman, may Allaah be pleased with him, in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah forbade us from performing <i>Istinja&#8217;</i> with the right hand.&#8221; And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;None of you should hold his penis in his right hand while he is urinating. nor should he wipe himself with the right hand after answering the call of nature.&#8221;</span> </i>[Al-Bukhari no.153 &amp; Muslim no.267]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if his left hand has been cut off, or is broken or there is some disease in it, he may use his right hand, and there is no objection to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because the Islamic law is based upon facility and ease, Allaah, the Most Glorified, Most High has lightened the burden of worship on those who have some excuse, according to the excuse. He, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (He) has not laid upon you in religion any hardship</b>.&#8221; [Surah al-Hajj 22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.&#8221;</b>[Surah al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can.&#8221;</b> [Surah at-Taghabun 64:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If I order you to do something, do it as much as you can.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukharino.7288 &amp; Muslim no.1337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;Verily the Religion is ease.&#8221;</i> </span>[Narrated by al-Bukhari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a sick person is unable to cleanse himself of minor impurity with the water by making ablution, or he is unable to purify himself of major impurity by making <i>Ghusl</i>, due to weakness, or fear of making his illness worse, or delaying his recovery, he may perform<i>Tayammum</i> [Dry ablution using sand or dust.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is done by striking his hands in clean dust once, then wiping his face with the palms of his hands and his fingers slowly, based upon the Words of Him, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And if you are ill, or on a journey, or one of you comes after answering the call of nature, or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) and you find no water, perform <i>Tayammum</i> with clean earth and rub therewith your faces and hands (Tayammum). Truly, Allaah is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.&#8221;</b> [Surah An-Nisa 4:43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ruling on those who are unable to use water is the same that of those who are unable to find water, according to the words of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he has intended.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukhari no. 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sick person may fall into one of a number of categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. If his illness is a simple one and he does not fear to use the water, such as an ailment from which there is no fear that using the water will delay his recovery, or increase his pain, or cause any infection, such as a headache, toothache and the like, or he is able to use warm water without harm, then it is not allowed for him to make <i>Tayammum</i>. Because the permission to perform it is in order to prevent harm, and there is no fear of harm to him, and because he can find water, therefore he must use it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If he fears from an illness which he fears may &#8211; should he use water &#8211; cause his death or harm one of his organs, or may lead to some illness which might cause his death or harm one of his organs, or cause the loss of some faculty, then it is permissible for him to perform <i>Tayammum</i>, based upon the words of the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not kill yourselves (nor kill one another). Surely, Allaah is Most Merciful to you.&#8221;</b>[Surah an-Nisa&#8217; 4:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If he is suffering from some illness which makes him unable to move, and he finds no one to bring him water, it is permissible for him to perform <i>Tayammum</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Anyone suffering from a wound, an ulcer or fracture, or any illness which will be exacerbated by using water, and who becomes <i>Junub</i> [in a state of sexual impurity] is allowed to perform <i>Tayammum</i>, based upon the above evidences. If he is able to wash the healthy areas of his body, he must do so and make <i>Tayammum</i> for the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sick person who is in a place in which he finds neither water nor dust, or anyone who can bring him either one of them, may pray whatever condition he is in, and he is not allowed to delay the prayer, as Allaah, the Most High say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him as much as you can.&#8221;</b> [Surah at-Taghabun 64:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. An invalid afflicted with incontinence of urine, who is not cured by his treatment, must make ablution for every prayer after the start of its prescribed time, wash off any urine that has affected his body, and wear a clean garment for his prayer, if this is not a burden on him. But if it is, he is excused from it, based upon the Allaah Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (He) has not laid upon you in religion any hardship</b>.&#8221; [Surah al-Hajj 22:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah intends for you ease, and He does not want to make things difficult for you.&#8221;</b>[Surah al-Baqarah 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the words of the Prophet <i>(Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam)</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>&#8220;If I order you to do something, do it as much as you cable.&#8221;</i></span> [Al-Bukhari no.7288 &amp; Muslim no.1337]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He must try to the best of his ability to prevent the spread of the urine to his clothes, or his body, or the place in which he will pray. And everything that invalidates ablution also invalidates <i>Tayammum</i>, and in addition, the ability to use water or its presence. And Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) has forbidden us from certain types of business transactions due to what they contain from sinful means of earning and what is found in them from dangers to mankind and the taking of wealth unjustly. From these types of prohibited transactions are:</p>
<p><strong>When the buying and selling keeps one preoccupied from performing worship</strong> , i.e. they take away from the time of the worship, such as when a person is busy buying and selling and holds back from praying in congregation in the masjid, to the point that he misses it or misses part of it. This is forbidden. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, when the prayer is called for on the Day of Jumu’ah, then rush to the Remembrance of Allaah and leave off the trading (commerce). That is better for you if you did but know. So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty and remember Allaah much in order that you may be successful.”</span> </em>[Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says in another ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“O you who believe! Do not let you wealth or your children divert you from the Remembrance of Allaah. And whoever does that, then such are the losers.” </em></span>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take note of Allaah’s saying: <strong>“…then such are the losers.” </strong>He rules upon them that they are losers even though they may be wealthy, having amassed hoards of money even if they may have many children.This is because their wealth and their children cannot replace what they missed out on from the Remembrance of Allaah. So even if they gain a profit or earn income in this world, they will still be losers in every sense of the word. They can only be profiting in reality if they combine between these two good things. If they were to combine between the seeking of sustenance and the worship of Allaah, by buying and selling when it is time for buying and selling and attending the prayer when it is time for prayer, then they would have combined between the good of this life and the good of the Hereafter. And they would have acted on Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"> “So seek your provision from Allaah and worship Him (alone)”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em> “So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, commerce is of two types – <strong>the commerce of the worldly life and the commerce of the next life (Hereafter)</strong>. The commerce of this life is with wealth and with earnings while the commerce of the next life is with righteous actions. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, shall I not direct you to a trade (i.e. commerce) that will save you from a painful punishment? Believe in Allaah and His Messenger and strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allaah with your wealth and your lives. That will be better for you, if you but knew! (If you do so), He will forgive you your sins and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in the gardens of ‘Adan (i.e. Paradise). That is indeed the great success. And He will also give you another (blessing), which you will love – help from Allaah and a near victory. So give glad tidings to the believers.”</span></em><strong><em> </em></strong>[Surah As-Saff: 10-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the immense commerce, which is profitable. So if the permissible commerce of this worldly life is attached to it, it becomes good upon good. But if a person limits his commerce to solely that of this worldly life while abandoning the commerce of the Hereafter, he becomes a loser, as Allaah says: <strong>“…then such are the losers.”</strong>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if a person were to turn his attention to performing worship and establishing the prayer, and if were to remember Allaah much, by doing what Allaah commanded him to do, Allaah would surely open the doors of sustenance for him. As a matter of fact, the prayer is a means for attaining sustenance (<em>rizq</em>), as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“And command your family with prayer and be patient in offering them. We are not asking you to provide Us with sustenance (rizq). (Rather), We will provide for you and the good end is for those who have Taqwaa.” </em></span>[Surah TaHa: 132]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the prayer, which some people claim takes time away from them seeking after the <em>rizq </em>(sustenance) and from buying and selling, is in fact the opposite of what they claim. It opens for them the door of provision, comfort and blessing. This is because the sustenance (<em>rizq</em>) is in the Hand of Allaah. So if you were to turn your attention towards remembering Him and worshipping Him, He would facilitate and open the door of sustenance for you. <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And Allaah is the best of Providers.” </strong></span>[Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says, describing the worship of the believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“In houses (masaajid), which Allaah has ordered to be raised, and in which His name is mentioned. He is glorified therein during the mornings and the evenings. (They are) Men whom neither business nor commerce diverts them away from the Remembrance of Allaah, nor from performing the Prayer or giving the Zakaat. They fear a day when the hearts and the eyes will be overturned out of fear (of the horrors of the Day of Judgement).”</span> </em>[Surah An-Noor: 36-37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In explanation of this ayah, some of the Salaf said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They (the Sahaabah) would buy and sell, but when one of them heard the mua’dhin calling to prayer, and the scale was still in his hand, he would drop the scale and head out for the prayer.”</strong></span> So as stated before, the point is that if the buying and selling preoccupies you from performing your prayer, then this commerce is forbidden and futile. And the money earned from it is Haraam (unlawful) and filthy.</p>

Of negating faith from yourself &#8211; Shaykh ibn&#160;Uthaymeen</span></a></p>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎<em>) </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever Allah wants good for, He gives him understanding of the religion</span></em>.”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And understanding of the religion demands <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>acceptance of it</strong></span>, because every person who understands and knows the religion, he <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>accepts it, and loves it</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Exalted, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">But no, by your Lord, they have not believed, until they make you (O Muhammad <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.</span></em> (An-Nisa 4:65).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this form of swearing stresses &#8211; by use of the statement (No!), and swearing particularly by the Rububiyyah of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, over His slaves, and it is the mention of Allah’s Rububiyyah over His Messenger &#8211; it stresses the negation of faith from Whoever does not abide by these three matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First:</strong></span> Judgement of the Messenger ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎) based on His saying: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">until they make you judge in all disputes between them</span></em>&#8221; meaning (by you), the Messenger ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever seeks judgement from other than Allah and His Messenger, he is not a believer. He is either a disbeliever whose disbelief has brought him out of the religion, or a disbeliever whose disbelief is less than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Second:</span></strong> The chest being open to the judgement; such way that they do not find any resistance in themselves for his decision. They rather find acceptance and openness to what the Prophet ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎) decided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Third:</span></strong> That they submit, which is stressed; meaning with complete submission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So beware O Muslim! Of negating faith from yourself.</strong> Let us draw an example for this: Two men were arguing about the Shari&#8217;ah ruling on an issue. One of them brought evidence from the Sunnah, while the other found difficulty and felt constricted by that. How could he abandon who he follows, so as to follow this Sunnah? This man, without a doubt, has deficient faith, because the believer, in truth, is he who, when he has a text from the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger ( <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">صلى الله عليه وسلم</span>‎) he feels as if he has won the greatest of spoils, and he will be joyful for that, and say: &#8220;<strong>All praise is due to Allah who guided me to this</strong>.” But so-and-so, who is partisan to his opinion, and tries to turn the textual proofs upside down, so that he can make them agree with what he likes, not what Allah and His Messenger intended, then this one is in a tremendous state of danger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on organizing celebrations for the birthdays of children or for wedding anniversaries?</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are no celebrations in Islaam except Friday the weekly ‘Eid, the first day of Shawwal – ’Eidal-Adha. The day of ’Arafah might be called an ‘Eid for those who are at’Arafah on that day, and the days of Tashreeq, following ’Eidul-Adha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for birthday celebrations for a person or his children, or wedding anniversaries or the like, none of them are legislated and they are closer to being innovations than to being allowed</strong></span>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>الصَّمَد</strong>  <strong><em>As-<u>S</u>amad</em> </strong>(the Perfect Lord and Master upon Whom the whole of creation depends), the Lord and Master Whose control is complete, upon Whom the whole of the creation depends for its needs because of His perfection in His self, His names, His attributes and His actions. The One Who remains and never passes away, the One Who neither eats nor drinks, free of all needs.</p>
<p><strong>[Source</strong>: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/01/28/the-ninety-nine-names-of-allaah/">The Ninety-Nine Names of Allaah </a>– Dawud Burbank [Audio|En] &amp; Transcribed PDF]</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Allāh is <em>As-Samad</em>” – Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Concerning his statement: &#8220;Allāh is <em>As-Samad</em>&#8220;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a clause of continuation, after He mentioned <em>Al-Ahadai&#8217;yyah</em> (the oneness), he mentioned <em>As-Samadiyyah</em>, and used a definite clause for both, to indicate exclusivity. That is Allah, alone, is <em>As-Samad</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is the meaning of <em>As-Samad</em>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that As-Samad means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He is the Perfect One, in His Knowledge, His Power, His Wisdom, His ’<em>Izzah</em> (Honor and Might), His Sovereignty and in all His Attributes</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em> As-Samad</em> is the one who does not have any cavity</strong></span> &#8211; that is without intestines nor abdomen. That is why it is said: The Angels are <em>Samad</em> because they do not have cavities; they do not eat nor drink. This meaning is related from Ibn ’Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him.[1] And this does not negate the first meaning, because it indicates His self sufficiency from all of His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is said: <em>As-Samad</em> has the meaning of the <em>Ma’ful</em> form, that is <em>Al-Masmudu ilaihi</em>;He who is betaken to by the creation of their needs, with the meaning that they incline to Him and they reach out for Him, and surrender their needs to Him. So it has the meaning of the everyone is in need of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These interpretations do not contradict one another in relation to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and as such we say that each of these meanings are affirmed due to the lack of contradiction among them. We interpret it with a comprehensive interpretation; we say As-Samad is the One Who is Perfect in His Attributes, the One whom all His creatures are in need of; they are dependent upon Him. Therefore, the tremendous meaning of the word As-Samad becomes clear to you. He is the One independent of any need from all other than Him, Perfect in all of What is attributed to Him, and that all other than Him is in need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If somebody says to you: “Allah rose above the Throne, does His rising above the Throne mean that He is in need of the Throne, such that if the Throne was removed, He would fall?” The answer is no! Never! Because Allah is <em>Samad</em>, perfect without need of the Throne. Rather the Throne, the heavens, the <em>Kursi</em> and all creatures are in need of Allah; He is independent of any need from them. We derive this from the word <em>As-Samad</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If somebody asks: &#8220;<strong>Does Allah eat and drink</strong>?&#8221; I say: Never; because Allah is <em>Samad</em>.” With this, we recognize that the word <em>As-Samad</em> is a word that covers all the perfect Attributes of Allah, and it relates to all the imperfect attributes of the creatures. That is why the are in need of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer&#8221;</strong> (Ash-Shura 42:11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fruit of a person’s faith in this, is that it leads the servant to give Him the utmost reverence, because there is nothing like Him among the creatures. So, exalt this Magnificent Lord that does not have an equal; Or else there will not be any benefit here to your faith that; <strong>&#8220;There is nothing like unto Him&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>When you believe that He is the All-Hearer,</strong></span> you Will soon be cautious regarding every statement that angers Allah, because you know that He hears you, and You fear His punishment. You will soon avoid every statement that involves disobedience of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, because you believe He is the All-Hearer. If this belief does not make this happen to you, know that your belief that Allah as the All-Hearer, is without a doubt, deficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you truly believe that Allah is the All-Hearer, you would not say anything except that which pleases Him, particularly when you are talking about His Shari&#8217;ah, as in the case of a Mufti or a scholar. For this is indeed worse. Allah, Glorious is He, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Then who does more wrong than one who invents a lie against Allah, to lead mankind astray without knowledge. Certainly Alla&#8217;h guides not the people who are Zalimz&#8217;n (wrongdoers))</strong> (Al-An’am 8:144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this is among the worst forms of wrongdoing. That is why He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verity! Allah guides not the people who are Zalimin wrongdoers))</strong> (Al-Ahqaf 46:10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This among the punishments for the one who gives religious verdicts without knowledge; that he will not be guided, because he is a wrongdoer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be warned my brother Muslim, against saying anything that does not please Allah, whether you say that regarding Allah, or otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The fruit of the belief that Allah is the All-Seer</strong></span>, is that you will not do anything that angers Allah, because you know that whenever you are looking at something that is prohibited, while the people do not know it is an unlawful glance, Allah, the Exalted sees this glance, and He knows what is in your heart:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>{Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and all that the breasts conceal}</strong>(Ghafir 40:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you believe in this, it is not possible that you ever do anything that does not please Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should be shy before Allah, as you are shy before the nearest of the people to you, the most respected of them before you. Therefore, if we believe that Allah is the All-Seer, we will soon guard against every action that will lead to angering Allah; otherwise, our faith in that will be deficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If somebody points with his finger, his lip, his eye, or head, to something that is unlawful, while the people around him are unaware, Allah, the Exalted, sees him. Whoever believes in Him, then he should beware of this; If we believe in What is implicated by Allah’s Names Attributes, then we would have a complete state steadfastness (Istiqamah) among ourselves. And the One whose Help is sought.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also some Angels who write down the deeds of human beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;But verily, over you (are appointed Angels in charge of mankind) to watch you, honorable, writing down (your deeds), they know all that you do&#8221;</strong></span> (Al-Infitar 82:10-12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it)&#8221;</strong></span> (Qaf 50: 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the companions of Imam Ahmad, may Allah have mercy upon him, visited him while he was sick. He found him groaning from the sickness. He said:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>&#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdullah! Are you groaning? Tawus said &#8216;Indeed, the Angels write down everything, even the groan of a sick person, because Allah says:</em></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;"><em>Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it(Qaf 50: 18)&#8221;&#8216;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Abu &#8216;Abdullah began to have (more) patience, and he stopped groaning,[1] because everything is written down. &#8220;Not a word does he (or she) utter? &#8211; Meaning any word uttered by you is written. However, you might be rewarded or punished for it. This is based on the saying that was said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] For what was reported by Salih bin Al-Imam Ahmad, he said: <em>&#8220;During his sickness prior to death, my father said: &#8216;Take out the book of &#8216;Abdullah bin Idris.&#8217; then said: &#8216;Read to me the narration of Laith that Tawus used to dislike groaning during sickness.&#8217; After that I did not hear to my father a groan till he died.&#8221;</em> Siyar A&#8217;lam An-Nubula (11:215).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Among them (Angels) are those who are in (constant) bowing and prostration to Allah in the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The heaven <em>Atat</em> (creak) and it has every right to creak.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong><em>Atit</em> </strong>is the Sarir Ar-Rahl (camel&#8217;s creaking). Meaning: If there was a heavy load on top of the camel, you would hear to it a creaking sound due to the heavy weight of the load.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The heaven creaks and it has every right to creak. There is no place that could contain four fingers in the heavens except that there is an Angel standing, bowing, or prostrating to Allah therein.&#8221;</strong></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these Angles cover the vastness of the heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[1] Reported by Abmad (5:173), At-Tirmidhi (2312), Ibn Majah (4190) and Al-Hakim (2:510), from Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him. And his wording is: &#8220;The heaven creaks, and it has every right to creak. There is no space for four fingers, except that there is an Angel there, placing its head in prostration to Allah.&#8221; The Hadith is referenced by Al-Albani in As-Sahihah (1722).</em> </span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">The following is posted from Riyadus Saliheen Published by Dar-us-Salam</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;One of the earlier Prophets who was out on an expedition proclaimed among his people that no man should follow him who had married a woman with whom he wished to cohabit but had not yet done so, or who had built houses on which he had not yet put the roofs, or who had bought sheep or pregnant she-camels and was expecting them to produce young. He, then, went on the expedition and approached the town at the time of the &#8216;Asr prayer or little before it. He then told the sun that both it and he were under command and prayed Allah to hold it back for them, so it was held back till Allah gave him victory. He collected the spoils and it (meaning fire) came to devour these, but did not. He said that among the people there was a man who stole from the booty. He told them that a man from every tribe must swear allegiance to him, and when a man&#8217;s hand stuck to his, he said: &#8220;There is thief among you and every individual of your tribe must swear allegiance to me&#8221;. (In course of swearing of allegiance,) hands of two or three persons stuck to his hand. He said: &#8220;The thief is among you&#8221;. They brought him a head of gold like a cow&#8217;s head and when he laid it down, the fire came and devoured the spoils. Spoils were not allowed to anyone before us, then Allah allowed spoils to us as He saw our weakness and incapacity and allowed them to us&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Commentary</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">1. In the opinion of Imam As-Suyuti, the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) referred to in this Hadith was Prophet Yusha` bin Nun (Joshua). His conduct shows that it is necessary to make suitable arrangements for the worldly needs of those who are engaged in the Cause of Allah so that they can concentrate on their struggle without any distraction.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">2. The lawfulness of the booty of war fought in the way of Allah is a specialty of the Muslim Ummah. Before the advent of Islam (the Shar&#8217;iah of Prophet Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam)), the booty of war which was free from dishonesty used to be consumed by fire. This Hadith also confirms the miracle of the Prophet Yusha&#8217; (Joshua) in which the movement of the sun was stopped until he had conquered the village.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">But the people of Fir`awn left no trace of righteousness on the earth and they had no good deeds that ascended to Allah, so the heavens and the earth did not weep for them</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Devil&#8217;s Deception of People by giving them High Hopes (of living long)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many Jews and Christians contemplated joining Islam, but Iblis convinced them to procrastinate saying: &#8220;Do not rush, look more into the issue.&#8221; Until they die as non-Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also causes the sinner to procrastinate seeking repentance. A poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Do not rush into committing a sin,</strong><br />
<strong>and then procrastinate repenting.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Iblis makes those seeking righteousness feel lazy, and he causes those who are serious to procrastinate. He convinces a jurist to rest instead of going over his lesson again. And convinces a worshipper who had woken up to pray at night that he still has a lot of time. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Iblis tries to make people lazy procrastinators, and to make them have hope (of a long life)</strong></span>. A disciplined person must take advantage of time, and never procrastinate. That which is feared can never be trusted, and that which passes can never be brought back again. The main reason for doing less good and more evil is relying on the hope of a long life, this is because a person continues to pro­crastinate performing good deeds and refraining from evil deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who hopes to wake up in the morning will not do much at night, and he who hopes to travel during the day will travel much at night. However, he who sees death to be near works hard during his life. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<strong>Perform prayer as if you were departing</strong>.&#8221; [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Salaf said: &#8220;<strong>Beware of procrastination, for it is one of devil&#8217;s strongest weapons</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A disciplined person prepares for his journey, while a procrastinator doesn&#8217;t. So when it comes time to travel the disciplined person feels happy while the procrastinator feels that he is in trouble. This is how people are. Some are alert, so when the Angel of Death comes they do not feel guilty. Others are not disciplined, so they feel the agony when it comes time to travel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If procrastination is part of your nature then repelling it becomes difficult. But when one knows that he has a persistant enemy he will always be on guard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to give us safety from the enemy&#8217;s cunning, the devil&#8217;s fttnah&#8217;s and the evils of ourselves and the dunyd. Indeed He is near and responsive.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is posted from : <strong><a title="Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf – Ahmad Ash-Shihhee" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/10/01/magnificent-points-of-advice-for-those-who-have-turned-to-the-way-of-the-salaf-ahmad-ash-shihhee/">Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf </a></strong>– Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad Ash-Shihhee. This book was read to Allaamaah Rabee’ al-Madkhalee who gave some good instructions regarding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad ash-Shihhee<br />
SOURCE: His book &#8220;Al-Wasaayah as-Saniyyah Lit-Taa’ibeena ilaas-Salafiyyah&#8221; (pg. 34-39)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars are the ones to be referred to and turned to regarding the important issues, especially in matters that concern the welfare of the Muslim ummah. If you look at the condition of the first generations from the Salaf as-Saalih, you would find that they were strict with regard to returning back to the senior scholars that were alive in their time, especially in getting rulings that resulted in making <i>tabdee’</i> (declaring someone an innovator) or <i>takfeer</i> (declaring someone a disbeliever). [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at the example of Yahyaa bin Ya’mar Al-Basree and Humaid bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Himayree Al-Basree, when the Qadariyyah appeared in their time and they began to manifest contradictions to the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, which necessitated that they be declared disbelievers or that they be pronounced innovators and removed from the fold of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. However, they did not rush into making a ruling against them. Rather, they went to those who held the position of being referred to with regard to issues of knowledge, from the scholars. And he was ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>). So they informed him of what occurred to them and he issued a ruling to them stating the misguidance and deviation of (this group of) the Qadariyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa bin Ya’mar said: “The first person who spoke (deviant views) with regard to Al-Qadar in Basrah was Ma’bad Al-Juhnee. Humaid bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Himayree and I set out to make Hajj or ‘Umrah, and we said to each other: “If only we could meet one of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger so that we could ask him about what these people are saying about Al-Qadar. So Allaah granted us that ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar ibn al-Khattaab (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>) enter the masjid So I and my companion gathered around him – one of us on his right and the other on his left. I felt as if my companion entrusted me with speaking to him, so I said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Abu ‘Abdur-Rahmaan, a people have appeared in our land that recite the Qur’aan and pursue knowledge…[and he mentioned some other points about them]…and they claim that there is no such thing as Al-Qadar (Divine Pre-Decree) and that it is rejected.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He responded: “If you meet these people, inform them that I am free from them and thy are free from me. By the One whom ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar swears by, if one of them had the likes of Mount Uhud in gold and he were to give it away in charity, Allaah would not accept it from him, until he believes in Al-Qadar.“ Then he said: “My father reported to me…” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And look at the example of Zubayd ibn Al-Haarith Al-Yaamee when the Murji’ah appeared in his time and he saw that they had oppositions to the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, which necessitated that they be ousted from the fold of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. Yet, he did not rush into making a ruling against them. Instead, he went to one who had the position of being referenced in religious matters in his time from the people of knowledge and fatwaa, those who took their knowledge from the Seniors amongst the Companions, who in this case was Abu Waa’il Shaqeeq bin Salamah Al-Asadee Al-Koofee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Zubayd went to him informing him of what had occurred, and Abu Waa’il issued a fatwaa to him based on a text from Allaah’s Messenger, which indicated the falsehood of the misconceptions of the Murji’ah and their deviating from Ahlus-Sunnah. Zubayd said: “When the Murji’ah appeared, I went to Abu Waa’il and mentioned that to him, so he said: ’Abdullaah narrated to me that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>‘Reviling a Muslim is sinfulness and fighting against him is disbelief.’</b>” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you were to compare between the condition of these people with regard to how they looked toward the people of knowledge in their time and between the condition of many of those who have become unstable in their repentance in this time of ours, you would find a huge difference between the two examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those people (in the first example) strove hard to implement this rule, and they did not rush to make a ruling against those people of their time whose deviation become apparent, until they first presented their case to the people of knowledge, those capable of issuing rulings (fatwaa) from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. So when they heard the ruling, they bit onto it with their molar teeth and distanced themselves from those deviants who were in opposition to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for today, then it is very rare that you can find those who strive hard to implement this rule. Rather, you will find those who have no concern for the words of the people of knowledge and fatwaa with regard to warning against the people of desires and innovation. So they wage war against the fataawaa (religious rulings) of the scholars and they distort their (intended) meanings. We ask Allaah to save and protect us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b class="Marker">Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Footnotes">[1] This does not mean that a student of knowledge is not to rule on issues altogether. What is meant here is that he should not rule on issues related to current occurrences, from the outset, especially those that are ambiguous from it. As for the clear issues, which are not ambiguous, then he is not required to refer to them (i.e. the scholars).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What Can This Eternal Life be Bought With?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">WHEN A PERSON THINKS about the life of this world before entering it, he considers it long. Likewise, when he thinks about it after leaving it, he sees a long period of time and knows that the stay in the grave is long. When he thinks about the Day of judgment, he knows that its fifty thousand years long, and when he thinks about Paradise and Hell, he knows that they will never end.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now, when he goes back to look at the time spent in this world, lets say 60 years, he can see that thirty of it is spent sleeping, fifteen or so is spent in childhood and most of what&#8217;s left goes to chasing after desires, food and money. When he accounts for what is left, he finds that much of it is nothing but showing off and heedlessness. The price of eternal life is the hours of his life, but what is left of them for him to buy it with?!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Pillar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Muhammadin kamaa Salayta &#8216;alaa ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali ibraaheema Innaka Hameedun Majeed&#8221;</span> [O Allaah, send your praises upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you sent praises upon Ibraaheem and the family of Ibraaheem. Verily, You are Most-Praiseworthy, Most Glorified]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This version of the tashahhud is well known. There are other forms of it as well.You may memorize whichever wording of the tashahhud that you like. However, choose one that is agreed upon. And if you hear someone using a tashahhud that varies from this one, do not condemn him.Tha same could be said about sending Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) if you have memorized the version mentioned here by the author. There are other ways of saying it as well. And we have stated many times that there exists many ways of doing it. Perhaps all of these ways (of sending salaat on the Prophet) have been gathered together by the great Scholar Ibn Al-Qavvim in his book which is unique in its subject: Jalaa-ul-Afhaam fis-Salaati &#8216;alaa Khair-il-Anaam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaat mentioned here (i.e. above) is known as the Abrahamic Salaat. The most comprehensive form of it is the one that has been agreed upon, which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Aali Muhammad kamaa salaita &#8216;alaa Ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali Ibraaheem. Innaka Hameedun Majeed. Wa Baarik Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Aali Muhammad kamaa baarakta &#8216;alaa Ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali Ibraaheem. Innaka Hameedun Majeed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This manner of saying it is agreed upon. And there are many other ways. However you should take note that none of the versions of the Abrahamic Salaat that have been recorded by Ibn Al-Qayyim in his afore-mentioned book contain an mention of the word &#8220;Sayyidinaa&#8221; our master) such as: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Many of our sensitive Muslim brothers, if you don&#8217;t say &#8220;<strong>Sayyidinaa</strong>&#8221; when sending Salaat and just say &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8221; , will perhaps think bad thoughts about you and say: &#8220;This person doesn&#8217;t have any respect for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">In fact, this very thing actually did happen, for one time a Moroccan man on Hajj told me: &#8220;0 Shaikh! I have attended your lessons from the first class till now while traveling. But I notice about you that when you send Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), you say &#8216; Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8217; and I never heard you once say: &#8216; Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8217; Why is this O Shaikh?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">He asked a good question and I clarified the matter to him, thus reducing the irritation found in him since he would become very annoyed whenever he would hear someone send Salaat on the Prophet and not say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">The Muslim common-folk do not make any distinction in matters. Perhaps they think that someone who leaves out the word &#8220;Sayyidinaa&#8221; does not respect the Prophet and does not love him in the manner that he deserves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">The reply: This is ignorance. It may even be called compound ignorance. Compound ignorance is when someone is ignorant and he doesn&#8217;t know that he is ignorant. If you don&#8217;t know that you don&#8217;t know something then this is ignorance on top of ignorance. So what is it that someone with ignorance attached to him knows? Nothing!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is our leader (Sayyid). He is the leader of all of mankind &#8211; all of the descendants of Aadam. This is what I worship Allaah with. We must believe this, in accordance with what he has informed us: &#8220;I am the Sayyid (leader) of mankind on the Day of Judgement. I am the Sayyid (leader) of the children of Aadam, and I do not say this to boast&#8221; We are obligated to believe that he is the Sayyid (leader) of all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in spite of this, when he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) taught the Companions how to send Salaat on him and when he dictated the Abrahamic Salaat to them during the revelation of the ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily Allaah and His Angels send Salaat (praises) on the Prophet. O you who believe, send your praises (Salaat) and greetings (Salaam) on him&#8221;</span> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When this ayah was revealed, the Companions asked: &#8220;0 Messenger of Allaah(Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), you have already taught us how to send greetings (of Salaam) upon you, but we have been ordered to (also) send praises (Salaat) upon you, so how do we send Salaat on you?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that this sort of questioning occurred in several different gatherings based on the fact that there are numerous manners of sending Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam). The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) taught his Companions to say it like this: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad.&#8221; This does not mean that he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) revoked his status of leadership and that he was no longer a Sayyid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have noted that at times the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) would condemn people in certain circumstances who would make statements that were understood to contain exaggeration and extremism with regard to himself. He (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) would condemn the one who said: &#8220;You are our Sayyid (leader), son of our Sayyid. And you are the best among us, son of the best among us&#8221; even though he really is the Sayyid (leader) of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, he did this because he feared that this man was being afflicted with extremism. Going to extremes with regard to the righteous people is one of the main causes of others being worshipped besides Allaah. So in order to protect the sanctuary of Tawheed, he told him no. He forbade him from (saying) that, saying: &#8220;I am only a slave, so say: &#8216;The slave and messenger of Alhall.'&#8221; This was even in spite of his prior statement in which he announced that he was the Sayyid (leader) of the children of Aadam. However, there is no contradiction between this statement and that statement since each situation warrants its own statement depending on its circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The situation in which the Prophet condemned the man was a situation that warranted such a condemnation and warning, whereas the situation in which he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) announced he was the Sayyid (of mankind) was due to the fact that he was talking about his (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) intercession. So he was clarifying its reality the reality that he is the Sayyid (leader) of all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point we are trying to make here is: Sending Salaat on the Prophet should be done by using one of the versions that have been reported in the texts. You should not add the phrase Sayyidina (our leader) to it even though the Prophet is our Sayyid. I hope that this point is understood. Furthermore, after making this point clear, I would like to reiterate that we must believe and affirm, in accordance with his report, that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is our Sayyid (leader). However, when sending Salaat upon him, we should not say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa.&#8221; Rather we should just say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8221; since this would be following his example, implementing his teachings, and carrying out his instructions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement stuns some people, which is why I must say again that the scholars have unanimously agreed that it is not permissible for a Muslim who wants to worship Allaah through words of supplication that have been reported in the texts to add, subtract, change or replace any of those words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars of Hadeeth, with their intricate memory and understanding of the texts, use as evidence one single report, which others perhaps are not aware of the basis of proof found in it. This report is about the time when the Prophet taught one of his Companions the supplication one should make when going to bed. The supplication contains the following words:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;Aamantu bi-Kitaabik aladhee anzalta wa Nabee&#8217;ik aladhee arsalta.&#8221;<br />
I believe in Your Book that You revealed and in Your Prophet that You sent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Companion began to repeat this supplication in order to memorize it, but then on one occasion, said: &#8220;&#8230;wa Rasoolik aladhee arsalta&#8221; , i.e. &#8220;&#8230;in Your Messenger that You sent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What did he do? He replaced the word &#8220;Nabee&#8221; (Prophet) with the word &#8220;Rasool&#8221; (Messenger). This Companion then narrated that: &#8220;The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), tapped my chest and said: &#8220;No, say: Wa Nabee&#8217;ik aladhee arsalta.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is clear proof that it is not proper for a person who wishes to follow Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and abide by his teachings to add, subtract, change or replace (these supplications) based on his own accord. The &#8220;Messenger&#8221; and &#8220;Prophet&#8221; are two valid titles for Prophet Muhammad. However, we cannot change the supplication from the manner in which it was reported since that is the way the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) stated it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) does not speak from his own desire. So these were revealed to the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) through revelation from Allaah. Meaning: The legislation of these words of remembrance that are to be said at the time of sleeping came down from the heavrns. So if something was revealed to the Prophet(Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and he conveyed it to his, Companions in the same manner in which it was sent down, it would not be proper for the Companions to change that. And we should follow their example, and Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="title" style="font-weight:bold;color:#494949;text-align:justify;">The following are excerps from <em>‘Sincere Counsel to the Seekers of Sacred Knowledge’</em> by Imaam Ibn al-Jawzi (Rahimahullaahu Ta’aala), in which he is advising his son:</p>
<div class="copy" style="color:#6e7173;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">Observe, my son, the way you deal with the limits of Allaah and see how you can keep yourself within their bounds.<strong> Indeed, he who takes care of these limits is taken great care of, and he who doesn’t, is left to himself.</strong> I shall now mention some of my experience to you so that you may observe my striving and ask the Granter of success to bless me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truly, <strong>most of the blessings I have been given have not been earned by me but rather they are conferred as a result of the planning of The Gentle One alone.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I remember myself as a child: A highly motivated six-year old sitting in class with older boys. The intellect I had been given superseded of old men. <strong>I do not recall myself playing on the road with other kids or even laughing out loud. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I was seven or so, I attended the gatherings in the Masjid. I would not sit in a circle of mere wordplay, but searching for a Hadeeth Scholar who would narrate about the Prophet’s (Sall-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa Sallam) life. <strong>I would memorize everything he said, then go back home and write it down.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was blessed for being granted my teacher Abu al-Fadl ibn Nasir (Rahimahullaah) who would take me to different Scholars and let me hear the Musnad [of Imaam Ahmad] and other major works.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>All this time I had no idea of why I was made to do these things.</strong> My teacher recorded all I had heard, and when I reached puberty he handed me this record. I accompanied him till his death, and through him I learned the science of Hadeeth and transmission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The kids used to go down to Tigris River and play on the bridge, <strong>but when I was small I used to take a book and sit far from people by the shore studying Sacred Knowledge. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then I was inspired to abandon the vanities of this world so I began constant fasting and reduced my food intake to very little.</strong> I trained myself to be patient, embarking on a continuous pursuit in order to do so and staying up at night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I didn’t feel satisfied with studying just one science so I read jurisprudence, sermon delivery and Hadeeth and followed those who practiced Zuhd. After that I studied linguistics. There was not a narrating Scholar or a preacher where I lived who I didn’t sit with and whenever such a person would arrive from elsewhere I would go to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>I used to choose of virtuous deeds what suited me and if I had to choose between two things I usually chose the right of al-Haqq (Allaah). </strong>He has planned my life and cultivated me in a beautiful fashion, guiding me towards what is best for me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He has protected me from my enemies, the jealous, and those who might plot against me. He has made everything convenient for my studies of Sacred Knowledge and sent me books from unexpected places. He gave me good understanding, the ability to memorize and write quickly and a talent for authoring books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I lacked nothing of this world. As a matter of fact, things were quite the opposite as Allaah gave me more than enough. He put a great deal of acceptance of me into peoples’ hearts and made the impact of my words leave them not questioning the authenticity of what I had to say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Approximately 200 thimmis [i.e. people of the book who live in Muslim lands according to a truce contract] have become Muslim at my hands <strong>and over 100 000 sinners have repented in my gatherings.</strong> More than 20 000 men have announced their repentance from foolish ways during my exhortations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to go around Hadeeth gatherings of different Scholars and run till I was out of breath so no-one would precede me. <strong>I would start my day having nothing to eat and finish it having nothing to eat.</strong> Never did Allaah degrade me to take from another person, instead He provided for me in order to protect my honour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truth is, mentioning all my experience would take quite a while. And here I am now and you can see what I have achieved. <strong>I will tell you the whole story in one single sentence,</strong> and that is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;">وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ وَيُعَلِّمُكُمُ اللَّهُ</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">”<strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">Fear Allaah, and Allaah will teach you</span>.</strong>” [Surah al-Baqarah:282]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">Note : The Book &#8220;<em style="font-weight:bold;color:#494949;">‘Sincere Counsel to the Seekers of Sacred Knowledge’&#8221; </em> was published by Dar us Sunnah publishers</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: Is it permissible to perform ruqyah on a disbeliever?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh Rabee (hafidhahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible. Abu Sa&#8217;eed (radhi Allaahu anhu), performed ruqyah on a disbeliever when he went out with a military detachment and passed by a group of people by a well whom they asked permission to be hosted but this group refused to do so. Then when their leader was stung by a scorpion, they came and said: &#8220;Our leader has been stung. Do you have anyone that can treat him with ruqyah?&#8221;  The Companions replied: &#8220;By Allaah, we will not treat him with ruqyah until you give us compensation. We sought your permission but you refused to host us!&#8221; The group gave them a flock of sheep and the leader was treated with Surah Al-Faatihah and cured as if he was freed from shackles!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows you that the person who performed ruqyah was sincere. The Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) concurred with him and with his using Surah Al-Faatihah as a ruqyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, those who perform ruqyah take gifts and money from people even if they do not heal the people they treat!! A condition for the permissibility of taking compensation for ruqyah is that the sick person must be healed, as was the case in the afore-mentioned hadeeth where, upon receiving the ruqyah, the man was cured as if he had just been released from shackles. And as a result of this, the Companions took the flock of sheep as payment. But had the man not been cured, they would not have taken the flock.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, today, the one who performs ruqyah is eager to take money. The sick and unfortunate go to him with their illnesses and misfortunes and they do not receive any help from him yet their money is seized. This money that they take is unlawful, may Allaah bless you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">From the excellent book (published by al-ibaanah) <strong><em>The Rules and Etiquettes of Ruqya</em></strong>, by Shaikh Saalih Aalush-Shaikh p.37-39 </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">“When Shaikh Abdullah Al-Qar’aawee<a style="color:#b85b5a;" href="http://us.mg4.mail.yahoo.com/dc/blank.html?bn=397.8&amp;.intl=us&amp;.lang=en-US#sdfootnote1sym" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="sdfootnote1anc"></a><sup>1</sup> came to our region, many people were suffering from illnesses; they were bed-ridden and couldn’t get up. And what was this due to? It was due to the Jinn and so on and so forth. They would go out and come across the Jinn at night in trees and upon the roads and so on, and the devils would take over them. This is because they were ignorant. They didn’t have any understanding of Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">So when he (i.e. Shaikh Al-Qar’aawee) came and spread Tawheed<strong>, </strong>not ruqyah or anything else, may Allah bless you, all of these things came to an end. All of these (possessions and illnesses) came to an end once Tawheed and knowledge spread. When Tawheed and knowledge spread, these things go away and come to an end. And when ignorance becomes widespread, sorcerers, soothsayers, devils and so on increase and cooperate with one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advised him to do as the good doers in the past did, which was to call to Tawheed and wage war against shirk and false superstitions such that the devils left them and they had no need for people to perform ruqyah on them from devils, sorcerers or anyone else….”</p>
<div id="sdfootnote1">
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]<strong>Translator’s Note:</strong>Shaikh Abdullah Al-Qar’aawee was born in 1315H in Saudi Arabia where he played a great role in reviving the call to Islaam, particularly in its southern regions, making Saamitah the center of his efforts. He studied under such Scholars as Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibtaheem, the former muftee of Saudi Arabia, and produced students of his own such as Shaikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee. He passed away in 1389H, may Allah have mercy on him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">After this, there occurs the opening supplication, which is optional, and states: <strong>&#8220;Subhaanak Allaahumma wa bi Hamdika. Wa Tabaarakasmuka wa Ta&#8217;aala Jadduka. Wa Laa ilaaha Ghayruka.&#8221;</strong> [Free from imperfections are You, O Allaah, and all praise is Yours. Blessed is Your Name, Glorified be Your Greatness, and there is no deity worthy of worship besides You]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of &#8220;<strong>Subhaanak Allaahumma</strong>&#8221; is: I absolve You from all imperfections in a manner that befits Your majesty. &#8220;<strong>Wa bi-Hamdika</strong>&#8221; i.e. while praising You. &#8220;<strong>Wa Tabaarakasmuka</strong>&#8221; i.e. blessing can be attained by mentioning You. &#8220;<strong>Wa Ta&#8217;aala Jadduka</strong>&#8221; i.e. Glorified be Your Greatness. &#8220;<strong>Wa Laa ilaaha Ghayruka</strong>&#8221; i.e. There is nothing that has the right to be worshipped on earth or in heaven except You, O Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>~ the explanation ~</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author, may Allaah have mercy on him, states here that the opening supplication is a recommended act. It is neither a pillar nor a requirement nor a condition. Rather it is supererogatory. He then went on to choose one version of the opening supplication, which is the shortest, amplest, and most comprehensive of these supplications from the perspective of praise, veneration and glorification of Allaah. And it is: <strong>&#8220;Subhaanak Allaahumma wa hi Hamdika. Wa Tabaarakasmuka wa Ta&#8217;aala Jadduka. Wa Laa Ilaaha Ghayruka</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar Ibn Al-Qayyim listed a number of opening supplications in his book Zaad al-Ma&#8217;aad. But he preferred this supplication over the numerous other ones of this nature, some of which are longer. This is due to the fact that this concise supplication contains such praise, veneration and glorification for Allaah the likes of which cannot be found in other supplications. Other supplications consist more of requests and invocations whereas this one consists of (purely) glorification, honoring and exaltation (of Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author then takes it upon himself to explain this supplication as well as what comes after it. The meaning of: &#8220;<strong>Subhaanak Allaahumma</strong>&#8221; is: &#8220;I absolve You, O Lord, in a manner that befits You, from all imperfections.&#8221;  This is an absolving that befits His majesty, and it is derived from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people are divided in their definitions of absolving Allaah from imperfections. Some people have defined it as negating Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, which is why the <strong>Jahmiyyah and Mu&#8217;tazilah</strong> have negated all of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, claiming that they are removing imperfections from Allaah. The reason for this (according to them) is because if one affirms Attributes for Allaah, this leads to likening Allaah to His creation. So, according to them, freeing Allaah from imperfections can only be achieved by negating His Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>Ashaa&#8217;irah and the Matooridiyyah</strong> did the same with respect to the textual Attributes. The textual Attributes are those attributes for which the intellect plays no part in affirming. They are only affirmed by way of narrations and textual proofs. According to the understanding of the Ashaa&#8217;irah, affirming these attributes literally goes against removing imperfections from Allaah. So as a result they resorted to <strong>taweel</strong> (misinterpretation). They did not negate the Attributes as others did. Rather, they claimed that what was literally stated in these texts was not what Allaah intended. So therefore, interpreting them them with other than their literal meanings is binding based on the claim of removing imperfections from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You will notice that everyone who negates or distorts the meaning of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes claims to be removing imperfections from Allaah by what they do. When the first group negated Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, they did not intend disrespect for Allaah. Rather, according to their claim, they only intended to remove imperfections from Him. But where is this removal of imperfections? They went astray in this regard. Why did they go astray? Because they looked for guidance in other than Allaah&#8217;s Book. <span style="color:#ff6600;">Whoever searches for guidance in other than the Book of Allaah and in other than what the Messenger brought, will no doubt go astray</span>. <strong>This is a principle</strong>. Whoever looks for guidance and truth in other than what the Messenger of Allaah came with will be misguided as recompense for turning away (from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah). This is since guidance, correctness and truth is restricted to only that which the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) brought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we want to know the true manner of removing Allaah, from imperfections in a manner that befits His majesty, we should read Allaah&#8217;s statement: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is nothing like Him (in comparison), and He is the All Hearer, the All-Seer</span>.&#8221; [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is there a greater example of removing imperfections from Allaah than this? Allaah affirms Attributes for Himself but negates any comparisons in those Attributes that He has affirmed. This is what is meant by <strong>tanzeeh</strong> (removing imperfections from Allaah). It is that you affirm for Him what He has affirmed for Himself from complete Attributes, perfect Names and flawless Actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Affirm for Him what He has affirmed for Himself. Then negate any comparisons to what He has affirmed (for Himself) since no one can describe Allaah who is more knowledgeable than Him. Also affirm for what His trusted Messenger has described Him with and negate my comparisons to what he (peace be upon him) has affirmed, since no one can describe Allaah from His creation who is more knowledgeable than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how Allaah has guided the people of truth and the callers to truth. So they know how to remove imperfections from Allaah without negating His Attributes, distorting their meaning, making comparisons to them or likening them to His creation. This is the point the author is trying to make when he says: &#8220;I absolve You from all imperfections, my Lord, in a manner that befits You.&#8221; This is the type of removing of imperfections from Allaah that befits His majesty, which has been derived from the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Wa bi-Hamdika&#8221;</strong> means: &#8220;while praising You.&#8221; So this consists of removing imperfections from Allaah while at the same time praising Him. But on the other hand, if you have negated Allaah&#8217;s Perfect Attributes, how can you then praise Him?! If you have negated the Attribute of Mercy from Allaah, how can you praise Him? You say that it is impossible for Allaah to have Mercy and that Love is something impossible for Allaah. He is neither loved nor does He love. How then can you praise him when you negate Mercy from Him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You heard previously the qudsee hadeeth about Al-Faatihah in which it is stated: &#8220;And when the servant says: <strong>Ar-Rahmaan-ir-Raheem</strong>&#8216;, Allaah says: &#8216;<strong>My servant has extolled Me</strong>.&#8221; As for the one who negates the Attribute of Mercy from Allaah, it is not possible for Him to praise Allaah, since praising Allaah can only be achieved through His exemplary Names, Attributes, and Actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Wa Tabaarakusmuka&#8221;</strong> means: Blessing is achieved by mentioning You. Your Name is removed from any imperfections and blessing is achieved through mention of Your Name. This is how the author (Muhammad bin Abdil-Wahhaab) has explained it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Wa Ta&#8217;aala jadduka&#8221;</strong> means: Glorified be Your greatness grandness. The word &#8220;<strong>jadd</strong>&#8221; here takes on the meaning of grandness and self sufficiency. So it means: &#8220;Glorified be Your Grandness and self-sufficiency.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that: &#8220;No one on earth or in heaven is worshipped with due right except for You, O Allaah.&#8221; The phrase &#8220;<strong>with due right</strong>&#8221; must be mentioned when explaining the meaning of &#8220;Laa Ilaaha illaaAllaah&#8221;. You must include &#8220;due right&#8221; or &#8220;rightfully&#8221; or else the meaning will be wrong. If you were to say: &#8220;There is no one worshipped in the heavens or on the earth except for You&#8221; we would be contradicting reality since those who are worshipped are many. But the one who is worshipped after all others have been negated is the One who is worshipped in truth or with &#8220;due right.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no one worshipped on earth or in heaven with due right except for You. As for those who are worshipped in the heavens and the earth, the worship of them is futile and invalid. The sun and the moon are worshipped but worshiping them is invalid. Trees are worshipped. Many of the large trees with many branches (known as dawhaat) are still worshipped today. This goes also for stones, tombs and shrines. The worship of these things is futile.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This also applies to the worship of Jinn and the worship of graves. Every time something is worshipped, it becomes known as a &#8220;god&#8221; according to the language. It is not called Allaah, but rather a &#8220;false&#8221; god. The term &#8220;god&#8221; is general and encompasses the One who is worshipped with due right as well as those that are worshipped wrongfully. The word &#8220;Allaah&#8221; is specifically reserved for the One who is worshipped with due right &#8211; the Creator of the heavens and the earth. There is no one worshipped in the heavens or the earth (with due right) except for you, O Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;If one of you comes to the masjid, he should look at the bottom of his shoes. If he sees any impurity on them, he should rub them on the ground. Then he may enter with them (i.e, the shoes) and pray with them on.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the acts of the Sunnah that has been abandoned today. in fact, it is one of the acts of the Sunnah that is fought against by many people. It is even considered a crime in some regions — Entering the masjid with sandals and shoes. If I were to go today and buy a pair of shoes from a store and then put them on and enter the masjid with them -this would be regarded as a crime and considered disrespectful to the mosques and houses of Allaah. The Sunnah has become innovation and innovation has become Sunnah! Praying in shoes was something well established at the time of the Salaf &#8211; they would not differ over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a matter of fact, everything found in this command (of the Prophet) Should be observed by an individual. So he should check if his shoes are clean upon entering the masjid, acting upon the hadeeth which we just mentioned: &#8220;Then he may enter with them (i.e. the shoes) and pray with them on.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he takes his shoes off, <strong>he should place them between his legs, not in front of him or behind him nor to his right or left</strong>, so as to disturb the people around him. Rather he should place them between his legs, in between his feet. This is what has been reported in the Sunnah and this is what the Salaf of this ummah have followed. This aspect of the Sunnah continues to be practiced in some areas of this country (i.e. Saudi Arabia). However, in some of the other areas of the country as well as some regions abroad, the reaction towards this Sunnah is bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nevertheless, <strong>we must emphasize here that praying in shoes is Sunnah, i.e. recommended. It is neither obligatory nor is it a condition or requirement for the validity of one&#8217;s prayer.</strong> So if this aspect of the Sunnah conflicts with another good that is found in some masaajid, or if opening the door to entering the masaajid with shoes on leads to squandering money, then this aspect of the Sunnah should be left off temporarily and restrictedly &#8211; to this confined area &#8211; until it is revived in other places similar to these masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The youth should not hasten to enter the masaajid with their shoes on for they will open the door for everyone to do so, and this will lead some people who are in a rush to enter the masjid before checking under their shoes. This will then lead to a squandering of the masjid&#8217;s carpet and we have been prohibited from squandering money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Squandering money is forbidden while entering the masjid and Praying with shoes on is recommended. So when there exists a conflict such as this, we should work to revive the Sunnah of praying in shoes in masaajid other than these &#8211; i.e. in masaajid that have remained in their pure original state with floors that are covered by dirt and sand &#8211; or in our homes, or in some open land when we go out on a journey or camping. There are many places.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that we should not fight against the act of praying in shoes, nor should we go to the extreme of entering these carpeted masaajid with shoes on thus causing the money spent on them to be squandered. Rather, we should combine between these advantages and those ahaadeeth, and that is by reviving the Sunnah of praying in shoes in other than these types of masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many masaajid and many places (to pray with shoes on). So we must have a good and proper understanding of the Religion and bring together all of the texts. A person should not take one portion or one text or one hadeeth and leave off all of the other texts. Rather, he must always try to reconcile and bring together all of the texts, as much as he is able to.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Removing all things that prevent Water from Reaching the Skin</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;">This means that a person must remove everything covering the body parts he washes during ablution that would prevent water from reaching his skin. This applies to those who work with <strong>paint</strong>. If this substance sticks hard onto the body parts they wash during ablution to the point that water cannot reach the skin, one is obligated to take it off by using paint remover before performing ablution.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;">This also applies to <strong>nail polish</strong>, which women put on their nails. They must remove this from their nails before performing ablution. A Muslim woman must remove this nail polish whenever she intends to perform ablution or ritual bathing, i.e. ghusl from sexual impurity. She may use this nail polish in her home afterward depending on whether she agrees with her husband that it is a means of beautification and adornment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Source: from the book &#8220;An Explanation of the conditions,pillars and requirements of Prayer&#8221; al-ibaanah publishing</p>
<p><strong>Touching a Woman with Sexual Desire</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The issue of touching a woman is another point the scholars have differed on The scholars have differed on this issue into three opinions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Opinion:</strong> Touching a woman nullifies one&#8217;s ablution under all circumstances, even if it is not done with sexual desire. So it includes all types of touching. This is the view held by Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Opinion:</strong> Is the one stated by the author, which is that it nullifies the ablution if done with sexual desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Opinion:</strong> Touching a woman does not nullify one&#8217;s ablution in any circumstance. Rather, the only thing that nullifies one ablution is actual sexual intercourse. This is what cancels out ablution and makes ghusl mandatory. This is the opinion of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas When people would disagree with him on this matter, he would put his fingers in his ears and say: &#8220;It only means sexual intercourse.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Or you have been in contact with women.&#8221;</span> [Surah Al-Maa&#8217;idah verse 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regardless if you read the ayah as &#8220;Iaamastum&#8221; or &#8220;lamastum&#8221;, the Interpreter of the Qur&#8217;aan, &#8216;Abdullaah bin &#8216;Abbaas has interpreted the meaning of &#8220;contact&#8221; here as sexual intercourse. As for all other types of contact besides sexual intercourse, they do not nullify one&#8217;s ablution. This is the third opinion, which is the view of the scholars of Hadeeth and the one that we incline towards, if Allaah wills, and Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Dr. Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din Al-Hilali</strong> (Translator of the Noble Qur&#8217;an) writes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‎It is a pity that many nations are only satisfied in the translated meaning of the Qur&#8217;an and Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah instead of studying the (true) Arabic text of the Qur&#8217;an and Prophet&#8217;‎s Sunnah. For this reason they are divided into various sects (due to the lack of knowledge about the religion of Islam) e.g. as regards to the ways of religious education, etc. so they are plunged in differences, which was prohibited by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the translation of the meaning of the Qur&#8217;an is meant for the above said purpose then it is a real mischief-doing, and an evil action and is against what was brought by Allaah‎s Messenger (Peace be upon him) and also against the opinions of the early and present day religious scholars. <strong>All the religious scholars unanimously agree that the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah should be taught in the language of the Qur&#8217;an (i.e. Arabic Language)</strong>. So did the early religious scholars of the Muslim nation when they conquered different countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translations are mainly meant for informing the people who have not yet embraced Islam to make clear to them the principles of Islam and the teachings of Muhammad (Peace be upon him) and to know its exact facts. When they reach this state and Allaah has blessed them with Islam, they must take the Qur&#8217;anic and the Messenger‎s Language (i.e. Arabic) as the only language to understand Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah&#8217;s mercy be on Shaykh &#8216;Umar Uzbak, a great Turkish man, who strove for Islam in Uzbakistan under the Russian government, after his long fight against the enemies of Islam with fire (iron) and tongue (speech), he took refuge in Afghanistan at Kabul, where the government honoured him. I met him there in 1352 A.H. (approx. 1932 CE) i.e. nearly 40 years ago, and he had vowed to Allaah that he will never speak to a relative or anybody else except in the Qur&#8217;anic and Messenger&#8217;s (Arabic) language. His wife sent a man for me to intercede for her to him that he should speak with her and her children in the Turkish language even for an hour everyday. So when I spoke to him about it, he said: &#8216;Russians had compelled us to learn perfectly the Russian language (by force), so we learnt it. And unless they knew that the learning of the Russian language will make the person who learns it, follow their ways of thinking, characters, and their traditions, they would not have forced anybody to learn it.&#8217; He further said to me, &#8216;I have vowed to Allaah long ago not to speak except in the language of the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah (i.e. Arabic) and I do that only for Allaah&#8217;s sake. If my wife and children desire to enjoy speaking with me, they should learn the language of the Qur&#8217;an and of the Prophet (Peace be upon him) (i.e. Arabic) and I am ready to teach them the Qur&#8217;anic language whenever they desire that‎</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> <b>The Tafsir Ibn Kathir of </b><b>Surat</b><b> Al-Qiyamah (Chapter &#8211; 75)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Which was revealed in Makkah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ أُقْسِمُ بِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ &#8211; وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ &#8211; أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَلَّن نَّجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُ &#8211; بَلَى قَـدِرِينَ عَلَى أَن نُّسَوِّىَ بَنَانَهُ &#8211; بَلْ يُرِيدُ الإِنسَـنُ لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ &#8211; يَسْـَلُ أَيَّانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَـمَةِ &#8211; فَإِذَا بَرِقَ الْبَصَرُ &#8211; وَخَسَفَ الْقَمَرُ &#8211; وَجُمِعَ الشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ &#8211; يَقُولُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ &#8211; كَلاَّ لاَ وَزَرَ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ &#8211; يُنَبَّأُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذِ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ &#8211; بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ &#8211; وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1. Nay! I swear by the Day of Resurrection.) (2. And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah.) (3. Does man think that We shall not assemble his bones) (4. Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers.) (5. Nay! Man desires to break out ahead of himself.) (6. He asks: &#8220;When will be this Day of Resurrection&#8221;) (7. So, when Bariqa the sight.) (8. And the moon will be eclipsed.) (9. And the sun and moon will be joined together.) (10. On that Day man will say: &#8220;Where (is the refuge) to flee&#8221;) (11. No! There is no refuge!) (12. Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) (13. On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.) (14. Nay! Man will be well informed about himself,) (15. Though he may put forth his excuses.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Oath about the Final Return on the Day of Resurrection and the Refutation against the Plots of the Thinkers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been mentioned previously on more than one occasion that if the thing that is being sworn about is something that is being negated, then it is permissible to use the word &#8220;La&#8221; (Nay) before the oath to emphasize the negation. Here, what is being sworn about is the affirmation of the final abode and the refutation against the claim of the ignorant that the resurrection of bodies will not occur. This is why Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ أُقْسِمُ بِيَوْمِ الْقِيَـمَةِ &#8211; وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! I swear by the Day of Resurrection. And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah.) Qatadah said, &#8220;This means, I swear by both of these things.&#8221; This has also been reported from Ibn `Abbas and Sa`id bin Jubayr. Concerning the Day of Judgement, it is well known what it is. In reference to An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah, Qurrah bin Khalid reported from Al-Hasan Al-Basri that he said about this Ayah, &#8220;Verily, by Allah, we think that every believer blames himself. He says (questioning himself), `What did I intend by my statement What did I intend by my eating What did I intend in what I said to myself&#8217; However, the sinner proceeds ahead and he does not blame himself.&#8221; Ibn Jarir recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And nay! I swear by An-Nafs Al-Lawwamah) &#8220;He criticizes himself in good and bad.&#8221; Similar has been reported from `Ikrimah. Ibn Abi Najih reported from Mujahid: &#8220;He is sorry for what he missed (of good deeds) and he blames himself for it.&#8221; Allah said;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَلَّن نَّجْمَعَ عِظَامَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Does man think that We shall not assemble his bones) meaning, `on the Day of Judgement does he think that We are not able to return his bones and gather them from their various places&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلَى قَـدِرِينَ عَلَى أَن نُّسَوِّىَ بَنَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Yes, We are able to put together in perfect order the tips of his fingers.) meaning, `does man think that We will not gather his bones Surely, We will gather them and We are quite able to put together his fingertips. This means Our power is suitable to gather (and recreate) them, and if We wished We could surely resurrect him with more than what he originally had. We could make his Banan, which are the tips of his fingers, all equal (in length).&#8217; Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلْ يُرِيدُ الإِنسَـنُ لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! Man desires to break out ahead of himself.) Sa`id reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;This means to proceed forward.&#8221; Mujahid said about,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِيَفْجُرَ أَمَامَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(to break out ahead of himself.) &#8220;This means that he wants to proceed ahead following his own whims.&#8221; `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;This refers to the disbeliever who denies the Day of Reckoning.&#8221; Ibn Zayd said the same thing. Thus, Allah says after this,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَسْـَلُ أَيَّانَ يَوْمُ الْقِيَـمَةِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He asks: &#8220;When will be this Day of Resurrection&#8221;) meaning, he says when will the Day of Judgement be His question is only a question of denying its occurrence, and rejecting its existence. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَـذَا الْوَعْدُ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ قُل لَّكُم مِّيعَادُ يَوْمٍ لاَّ تَسْتَـَخِرُونَ عَنْهُ سَاعَةً وَلاَ تَسْتَقْدِمُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they say: &#8220;When is this promise if you are truthful&#8221; Say: &#8220;The appointment to you is for a Day, which you cannot put back for an hour nor put forward.&#8221;) (34:29-30) Here Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا بَرِقَ الْبَصَرُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So, when Bariqa the sight.) Abu `Amr bin Al-`Ala&#8217; recited this Ayah as Bariqa with a Kasrah under the letter Ra, which means to be diminished. That which he (Abu `Amr) has said resembles the statement of Allah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ يَرْتَدُّ إِلَيْهِمْ طَرْفُهُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Their gaze returning not towards them.) (14:43) meaning, they will be looking this way and that way in horror. Their gaze will not be able to rest upon anything due to the severity of the terror on that Day. Others recited it as Baraqa with a Fathah over the letter Ra, and its meaning is close to the first recitation (Bariqa). The intent here is that the eyes will be dazzled, humbled, diminished, and humiliated on the Day of Judgement due to the severity of the horrors and the greatness of the matters that they will witness on that Day. Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَخَسَفَ الْقَمَرُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And the moon will be eclipsed.) meaning, its light will go away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَجُمِعَ الشَّمْسُ وَالْقَمَرُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And the sun and moon will be joined together.) Mujahid said, &#8220;They will be rolled up.&#8221; In explaining this Ayah, Ibn Zayd recited the following Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِذَا الشَّمْسُ كُوِّرَتْ &#8211; وَإِذَا النُّجُومُ انكَدَرَتْ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the sun is wound round and its light is lost and is overthrown, and when the stars fall.) (81:1,2) It has been reported from Ibn Mas`ud that he recited the Ayah as, (وَجُمِعَ بَيْنَ الشَّمْسِ وَالْقَمَرِ) (and the sun and the moon will be joined between each other.) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَقُولُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ أَيْنَ الْمَفَرُّ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On that Day man will say:&#8221;Where (is the refuge) to flee&#8221;) meaning, the human will see these horrors on the Day of Judgement and he will want to flee. He will say, &#8220;Where (is the place) to flee to&#8221; This means, where is the escape or refuge Allah then says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ لاَ وَزَرَ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No! There is no refuge! Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) Ibn Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Jubayr and several others of the Salaf said, &#8220;There will be no salvation.&#8221; This Ayah is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[مَا لَكُمْ مِّن مَّلْجَأٍ يَوْمَئِذٍ وَمَا لَكُمْ مِّن نَّكِيرٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You will have no refuge on that Day nor there will be for you any denying.) (42:47) meaning, `there will be no place for you to hide.&#8217; This is like what Allah says here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ وَزَرَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is no refuge.) meaning, `there will be no place for you to seek shelter.&#8217; Thus, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمُسْتَقَرُّ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Unto your Lord will be the place of rest that Day.) meaning, the place of return and the final destination. The Deeds of Man will be placed before Him on the Day of Judgement Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يُنَبَّأُ الإِنسَـنُ يَوْمَئِذِ بِمَا قَدَّمَ وَأَخَّرَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On that Day man will be informed of what he sent forward, and what he left behind.) meaning, he will be informed of all of his deeds, the old of them and the recent of them, the first of them and the last of them, the small of them and the large of them. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَوَجَدُواْ مَا عَمِلُواْ حَاضِرًا وَلاَ يَظْلِمُ رَبُّكَ أَحَدًا]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they will find all that they did, placed before them, and your Lord treats no one with injustice.) (18:49) Likewise, Allah says here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ &#8211; وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! Man will be well informed about himself, though he may put forth his excuses.) meaning, he will be a witness against himself, knowing full well what he did, even though he will try to make excuses and deny it. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اقْرَأْ كَتَـبَكَ كَفَى بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((It will be said to him): &#8220;Read your book. You are sufficient as a reckoner against yourself this Day.&#8221;) `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported that Ibn `Abbas said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلِ الإِنسَـنُ عَلَى نَفْسِهِ بَصِيرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay! Man will be well informed about himself.) &#8220;His hearing, his sight, his two hands, his two legs and his limbs.&#8221; Qatadah said, &#8220;This means he is a witness against himself.&#8221; In another narration from Qatadah he said, &#8220;By Allah! If you wish to see him, you would see him as someone who sees the shortcomings of the people and their sins, yet he is heedless of his own sins.&#8221; It used to be said, &#8220;Verily, it is written in the Injil: `O Son of Adam, do you see the small splinters in the eye of your brother and disregard the tree stump that is in your eye, so you do not see it&#8221;&#8217; Mujahid said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;This means, even though he argues in defense of it, he is a witness against it.&#8221; Qatadah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;Even though he will try to make false excuses on that Day, they will not be accepted from him.&#8221; As-Suddi said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;This means his argument.&#8221; This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ لَمْ تَكُنْ فِتْنَتُهُمْ إِلاَّ أَن قَالُواْ وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There will then be no Fitnah for them but to say: &#8220;By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.&#8221;) (6:23) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَوْمَ يَبْعَثُهُمُ اللَّهِ جَمِيعاً فَيَحْلِفُونَ لَهُ كَمَا يَحْلِفُونَ لَكُمْ وَيَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ عَلَى شَىْءٍ أَلاَ إِنَّهُمْ هُمُ الْكَـذِبُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On the Day when Allah will resurrect them all together; then they will swear to Him as they swear to you (O Muslims). And they think that they have something. Verily, they are liars!) (58:18) Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلَوْ أَلْقَى مَعَاذِيرَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Though he may put forth his excuses.) &#8220;This is apologizing. Haven&#8217;t you heard that Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ يَنفَعُ الظَّـلِمِينَ مَعْذِرَتُهُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Day when their excuses will be of no profit to wrongdoers.) (40:52) and He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَلْقَوْاْ إِلَى اللَّهِ يَوْمَئِذٍ السَّلَمَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they will offer submision to Allah on that Day.) (16:87) and He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَأَلْقَوُاْ السَّلَمَ مَا كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ مِن سُوءٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then they will (falsely) submit: &#8220;We used not to do any evil.&#8221;) (16:28) and their statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللَّهِ رَبِّنَا مَا كُنَّا مُشْرِكِينَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(By Allah, our Lord, we were not those who joined others in worship with Allah.) (6:23)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ &#8211; إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ وَقُرْءَانَهُ &#8211; فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَـهُ فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْءَانَهُ &#8211; ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُ &#8211; كَلاَّ بَلْ تُحِبُّونَ الْعَاجِلَةَ &#8211; وَتَذَرُونَ الاٌّخِرَةَ &#8211; وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ &#8211; وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَاسِرَةٌ &#8211; تَظُنُّ أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(16. Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith.) (17. It is for Us to collect it and that it be recited.) (18. And when We have recited it to you, then follow its recitation.) (19. Then it is for Us to make it clear.) (20. But no! Rather you love the present life of this world,) (21. And neglect the Hereafter.) (22. Some faces that Day shall be Nadirah.) (23. Looking at their Lord.) (24. And some faces that Day will be Basirah,) (25. Thinking that some calamity is about to fall on them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>How the Prophet received the Revelation</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is Allah teaching His Messenger how to receive the revelation from the angel. For verily, he (the Prophet ) was rushing in his attempts to grasp the revelation and he would be reciting the revelation with the angel while he was reciting it. Therefore, Allah commanded him that when the angel brings some revelation to him he should just listen. Allah would make sure to collect it in his chest, and He would make it easy for him to recite it in the same way that it was revealed to him. Allah would explain it, interpret it and clarify it for him. So the first phase was gathering it in his chest, the second phase was recitation and the third phase was its explanation and clarification of its meaning. Thus, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith.) meaning, with the Qur&#8217;an. This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تَعْجَلْ بِالْقُرْءانِ مِن قَبْلِ إَن يُقْضَى إِلَيْكَ وَحْيُهُ وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدْنِى عِلْماً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And be not in haste with the Qur&#8217;an before its revelation is completed to you, and say: &#8220;My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.&#8221;) (20:114) Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is for Us to collect it) meaning, `in your chest.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقُرْءَانَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and that it be recited.) meaning, `that you recite it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَـهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when We have recited it to you,) meaning, `when the angel has recited it to you from Allah,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْءَانَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then follow its recitation.) meaning, `listen to it then recite it as he taught you to recite it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then it is for Us to make it clear.) meaning, `after memorizing it and reciting it, We will explain it to you, clarify it and inspire you with its meaning according to what We intended and legislated.&#8217; Imam Ahmad recorded from Ibn `Abbas that he said that the Messenger of Allah used to struggle very hard to grasp the revelation and he used to move his lips (rapidly with the recitation). The narrator, Sa`id, then said, &#8220;Ibn `Abbas said to me, `I will move my lips like the Messenger of Allah used to move his lips (in order to show you).&#8221;&#8217; Then, the subnarrator said, &#8220;And Sa`id said to me, `I will move my lips like I saw Ibn `Abbas moving his lips (in order to show you).&#8221;&#8217; Then Allah revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُحَرِّكْ بِهِ لِسَانَكَ لِتَعْجَلَ بِهِ &#8211; إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا جَمْعَهُ وَقُرْءَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Move not your tongue concerning to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it and that it be recited.) Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;This means He will collect it in his chest to recite it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا قَرَأْنَـهُ فَاتَّبِعْ قُرْءَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when We have recited it to you, then follow its recitation.) meaning, listen to it and pay attention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا بَيَانَهُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then it is for Us to make it clear (to you).) So after this, when Jibril would leave, he would recite it as Jibril had taught him to recite it.&#8221; This has also been recorded by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. Al-Bukhari&#8217;s wording says, &#8220;So whenever Jibril would come to him he would be silent, and when Jibril had left he would recite it just as Allah, the Mighty and Sublime had promised him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Cause of rejecting the Day of Judgement is Love of the World and Heedlessness of the Hereafter</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ بَلْ تُحِبُّونَ الْعَاجِلَةَ &#8211; وَتَذَرُونَ الاٌّخِرَةَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But no! Rather you love the present life of this world. And neglect the Hereafter.) meaning, the only thing that has caused them to reject the Day of Judgement and oppose the true revelation and the Mighty Qur&#8217;an Allah revealed to His Messenger is that their only concern is the present worldly life. They are preoccupied and distracted from the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Seeing Allah in the Hereafter</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some faces that Day shall be Nadirah.) which comes from the word Nadarah, which means splendid, radiant, glowing, delighted with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلَى رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Looking at their Lord.) meaning, they will see Him with their very eyes. This is just as was recorded by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّكُمْ سَتَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ عِيَانًا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, you all will see your Lord with your own eyes.) The believers seeing Allah in the abode of the Hereafter has been confirmed in the authentic Hadiths from numerous routes of transmission with the scholars of Hadith. It is not possible to deny this or refuse it. Examples would be the Hadiths of Abu Sa`id and Abu Hurayrah, and they are both recorded in the Two Sahihs. They both mentioned that some people said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Will we see our Lord on the Day of Judgement&#8221; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«هَلْ تُضَارُّونَ فِي رُؤْيَةِ الشَّمْسِ وَالْقَمَرِ لَيْسَ دُونَهُمَا سَحَابٌ؟»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Are you harmed by seeing the sun and the moon when there are no clouds beneath them) They replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«فَإِنَّكُمْ تَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَذَلِك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then you will surely see your Lord like that.) In the Two Sahihs it is recorded from Jabir that he said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah looked at the moon on a night when it was full, and he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّكُمْ تَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ هَذَا الْقَمَرَ، فَإِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَنْ لَا تُغْلَبُوا عَلَى صَلَاةٍ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَلَا قَبْلَ غُرُوبِهَا، فَافْعَلُوا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, you will see your Lord just as you see this moon! So if you are able to avoid missing a prayer before the rising of the sun (Fajr prayer) or before its setting (`Asr prayer) then do so.)&#8221; Among the Hadiths, which Muslim was alone in recording, is a narration from Suhayb that the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ قَالَ يَقُولُ اللهُ تَعَالى: تُرِيدُونَ شَيْئًا أَزِيدُكُمْ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ: أَلَمْ تُبَيِّضْ وُجُوهَنَا؟ أَلَمْ تُدْخِلْنَا الْجَنَّةَ وَتُنَجِّنَا مِنَ النَّارِ؟ قَالَ: فَيَكْشِفُ الْحِجَابَ، فَمَا أُعْطُوا شَيْئًا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِمْ مِنَ النَّظَرِ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ، وَهِيَ الزِّيَادَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the people of Paradise enter the Paradise, Allah will say, `Do you want me to give you anything extra&#8217; They will say, `Haven&#8217;t you whitened our faces Haven&#8217;t you entered us into Paradise and saved us from the Fire&#8217; Then He will remove the veil and they will not be given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord, and that will be the extra (Ziyadah).) Then he recited this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُواْ الْحُسْنَى وَزِيَادَةٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For those who have done good is the best and extra (Ziyadah).) (10:26) Also among the Hadiths, which Muslim was alone in recording, is the Hadith of Jabir in which the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّ اللهَ يَتَجَلَّى لِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ يَضْحَك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah will appear before the believers while He is laughing.) This will take place on the open plains of the Resurrection place. In some of these Hadiths, it mentions that the believers will be looking at their Lord on the open plains and some mention that this will occur in the Gardens of Paradise. If it were not due to fear of taking up a lot of space, we would present all of these Hadiths with their routes of transmission and wordings from those that are in the Sahih collections, the collections of good narrations, the Musnad collections and the Sunan collections. However, we have mentioned this in separate places in this Tafsir, and Allah is the Giver of success. This issue is something that the Companions, the Successors and the Salaf of this nation have agreed upon, and all praise is due to Allah. It is something that is agreed upon between the Imams of Islam and the guides of all mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Blackening of the Faces of the Disobedient People on the Day of Judgement</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ بَاسِرَةٌ &#8211; تَظُنُّ أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And some faces that Day will be Basirah. Thinking that some calamity is about to fall on them.) These are the faces of the sinners that will be Basirah on the Day of Judgement. Qatadah said, &#8220;This means gloomy.&#8221; As-Suddi said, &#8220;Their (the faces) color will change.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[تَظُنُّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Thinking) meaning, they will be certain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَن يُفْعَلَ بِهَا فَاقِرَةٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that some calamity is about to fall on them.) Mujahid said, &#8220;A disaster.&#8221; Qatadah said, &#8220;An evil.&#8221; As-Suddi said, &#8220;They will be certain that they are going to be destroyed.&#8221; Ibn Zayd said, &#8220;They will think that they are going to enter into the Hellfire.&#8221; This situation is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يَوْمَ تَبْيَضُّ وُجُوهٌ وَتَسْوَدُّ وُجُوهٌ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On the Day when some faces will become white and some faces will become black.) (3:106) Similarly Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ مُّسْفِرَةٌ &#8211; ضَـحِكَةٌ مُّسْتَبْشِرَةٌ &#8211; وَوُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَلَيْهَا غَبَرَةٌ &#8211; تَرْهَقُهَا قَتَرَةٌ &#8211; أُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْكَفَرَةُ الْفَجَرَةُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some faces that Day will be bright. Laughing, rejoicing at the good news. And other faces, that Day will be dust-stained; darkness will cover them, such will be the disbelieving, wicked.) (80:38-42) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ خَـشِعَةٌ &#8211; عَامِلَةٌ نَّاصِبَةٌ &#8211; تَصْلَى نَاراً حَامِيَةً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some faces, that Day will be humiliated. Laboring, weary. They will enter in the hot blazing Fire.) (88:2-4) until Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاعِمَةٌ &#8211; لِّسَعْيِهَا رَاضِيَةٌ فِى جَنَّةٍ عَالِيَةٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((Other) faces that Day will be joyful. Happy with their endeavor. In a lofty Paradise.) (88:8-10) And there are other similar Ayat and discussions (in the Qur&#8217;an).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ &#8211; وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ &#8211; وَظَنَّ أَنَّهُ الْفِرَاقُ &#8211; وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ &#8211; إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمَسَاقُ &#8211; فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى &#8211; وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى &#8211; ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّى &#8211; أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى &#8211; أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِىٍّ يُمْنَى &#8211; ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّى &#8211; فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالاٍّنثَى &#8211; أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(26. Nay, when it reaches to the collarbones.) (27. And it will be said: &#8220;Who can cure him&#8221;) (28. And he will think that it was the parting;) (29. And one shank will be joined with another shank.) (30. The drive will be on that Day to your Lord!) (31. So, he neither believed nor prayed!) (32. But on the contrary, he denied and turned away!) (33. Then he walked in conceit to his family admiring himself!) (34. Woe to you! And then woe to you!) (35. Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) (36. Does man think that he will be left neglected) (37. Was he not a Nutfah of semen emitted) (38. Then he became an `Alaqah; then shaped and fashioned in due proportion.) (39. And made of him two sexes, male and female.) (40. Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Certainty will occur at the Time of Death Allah informs of the condition at the time of death and what terrors it contains.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah make us firm at that time with the Firm Statement. Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, when it reaches to the collarbones.) If we make the word &#8220;Kalla&#8221; negative, then this Ayah means, `O son of Adam! You are not able to deny that which I informed you of at that time (death). This will become something witnessed by you with your own eyes.&#8217; If we consider the word &#8220;Kalla&#8221; to be a word of affirmation, then this would be the most obvious meaning. In this case it would mean that it is certainly true when the soul reaches the collarbones &#8211; meaning, `your soul will be pulled out of your body and it will reach your collarbones.&#8217; This is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلَوْلاَ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ الْحُلْقُومَ &#8211; وَأَنتُمْ حِينَئِذٍ تَنظُرُونَ &#8211; وَنَحْنُ أَقْرَبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنكُمْ وَلَـكِن لاَّ تُبْصِرُونَ &#8211; فَلَوْلاَ إِن كُنتُمْ غَيْرَ مَدِينِينَ &#8211; تَرْجِعُونَهَآ إِن كُنتُمْ صَـدِقِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then why do you not (intervene) when (the soul of the dying person) reaches the throat And you at the moment are looking on, but We are nearer to him than you, but you see not, then why do you not if you are exempt from the reckoning and recompense, bring back the soul, if your are truthful) (56:83-87) Thus, Allah similarly says here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كَلاَّ إِذَا بَلَغَتِ التَّرَاقِىَ &#8211; وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, when it reaches to the collarbones. And it will be said: &#8220;Who can cure him) `Ikrimah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said, &#8220;Meaning, who is the person who recites divine prayers of healing so that he may come and cure him&#8221; Abu Qilabah made a similar statement when he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَقِيلَ مَنْ رَاقٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And it will be said: &#8220;Who can cure him) &#8220;This means who is the doctor that can cure him&#8221; Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd all have similar statements. `Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said concerning the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And one shank will be joined with another shank.) &#8220;This is the last day of the days of this world and the first day of the days of the Hereafter. So there will be hardships that will meet (more) hardships, except for he whom Allah has mercy upon.&#8221; `Ikrimah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And one shank will be joined with another shank.) &#8220;The great matter (will be joined) with the great matter.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;A test (will be joined) with a test.&#8221; Al-Hasan Al-Basri said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَالْتَفَّتِ السَّاقُ بِالسَّاقِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And one shank will be joined with another shank. ) &#8220;These are your two shins when they are bound together.&#8221; In another narration from him (Al-Hasan) he said, &#8220;His two legs have died and they will not carry him while he used to walk around on them.&#8221; Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلَى رَبِّكَ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْمَسَاقُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The drive will be on that Day to your Lord!) meaning, the place of return and the destination. This is that the soul ascends into the heavens and Allah says, &#8220;Return my servant to the earth, for verily, I have created them from it, I return them into it, and from it I will bring them out at another time.&#8221; This has been reported in the lengthy Hadith of Al-Bara&#8217;. Verily, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ وَيُرْسِلُ عَلَيْكُم حَفَظَةً حَتَّى إِذَا جَآءَ أَحَدَكُمُ الْمَوْتُ تَوَفَّتْهُ رُسُلُنَا وَهُمْ لاَ يُفَرِّطُونَ &#8211; ثُمَّ رُدُّواْ إِلَى اللَّهِ مَوْلَـهُمُ الْحَقِّ أَلاَ لَهُ الْحُكْمُ وَهُوَ أَسْرَعُ الْحَـسِبِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He is the Irresistible (Supreme), over His servants, and He sends guardians over you, until when death approaches one of you, Our messengers take his soul, and they never neglect their duty. Then they are returned to Allah, their True Master. Surely, for Him is the judgement and He is the swiftest in taking account.) (6:61,62)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Mentioning the Case of the Denier</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى &#8211; وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So, he neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he denied and turned away!) This is to inform about the disbeliever who used to deny the truth in his heart in the abode of this worldly life, and he used to turn away from acting according to its way. Thus, there is no good in him, internally or externally. Therefore, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَلاَ صَدَّقَ وَلاَ صَلَّى &#8211; وَلَـكِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّى &#8211; ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So he neither believed nor prayed! But on the contrary, he denied and turned away! Then he walked in conceit (full pride) to his family admiring himself!)(75:31-33) meaning, stubborn, cruel, obstinate, wanton, lazy, having no concern and doing no deeds. This is similar to Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَإِذَا انقَلَبُواْ إِلَى أَهْلِهِمْ انقَلَبُواْ فَكِهِينَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they returned to their own people, they would return jesting.) (83:31) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّهُ كَانَ فِى أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُوراً &#8211; إِنَّهُ ظَنَّ أَن لَّن يَحُورَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, he was among his people in joy! Verily, he thought that he would never come back (to Us)!) (84:13,14) meaning, return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بَلَى إِنَّ رَبَّهُ كَانَ بِهِ بَصِيراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Yes! Verily, his Lord has been ever beholding him!) (84:15) Ad-Dahhak reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ ذَهَبَ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ يَتَمَطَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then he walked in conceit to his family admiring himself!) &#8220;This means arrogantly.&#8221; Qatadah and Zayd bin Aslam both said, &#8220;Strutting.&#8221; Allah then says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) This is a definite warning and threat from Allah to those who disbelieve in Him and strut about when walking. This means, `you deserve to strut like this while you have disbelieved in your Creator and Maker.&#8217; This is what is commonly said in this type of situation in order to mock and intimidate (someone). This is as Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ذُقْ إِنَّكَ أَنتَ الْعَزِيزُ الْكَرِيمُ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Taste you (this)! Verily you were (pretending to be) the mighty, the generous!) (44:49) Similarly, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كُلُواْ وَتَمَتَّعُواْ قَلِيلاً إِنَّكُمْ مُّجْرِمُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Eat and enjoy yourselves for a little. Verily, you are criminals.) (77:46) Allah also says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَاعْبُدُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ مِّن دُونِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So worship what you like besides Him.) (39:15) And like Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اعْمَلُواْ مَا شِئْتُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do what you will.) (41:40) There are other examples of this as well. Abu `Abdur-Rahman An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded from Sa`id bin Jubayr that he said, &#8220;I mentioned to Ibn `Abbas,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) He (Ibn `Abbas) replied, `The Messenger of Allah said this to Abu Jahl, then Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, revealed this Ayah.&#8221;&#8217; Ibn Abi Hatim recorded from Qatadah that he said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى &#8211; ثُمَّ أَوْلَى لَكَ فَأَوْلَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Woe to you! And then woe to you! Again, woe to you! And then woe to you!) &#8220;It is a threat followed by a threat, just as you hear it. They claim that the Prophet of Allah grabbed the clothes of the enemy of Allah, Abu Jahl. The Prophet then said to him, `Woe to you! And then (again) woe to you! Again woe to you! And then (again) woe to you!&#8217; At this the enemy of Allah, Abu Jahl, said, `Are you threatening me, O Muhammad By Allah! Neither you nor your Lord are able to do anything, and verily, I am the mightiest person walking between its (Makkah&#8217;s) two mountains.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Man will not be left neglected</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَيَحْسَبُ الإِنسَـنُ أَن يُتْرَكَ سُدًى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Does man think that he will be left neglected) As-Suddi said, &#8220;Meaning not resurrected.&#8221; Mujahid, Ash-Shafi`i and `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam, all said, &#8220;Meaning, he will not be commanded and prohibited.&#8221; Apparently the Ayah includes both meanings. This means that he will not be left neglected in this worldly life, without being commanded and prohibited. He also will not be left neglected in his grave unattended to without being resurrected. Rather he will be commanded and prohibited in this life, and gathered back to Allah in the abode of the Hereafter. The intent here is to affirm the existence of the abode of the final return and to refute whoever rejects it from the people of deviance, ignorance and stubbornness. Thus, Allah uses the beginning of creation as a proof for the repetition of the creation in His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَمْ يَكُ نُطْفَةً مِّن مَّنِىٍّ يُمْنَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Was he not a Nutfah of semen emitted) meaning, was not man a weak drop of sperm from a despised fluid known as semen, that is emitted from the loins into the wombs</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ثُمَّ كَانَ عَلَقَةً فَخَلَقَ فَسَوَّى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then he became an `Alaqah; then shaped and fashioned in due proportion.) meaning, he became a clot, then a lump of flesh, then he was formed and the soul was blown into him. Then he became a perfect creation with healthy limbs, as either a male or a female by the permission and decree of Allah. Thus, Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَجَعَلَ مِنْهُ الزَّوْجَيْنِ الذَّكَرَ وَالاٍّنثَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And made of him two sexes, male and female.) Then Allah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead) meaning, is not He Who made this perfect creation from this weak drop of sperm able to repeat that as He did originally And &#8220;the ability to repeat that&#8221; either refers to the origination only, or to both that and the process of perfecting it, according to two different views, as in Allah&#8217;s saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَهُوَ الَّذِى يَبْدَأُ الْخَلْقَ ثُمَّ يُعِيدُهُ وَهُوَ أَهْوَنُ عَلَيْهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And He it is Who originates the creation, then He will repeat it; this is easier for Him.) (30:27) The first view is more popular, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Supplication upon completing this Surah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud recorded from Musa bin Abi `A&#8217;ishah that he said, &#8220;A man used to pray on top of his house and whenever he recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَيْسَ ذَلِكَ بِقَـدِرٍ عَلَى أَن يُحْيِىَ الْمَوْتَى ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Is it not so then, that He would be able to give life to the dead) he would say, `Glory to You, of course.&#8217; So the people asked him about that and he said, `I heard it from the Messenger of Allah .&#8221;&#8217; Abu Dawud was alone in transmitting this Hadith and he did not mention who this Companion was, but there is no harm in that.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Last two Ayah of Surat ul Baqarah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (Muhammad ) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. They say, &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers&#8221; &#8211; and they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey. (We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all).&#8221; (Al-Baqarah 2:285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh burdens not a person beyond his scope. He gets reward for that (good) which he has earned, and he is punished for that (evil) which he has earned. &#8220;Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error, our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians); our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Pardon us and grant us Forgiveness. Have mercy on us. You are our Maulâ (Patron, Suppor-ter and Protector, etc.) and give us victory over the disbelieving people.&#8221; (Al-Baqarah 2:286)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Virtue of These Ayah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Abbas &#8221; who said:<br />
&#8220;While Jibra&#8217;eel (Gibrael) &#8221; `May Peace be upon him&#8217; was sitting with the Prophet !, he heard the opening of a gate above him. So he raised his head and said: `This is a gate from the shies that has opened today, which has never opened before this day.&#8217; So an angel descended from it (the gate). So he Jibra&#8217;eel &#8221; said: &#8220;This is an angel that has descended to the earth, which has never descended except today. He gave Salam and said: &#8216;Receive glad tidings [Oh Muhammad ! with two lights which have been given to you, that have never been given to a Prophet before you: The Opening of the Book (i.e. Surat Al- Fatihah) and the end of Surat Al-Baqarah. Never do you read a letter from either of the two (Surahs) except that you are given it.( Which means that you are given its reward (i.e. the reward of recitation)) (Reported by Muslim) (Taken from Mukhtasar Sahih Muslim with Shaykh AI-Albani&#8217;s editing, p.553, Hadith no. 2094.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Each one believes in Allah, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say,) &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, each of the believers believes that Allah is the One and Only and the Sustainer, there is no deity worthy of worship except Him and there is no Lord except Him. The believers also believe in all Allah&#8217;s Prophets and Messengers, in the Books that were revealed from heaven to the Messengers and Prophets, who are indeed the servants of Allah. Further, the believers do not differentiate between any of the Prophets, such as, believing in some of them and rejecting others. Rather, all of Allah&#8217;s Prophets and Messengers are, to the believers, truthful, righteous, and they were each guided to the path of righteousness, even when some of them bring what abrogates the Law of some others by Allah&#8217;s leave. Later on, the Law of Muhammad, the Final Prophet and Messenger from Allah, abrogated all the laws of the Prophets before him. So the Last Hour will commence while Muhammad&#8217;s Law remains the only valid Law, and all the while a group of his Ummah will always be on the path of truth, apparent and dominant. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they say, &#8220;We hear, and we obey&#8221;) means, we heard Your statement, O our Lord, comprehended and implemented it, and adhered to its implications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((We seek) Your forgiveness, our Lord) contains a plea and supplication for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness, mercy and kindness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope) means, Allah does not ask a soul what is beyond its ability. This only demonstrates Allah&#8217;s kindness, compassion and generosity towards His creation. This Ayah is the Ayah that abrogated the Ayah that worried the Companions, that is, Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whether you disclose what is in yourselves or conceal it, Allah will call you to account for it.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that although Allah will question His servants and judge them, He will only punish for what one is able to protect himself from. As for what one cannot protect himself from, such as what one says to himself &#8211; or passing thoughts &#8211; they will not be punished for that. We should state here that to dislike the evil thoughts that cross one&#8217;s mind is a part of faith. Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He gets reward for that which he has earned) of good,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And he is punished for that which he has earned) of evil, that is, concerning the acts that one is responsible for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said, [mentioning what the believers said] while directing His servants to supplicate to Him, all the while promising them that He will answer their supplication:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;Our Lord! Push us not if we forget or fall into error,&#8221;) meaning, &#8220;If we forgot an obligation or fell into a prohibition, or made an error while ignorant of its ruling.&#8221; We mentioned the Hadith by Abu Hurayrah, that Muslim collected, wherein Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication).&#8221; There is also the Hadith by Ibn `Abbas that Allah said, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden like that which You did lay on those before us (Jews and Christians),) means, &#8220;Even if we were able to perform them, do not require us to perform the difficult deeds as You required the previous nations before us, such as the burdens that were placed on them. You sent Your Prophet Muhammad , the Prophet of mercy, to abrogate these burdens through the Law that You revealed to him, the Hanifi (Islamic Monotheism), easy religion.&#8221; Muslim recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication).&#8221; Ibn `Abbas narrated that the Messenger of Allah said that Allah said, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication).&#8221; There is the Hadith recorded through various chains of narration that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I was sent with the easy Hanifiyyah way.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear) </strong>of obligations, hardships and afflictions, do not make us bear what we cannot bear of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Our Lord! Put not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We mentioned that Allah said, &#8220;I shall (accept your supplication)&#8221; in one narration, and, &#8220;I did (accept your supplication),&#8221; in another narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Pardon us) meaning, between us and You regarding what You know of our shortcomings and errors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And grant us forgiveness) concerning what is between us and Your servants. So do not expose our errors and evil deeds to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have mercy on us) in what will come thereafter. Therefore, do not allow us to fall into another error. They say that those who commit error need three things: Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for what is between Him and them, that He conceals these errors from His other servants, and thus does not expose them before the servants, and that He grants them immunity from further error.&#8221; We mentioned before that Allah answered these pleas, &#8220;I shall,&#8221; in one narration and, &#8220;I did,&#8221; in another narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You are our Mawla) meaning, You are our supporter and helper, our trust is in You, You are sought for each and every type of help and our total reliance is on You. There is no power or strength except from You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And give us victory over the disbelieving people) those who rejected Your religion, denied Your Oneness, refused the Message of Your Prophet , worshipped other than You and associated others in Your worship. Give us victory and make us prevail above them in this and the Hereafter. Allah said, &#8220;I shall,&#8221; in one narration, and, &#8220;I did,&#8221; in the Hadith that Muslim collected from Ibn `Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Ibn Jarir recorded that Abu Ishaq said that whenever Mu`adh would finish reciting this Surah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And give us victory over the disbelieving people), he would say &#8220;Amin.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ar-Raheeq al-Makhtoom</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On their way back to Madinah, at a large sand hill, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam divided the spoils equally among the fighters after he had taken Al-Khums (one-fifth). When they reached As-Safra&#8217;, he ordered that two of the prisoners should be killed. They were An-Nadr bin Al-Harith and &#8216;Uqbah bin Abi Muait, because they had persecuted the Muslims in Makkah, and harboured deep hatred towards Allaah and His Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam . In a nutshell, they were criminals of war in modern terminology, and their execution was an awesome lesson to oppressors. &#8216;Uqbah forgot his pride and cried out, &#8220;Who will look after my children O Messenger of Allaah?&#8221; The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam answered, &#8220;The Fire (of Hell).&#8221; Did &#8216;Uqbah not remember the day when he had thrown the entrails of a sheep onto the head of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam while he was prostrating himself in prayer, and Fatimah had come and washed it off him? He had also strangled the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam with his cloak if it had not been for Abu Bakr to intervene and release the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam . The heads of both criminals were struck off by Alee bin Abi TAleeb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam exhorted the Muslims to treat the prisoners so well to such an extent that the captors used to give the captives their bread (the more valued part of the meal) and keep the dates for themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prisoners of war constituted a problem awaiting resolution because it was a new phenomenon in the history of Islaam. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam consulted Abu Bakr and Umar bin Al-Khattab as to what he should do with the prisoners. Abu Bakr suggested that he should ransom them, explaining this by saying: &#8220;They are after all our relatives, and this money would give us strength against the disbelievers, moreover, Allaah could guide them to Islaam.&#8221; Umar advised killing them, saying, &#8220;They are the leaders of Kufr (disbelief).&#8221; The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam preferred Abu Bakr&#8217;s suggestion to that of Umar&#8217;s. The following day, Umar called on the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and Abu Bakr to see them weeping. He showed extreme astonishment and inquired about the situation so that he might weep if it was worth weeping for, or else he would feign weeping.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;It is not for a Prophet that he should have prisoners of war (and free them with ransom) until he had made a great slaughter (among his enemies) in the land. You desire the good of this world (i.e. the money of ransom for freeing the captives), but Allaah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise. Were it not a previous ordainment from Allaah, a severe torment would have touched you for what you took.&#8221;</strong> [Qur&#8217;aan 8:67-68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The previous Divine ordainment went as follows,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity (i.e. free them without ransom) or ransom.&#8221; </strong> [Qur&#8217;aan 47:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which included an area providing permission to take ransom, that is why no penalty was imposed. They were rebuked only for taking prisoners before subduing all the land of disbelief. Apart from this, the polytheists taken to Madinah were not only prisoners of war but rather archcriminals of war whom modern war penal law brings to justice to receive their due sentence of death or prison for life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ransom for the prisoners ranged between 4000 and 1000 Dirhams in accordance with the captive&#8217;s financial situation. Another form of ransom assumed an educational dimension; most of the Makkans, unlike the Madinese, were literate and so each prisoner who could not afford the ransom was entrusted with ten children to teach them the art of writing and reading. Once the child had been proficient enough, the instructor would be set free. Another clan of prisoners were released unransomed on grounds of being hard up. Zainab, the daughter of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , paid the ransom of her husband Abul-&#8216;As with a necklace. The Muslims released her prisoner and returned the necklace in deference to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam but on condition that Abul-&#8216;As allow Zainab to migrate to Madinah, which he actually did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In captivity, there was also an eloquent orator called Suhail bin &#8216;Amr. Umar suggested that they pull out his front teeth to disable him from speaking, but the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam turned down his suggestion for fear Quraish should retAleeate in the same manner on one hand, and on the other for fear of Allaah&#8217;s wrath on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;d bin An-Nu&#8217;man, a lesser pilgrim detained in Makkah, was released in return for setting Abu Sufyan&#8217;s son, a captive, free.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Story of the 600-700 Jews Beheaded by the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam at Bani Quraiza in 5 AH</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bani Quraiza was a tribe of Jews in a district of Madinah that betrayed the Muslims and sided with the enemy during the Battle of Ahzaab (also known as the Battle of the Confederates and the Battle of the Trench). The Sealed Nectar describes what happened to them immediately after the Battle of Ahzaab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Archangel Gabriel, on the very day the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam came back to Madinah after the previous battle, and while he was washing in Umm Salama&#8217;s house, visited him asking that he should unsheathe his sword and head for the habitation of the seditious Banu Quraiza and fight them. Gabriel noted that he with a procession of angels would go ahead to shake their forts and cast fear in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , immediately summoned the prayer caller and ordered him to announce fresh hostilities against Banu Quraiza, institued Ibn Umm Maktum as a ruler of Madinah, and entrusted the banner of war to Alee bin Abi TAleeb who marched towards the appointed target and came close enough to hear the Jews abusing the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , who on his part set out at the head of three thousand infantry men and thirty horsemen of Ansar (Helpers) and Muhajireen (Emigrants). On their way to encounter the enemy, the afternoon prayer was due. Some Muslims refused to observe it until they had defeated the enemy, while others offered it in its proper time, as usual. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam objected to neither. When they reached the habitations of Banu Quraiza, they laid tight siege to their forts. Seeing this terrible situation they were in, the chief of the Jews Ka&#8217;b bin Asad offered them three alternatives: to embrace Islaam, and consequently their life, wealth, women and children would be in full security, and reminded them that such behaviour would not be incongruous with what they had read in their books about the veracity of Muhammad&#8217;s Prophethood; to kill their children and women and then challenge the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and his followers to the sword to either exterminate the Muslims or be exterminated, or as a third possibility to take Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and his people by surprise on Saturday &#8211; a day mutually understood to witness no fighting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">None of those alternatives appealed them, so their chief, angrily and indignantly, turned to them saying: &#8220;You have never been decisive in decision-making since you were born.&#8221; The gloomy future already visible, they made contacts with some Muslims, who had maintained good relation with them, in order to learn about their fate in the light of the current circumstances. They requested that Abu Lubaba be despatched to them for advice. On his arrival, the men began to implore, women and children to cry desperately. In answer to their demand for advice he pointed to his throat saying it was homicide awaiting them. He then immediately reAleezed that he had betrayed the Prophet&#8217;s trust, so he headed directly for the mosque in Madinah and tied himself to a wooden tall pole swearing that no one would untie him save the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , and added that he would never enter the habitation of Banu Quraiza in recompense for the deadly mistake he made. When the Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was informed of this incident, he said, &#8221; I would have begged Allaah to forgive him if he had asked me, but since he had tied himself out of his own free will, then it was Allaah Who would turn to him in forgiveness.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews of Banu Quraiza could have endured the siege much longer because food and water were plentifully available and their strongholds were greatly fortified, whereas the Muslims were in the wild bare land suffering a lot from cold and hunger, let alone too much fatigue consequent on endless warfare operations that had started even before the battle of Confederates. Nevertheless, this was a battle of nerves, for Allaah had cast fear in the the Jews&#8217; hearts, and their morale had almost collapsed especially when two Muslim heroes, Alee bin Abi TAleeb and Az-Zubair bin &#8216;Awwam proceeded with Alee swearing that he would never stop until he had either stormed their garrisons or been martyred like Hamza (a former Muslim martyr).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the light of this reluctance, they had nothing except to comply with the Messenger&#8217;s judgement. The Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam ordered that the men should be handcuffed, and this was done under the supervision of Muhammad bin Salamah Al-Ansari while the women and children were isolated in confinement. Thereupon Al-Aws tribe interceded begging the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam to be lenient toward them. He suggested that Sa&#8217;d bin Mu&#8217;adh, a former ally, be deputed to give verdict about them, and they agreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;d meanwhile stayed behind in Madinah due to a serious wound he sustained in the Confederates Battle. He was summoned and brought on a donkey. On his way to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam , the Jews used to exhort him to be lenient in his judgement on account of former friendship. Sa&#8217;d remained silent but when they persisted he uttered: &#8220;It is time for Sa&#8217;d not to be afraid of the blame of the blamers.&#8221; On hearing this decisive attitude, some of them returned to Madinah waiting for a desperate doom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On arrival, he Aleeghted with the help of some men. He was informed that the Jews had agreed to accept his verdict about them. He immediately wondered if his judgement would pass on all the people present, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam included, turning his face away in honour of him. The reply was positive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He decided that all the able-bodied male persons belonging to the tribe should be killed, women and children taken prisoners and their wealth divided among the Muslim fighters. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam accepted his judgement saying that Sa&#8217;d had adjudged by the Command of Allaah. In fact, the Jews deserved that severe punitive action for the ugly treachery they had harboured against Islaam, and the large arsenal they have amassed and which consisted of one thousand and five hundred swords, two thousand spears, three hundred armours and five hundred shields, all of which went into the hands of the Muslims. Trenches were dug in the bazaar of Madinah and a number of Jews between six and seven hundred were beheaded therein. Hot beds of intrigue and treachery were thus exterminated once and for all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Huyai, a chief criminal of war, a devil of Bani Nadir and Safiyah&#8217;s father, had joined the ranks of Banu Quraiza when Quraish and Ghatfan defected, was admitted into the audience of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam with his hands tied to his neck with a rope. In audacious defiance, he declared obstinate enmity to the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam but admitted that Allaah&#8217;s Will was to be fulfilled and added that he was resigned to his fate. He was ordered to sit down, and was beheaded on the spot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Only one woman of the Jews was killed because she had killed a Muslim warrior by flinging a grinding stone upon him. A few elements of the enemy embraced Islaam and their lives, wealth and children were spared. As for the spoils of the war, the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam divided them, after putting a fifth aside, in accordance with Allaah&#8217;s injunctions. Three shares went to the horseman and one to the infantry fighter. Women captives were sent to Najd to be bartered with horses and weaponry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the war with Banu Quraiza had been settled and they had been defeated, Sa&#8217;d bin Mu&#8217;adh&#8217;s wish was gratified and he gave his last breath. In response to his supplication &#8216;Aishah narrated, Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s wounds began to bleed from the front part of his neck while he was in his tent which the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam had pitched for him in the mosque so that he would be in close proximity in order to inquire about and watch his well-being closely. The people were not scared except when the blood flowed towards them, and in the Mosque along with Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s tent, there was the tent of Banu Ghifar. They said: O people of the tent, what is it that is coming to us from you? Lo! it was Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s wound that was bleeding and he died thereon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir narrated that the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam had said: <em> &#8220;The Throne of the Compassionate shook for the death of Sa&#8217;d bin Mu&#8217;adh.&#8221;</em> When his bier was carried, At-Tirmidhi said: The hypocrites alleged it was too light. The Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam retorted: <em> &#8220;The angels are carrying him.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the process of the sieze laid to Banu Quraiza, one man of the Muslims, Khallad bin Suwaid was killed when a women of the Jews dropped the grinding stone on him, and another, Abu Sinan bin Mihsan, the brother of &#8216;Ukasha, died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Lubaba stayed tied for six nights. His wife used to untie him at prayer times and then he tied himself again to the pole. One early morning, Allaah the All-Forgiving revealed a verse to the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam to the effect that Allaah had turned to Abu Lubaba with forgiveness. The Muslims rushed to release him but he insisted that the Messenger of Allaah sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam himself do it. And this was done shortly before the morning prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Military Expedition took place in the month of Dhul Qa&#8217;dah in the year five Hijri (5AH), and the siege of Banu Quraiza&#8217;s forts lasted for 25 days. The Chapter of Confederates (Qur&#8217;aan, Surah 33)was revealed containing Allaah&#8217;s Words concerning the basic issues relating to the believers and hypocrites during the battle of the Confederates, and the consequences of the treachery and breaching of covenants by the Jews.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation of the Meanings of the Names of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) &#8211; Taken from &#8216;Zaad al-Ma`aad&#8217; (1/88-97) of ibn al-Qayyim, rahimahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) has been called by many names and titles in the Qur`aan and Sunnah, each one of them describing a special quality of this exalted personality. And in understanding them and reflecting upon them, we can, by the permission of Allaah, increase in our love and following of the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). This discussion is taken from &#8216;Zaad al-Ma`aad&#8217; (1/88-97) of ibn al-Qayyim, rahimahullaah, summarised.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The names of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) are of two types:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Those names that are specific to him and none of the Messengers before him had these names, like Muhammad, Ahmad, al-Aaqib, al-Haashir, al-Muqaffee, Nabi al-Malhama.</li>
<li>Those names and qualities that are not specific to him, and were shared by the Messengers before him, but are found in him in the most complete and perfect forms. Like: Messenger of Allaah, His Prophet, His Servant, Prophet of Mercy etc.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What follows is an explanation of some of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Muhammad</strong>: is a passive participle, whosoever is praised, possessing many praiseworthy qualities then he is muhammad. And Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) is praised more than any other person, and this is why &#8211; and Allaah knows best &#8211; he was called by this name in the Torah, due to the many praiseworthy qualities which he, his religion, and his nation possess such that even Moses wished that he would be from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ahmad</strong>: Derived, as is Muhammad, from the noun hamd (praise). A group of scholars said that it is a passive participle, meaning: his praising of Allaah is more than any other person&#8217;s praise of him, and therefore he is the most deserving of being praised and the first. So in meaning Ahmad is similar to Muhammad except that the distinction is that he is Muhammad due to his possessing many praiseworthy qualities, and he is Ahmad due to his being praised in a more excellent way than the praise of any other. And this is the most complete meaning of this word, and the most extensive in commending him (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also these two names stem from his character, and the praiseworthy qualities specific to him, and it is because of these that he is called Muhammad (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and Ahmad. And he is the one who is praised by the People of the Heaven, the People of the earth, the People of the world and the People of the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Mutawakkil</strong>: (The One who puts his trust in Allaah). In the Saheeh of Bukhaaree from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin Umru who said, &#8220;I read the description of the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) in the Torah: Muhammad is Messenger of Allaah, My servant and Messenger, I have called him al-Mutawakkil. He is neither rude nor harsh and he does not shout in the markets, and he does not return an evil for an evil, rather he overlooks and forgives. And I will not make him to die until I make firm the nation through him, causing them to say: there is none worthy of worship except Allaah.&#8221; {1}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) is the most deserving of this name, because the trust he put in Allaah to establish the religion was a trust unequalled by any other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Maahee</strong>: (the destroyer/effacer). This has been explained in the hadeeth of Jubair bin Mut`am: &#8220;al-Maahee: the one through whom Allaah destroys and effaces unbelief.&#8221; {2}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Disbelief was not destroyed and removed by any single person as completely as was done by the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam). For indeed he was sent, and all of the inhabitants of the earth were in disbelief, except for some remnants of the People of the Book. Consisting of the worshippers of idols, the Jews who had the Anger of Allaah on them, the Christians who had been misguided, the atheist Saabi`een, the worshippers of the stars and the fire, and the philosophers who did not acknowledge the laws of the Prophets. And Allaah effaced them all through His Messenger until He established His religion and made it supreme over all others, and made it spread to the extent that the night and day spreads, and made his call as the rays of the sun in the various lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Haashir</strong>: (the Gatherer). He is the one who gathered and united the people at his feet, and therefore it was as if he had been sent for this purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Aaqib</strong>: (The Last). He is the one who came at the end of the line of Prophets, and there is no prophet after him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Muqaffee</strong>: (). He is the one who was sent with the characteristics of the Messengers that had preceded him, and was their seal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nabi at-Tawba</strong>: (the Prophet of Repentance). It was by him that Allaah opened the door of repentance for the inhabitants of the earth [by them accepting his message], and Allaah forgave them with a forgiveness that was not given to the people before him. {3}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) was the one who sought forgiveness from Allaah the most, to the extent that he would say, &#8220;My Lord forgive me and turn toward me, You are The Oft-Forgiving, The Oft-Returning&#8221; {4}, 100 times in a single sitting. And he used to say, &#8220;O people repent to Allaah, your Lord, for indeed I repent to Allaah 100 times in a day&#8221;. {5}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise the repentance of his (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) nation is more complete than the repentance of all the other nations, the most quickest in being answered, and the easiest to be obtained. For the repentance of the previous nations was of the most difficult matters, to the extent that the repentance for the worshippers of the cow amongst the People of Israa`eel was to kill those worshippers. {6} But as for this nation, then from the Kindness of Allaah to it is that he has made repentance dependant upon sorrow and abstaining (from the sin in question).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nabi al-Malhama</strong>: (The Prophet of Slaughter). He was the one who was sent with Jihaad to the enemies of Allaah, and no prophet before him did Jihaad to the extent that the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) and his nation fought Jihaad. And the like of the large wars that took place between him and the disbelievers were not seen before him. For his nation fought the disbelievers in lands to the ends of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nabi ar-Rahma</strong>: (The Prophet of Mercy). He was the one whom Allaah sent as a Mercy for the universe. And Allaah was Merciful to all the people of the earth through him, both the believers and the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Faatih</strong>: (the opener/conqueror). It was through him that Allaah opened the door of guidance after it had been closed, and opened closed eyes and deaf ears and sealed hearts. And through him Allaah conquered the lands of the disbelievers, and opened the doors of Paradise, and opened through him the ways of acquiring beneficial knowledge and righteous actions. And He opened through him both the doors of this world and the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Ameen</strong>: (the Trustworthy). He is the most deserving out of all creation for this name. For he is the trustee of Allaah of His revelation and religion. And he is the trusted one in the Heaven and in the earth. And this is why he was called al-Ameen before his Prophethood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Basheer</strong>: (the Bearer of glad tidings). He is the bearer of glad tidings for the one who obeys him of reward, and he is the Warner (an-Nadheer) of the one who disobeys him of punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah called him his <strong>servant (Abd)</strong> in many places in His Book for example, &#8216;Blessed be He who revealed the Furqaan to His servant&#8217;. {7}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established that he (sallallaahu ’alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;I am the <strong>Master (sayyid) of the children of Aadam</strong> [on the Day of Judgement] and I am not being arrogant.&#8221; {8}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah called him an <strong>Illuminating Lamp (Siraaj Muneer)</strong>. And all praise is due to Allaah, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From &#8220;Zâd al-Ma&#8217;âd fî Hadyi Khayri-l &#8216;Ibâd&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Prophet&#8217;s <i>Ghazwat</i>, <i> Bu&#8217;uth</i> and <i>Saraya</i> [1] occurred after the <i>Hijrah</i>, within a span of ten years. There were either twenty-seven <i>Ghazwat</i>, or twenty-five, or twenty-nine. The Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> had to fight in nine battles, <i>Badr</i>, <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>, <i>al-Khandaqh</i>, <i>Quraidhah</i>, <i>al-Mustaliqh</i>, <i> Khaybar</i>,<i> al-Fath&#8217;</i> (Conquering of Makkah), <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i> and <i>Tâ&#8217;if</i>. It was said that the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> also fought against <i>Banî an-Nadhîr</i> (a Jewish tribe) and at <i>al-Ghabah</i> and <i>Wadi al-Qura</i>, which was a suburb of Khaybar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <i>Saraya</i> of the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and the armies he sent, they numbered close to sixty. There were seven major battles: <i>Badr</i>, <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>, <i>al-</i><i>Khandaqh</i>, <i>Khaybar</i>, <i>al-Fath&#8217;</i>, <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i> and <i>Tabuk</i>. [2] Several parts of the Qur&#8217;ân mentioned these major <i>Ghazwat</i>. For instance, Sûrah al-Anfâl (chapter 8) was revealed about <i>Ghazwat Badr</i>, while the last part of Sûrah ali-&#8216;Imrân (chapter 3) was about <i>Ghazwat &#8216;Uhud</i>, from Allâh&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And (remember) when you [Muhammad <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i></b><b>] left your household in the morning to post the believers at their stations for the battle&#8221;</b> [3:121],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until just before the end of the Sûrah. The beginning of Sûrah al-Ahzâb (chapter 33) was revealed about the battles of <i>al-Khandaqh</i>, <i>Quraydhah</i> and <i>Khaybar</i>. Sûrah al-&#8216;Hashr (59) was revealed about <i>Banî an-Nadhîr</i>, <i>al-Fath&#8217;</i> (48) about <i>al-&#8216;Hudaibiyyah</i> and the battle of <i>Khaybar</i>. The conquering of Makkah was mentioned indirectly in Sûrah al-Fath&#8217; and directly in Sûrah an-Nasr (110). He <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was wounded during the battle of <i>&#8216;Uhud</i>. [3] The angels fought alongside the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> during the battles of <i>Badr</i> [4] and <i>&#8216;Hunayn</i>. They also descended during the battle of <i>al-Khandaqh</i> [5], where they shook the <i>Mushriks</i> [surrounding <i>Madînah</i>] and defeated them. During that battle, the Prophet <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> threw a handful of sand at the faces of the <i>Mushriks</i> (Polytheists) and they fled [without a fight]. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> won decisively in two battles, <i>Badr</i> and <i>&#8216;Hunain</i>. He used <i>al-Manjaniq</i> (mongonel, or catapult) during on battle, <i>at-Tâ&#8217;if</i>, and took cover behind a trench during <i>Ghazwat al-Khandaqh</i>, also known as <i>Ghazwat al-Ahzâb</i>. Salmân al-Farsî <i>radiallâhu &#8216;anhu</i> suggested that the trench be dug in that battle.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] &#8216;<i>Ghazwat</i>&#8216;, pl. for &#8216;<i>Ghazwah</i>&#8216;, means battles. The battles that the Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> led himself were called, &#8216;<i>Ghazwat</i>&#8216;, whereas the armies and expeditions he sent while remaining behind are called, &#8216;<i>Bu&#8217;uth</i>&#8216;, pl. for, &#8216;<i>Ba&#8217;th</i>&#8216;, and &#8216;<i>Saraya</i>&#8216;, pl. for, &#8216;<i>Sariyyah</i>&#8216;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] All of which are mentioned in detail later on in, <i>Zâd al-Ma&#8217;âd</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Al-Bukhârî (3767) narrated that Sahl bin as-Sa&#8217;idi was asked about how the wound of the Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was treated, and he replied, &#8220;&#8216;Alî used to bring water in his shield and Fâtimah (the Prophet&#8217;s daughter and &#8216;Alî&#8217;s wife) used to wash the blood off his face. Then straw mat was burnt and the wound was filled with it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Al-Bukhârî (3694) narrated that &#8216;Abdullâh ibn &#8216;Abbâs <i>radiallâhu &#8216;anhu</i> said that the Prophet <i> sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said on the day of <i>Badr</i>, &#8220;Here is Jibrîl, holding the head of his horse and wearing war armours.&#8221; Allâh sent the angels to strengthen their hearts of the believers and to aid them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Shaykh &#8216;Irfân said, &#8220;Allâh said in Sûrah al-Ahzâb (33:9), <b> &#8216;O you who believe! Remember Allâh&#8217;s Favour to you, when there came against you hosts, and We sent against them a wind and forces that you saw not [angels during the battle of Al-Ahzâb (the Confederates, <i>Ghazwat al-Khandaq</i> (in 5 AH)]. And Allâh is Ever All-Seer of what you do.&#8217; </b>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Al-Bukhârî (2716) and Muslim (3277) narrated that Allâh&#8217;s Apostle <i>sallallâhu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> asked for Allâh&#8217;s wrath upon the <i> Ahzâb</i>, saying: <i>&#8220;O, Allâh, Revealer of the Holy Book, and the One swift at reckoning! O, Allâh, Defeat the confederates. O, Allâh, Defeat them and shake them.&#8221;</i></p>

Khadijah Bint Khuwailid:</strong> In Makkah — prior to Hijra — the Prophet’s household comprised him (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and his wife Khadijah bint Khuwailid. He was twenty-five and she was forty when they got married. She was the first woman he married. She was the only wife he had till she died. He had sons and daughters with her. None of their sons lived long. They all died. Their daughters were Zainab, Ruqaiya, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zainab was married to her maternal cousin Abu Al-‘As bin Al-Rabi‘ and that was before Al-Hijra. Ruqaiya and Umm Kulthum were both married to ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan &#8211; may Allah be pleased with him &#8211; successively (i.e. he married one after the death of her sister). Fatimah was married to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib; and that was in the period between Badr and Uhud battles. The sons and daughters that Fatimah and ‘Ali had were Al-Hasan, Al-Husain, Zainab and Umm Kulthum.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well-known that the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) was exceptionally authorized to have more than four wives for various reasons. The wives he married were thirteen. Nine of them outlived him. Two died in his lifetime: Khadijah and the Mother of the poor (<em>Umm Al-Masakeen</em>) — Zainab bint Khuzaima, besides two others with whom he did not consummate his marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2. Sawdah bint Zam‘a:</strong> He married her in Shawwal, in the tenth year of Prophethood, a few days after the death of Khadijah. Prior to that, she was married to a paternal cousin of hers called As-Sakran bin ‘Amr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 3. ‘Aishah bint Abu Bakr:</strong> He married her in the eleventh year of Prophethood, a year after his marriage to Sawdah, and two years and five months before Al-Hijra. She was six years old when he married her. However, he did not consummate the marriage with her till Shawwal seven months after Al-Hijra, and that was in Madinah. She was nine then. She was the only virgin he married, and the most beloved creature to him. As a woman she was the most learnèd woman in jurisprudence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 4. Hafsah bint ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab:</strong> She was <em>Aiyim</em> (i.e. husbandless). Her ex-husband was Khunais bin Hudhafa As-Sahmi in the period between Badr and Uhud battles. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in the third year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 5. Zainab bint Khuzaimah:</strong> She was from Bani Hilal bin ‘Amir bin Sa‘sa‘a. Was nicknamed <em>Umm Al-Masakeen</em>, because of her kindness and care towards them. She used to be the wife of ‘Abdullah bin Jahsh, who was martyred at Uhud, was married to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) in the fourth year of Al-Hijra, but she died two or three months after her marriage to the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 6. Umm Salamah Hind bint Abi Omaiyah:</strong> She used to be the wife of Abu Salamah, who died in Jumada Al-Akhir, in the fourth year of Al-Hijra. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in Shawwal of the same year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 7. Zainab bint Jahsh bin Riyab:</strong> She was from Bani Asad bin Khuzaimah and was the Messenger’s paternal cousin. She was married to Zaid bin Haritha — who was then considered son of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . However, Zaid divorced her. Allâh sent down some Qur’ânic verses with this respect:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e., divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage.&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About her, Allâh has sent down some verses of <em>Al-Ahzab</em> Chapter that discussed the adoption of children in detail — anyway we will discuss this later. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in Dhul-Qa‘dah, the fifth year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8. Juwairiyah bint Al-Harith: </strong> Al-Harith was the head of Bani Al-Mustaliq of Khuza‘ah. Juwairiyah was among the booty that fell to the Muslims from Bani Al-Mustaliq. She was a portion of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas’ share. He made her a covenant to set her free at a certain time. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) accomplished the covenant and married her in Sha‘ban in the sixth year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 9. Umm Habibah:</strong> Ramlah, the daughter of Abu Sufyan. She was married to ‘Ubaidullah bin Jahsh. She migrated with him to Abyssinia ( Ethiopia). When ‘Ubaidullah apostatized and became a Christian, she stoodfast to her religion and refused to convert. However ‘Ubaidullah died there in Abyssinia ( Ethiopia). The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) dispatched ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damri with a letter to Negus, the king, asking him for Umm Habibah’s hand — that was in Muharram, in the seventh year of Al-Hijra. Negus agreed and sent her to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) in the company of Sharhabeel bin Hasnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 10. Safiyah bint Huyai bin Akhtab:</strong> From the Children of Israel, she was among the booty taken at Khaibar battle. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) took her for himself. He set her free and married her after that conquest in the seventh year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 11. Maimunah bint Al-Harith:</strong> The daughter of Al-Harith, and the sister of Umm Al-Fadl Lubabah bint Al-Harith. The Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her after the Compensatory <em>‘Umrah</em> (Lesser Pilgrimage). That was in Dhul-Qa‘dah in the seventh year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those were the eleven women that the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) had married and consummated marriage with them. He outlived two of them — Khadijah and Zainab, the <em>Umm Al-Masakeen.</em> Whereas the other nine wives outlived him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two wives that he did not consummate marriage with were, one from Bani Kilab and the other from Kindah and this was the one called Al-Jauniyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides these, he had two concubines. The first was Mariyah, the Coptic (an Egyptian Christian), a present gift from Al-Muqauqis, vicegerent of Egypt — she gave birth to his son Ibrâhim, who died in Madinah while still a little child, on the28 th or29 th of Shawwal in the year 10A.H., i.e.27 th January, 632 A.D. The second one was Raihanah bint Zaid An-Nadriyah or Quraziyah, a captive from Bani Quraiza. Some people say she was one of his wives. However, Ibn Al-Qaiyim gives more weight to the first version. Abu ‘Ubaidah spoke of two more concubines, Jameelah, a captive, and another one, a bondwoman granted to him by Zainab bint Jahsh.[]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever meditates on the life of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) , will conceive that his marriage to this great number of women in the late years of his lifetime, after he had almost spent thirty years of his best days of youth sufficing himself to one old wife — Khadijah and later on to Sawdah, was in no way an overwhelming lustful desire to be satisfied through such a number of wives. These marriages were in fact motivated by aims and purposes much more glorious and greater than what normal marriages usually aim at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tendency of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) towards establishing a relationship by marriage with both Abu Bakr and ‘Umar and his marriage to ‘Aishah and Hafsah — and getting his daughter Fatimah married to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, and the marriage of his two daughters, Ruqaiyah and Umm Kulthum to ‘Uthman — indicate clearly that he aimed at confirming the relationship among the four men — whose sacrifices and great achievements in the cause of Islam are well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides this, there was that tradition of the Arabs to honour the in-law relations. For them a son or a daughter-in-law was a means by which they sought the consolidation of relationship and affection with various phratries. Hostility and fights against alliances and affinities would bring an unforgettable shame, disgrace and degradation to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By marrying the Mothers of believers, the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) wanted to demolish or break down the Arab tribes’ enmity to Islam and extinguish their intense hatred. Umm Salamah was from Bani Makhzum — the clan of Abu Jahl and Khalid bin Al-Waleed. Her marriage to the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) produced good results. Khalid’s deliberately undecisive attitude at Uhud — for instance — was due to the Messenger’s marriage to Umm Salamah. Khalid went even further than that, in a short time he willingly became a keen obedient Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Messenger of Allâh’s marriage to Umm Habibah, Abu Sufyan, her father, did not encounter him with any sort of hostility. Similarly his marriage to Juwairiyah and Safiyah made the two tribes stop all sorts of provocation, aggression or hostility against Islam. Better still, Juwairiyah, herself, was one of the greatest sources of blessing to her own people. On the occasion of her marriage to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) , his Companions set a hundred families of her people free. They said: &#8220;It is for their affinity with the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) .&#8221; No need to say what great good impression this gratitude had on everybody’s soul. One of the greatest motives of all is Allâh’s bidding his Prophet to educate and purify the souls of people who had known nothing whatsoever about courtesy, education and culture. He had to teach them to comply with the necessities of civilization and to contribute to the solidification and the establishment of a new Islamic society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An essential fundamental rule of the Muslim society is to prohibit mixing of men and women. Providing direct education for women, though highly compelling, is impossible in the light of this Islamic norm. Therefore, the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) had to select some women of different ages and talents, and indoctrinate them systematically in order to educate she-bedouins and townswomen, old and young, and thus furnish them with the instruments of propagating the true faith. The Mothers of believers (i.e. wives of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) ) were in such a convenient position that they could convey the state of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and his affairs to people (men and women). Being educated and taught the teachings and rules of Islam, his wives, especially those who outlived him, played a very important role in conveying Prophetic traditions <em>Ahadith</em> to the Muslims. ‘Aishah, for instance, related a large number of the Prophet’s deeds and statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His marriage to his paternal cousin Zainab bint Jahsh was a peculiar case which aimed at eradicating a deeply rooted pre-Islamic tradition — i.e. the adoption of children. In <em>Al-Jahiliyah</em> the Arabs used to consider an adopted person exactly like a real son or daughter as far as rights and sanctities are concerned. That <em>Jahiliyah</em> tradition had been so deeply rooted in their hearts that it was not easy to remove or uproot it. This tradition in fact affronts the basic principles of Islam; especially those concerned with marriage, divorce and inheritance and some other cases, and brought about lots of corruptions and indecencies. Naturally Islam stands against such deeds, and attempts to remove them from the Islamic society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the eradication of this tradition, Allâh, the Exalted, bid His Messenger (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to marry his cousin Zainab bint Jahsh, who was an ex-wife to Zaid. She was at variance with Zaid to an extent that he intended to divorce her — that was at the time when the Confederates (<em>Al-Ahzab</em>) were making an evil alliance against the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and against the Muslims. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) feared that the hypocrites, the idolaters, and the Jews would make a propaganda out of it and try to influence some Muslims of weak hearts. That was why he urged Zaid not to divorce her, in order not to get involved into that trial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly this hesitation and partiality were alien to the character of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . They did not apply to the power of determination and will with which he had been sent. Allâh, the Exalted, blamed him for that by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;And (remember) when you said to him (Zaid bin Haritha may Allah be pleased with him &#8211; — the freed slave of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) on whom Allâh has bestowed grace (by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) too) have done favour (by manumitting him), ‘Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allâh.’ But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allâh has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allâh will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e. Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allâh had a better right that you should fear him.&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally Zaid divorced Zainab and the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her at the time he laid siege to Bani Quraiza. That was after she had finished her <em>Iddat</em> (i.e. period during which a widow or a divorcee may not remarry). Allâh Himself had already ordained it, and so gave him no other alternative. Allâh had even started the marriage Himself by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them).&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that was in order to break down the tradition of child adoption in practice after He had done it in words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just near Allâh.&#8221; [33:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad ( saw) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allâh, and the last (end) of the Prophets.&#8221; [33:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lots of deeply-rooted traditions cannot be uprooted or demolished or even adjusted by mere words. They must be matched and associated with the action of the advocate of the Message himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This could be perceived through the deeds practised by the Muslims at Al-Hudaibiyah <em>‘Umrah</em> (Lesser Pilgrimage) during which ‘Urwah bin Mas‘ud Al-Thaqafi saw certain Muslims tend to pick up any expectoration that fell down from the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . He also saw them race to the water of his ablution and they almost quarrelled for it. There were others who competed to pledge allegiance to death and some others pledged not to flee from (the battlefield). Among those people, were eminent Companions like ‘Umar and Abu Bakr, who although dedicated all their lives to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and to the cause of Islam, but refused to carry out the Messenger’s ordres with respect to slaughtering sacrificial animals after the ratification of Al-Hudaibiyah Peace Treaty, the thing that perturbed and caused the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to feel anxious. However, when Umm Salamah &#8211; may Allah be pleased with her &#8211; advised that he take the initiative and sacrifice his animals, his followers raced to follow his example; a clear evidence in support of the saying: Actions speak louder than words, in the process of exterminating a deeply-established tradition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hypocrites aroused a lot of suspicions and made a broad false propaganda against that marriage. Their acts and talks about that marriage had ill-effects on those Muslims whose Faith was still weak, particularly that Zainab was the fifth wife — and the Noble Qur’ân limited the number up to four only; Zaid was traditionally his son, and so a father marrying his son’s divorcee was a heinous sin in the eyes of the Arabians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> Al-AhzabSurah</em> was revealed to shed full light on the two issues, i.e. Islam does not recognize adoption of children, and the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is given (by Allâh) more freedom as regards the number of wives he can hold than other Muslims in order to achieve noble and honourable purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the treatment of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to his wives was of honourable, noble, and superb nature. His wives were on tops in respect of honour, satisfaction, patience, modesty, and service (that is to say the performance of housework and marriage duties). Although the Messenger’s house-life was hard and unbearable, none of his wives complained. Anas said about the Prophet’s life: &#8220;According to my knowledge, the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) has never tasted a thin flattened loaf in all his lifetime, nor has he ever seen with his own eyes roasted mutton.&#8221;[]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aishah said: &#8220;Over two months have elapsed — during which we have seen three crescents — and yet no fire has been kindled in the houses of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) (i.e. they did not cook food).&#8221; &#8220;What did you eat to sustain yourselves?&#8221; ‘Urwah asked. She said &#8220;The two blacks: dates and water&#8221;[]. Lots of information about the hard life of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) were told.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of these hardships, straits and adversity of life in the house of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam), none of his wives uttered a word of complaint worthy of reproach — but once. This exception was required by human instinctive inclinations. However, it was not so important and consequently it did not require the decree of a legislative rule. Allâh has given them an opportunity to choose between two things, as clearly stated in the following verses:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;O Prophet (Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam)! Say to your wives: ‘If you desire the life of this world, and its glitter, — then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free in a handsome manner (divorce). But if you desire Allâh and His Messenger, and the Home of the Hereafter, then verily, Allâh has prepared for <em>Al-Muhsinat</em> (good doers) amongst you an enormous reward.’&#8221; [33:28,29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were so noble and honest that none of them preferred ‘the life of this world and its glitter’ to the abode in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although they were many in number, nothing of the dispute occurrences that normally happen among co-wives, took place in their houses. Very few cases could be the only exception; but they were quite normal. Allâh reproached them for that, so they ceased to do such a thing. This incident is mentioned in <em>At-Tahreem</em> Chapter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;O Prophet! Why do you ban (for yourself) that which Allâh has made lawful to you …&#8221; [66:1] (to the end of the fifth verse).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Discussing polygamy — in my opinion — is not a necessity; since a person who is familiar with the Europeans, and indecent practices, sufferings, wickedness, their sorrows and distresses, the horrible crimes they commit in this respect as well as the trials, the disasters that they are involved in, and which emanate directly from their disregard of the principle of polygamy form a good reason (to justify the soundness of polygamy). The distorted picture of life in Europe with the ill-practices featuring it, could truthfully justify the existence and practice of polygamy. In this, there are Divine signs for all people possessed of lucid mind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded from Suhayb that the Messenger of Allah said:Among the people who came before you, there was a king who had a sorcerer, and when that sorcerer became old, he said to the king, &#8220;I have become old and my time is nearly over, so please send me a boy whom I can teach magic.&#8221; So, he sent him a boy and the sorcerer taught him magic. Whenever the boy went to the sorcerer, he sat with a monk who was on the way and listened to his speech and admired them. So, when he went to the sorcerer, he passed by the monk and sat there with him; and on visiting the sorcerer the latter would thrash him. So, the boy complained about this to the monk. The monk said to him, &#8220;Whenever you are afraid of the sorcerer, say to him: `My people kept me busy.&#8217; And whenever you are afraid of your people, say to them: `The sorcerer kept me busy.&#8221;&#8217; So the boy carried on like that (for some time). Then a huge terrible creature appeared on the road and the people were unable to pass by. The boy said, &#8220;Today I shall know whether the sorcerer is better or the monk is better.&#8221; So, he took a stone and said, &#8220;O Allah! If the deeds and actions of the monk are liked by You better than those of the sorcerer, then kill this creature so that the people can cross (the road).&#8221; Then he struck it with a stone killing it and the people passed by on the road.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The boy came to the monk and informed him about it. The monk said to him, &#8220;O my son! Today you are better than I, and you have achieved what I see! You will be put to trial. And in case you are put to trial, do not inform (them) about me.&#8221;The boy used to treat the people suffering from congenital blindness, leprosy, and other diseases. There was a courtier of the king who had become blind and he heard about the boy. He came and brought a number of gifts for the boy and said, &#8220;All these gifts are for you on the condition that you cure me.&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;I do not cure anybody; it is only Allah who cures people. So, if you believe in Allah and supplicate to Him, He will cure you.&#8221; So, he believed in and supplicated to Allah, and Allah cured him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later, the courtier came to the king and sat at the place where he used to sit before. The king said, &#8220;Who gave you back your sight&#8221;The courtier replied, &#8220;My Lord.&#8221; The king then said, &#8220;I did&#8221; The courtier said, &#8220;No, my Lord and your Lord &#8211; Allah&#8221; The king said, &#8220;Do you have another Lord beside me&#8221; The courtier said, &#8220;Yes, your Lord and my Lord is Allah.&#8221; The king tortured him and did not stop until he told him about the boy. So, the boy was brought to the king and he said to him, &#8220;O boy! Has your magic reached to the extent that you cure congenital blindness, leprosy and other diseases&#8221;He said, &#8221; I do not cure anyone. Only Allah can cure.&#8221; The king said, &#8220;Me&#8221; The boy replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The king asked, &#8220;Do you have another Lord besides me&#8221;The boy answered, &#8221; My Lord and your Lord is Allah.&#8221; So, he tortured him also until he told about the monk. Then the monk was brought to him and the king said to him, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; The monk refused and so the king ordered a saw to be brought which was placed in the middle of his head and he fell, sawn in two. Then it was said to the man who used to be blind, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; He refused to do so, and so a saw was brought and placed in the middle of his head and he fell, sawn in two. Then the boy was brought and it was said to him, &#8220;Abandon your religion.&#8221; He refused and so the king sent him to the top of such and such mountain with some people. He told the people, &#8220;Ascend up the mountain with him till you reach its peak, then see if he abandons his religion; otherwise throw him from the top.&#8221; They took him and when they ascended to the top, he said, &#8221; O Allah! Save me from them by any means that You wish.&#8221; So, the mountain shook and they all fell down and the boy came back walking to the king. The king said, &#8221; What did your companions (the people I sent with you) do&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;Allah saved me from them.&#8221; So, the king ordered some people to take the boy on a boat to the middle of the sea, saying, &#8220;If he renounces his religion (well and good), but if he refuses, drown him.&#8221; So, they took him out to sea and he said, &#8220;O Allah! Save me from them by any means that you wish.&#8221; So they were all drowned in the sea.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the boy returned to the king and the king said, &#8220;What did your companions do&#8221; The boy replied, &#8220;Allah, saved me from them.&#8221; Then he said to the king, &#8220;You will not be able to kill me until you do as I order you. And if you do as I order you, you will be able to kill me.&#8221; The king asked, &#8220;And what is that&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;Gather the people in one elevated place and tie me to the trunk of a tree; then take an arrow from my quiver and say: `In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.&#8217; If you do this, you will be able to kill me.&#8221; So he did this, and placing an arrow in the bow, he shot it, saying, &#8220;In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy.&#8221; The arrow hit the boy in the temple, and the boy placed his hand over the arrow wound and died. The people proclaimed, &#8220;We believe in the Lord of the boy!&#8217;’ Then it was said to the king, &#8220;Do you see what has happened That which you feared has taken place. By Allah, all the people have believed (in the Lord of the boy).&#8221;So he ordered that ditches be dug at the entrances to the roads and it was done, and fires were kindled in them. Then the king said, &#8220;Whoever abandons his religion, let him go, and whoever does not, throw him into the fire.&#8221; They were struggling and scuffling in the fire, until a woman and her baby whom she was breast feeding came and it was as if she was being somewhat hesitant of falling into the fire, so her baby said to her,&#8221;Be patient mother! For verily, you are following the truth!&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim also recorded this Hadith at the end of the Sahih. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar related this story in his book of Sirah in another way that has some differences from that which has just been related. Then, after Ibn Ishaq explained that the people of Najran began following the religion of the boy after his murder, which was the religion of Christianity, he said, &#8220;Then (the king) Dhu Nuwas came to them with his army and called them to Judaism. He gave them a choice to either accept Judaism or be killed, so they chose death. Thus, he had a ditch dug and burned (some of them) in the fire (in the ditch), while others he killed with the sword. He made an example of them (by slaughtering them) until he had killed almost twenty thousand of them. It was about Dhu Nuwas and his army that Allah revealed to His Messenger :</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>(Cursed were the People of the Ditch. Of fire fed with fuel. When they sat by it. And they witnessed what they were doing against the believers. And they had no fault except that they believed in Allah, the Almighty, Worthy of all praise! To Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth! And Allah is Witness over everything.) (85:4-9)</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Muhammad bin Ishaq said in his book of Sirah &#8212; that the one who killed the People of the Ditch was Dhu Nuwas, and his name was Zur`ah. In the time of his kingdom he was called Yusuf. He was the son of Tuban As`ad Abi Karib, who was the Tubba` who invaded Al-Madinah and put the covering over the Ka`bah. He kept two rabbis with him from the Jews of Al-Madinah. After this some of the people of Yemen accepted Judaism at the hands of these two rabbis, as Ibn Ishaq mentions at length. So Dhu Nuwas killed twenty thousand people in one morning in the Ditch. Only one man among them escaped. He was known as Daws Dhu Tha`laban. He escaped on a horse and they set out after him, but they were unable to catch him. He went to Caesar, the emperor of Ash-Sham. So, Caesar wrote to An-Najashi, the King of Abyssinia. So, he sent with him an army of Abyssinian Christians, who were lead by Aryat and Abrahah. They rescued Yemen from the hands of the Jews. Dhu Nuwas tried to flee but eventually fell into the sea and drowned. After this, the kingdom of Abyssinia remained under Christian power for seventy years. Then the power was divested from the Christians by Sayf bin Dhi Yazin Al-Himyari when Kisra, the king of Persia sent an army there (to Yemen). He (the king) sent with him (Sayf Al-Himyari) those people who were in the prisons, and they were close to seven hundred in number. So, he (Sayf Al-Himyari) conquered Yemen with them and returned the kingdom back to the people of Himyar (Yemenis).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Al Hamdulillah<br />
</strong><strong>(All Praise and Thanks be to Allah)</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Meaning of Al-Hamd</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ja`far bin Jarir said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>The meaning of (Al-Hamdu Lillah) (all praise and thanks be to Allah)</strong> is: all thanks are due purely to Allah, alone, not any of the objects that are being worshipped instead of Him, nor any of His creation. These thanks are due to Allah&#8217;s innumerable favors and bounties, that only He knows the amount of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s bounties include creating the tools that help the creation worship Him, the physical bodies with which they are able to implement His commands, the sustenance that He provides them in this life, and the comfortable life He has granted them, without anything or anyone compelling Him to do so. Allah also warned His creation and alerted them about the means and methods with which they can earn eternal dwelling in the residence of everlasting happiness. All thanks and praise are due to Allah for these favors from beginning to end.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, Ibn Jarir commented on the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Al-Hamdu Lillah)</strong>, that it means, &#8220;A praise that Allah praised Himself with, indicating to His servants that they too should praise Him, as if Allah had said, `Say: All thanks and praise is due to Allah.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was said that the statement, <strong>(All praise and thanks be to Allah)</strong>, entails praising Allah by mentioning His most beautiful Names and most honorable Attributes. When one proclaims, `All thanks are due to Allah,&#8217; he will be thanking Him for His favors and bounties.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Difference between Praise and Thanks</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hamd is more general, in that it is a statement of praise for one&#8217;s characteristics, or for what he has done. Thanks are given for what was done, not merely for characteristics.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Statements of the Salaf about Al-Hamd</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hafs mentioned that `Umar said to `Ali, &#8220;We know La ilaha illallah, Subhan Allah and Allahu Akbar. What about Al-Hamdu Lillah&#8221; `Ali said, &#8220;<strong>A statement that Allah liked for Himself, was pleased with for Himself and He likes that it be repeated</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn `Abbas said, <strong>&#8220;Al-Hamdu Lillah is the statement of appreciation. When the servant says Al-Hamdu Lillah, Allah says, `My servant has praised Me.&#8221;</strong> Ibn Abi Hatim recorded this Hadith.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Virtues of Al-Hamd</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded that Al-Aswad bin Sari` said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I said, `O Messenger of Allah! Should I recite to you words of praise for My Lord, the Exalted, that I have collected&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Verily, your Lord likes Al-Hamd.)</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, Abu `Isa At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah recorded that Musa bin Ibrahim bin Kathir related that Talhah bin Khirash said that Jabir bin `Abdullah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(The best Dhikr (remembering Allah) is La ilaha illallah and the best supplication is Al-Hamdu Lillah.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhi said that this Hadith is Hasan Gharib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Majah recorded that Anas bin Malik said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(No servant is blessed by Allah and says,`Al-Hamdu Lillah&#8217;, except that what he was given is better than that which he has himself acquired.)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further, in his Sunan, Ibn Majah recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A servant of Allah once said, `O Allah! Yours is the Hamd that is suitable for the grace of Your Face and the greatness of Your Supreme Authority.&#8217; The two angels were confused as to how to write these words. They ascended to Allah and said, `O our Lord! A servant has just uttered a statement and we are unsure how to record it for him.&#8217; Allah said while having more knowledge in what His servant has said, &#8216;What did My servant say&#8217; They said, `He said, `<strong>O Allah! Yours is the Hamd that is suitable for the grace of Your Face and the greatness of Your Supreme Authority</strong>.&#8217; Allah said to them, <strong>`Write it as My servant has said it, until he meets Me and then I shall reward him for it</strong>.)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al before Hamd encompasses all Types of Thanks and Appreciation for Allah</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The letters Alif and Lam before the word Hamd serve to encompass all types of thanks and appreciation for Allah, the Exalted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Hadith stated,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(O Allah! All of Al-Hamd is due to You, You own all the ownership, all types of good are in Your Hand and all affairs belong to You.)</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">[Below is a portion from the book &#8220;Miracles of the Messenger (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam)&#8221; regarding the remembrance of Allah. This miracle occurred when Rasulallah moved from the tree trunk to the newly made pulpit to give the Khutbah. Rasulallah used to lean against the tree trunk but when he left for the pulpit it cried out loud like a child for it would no longer be in the company of the Prophet and hear the remembrance of Allah (azzawajal). You can read the detailed story and hadith in chapter 6 page 105 in the book &#8220;Miracles of the Messenger (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam)&#8221;]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was also another reason for the weeping of the tree trunk and this was made clear by the Prophet when he said to his Companions: &#8220;It wept because of the remembrance of Allah (Dhikr) which it used to hear.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the tree trunk also used to hear remembrance of Allah from the mouth of the Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) and Allah, the Most Blessed, the Most High says regarding remembrance of Him: <i>&#8220;Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest. &#8220;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not surprising that the tree trunk cried for that which brought tranquility to it. Haply, we may learn from this lifeless thing to love the remembrance of Allah and to accustom ourselves to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Dhikr means to remember something through constant verbal repetition of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person were to constantly repeat the Names of Allah for example he would be remembering Allah; and due to the great need of man for remembrance of Allah, He has encouraged us to do it, in His Words: <i>&#8220;He said: &#8216;O my Lord! Make a sign for me.&#8217; (Allah) said: &#8216;Your sign is that you shall not speak to mankind for three days except with signals. And remember your Lord much (by praising Him again and again), and glorify (Him) in the afternoon and in the morning.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <i>&#8220;O you who believe! Remember Allah with much remembrance.&#8221; </i>In remembrance of Allah there is great virtue, including:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Reminding Others to Remember Allah:</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Most Glorified, the Most High says: &#8220;Therefore remember Me (by praying, glorifying). I will remember you, and be grateful to Me (for My countless Favors on you) and never be ungrateful to Me. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He inspired the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) to say: <i>&#8220;Shall I not inform you about the best of your deeds with Allah and the purest of them with your King and the highest of them in status for you, which are better for you than spending gold and silver in charity and better than meeting your enemy and cutting off their heads, while they also cut off yours?&#8221; They said &#8220;Certainly, oh, Messenger of Allah!&#8221; He said: &#8220;It is remembrance of Allah, the All-Mighty, the All Powerful.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) also said: <i>&#8220;The likeness of one who remembers Allah and one who does not remember Allah is as the likeness of the living and the dead.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It repels Satan and pleases the Most Gracious, according to the Words of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam): <i>&#8220;Whenever a people sit in a meeting-place and remember Allah, they are surrounded by angels and enveloped in mercy, and tranquility descends upon them as they remember Allah; and Allah makes mention of them to those with Him.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It removes Anxiety and Sadness and enlightens the Heart and brings Peace and Tranquility to it, according to the Words of Allah, the Most High: <i>&#8220;Those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism), and whose hearts find rest in the remembrance of Allah verily, in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find rest.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It strengthens the Heart and the Body, according to the Words of the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) to His Daughter, Fatimah and &#8216;Ali (R). He told them to glorify Allah (i.e., say Subhan Allah) thirty-three times, to praise and thank Allah (i.e., to say Al-Hamdu Lilldh) thirty-three times and to extol Allah (i.e., to say Allahu Akbar) thirty-four times. This was when she (i.e., Fatimah ) asked him for a servant which would help her in her work.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remembrance of Allah also attracts Sustenance, according to the Words of Allah, the Most High: <i>&#8220;Ask forgiveness from your Lord, verily, He is Oft Forgiving; He will send rain to you in abundance, and give you increase in wealth and children, and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers. &#8220;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through remembrance of Allah, the hearts live, according to the Saying of Ibn Taimiyyah: Remembrance of Allah for the heart is like water to the fish; and what would the situation of the fish be if it left the water?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remembrance of Allah causes the One Who remembers Him to be with Him, according to the Hadith Qudsi: <i>&#8220;I am with My slave whenever he remembers me and moves his lips to pronounce My Names.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he spoke the truth who said: &#8220;The heart becomes diseased due to two things: negligence and sin; and it becomes clear due to two things: seeking forgiveness from Allah and remembrance of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Remembrance of Allah, the Slave earns Allah&#8217;s Love, according to the Words of Ibn &#8216;Abbas (R): &#8220;When Moses t went to Mount Sinai, he said: &#8216;Oh, my Lord! Which of Your slaves is most beloved to You?&#8217; He said: &#8220;The one who remembers me and does not forget me.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remembrance of Allah also opens up the door to knowledge for the slave and protects the tongue from backbiting and tale-bearing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been said that it causes the slave to be conscious of Allah&#8217;s Observation of him, which admits him to the door of <i>Ihsan,</i> so that he worships Allah as if he could see Him. It also gives rise to<i> Inabah</i>, which is to return to Allah, the All-Mighty, the All-Powerful. So when a person returns frequently to Allah by remembrance of Him, it will cause him to return to Allah in all circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Remembrance of Allah is the Easiest Act of Worship:</b> It is easy for a person in every place, in every situation and at all times to remember Allah and in spite of this, it is one of the best acts of worship for the movement of the tongue is lighter and easier than the movement of any other part of the body. Therefore, it is incumbent upon the Muslim to take care to accustom his tongue to remembrance of Allah and keep it moist thereby and he should do so in all circumstances, according to the Hadith of &#8216;Aishah : &#8220;The Messenger of Allah (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam), used to remember Allah, the Most High in all circumstances.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, we must observe his Sunnah, for there is a supplication and a remembrance of Allah (Dhikr) legislated for every time and every action.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">In the Shade of this Miracle</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It might appear that the weeping of an inanimate object is something strange, but it was a subjugation from Allah in order that the tree trunk should deliver a Message not only for the Companions (R) rather, it was for all mankind, in every time and place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was a message delivered by the tree trunk through Allah&#8217;s Ability to do all things and it announced it in a resounding manner, which echoed: &#8220;La ilaha illallah (none is worthy of worship except Allah).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tree trunk addressed mankind, with a message of complete faith, in that language which purifies the hearts and washes the senses and when humanity understands it, its soul which is wandering in the wilderness will return to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its message will remain to soften hard hearts, to remind forgetful hearts and to awaken sleeping feelings and to give life to sensations which have died and it will remain to shout out to mankind: The dry, lifeless object cried out for the intimacy and delight which it lost, when the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) passed by it in favor of the new pulpit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The dry, lifeless object was distressed at being far from the Prophet (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam) and alarmed at being parted from him and wished that it should continue. It was as if this dry, lifeless object was declaring to us that we should seek that delight which comes from following the guidance of Al-Mustafa e; and adhering to his Sunnah. And (that it was declaring also) that we should feel distress at being far from it, that we beware of transgress in it, that we should hold fast to it and cling to it by our molar teeth, in order that we might attain closeness to the Prophet and companionship with him, and that the Miracle should remove from us all traces of doubt which might remain present in the hearts of some, regarding the Messenger (Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam)</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 1: Water</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira[1] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Said regarding the sea, &#8220;Its water is purifying and its dead (animals) are lawful (to eat)&#8221;.<br />
[Al-Arba&#8217;a[2] and Ibn Abu Shaiba reported it, version is of the latter. Ibn Khuzaima and At-Tirmidhi graded it Sahih (sound). Malik, Ash-Shafi’i and Ahmad reported it].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri[3] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Water is purer[4] and nothing can make it impure.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ath-Thalatha[5], and Ahmad graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Umama Al-Bahili[6] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Water cannot be rendered impure by anything except something which changes its smell, taste and color[7]&#8221;.<br />
[Ibn Majah reported it and Abu Hatim described it as Da&#8217;if (weak)]. And Al-Baihaqi reported: &#8220;Water is pure unless any impure thing is added which changes its smell, taste and color.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar[8] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If there is enough water to fill two pots (Qulla)[9], it carries no impurity.&#8221; Another version has: &#8220;it does not become unclean&#8221;.<br />
[AI-Arba&#8217;a reported it. Ibn Khuzaima, Ibn Hibban and Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), said, &#8220;None of you should take bath in stagnant water when he is sexually impure.&#8221;<br />
[Muslim reported it].<br />
Another version of Al-Bukhari has: &#8220;None of you should urinate in stagnant water that is not flowing, then take bath in it.[10] &#8220;A version of Muslim has the words: &#8220;from it (i.e. the water)&#8221;.<br />
A version of Abu Da’ud has: &#8220;One should not take bath in it from sexual impurity.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man[11] who accompanied the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) narrated: Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) forbade a woman to bathe with the water left over by a man, and that a man should not bathe with the water left over by a woman, (and instead) they should both take scoopfuls of the water together.<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and An-Nasa’i and its chain of narrators is Sahih (authentic)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه)[12]: The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to bath with the water left over by Maimuna (رضي الله عنه) [Muslim reported it]. And Ashab As-Sunan (compilers of the Prophet&#8217;s sayings) reported that one of the wives of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) took bath from a vessel, then came the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and when he wanted to take bath from that (vessel), she[13] said, &#8220;I was sexually impure.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Water does not become sexually impure.&#8221;<br />
[At- Tirmidhi and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said &#8220;The cleansing of the utensil belonging to one of you, after it has been licked by dog, is to wash it seven[14] times, using soil for cleaning at the first time.<br />
[Muslim reported it· Another version has: &#8220;he should spill the contents]&#8221;<br />
Al-Tirmidhi&#8217;s version has: &#8220;using soil at the first or last time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qadata[15] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Said about the cat that, &#8220;It is not unclean, but is one of those who intermingle with you<br />
[Reported by Al-Arba’a[16]. At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik[17] رضي الله عنه): A Bedouin came and urinated in one corner of the mosque, and the people shouted at him, but Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) stopped them, and when he finished urinating, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ordered for a bucket of water which was split[18] over it.<br />
[Agreed upon][19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn ‘&#8217;Umar (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) &#8216;said, &#8220;Two types of dead animals and two types of bloods have been made lawful for us, the two types of dead animals are locusts and fish (seafood), while the two types of bloods are the liver and the spleen.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ahmad and Ibn Majah, and this Hadith has some weakness.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;When a fly falls in the drink of one of you, he should fully dip it and then throw it away because there is disease in one of its wings and cure in the other[20].<br />
[Reported by Al-Bukhari and Abu Da’ud who added: &#8220;It (the fly) protects itself with the diseased wing (by dipping it first in a drink)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Waqid Al-Laithi[21] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Whatever (portion) is cut off from an animal when it is alive is dead (meat).<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and At-Tirmidhi who graded it Hasan (fair), and this version is of Tirmidhi].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           His real name is &#8216;Abdullah or &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Sakhr Ad-Dausi, and was one of the greatest Sahaba (Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) and reported the largest number of Ahadith. More than 800 men narrated from him. He became a Muslim in the year of Khaibar (7 H.) and stayed in the company of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) until he (the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) died. He was appointed a Mufti (scholar of Islamic verdicts) during the caliphate of&#8217; Umar and later became the governor of Al-Madina during the reign of Mawan bin Al-Hakam. He died in 59 H. and was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           The collectors of Hadith: Abu Da’ud, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           His name is Sa&#8217;d bin Malik bin Sinan Al-Khazraji Al-Ansari. He was one of the learned Sahaba, reported many Ahadith and gave religious opinions for some time. He died at the beginning of 74H at the age of 86 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           It is reported in Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi and Abu Da’ud that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said these words answering a question about the well of Bud&#8217;a, which is located in the vicinity of Al-Madina, and was always filled with filth. This well was situated in a low-lying area and the rainwater would carry all the dirt and garbage into it. These words are certainly about this well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           The collectors of Hadith: Abu Da&#8217;ud, At-Tirmidhi, and An-Nasa&#8217;i.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           His name is Suday bin &#8216;Ajlan, one of the Sahaba who reported many Ahadith. He lived in Egypt then moved to Hims (now in Syria) and died there at the age of 81 or 86 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Some of the people remark that water may be less or more in quantity, if filth alters its one quality out of three (its colors, odor and taste), it would become impure. But the proper view in this connection is that if water is less than 227 kilograms (two Qulla) then mere filth makes it impure, whether there is a change in any one of its quality or not, but when water is more than the said quantity, it does not get impure, until there is a change at least in one quality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           He was among the most ascetic and most knowledgeable Sahaba. He became a Muslim at Makka while a small boy, and mi grated to Al-Medina. He first participated in the battle of Al-Khandaq, died in 73AH, and was buried at Dhi Tuwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           <i>Qulla</i> is a large earthen pot, which may contain water up to two and a half water-skins, viz., and one hundred and thirteen kilograms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         It means less quantity of water; if water is in abundance, it will be regarded as flowing water, which is not an impure one and is good for bathing. It has been prohibited to urinate in the stagnant water on the ground that one may not make it a habit and pollute the water. Condition of the stagnant water is only because flowing water is always clean and never becomes impure, even dirt and filth do not make it impure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         This man is one of the Sahaba, and failure to mention his name does not harm because the Sahaba are all trust worthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         He is ‘Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul-Muttalib, the Prophet&#8217;s cousin and the scholar of the Muslim Ummah. He was born 3 years before Al-Hijra and died at Ta&#8217;if in 67 AH.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         This Hadith apparently seems to be in contradiction with the first, but actually it is not, because the order is not of absolute prohibition, but is only of suggestive prohibition to avoid any trace of impurity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         It must be clear that just to clean a thing from impurity, it is not necessary to wash a for seven times. The philosophy of cleaning a thing for seven times is different from that of simple purification. Physicians of today say that mostly in the intestines of dogs there are germs and small worms approximately 4 mm. in length, and these move out from intestines with the excrement and stick to the hair around the anus· When dogs clean this place with tongue, it gets soiled with these organisms If a dog licks a pot or someone kisses the dog, as the European and American ladies do, these ate transferred from dog to the pot or to the mouth of the woman and then to the stomach These organisms keep on moving, and penetrate into blood cells causing many fatal diseases· As the detection of these germs is not possible without microscopic tests, the Shari&#8217;a (Islamic law) declared the dog&#8217;s saliva an inherently impure thing by a general command, and whatever a thing is polluted with dog&#8217;s saliva, must be cleaned seven times (which in one time should be with the soil) to be sure of its purity. For more details please see the footnotes of the book Ahkam-ul-Ahsan, Sharh Umdat-ul-Ahkam].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]         He is Al-Harith bin Rib&#8217;i Al-Ansari, the prophet&#8217;s horseman. He fought the battle of Uhud and those, which followed. It is said he died at Al-Madina or Kufa in 54H</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]         Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah·</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17]         He was the Prophet’s servant from the time he came to Al-Madina till his death. He is known as Abu Hamza and was Khazraji· He lived in Basra during Umar&#8217;s Caliphate and died in it at the age of 99 or 103 years in 91 or 92 or 93 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]         This Hadith proves that earth gets pure when dried up, as Ibn Abi Shaiba has narrated, specially when you let the water flow over the spot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]         Al-Bukhari and Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]         It is evident from this Hadith that if a fly drops into water or syrup, it will not become impure, and the creatures of this family who&#8217;s blood does not flow, like mosquito, wasp and spider, etc, do not make the water impure if fallen or died into it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21]         His name is Al-Harith bin &#8216;Auf and is a descendant of Banu &#8216;Aamir bin Laith. He became a Muslim very early and is counted among the people of Al-Madina. It is said that he fought at Badr, lived in Makka and died in it in 65H or 68H at the age· of 57 and was buried at Funj.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 2: Utensils</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman[1] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Do not drink in silver or gold utensils, and do not eat in plates of such metals,[2] for such things are for them (the disbelievers) in this worldly life and for you in the Hereafter.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon][3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Umm Salama[4] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم)· Said, &#8220;He who drinks in a silver utensil is only swallowing Hell-fire in his stomach.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;When the skin is tanned it becomes purified[5]&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim]<br />
AI-Arba &#8216;a have the words: &#8220;Any skiI1 that is tanned…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salama bin Al-Muhabbiq[6] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;The tanning of a dead animal&#8217;s skin purifies it.&#8221;<br />
[Ibn Hibban graded it Sahih (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Maimuna (رضي الله عنه): Some people dragging a (dead) goat passed by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). He told them, &#8220;Had you better taken its skin.” They said, &#8220;It is dead&#8221;. He said, &#8220;Water and the leaves of the Acacia tree will purify it.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and An-Nasa’i].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Tha’laba Al-Khushni[7] (رضي الله عنه): I said, &#8220;O Allah’s Messenger! We are living in a land inhabited by the people of the Scriptures, can we take our meals in their utensils?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat in theirs[8] but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash them and eat in them.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran bin Husain[9] (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his Companions performed Wudu (ablution) from a skin water container[10] belonging to a polytheist woman.<br />
[Agreed upon]. (It is an extract of a long Hadith)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik (رضي الله عنه): When the cup of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) got broken, he fixed it with a silver wire[11] at the crack.<br />
[Reported by Al-Bukhari]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           He is nicknamed Abu Abdullah, both him and his father were Sahaba and he became famous for being the confidant of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) He died at Midian (Madain) forty nights after the killing of &#8216;Uthman in the year 35H or 36 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           This Hadith is mentioned here with a purpose to clarify that if it is prohibited to eat and drink in gold and silver utensils, then performing ablution is also prohibited with using gold and silver utensils, otherwise this Hadith would have been placed in the chapter of eating and drinking Eating, drinking and performing ablution in utensils studded with rubies and diamonds is permissible</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Al-Bukhari and Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           She is Hind bint Abu &#8216;Umaiya. She was married to Abu Salama, she immigrated with him to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and came with him to Al-Madina When Abu Salama died from an injury, he had sustained during the battle of Uhud the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) married her in Shawwal 4 H· It is said that she died in 59H or 62 H at the age of 84 years and was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           This Hadith approves that a hide, after tanning becomes pure and clean, may be the hide is of an animal which is (haram) prohibited to eat or (halal) lawful to eat and whether the animal is slaughtered or died. But the skins of human beings and some of the animals are unlawful and not permitted for use. The skin of man is unlawful due to his sacredness and reverence and the skins of animals like dog and pig are unlawful and not permitted for use because they are inherently impure and unclean. It should also be remembered that hair, teeth and horns of permitted animals are also lawful for use and trade.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           He is nicknamed Abu Sinan of Hudhali tribe. He is considered as a resident of Basra and Al-Hasan Al-Basri took the Hadith from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           He is a Sahabi (Companion of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم.) descending from Khushain bin An-Nimir of Quda&#8217;a tribe. He was one of the Ashab Ash-Shajara who entered a covenant with the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on the day of Al-Hudaibiya. He was sent to his people and they accepted Islam. He settled in Sham and died there in 75H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           This Hadith makes it clear that if the utensils from a Muslim are available then the utensils of a non-Muslim should not be used for eating, drinking or cooking. If it is certain about a non-Muslim that he does not eat something unlawful or prohibited, then his utensils may be used, but even then one should be careful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           He is nicknamed Abu Nujeid and is from the Khuza&#8217;a tribe. He accepted Islam in the year of Khaibar. He settled in Basra and died there in 52H or 53H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         This Hadith clarifies that such utensils of the polytheists may be used without any hesitations, about which there is no probability of being impure.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         This Hadith proves that if this much amount of gold or silver is present m any utensil, then making ablution with it or eating and drinking in it is not prohibited.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 3: The Nature and Cleansing of An-Najasah</h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">(The Impurities)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was asked about making vinegar out of wine. He said, &#8220;No (it is prohibited)&#8221;.[1]<br />
[Reported by Muslim, and At-Tirmidhi and the latter graded it Hasan-Sahih (fair and sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated (Anas bin Malik) (رضي الله عنه): On the day of Khaibar, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) commanded Abu Talha[2] to announce: &#8220;Allah and His Messenger have prohibited for you (eating of) the flesh of the donkeys, for it is unclean.&#8221;[3]<br />
[Agreed upon.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Kharija[4] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) delivered a Khutba (religious talk) to us at Mina while mounted on his camel and its saliva was pouring on my[5] shoulders.<br />
[Reported by Ahmad and At-Tirmidhi and the latter graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha[6] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to wash the semen[7] and then go out for prayer in that (very) garment, and I could still see the trace of the washing on it.<br />
[Agreed upon].<br />
In the version of Muslim: &#8220;I used to scrape it (the semen) off the garment of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and then he offered prayer with it.&#8221;<br />
In yet another version of Muslim: &#8220;Verily! I (&#8216;Aisha) used to scrape it (the semen) off his garment with my nails while it was dry&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu As-Samh[8] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;The urine of a baby girl should be washed off and the urine of a baby boy should be sprinkled[9] with water).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and An-Nasa’i and Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr[10] (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said regarding menstruation blood that smears a garment, &#8220;She should scrape it, rub it with water, then wash it and then she may pray in it&#8221;.<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Khaula[11] said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, suppose the (trace of) the blood does not go?&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Washing it with) water will suffice you and its trace won&#8217;t harm you.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by At- Tirmidhi, and its <i>Sanad</i> (chain of narrators) is weak].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           Making of vinegar from wine by adding something in it is prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           He is Zaid bin Sahl bin Al-Aswad bin Haram Al-Ansari An-Najari who was one of the senior Sahaba. He attended the &#8216;Aqaba Covenant and all the battles. He fought bravely during the battle of Uhud and defended the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) till his hand got paralyzed. He also killed 20 men in the battle of Hunain. He died in the year 34 H. or 51 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Leftover water of a donkey is pure and usable</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           He is &#8216;Amr bin Kharija bin Al-Muntafiq Al-Asadi. He was an ally of Abu Sufyan. He is regarded as being from the clan of Al-Ash&#8217;ar. He is among the Sahaba who settled in Sham and this Hadith was reported by the people of Basra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           From this Hadith we come to know that the saliva of a Halal [lawful to eat] animal is also pure. This Hadith was approved by the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           She is the daughter of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) married her 2 years before the Hijra in the month of Shawwal, but wedded her in 1 H. at the age of9 years. She was very learned and reported many Ahadith. She died on 17 Ramadan 57 H or 58 H. Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه) offered her Funeral prayer and she was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           There is a difference of opinion concerning the human semen, whether it is impure or not. Some religious elites consider it like saliva or nasal secretion, and according to others it is necessary to wash it. Former group gives its reason from the Hadith of scraping it when dried, and the latter group argues from the Hadith of washing the semen. In fact, semen is impure and it must be cleaned by washing, scraping, rubbing or wiping. (See the book Nail-ul-Autar by Imam Shaukani)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           His name is Iyya’d. He was a manumitted slave and servant of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Ibn Abdul-Bar said that he was reported to be lost and nobody knew where he died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           It means that there is difference in the urine of a boy and a girl. In the suckling period, girl&#8217;s urine is more impure than the boy&#8217;s urine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         She is the mother of&#8217; Abdullah bin Az-Zubair and the elder sister of&#8217; Aisha. She became a Muslim very early in Makka and migrated to Al-Madina. She died less than a month after the killing of her son Ibn Az-Zubair in 73H at the age of about 100 years, yet she neither lost a tooth nor had any mental problem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         Khaula bint Yasar was a Sahabiya and Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman narrated the Hadith from her.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 4: Wudu (Ablution)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29.  Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Had I not feared burdening my Ummah (followers), I would have commanded them to use Siwak[1] (stick toothbrush) before every Salat (prayer).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Malik, Ahmad and An-Nasa’i. Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound) and Al-Bukhari mentioned as a Mu&#8217;allaq (suspended &#8212; without its chain of narrators)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30.  Narrated Humran[2], the manumitted slave of &#8216;Uthman[3] (RA): &#8216;Uthman (رضي الله عنه) called for water to perform ablution. He washed palms of his hands three times, then rinsed his mouth and sniffed water in his nose and then blew it out. He then washed his face three times. Thereafter he washed his right hand up to his elbow three times[4] then the left one likewise, then he passed wet hands on his head. Then he washed his right foot up to the ankle three times, then the left one likewise. He then said, &#8220;I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) performing ablution like this ablution of mine.&#8221; [Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31.  Narrated &#8216;Ali[5] (رضي الله عنه), regarding the description of the ablution of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): He (the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) wiped his head (with water) only once[6].<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud, An-Nasa’i, At-Tirmidhi with a Sahih Sanad (authentic chain of narrators). At-Tirmidhi said, &#8220;It&#8217;s the most sound Hadith on this subject&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32.  Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Zaid bin &#8216;Aasim[7] (رضي الله عنه) describing the nature of ablution performance: Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) wiped his head from the forehead to the back of his head and then back to the forehead[8] with his (wet) hands.<br />
[Agreed upon].<br />
And in another version of theirs: &#8220;He began from the front of his head and took them (his wet hands) to the back of his head and then returned them to the place he had begun from.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33.  Narrated Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr[9] (رضي الله عنه), regarding the description of the ablution: &#8220;Then he (Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم) wiped his head, inserted his index finger in his ears and wiped the exterior of his ears with his thumbs.&#8221;[10]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and An-Nasa’i and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34.  Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;When one of you wakes up from his sleep, he must blow off his nose three times, for the Satan spends the night inside one&#8217;s nostrils&#8221;<br />
[11][Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35.  Narrated (Abu Huraira رضي الله عنه): (Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said,) &#8220;When one of you wakes up from his sleep, he must not put his hand in a utensil till he has washed it three times[12], for he does not know where his hand was (while he slept).&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon. This is Muslim&#8217;s version]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36.  Narrated Laqit bin Sabra (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Perform a perfect Wudu (ablution), run (your fingers) through the fingers of the hands and the toes[13], and if not fasting, sniff water up well inside the nose.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Arba &#8216;a[14], and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]<br />
In another version of Abu Da’ud is: &#8220;If you perform ablution rinse your mouth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37.  Narrated &#8216;Uthman (رضي الله عنه): While performing Wudu, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would run (his) fingers through his beard[15].<br />
[Reported by At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38.  Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Zaid (رضي الله عنه): Two-thirds of a <i>Mudd[16]</i> (of water) was brought to the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم (for ablution) so he began rubbing his arms.<br />
[Reported by Ahmad, and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39.  Narrated (&#8216;Abdullah bin Zaid رضي الله عنه): He saw the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم taking some water to wipe his ears other than the water he had taken to wipe his head.<br />
[Reported by Al-Baihaqi, who said that its <i>Isnad</i> (chain of narrators) is authentic, At-Tirmidhi also graded it Sahih (sound)]<br />
And the words of the Muslim version are: &#8220;he wiped his head taking extra water from that he had taken for the washing of the hands,&#8221; and this Hadith is Al-Mahfuz.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40.  Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه):I heard Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying, &#8220;My people will come on the Day of Resurrection with bright faces, hands and feet from the traces of Wudu (ablution). If any of you can lengthen his brightness[17], let him do so.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon and this is Muslim&#8217;s version]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41.  Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم· loved to begin with the right while putting on his shoes, combing his hair, in his purification and in all his affairs[18].<br />
[Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42.  Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said, &#8220;When you perform ablution, begin with your right limbs.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Arba&#8217;a[19] and graded Sahih (sound) by Ibn Khuzaima]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43.  Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba[20][](رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) performed ablution and passed wet hands on his forelock, over the turban and over the two leather socks[21].<br />
[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44.  Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah[22] (رضي الله عنه) regarding the Hajj (pilgrimage) of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Begin with what Allah had begun with.&#8221;[23]<br />
[Reported by An- Nasa’i in this commanding version while Muslim has reported it in the reporting[24] one]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45.  Narrated (Jabir bin Abdullah رضي الله عنه): The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم used to run the water down his elbows while performing ablution.<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni with a weak chain of narrators]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46.  Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;There is no Wudu (ablution) for one who does not mention Allah&#8217;s Name upon it[25].&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ahmad, Abu Da&#8217;ud and Ibn Majah with a weak chain of narrators].<br />
At-Tirmidhi reported something similar to the above from Sa&#8217;id bin Zaid[26], and Abu Sa&#8217;id like this, and Ahmad said that nothing is authenticated in it]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47.  Narrated Talha bin Musarrif[27] quoting his father on the authority of his grandfather[28]: &#8220;I saw Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) rinsing his mouth and sniffing up and blowing his nose with separate scoops[29] of water.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abi Da&#8217;ud with a weak chain of narrators].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48.  Narrated &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه), regarding performance of Wudu (ablution): The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم, rinsed his mouth and sniffed and blew (his nose) with water three times. He sniffed up and blew his nose with the same hand from which he took the water.<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and An-Nasa&#8217;i]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49.  Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Zaid (رضي الله عنه) regarding Wudu (ablution): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) put his hand (in the utensil) rinsed (his mouth) and sniffed up and blew (his nose) from one scoop (of water). He did that three times.<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50.  Narrated Anas (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saw a man on whose foot appeared a portion like the size of a nail, which was not touched by water. He then said, &#8220;Go back and perform your Wudu (ablution) properly[30].&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and An-Nasa’i].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">51.  Narrated (Anas رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) · used only one <i>Mudd[31]</i> of water for ablution and one Sa'[32] to five Mudd of water for his bath.<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">52.  Narrated Umar[33] (رضي الله عنه): &#8216;Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If one after performing ablution completely recites the following supplication: (<i>Ash-hadu an la ilaha ill-Allau wahdahu 1a sharika lahu, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan &#8216;abduhu wa Rasuluhu</i>) &#8216;I testify that there is no one worthy of worship but Allah, He is Alone and has no partner and Muhammad is His slave and Messenger,&#8217; all the eight gates of Paradise will be opened for him and he may enter through any gate he wishes.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim and At-Tirmidhi who added the following words to the supplication: (<i>Allahumma aj &#8216;alni minAl-tawwabina waj&#8217;alni minAl-mutatahhirina</i>) &#8220;Oh Allah! Include me among those who repent and those who keep themselves pure&#8221;]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           It means that the use of <i>Siwak</i> (tooth cleaning stick from the tree or the toothbrush) with every ablution is Sunna [the way of the noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم] and the Hadith reported by Muslim tells us that Siwak should be used before every prayer. It means that if anybody is going to offer prayers with ablution performed previously, even then he should use Siwak. These Ahadith prove extreme emphasis on the constant use of Siwak for the cleaning of teeth. It is Sunna (supererogatory) and not <i>Wajib</i> (compulsory).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           Humran bin Aban was caught by Khalid bin Al-Walid in a war during Abu Bakr&#8217;s caliphate, and he sent him to serve &#8216;Uthman who freed him. He is trustworthy of the 2nd grade in the reporting of Ahadith. He died in 75 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           The third Guided Caliph. He accepted Islam early and married Ruqaiya and then Umm Kulthum, daughters of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and was therefore nicknamed Dhun-Nuirain (the possessor of the two lights, i.e. the daughters of the Prophet h صلى الله عليه و سلم). He was killed as a martyr on Friday, 18th Dhul Hijja, 35H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           In this Hadith washing of face, hands and feet is stated to be done three times each, whereas in others, two times and one time washing is regarded as enough. Imam Nawawi has written the consensus of opinions that washing once is Fard (obligatory).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           The fourth Guided Caliph. He fought all the battles except Tabuk, for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) had left him as in charge in Al-Madina. An evildoer called &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Muljam killed him as a martyr on Friday morning 17th Ramadan 40 H. at Kufa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           It means that wiping of head (doing Mash) only once is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           He was an Ansari belonging to Bani Mazin from An-Najar clan. He fought at Uhud and killed Musailima Al-Kadhdhab together with Wahshi on Al-Yamama Day. He was killed on the day of Al-Harrah in 63 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           This Hadith tells us that <i>Mash</i> (wiping) of head should be started from the front.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           He is the son of&#8217; Amr bin Al&#8217;-Aas Al-Qurashi. He became a Muslim before his father who was older than him by 13 years. He was an Aalim (learned), memorized Ahadith and was very pious. He died in the 63 H. or 70 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         It means that ears are to be wiped internally and externally. The side close to the head is external and near the face is internal. Tirmidhi after narrating the Hadith concerning wiping of ears internally and externally, says that religious scholars follow the same practice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         Spending the night of Satan inside the nostrils of a man is plausible, but its actual state is better known to Allah and His Messenger. May be this is a figurative expression, because bad excretions gather in the nose and cause laziness, indolence, slackness and negligence. All these states are satanic dispositions</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         It means that hands should not be dipped in the ablution water container, as the word &#8216;ablution&#8217; is present in some of the Ahadith narrated by Bukhari. Allamah Ibn Hajar, in his book Fath Al-Bari, says: Though this Hadith apparently seems to be related with the utensils of ablution but it includes all other utensils and bathing water containers. But if there is a big pool or tank of water then it is permissible to put hands in it</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         It means that the fingers of hands and feet should be washed completely and carefully.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]         During the performance of ablution, combing of beard with fingers is Sunnah (supererogatory) and not Wajib (compulsory).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]         In some Ahadith, a full Mudd has been mentioned. One Mudd is a little more than six hundred grams. This is the least quantity of water mentioned for ablution; otherwise it will be very difficult to perform ablution with small amount of water. Maximum limit of water has not been ordained, any amount of water may be used for ablution and bath, but water should not be wasted</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17]         It may have more than one meaning. It may mean washing of limbs more than the minimum limits, for example, washing of hands up to shoulders and washing of feet up to knees; Abu Huraira رضي الله عنه assumes this meaning. It may also mean that every limb should be washed three times, instead of washing it for one time &#8212; the minimum limit for washing. It may also mean to perform ablution again and again or to remain with ablution all the time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]         This mode of action of the noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم was for noble actions, for other actions like coming out of mosque and entering a toilet etc., one should put his left feet first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]         Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]         Abu Abdullah or Abu Iesa, Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba bin Mas&#8217;ud Ath-Thaqafi was a prominent Sahabi. He became a Muslim in the year of the Khandaq (trench) and migrated. He first participated in Al-Hudaibiya. He died in 50 H. in Kufa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21]         This Hadith makes it clear that wiping over turban (cap) is also correct. There are two forms of it. First, to wipe partly on the turban and partly on the head. There is no difference of opinion on this form of action. Secondly, to wipe only on turban. There is a difference of opinion on this, but this is also proved by Sahih Hadith narrated by Tirmidhi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22]         Jabir was an Ansari from Sulami clan and he was nicknamed Abu &#8216;Abdullah. He was among the eminent Sahaba. He fought at Badr though some said that he did not witness neither Badr nor Uhud, but took part in those battles that followed them. He was also at Siffin. He was among the memorizers of many Ahadith. He became blind towards the end of his life, and died in 74 H at the age of 94 years. It is reported that he was the last Sahabi to die at Al-Madina.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23]         Noble Quran has mentioned As-Safa in the first place between As-Safa and Al-Marwa. The</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Started Sa&#8217;i (running between the Safa and Marwa during Hajj and &#8216;Umrah) from the Safa side, so start ablution in the same manner, starting from washing of the face, then hands up to elbows; then wipe the head and wash the feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24]         In this Hadith the word (bada) has been used in Arabic text, in the sense of giving information instead of order</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25]         In this regard, there exist contradictory Ahadith, which indicate opposing views about saying (Bismillah) before performing ablution. Correct answer of this issue is to say <i>Bismillah</i> is Sunna.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[26]         He is Sa&#8217;id bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr Al-Qurashi, nicknamed Abu Al-A&#8217;war and is one of the ten who were promised Paradise. He accepted Islam very early and was married to Fatima, the sister of &#8216;Umar, and they were both instrumental to &#8216;Umar becoming a Muslim. He fought all the battles except Badr, because he was away looking for the caravan. He died in 51 H. and was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[27]         He is Abu Muhammad or Abu &#8216;Abdullah Talha bin Musarrif. He was a reliable Tabi&#8217;i (see glossary) of the 5th grade. He was a righteous reciter of the Quran, and died in 112 H. His father Musarrif is unknown and that has made this Hadith Da&#8217;if</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[28]         He is called Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Amr or Amr bin Ka&#8217;b bin Juhdub Al-Yami &#8212; descending from a Yamani tribe called Yam of Hamadan. Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Bar said he (Ka&#8217;b) settled in Kufa and is a Sahabi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29]         It means that the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), used to take water separately for cleaning the nose and rinsing the mouth. According to the author, this Hadith is Da&#8217;if (weak). According to Al-Bukhari and Muslim, the noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم used a single handful of water for cleaning the nose and rinsing the mouth. Imam Nawawi has stated its five forms and regarded sound the one, Al-Bukhari and Muslim has stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[30]         This Hadith makes it clear that washing of the whole foot is obligatory. In a Hadith recorded by Muslim, it is stated that it is Fire for that part of the foot, which is dry. In this Hadith, there is repudiation for those who consider the Mash (wiping) of foot as proper and acceptable; or those who consider the Mash (wiping) and Ghusl (washing) both compulsory; or those who consider Mash and Ghusl both permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[31]         One Mudd is equal to six hundred grams approx., and one Sa&#8217; is equal to a little more than two and a half kilograms, and this is the least quantity to be used. It means that one should be very careful in the use of water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[32]         One Sa &#8216; is equivalent to 4 Mudd or 2660 grams</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[33]         The second Guided Caliph who was unique throughout history. He filled the world with wisdom, justice and conquests. He was Qurash&#8217;s ambassador during the <i>Jahiliya</i> (ignorance) period. He accepted Islam in Dhul Hijja, the 6th year of the Prophet-hood and fought all the battles. He made conquests in Iraq, Persia, Sham, Egypt and other places. He was killed by Abu Lu&#8217;lu&#8217;a, a slave of Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba and died as a martyr on 1st Muharram 24H.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 5: Mash (Wiping) Over Khuffain<br />
(Two Leather Socks)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba (رضي الله عنه): Once I was in the company of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), he then performed ablution and I dashed to take off his socks (Khuffain). He said, &#8220;Leave them for I had put them on after performing ablution[1].&#8221; So he wiped over them.<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Al-Arba’a except An-Nasa’i: The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) wiped over the upper part of the leather socks and the under part of it.<br />
[In its chain of narrators there is weakness]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): If the religion were based on opinion,[2] it would be more important to wipe over the under parts of the leather socks than the upper, but I have seen Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) wiping over the upper parts of his leather socks.<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud with good Isnad (chain of narrators)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin &#8216;Assal[3] (رضي الله عنه): When we were on a journey,[4] the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to command us to wear our leather socks for three days and three nights,[5] whether we had to answer the call of nature or slept. However, in case of ejaculation or sexual impurity, he commanded us to remove the leather socks.<br />
[Reported by An-Nasa&#8217;i and At-Tirmidhi, version is of the latter. With them Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) fixed the period of Mash (wiping) over the leather socks (Khuffain &#8212; plural of Khuff) for three days and nights for a traveler and one day and a night for the resident person in a town<br />
[Reported by Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Thawban[6] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) sent out a military expedition and commanded them to wipe over the turbans[7] and leather socks.<br />
[Reported by Ahmad and Abu Da’ud. Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه) in a Mawquf (untraceable) and Anas in a Marfu &#8216; (traceable) Hadith: &#8220;If one of you performs ablution and puts on his two leather socks, let him perform Mash (wipe) over them (with water) and pray in them, and he may not take them off if he so wishes[8] except after ejaculation or sexual impurity.<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni and Al-Hakim and graded Sahih (sound) by him]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra[9] (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) gave permission for the traveler to perform Mash (wiping) over his leather socks for three days and nights and for a non-traveler for a day and a night, if he had put them on in a state of purity.<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni, and graded Sahih (sound) by Ibn Khuzaima]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ubai bin &#8216;Imara[10] (رضي الله عنه): I asked, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, may I wipe over the Khuffain (leather socks)?&#8221; The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. I asked, &#8220;For one day?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;For one day&#8221;. I again asked, &#8220;And for two days?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;For two days too&#8221;. I again asked, &#8220;And for three days?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, as long as you wish&#8221;.[11]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud, who said, &#8220;It is not strong.&#8221;[12]]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           Mash (wiping) over the socks is conditioned. One should have put on the socks after performing ablution, if socks have been worn without performing an ablution then wiping over the socks is not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           It means that the religious commands and prohibitions are based on Revelation and not on prudence. One cannot accept or reject the orders on their comprehension or incomprehension. It does not mean that the commands and prohibitions of religion are against the intellect and wisdom. It also proves that in the presence of a Sahih (authentic and sound) Hadith, giving a verdict against it is not allowed, that is why it has been clarified in Islamic Jurisprudence and its principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Safwan bin ‘Assal Al-Muradi Al-Jumali was a well-known Sahabi who had accompanied the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in twelve Ghazwat (expeditions). He settled at Kufa and it is said that among the Sahaba, only &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas’ud reported a Hadith from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           Mash (wiping) over the socks is right, and permitted by Ahadith. There are more than eighty (80) Companions of the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) who have narrated and spoke about this topic. &#8216;Ashra-e-Mubashshara (ten most pious companions of the noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم, who were given the glad tiding of Paradise in this world) are also included in the list of reporters. Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Barr has related the consensus of opinion concerning this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           It means that Mash (wiping) is allowed for a traveler up to three days and for a resident up to thirty-four hours. The time period for Mash starts from the nullification of ablution and not from the time of wearing the socks. The way of carrying out Mash (wiping) is to soak the hands with water and starting from the fingers, drawing it up to the calf of the leg. After the completion of permitted time and by passing of the wind, urine, etc., Mash nullifies, and is also cancelled by all those things, which cancel or nullify the ablution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           He is Thawban bin Bujdud bin Jahdar, who was nicknamed Abu &#8216;Abdullah. He was an inhabitant of As-Surat, which is a place between Makka and Al-Madina. It was also said that he was from Himyar. He stayed with the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) throughout his life, then settled in Sham and later on moved to Hims, in which he died in 54 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           In Arabic text the word Asa&#8217;ib stands for a bandage, which is used for dressing of wounds; or in case of broken leg or arm, over the wooden strips around the broken bone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           ‘If he so wishes&#8217; means within the permitted time for Mash (wiping). After the completion of Mash time, it is a must to take off the socks and perform ablution afresh and wash the feet too and put on the socks again then the time for Mash will start anew.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           His name is Nufai&#8217; bin Al-Harith or bin Al-Masuh. He descended from Ta&#8217;if Fort together with a group of slaves and became a Muslim, whereupon the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) freed him. He was among the virtuous Sahaba and died at Basra in 51 H or 52 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         Ubai bin &#8216;Imara was a Sahabi from the Ansar of Al-Madina. He settled in Egypt. Ibn Hibban said, &#8220;He prayed to the two Qiblah, but I do not take his report as a complete chain of narrators.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         Sanad (transmitted chain) of this Hadith is not sound. That Hadith in which the period of one day (twenty-four hours) for a resident and three days for a traveler is granted is sound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         This Hadith was not taken as evidence for its weakness and for contradicting the sound and good Hadith that fixed the durations. An-Nawawi has mentioned in Sharh Al- Muhadhdhab that the Imam have agreed on the weakness of this Hadith and Ahmad said, &#8221; Its narrators are unknown.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 6: The Nullification[1] of Wudu (Ablution)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas (رضي الله عنه): The Companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in his lifetime used to wait for the &#8216;<i>Isha</i> (night) prayer, so much so that their heads were lowered down (by dozing)[2]. They would then pray without performing ablution.[3]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and Ad- Daraqutni graded it Sahih (sound). Its origin is in Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Fatima bint Abu Hubaish[4] came to the Prophet r (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I am a woman whose blood keeps flowing (even after the menstruation period).[5] I am never purified; should I, therefore, stop praying?&#8221; He (the Prophet) said, &#8220;No, for that is only a vein, and is not menstruation. So when the menstruation comes, abstain from prayers, and when it ends, wash the blood from your self and then pray.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon].<br />
Al-Bukhari’s version adds: &#8220;Then perform ablution for every prayer,&#8221;[6] and Muslim admitted that he dropped this addition deliberately.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib (رضي الله عنه): I was one whose <i>Madhi</i> (urethral discharge)[7] flowed readily and asked Miqdad[8] to ask the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about it. He (the Prophet) said: &#8220;One should perform Wudu (ablution) in this case.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon and this is Al-Bukhari&#8217;s version]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) kissed[9] one of his wives and went to pray without performing (fresh) ablution.<br />
[Reported by Ahmad, and Al-Bukhari graded it Da’if (weak)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If one of you feels disturbance in his stomach and doubts whether he has released some air or not, then he should not leave the mosque unless he hears its sound or smells (its) odor.[10]&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Talq bin &#8216;Ali[11] (رضي الله عنه): A man said: &#8220;I touched my penis&#8221; or he said, &#8220;Does a man who touch his penis during the prayer should perform <i>Wudu</i> (ablution)?&#8221; The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), replied, &#8220;No, it is only a part of your body.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa[12]. Ibn Hibban graded it Sahih (sound) and Ibn Al-Madini said, &#8220;It is better than the Hadith of Busra&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Busra bint Safwan[13] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;He who touches his penis should perform ablution.&#8221;[14]<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa, and At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Hibban graded it Sahih (sound), and Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;It is the most authentic (Hadith) in this chapter&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Whoever vomits, bleeds through the nose[15], or releases <i>Madhi</i>(urethral discharge) should go, perform ablution and then complete his <i>Salat</i> (prayer)[16] (by continuing from where he had stopped at) on condition that he does not speak in the process.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ibn Majah, and Ahmad and others graded it Da&#8217;if].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin Samura[17] (رضي الله عنه): A man asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), &#8220;Should I perform ablution after eating mutton?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you wish so&#8221;, he then asked, &#8220;Should I perform ablution after eating camel meat?[18] He(صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;Whoever washes a dead person[19] should take a bath (thereafter); and whoever carries it should perform ablution.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ahmad, An-Nasa’i and At-Tirmidhi who graded it Hasan (fair). And Ahmad said that there is no authentic <i>Hadith</i> in this chapter]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Abu &#8216;Bakr[20] (رضي الله عنه): The book written by Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) for &#8216;Amr bin Hazm[21] also contained: &#8220;None except a pure person should touch the Quran[22].<br />
[Reported by Malik as a <i>Mursal</i> and by An-Nasa’i and Ibn Hibban as <i>Mawsul</i>. And it is graded as <i>Ma&#8217;lul</i> (defective)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to mention A11ah&#8217;s Name (praise Him) at all times.[23]<br />
[Reported by Muslim and Al-Bukhari recorded it as Mu&#8217;allaq (suspended)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) had blood extracted from his body[24] and offered the prayer and did not perform (a new) ablution.<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni who graded it Da’if (weak)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mu’awiya[25] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;The eye (when awake) is the string of anus (to stop air escaping), and if the two eyes sleep the string is untied.&#8221;[26]<br />
[Reported by Ahmad and At-Tabardni who added, &#8220;Whoever sleeps should perform ablution.]&#8221; Also reported by Abu Da’ud mentioning the above addition without the words &#8220;the string is untied&#8221;, but both versions are weak]. And Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه), narrated in a <i>Marfu&#8217;</i> (traceable) Hadith that: &#8220;Ablution is necessary for one who sleeps while he is lying flat[27].&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and there is weakness in its chain of narrators]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Satan comes to one of you in Salat (prayer) and blows air in his bottom, so he imagines that he has released air yet he did not. So if he gets that feeling he should not leave his prayer unless he hears the sound (of the air) or smells its odor.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Bazzar] . It is originally from the <i>Sahihain</i> of Bukhari and Muslim as the Hadith narrated by &#8216;Abdullah bin Zaid. And Muslim reported by Abu Huraira likewise. And Abu Sa&#8217;id narrated in a Marfu&#8217; Hadith: &#8220;If Satan comes to one of you and says: &#8216;You have nullified your ablution (by releasing air)&#8217;, let him say: &#8216;You have lied.'&#8221; [Reported by Al-Hakim]. Ibn Hibban also reported the above Hadith with the version: &#8220;Let him say in his heart&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           All those causes which invalidate the Wudu (ablution) also invalidate the <i>Tayammum </i>(purification with clean soil in case the water is not available).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           It proves that ablution is not cancelled by dozing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Sleep invalidates the ablution or not, is a controversial issue. In this matter final decision is that with a sound sleep ablution is nullified, otherwise not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           Fatima bint Abu Hubaish is a <i>Sahabiya</i> from <i>Quraish</i> and then <i>Asad</i>. Her father is Qais bin &#8216;Abdul-Muttalib bin Asad bin &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Uzza bin Qusai. She was a renowned <i>Muhajira</i> and was married to &#8216;Abdullah bin Jahsh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           Vaginal bleeding is of three types: 1) <i>Haid</i> &#8211; Blood of regular monthly menstrual course which starts at the age of puberty. This type of blood ceases during the period of pregnancy. 2) <i>Nifas</i> &#8211; Puerperal blood coming after the childbirth, it lasts maximum for forty days. 3) <i>Istihada</i> &#8211; The blood which may happen to come differently from the above two types. Here it means the last mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           It means that the <i>Istihada</i> blood invalidates the ablution, that is why the noble Prophet (PUH), ordered to perform a fresh ablution for every prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Madhi is a white water like lubricant, which oozes out involuntarily at the time of sexual desire. This urethral discharge invalidates the ablution, but is not a cause for obligatory bath</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           Miqdad bin &#8216;Amr bin Tha&#8217;laba Al-Bahrani was nicknamed Abul-Aswad or Abu &#8216;Amr and is known as Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad. Al-Aswad bin Yaghuth Az-Zuhri had fostered and entered into a defense agreement with Miqdad in the Jahiliya days. He was among the virtuous, wise and eminent Sahaba. He was the sixth Muslim, made the two migrations and attended all the major battles. He was a horseman during Badr and participated in the conquest of Egypt. He died at the age of 70 in 33 H. at Al-Jauf, three miles from Al- Madina so he was carried to Al-Madina, &#8216;Uthman offered his Funeral prayer, and was buried at Al-Baqi&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           This Hadith confirms that ablution is not cancelled by touching a woman with or without lust. This is supported by a reporting of Imam Bukhari narrated by &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was praying in the darkness and I was laying at rest while my feet were at the place where the Prophet prostrated (on his prayer mat). At the time of prostration he would touch my feet and I would remove them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         This Hadith points out an important principle that everything remains at its command until there is something certain against it. Suspicion carries no weight, whether one is in prayer or not</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         He is Abi Ali Talq bin Ali bin Talq bin &#8216;Amr Al-Hanafi As-Siheimi Al-Yamami. He visited the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as soon as he arrived at Al-Madina and worked with him in building the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         Ahmad, Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         Busra bint Safwan bin Naufal bin Asad bin &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Uzza Al-Qurashiya Al-Asadiya was a Sahabiya, among the first Muslims, migrated early and lived till the caliphate of <i>Mu&#8217;awiya</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         Foregoing Hadith of Talq bin Ali seems to be contradictory to this, but infect it is not. If the organ is touched uncovered or with lustful intention, then the ablution is nullified, otherwise not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]         This Hadith is Da’if (weak), and there is no Sahih (sound) Hadith concerning this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]         It means that if a man prayed two <i>Rak&#8217;a</i> with the <i>Imam</i> (leader of prayer) and it happens that his ablution is cancelled. He leaves the prayer and after making a fresh ablution joins again with the <i>Imam</i> in the same part of prayer where he left, then he should finish the prayer with <i>Imam</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17]         He is a famous Sahabi and the son of Sa&#8217;d bin Abi Waqqas&#8217; sister. He settled at Kufa and built a house there. He died in 74 H. or 66 H. His father Samura bin Junada As-Sawai Al. &#8216;Aamiri is also a Sahabi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]         Some people mean by this the complete ablution and others mean only the rinsing of mouth. Latter view is correct because the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) pointed out fat as its cause and fat always sticks in the mouth only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]     Concerning this issue there is no authentic Hadith. Some say that bath is compulsory on one who bathes the dead body, some others are of the opinion that it is just desirable; while to others ablution is compulsory, and there are still others who consider it also not necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]         &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Bakr bin Muhammad bin &#8216;Amr bin Hazm Al-Ansari Al-Madani Al- Qadi was a Tabi&#8217;i of the 5th grade. He died in 135 H. at the age of 70 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21]         He is a Khazraji, a Najari and is nicknamed Abu Ad-Dahhak. He first took part in Al-Khandaq and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) sent him to Najran to teach the people about the religion and collect their <i>Sadaqat</i>. He wrote for them a book containing the obligatory and voluntary acts, the <i>Sadaqat</i> and the blood wit, and this is the book mentioned in the Hadith. He died in Al-Madina after the fifties</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22]         <i>Hadath</i> <i>Akbar</i> (sexual discharge) and <i>Hadath</i> <i>Asghar</i> (passing wind, urine or defecation) both make the purification due, if Hadath (impurity) is the result of coition then it is unanimously agreed not to touch the noble Quran, but there is a difference of opinion in doing that without ablution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23]         The times of answering the call of nature, urination and coition are not included. In the state of being impure by coition, remembrance and pronouncing the Name of Allah is permissible, but touching and reciting the noble Quran is prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24]         This Hadith clarifies that bleeding except from two (vagina and anus) does not invalidate the ablution. Ahadith of same class have also been narrated by Ibn &#8216;Umar, Ibn &#8216;Abbas and Abi Aufa (رضي الله عنه)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25]         Both him and his father Abu Sufyan Sakhr bin Harb became Muslims at the conquest of Makka. &#8216;Umar appointed him as the governor of Sham after the death of his brother Yazid bin Abu Sufyan and he remained so until &#8216;Ali came out in order to dispose him by force and he was sworn as the caliph when Al-Hasan stepped down in his favor in the year 40 H. He died in <i>Rajab</i> 60 H. at the age of 78 years</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[26]         It means sleep is a cause of Hadath (impurity) and not Hadath itself</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[27]         It means that sleeping in the flat position results in the invalidation of ablution, whereas in the foregoing Hadith mere sleep is described as the factor of invalidation. Sleeping in the flat position is an indication of sound sleep, when all the organs of body are at rest, it enhances the possibility of uncontrolled passing of wind; while in a light sleep or napping one is not completely unconscious.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 7: The Manners of Answering<br />
the Call of Nature</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to remove his ring[1] when entering the lavatory.<br />
[Reported by Al-Arba&#8217;a[2], and it is defective]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated (Anas) (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on entering the lavatory used to say[3]: [<i>Alla’humma inni a&#8217;udhu bika minal khubthi wal khaba&#8217;ithi</i>] &#8220;O Allah, I seek refuge with you from devils &#8211; males and females (or all offensive and wicked things, evil deeds and evil spirits, etc.).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by As-Sab&#8217;a].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated (Anas) (رضي الله عنه): Whenever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) went to the privy, a servant and I used to carry a skin water container and a spear, and he would cleanse himself with the water[4]<br />
[Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told me, &#8220;Take the skin water container&#8221;, he then went forward till he disappeared[5] from me and relieved himself.<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Safeguard your selves from the two matters which cause ac cursing that befalls the one who relieves himself on people&#8217;s path-ways[6] and under the shades.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim]<br />
Narrated Mu’adh[7] (رضي الله عنه): He (the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;Guard against the three things which cause curse (i.e.) defecating at the watering places, on the roadbeds and in the shades.&#8221;[8]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud]. Ahmad reported from Ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه) that defecation is prohibited also at the place where water collects.<br />
[And both the two (i.e. the previous and this Hadith) have weakness.<br />
And Ibn &#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه) the prohibition of relieving oneself under fruity trees and on the bank of a flowing river.<br />
[Reported by At-Tabardni with a weak chain of narrators]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;When two people go together to relieve themselves they should disappear from each other and do not talk, for Allah detests that.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ahmad; Ibn As-Sakan and Ibn Al-Qattan graded it Sahih (sound) but &#8216;it is defective[9]].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Qatada (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Nobody should touch his penis with his right hand[10] when urinating, and should not clean himself (from defecation or urine) using his right hand and should not breathe in the utensil (he is drinking from).&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon. This version is of Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salman[11] (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) forbade us to face the <i>Qiblah</i> when defecating or urinating, or to clean ourselves using the right hand, or to clean ourselves with less than three stones, or to clean ourselves with dung or a bone.<br />
[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ayub[12] (رضي الله عنه): (Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said,) &#8220;Neither face nor turn your back to the Qiblah[13] while defecating or urinating, but turn towards the east or the west.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by the As-Sab&#8217;a]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If anyone goes to relieve himself, he should conceal himself.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated (&#8216;Aisha رضي الله عنه): When the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) came out of the privy, he used to say, &#8220;<i>Ghufra’naka</i> (O Allah! Grant me Your forgiveness).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa[14]. Abu Hatim and Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Mas’ud (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) went out to answer the call of nature and asked me to bring three stones. I found two stones and searched for the third but could not find it. So I took a dried piece of dung and brought it to him. He took the two stones and threw away the dung[15] and said, &#8220;This is a filthy thing&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by Al-Bukhari. And in the version of Ahmad and Ad-Daraqutni it is added: &#8220;Bring me more[16] (something other than dung)&#8221;]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) forbade us to use a bone or dung for cleaning and said, &#8220;These two things do not purify.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni who graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): A11ah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Beware of (smearing yourselves with) urine, because it is the main cause of punishment in the grave.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni]<br />
and Al-Hakim reported that: &#8220;Urination is the main cause of punishment in the grave&#8221;.<br />
[Its chain of narrators is authentic]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sura’qa bin Malik[17] (رضي الله عنه): A11ah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) educated us about lavatory (manners) that we should sit on our left foot[18] and keep erect our right foot.<br />
[Reported by Al-Baihaqi through a chain of weak narrators][19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Iesa bin Yazdad[20] from his father (رضي الله عنه,): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;When one of you passes urine, he should empty his penis three times.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ibn Majah through a weak chain of narrators]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) asked the residents of Quba’ that what had earned them the Praise of Allah and they replied, &#8220;We use water after (cleaning ourselves with) stones.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Bazzar with <i>Da&#8217;if</i> chain of narrators and its <i>Asl</i> (original source) is in Abu Da’ud and At-Tirmidhi, and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound) through Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه) without mentioning the &#8220;stones.&#8221;]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           On that ring “Allah’s Messenger Muhammad” (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was carved in three lines. It means that Names of Allah and the verses of noble Quran in the written form should not be carried to the lavatory or while going out to answer the call of nature.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i and Ibn Majah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Usually <i>jinns</i> live in such filthy places, for that reason the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) sought the refuge of Allah. Before entering the lavatory one should recite this prayer in an audible voice. According to the narration of Anas (رضي الله عنه), in wilds or in jungle, one should recite this prayer before sitting for the call of nature. During the call of nature one should also be careful about one&#8217;s body and clothes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           Most of the people [religious scholars] prefer to purify with clod of mud and water both.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           This action of the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) guides that while going out for the call of nature, it is necessary to arrange some kind of privacy and be hidden from others. In another Hadith, it is stated that in an open space, a mound of soil or a heap of sand should be made for the purpose of screening. If someone eases himself in an open, Satan will laugh at his buttocks and will make him a laughing stock of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           It is prohibited to answer the call of nature near pathways or near the ways in the vicinity of populated areas. Sites of abandoned road or deserted place can be used for the purpose</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Mu’adh is an <i>Ansari</i> of Al-Khazraj tribe and was one of the virtuous, noble and most learned Sahaba. He attended Al-&#8216;Aqaba, Badr and other major battles. The Prophet ·(صلى الله عليه و سلم) appointed him as his representative in Yemen. Then &#8216;Umar appointed him as the governor of Sham after Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah. He died in the plague of <i>Amwa’s</i> in 17H or 18 H at the age of 38.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           Altogether these are six places. It is forbidden in a <i>Hadith</i> to answer the call of nature or to urinate near the gates of the mosques.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           This is confirmed by other authentic <i>Ahadith</i>, so it is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         Handling the male organ with right hand during urination or washing, and breathing in the utensils during drinking is prohibited according to some, while according to others it is undesirable. Breathing in the utensil is harmful because this is the cause of transmission of germs from one to another, and the Hadith which informs about three pauses while drinking means drink should be taken slowly and not at a gulp.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         He was known as &#8220;Salman the benevolent&#8221; and was nicknamed Abu &#8216;Abdullah. His origin is from Persia. He traveled in search of a religion and became a Christian. Then he moved to Al-Madina and believed in the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as soon as he arrived at Al-Madina He was a leader in Islam and died in Al-Madina in 50 H or 32 H. It is reported that he lived long for either 250 or 350 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]         His name is Khalid bin Zaid bin Kulaib. He hosted the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) when he first arrived in Al-Madina. He was one of the senior and most great <i>Sahaba</i>. He attended Badr and was martyred while taking part in an expedition against the Byzantinians in 50 H. His grave, situated at the walls of Istanbul, is well known and visited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         In this issue &#8216;Forbiddance&#8217; is for open places, it is not forbidden in inside the building where there are walls around. As there is a Hadith narrated by &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه). He narrates: &#8220;In the house of my sister Hafsa, I went upstairs on the roof, I saw the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) answering the call of nature, he was facing towards Sham.&#8221; This Hadith is of Sahih Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         The Collectors of Hadith: Ahmad, Abu Da’ud, An-Nasa’i, At-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15]         It is known from this Hadith that one should not clean the private parts with dung or excrement of animals, and so it is forbidden to clean with bones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16]         The mentioned addition proves that for cleanliness three clods of mud are needed, even though two may suffice, but the condition of three is a must. More than three may be used if needed, but the number should be odd. This Hadith also proves that dung cannot be used for cleaning private parts, likewise cleaning by bones is also prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17]         Sura’qa bin Malik bin Ju&#8217;shum Al-Mudlaji Al-Kinani, nicknamed Abu Sufyan was a prominent Sahabi. He was the one who traced Allah’s Messenger (رضي الله عنه) on his way to migration whereupon the forelegs of his horse sunk into the ground up to the knees. He died in 24 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18]         There is always advisability in every command of Islam, whether we comprehend it or not The noble Prophet b (صلى الله عليه و سلم) instructed us to sit on the left foot (to put weight of the body on left foot) while sitting for answering the call of nature; as the stomach is on the left side, it makes the action easy; and the constipation, the mother of diseases, is also eradicated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19]         This Hadith is weak because there are unknown narrators in its chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20]         &#8216;Iesa and his father Yazdad are both unknown. Ibn Ma&#8217;in said, &#8221; &#8216;Iesa and his father are unknown.”</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 8: Taking Ghusl (Bath) and the Precepts Regarding Sexual Impurity.</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;The water (of the Ghusl is due to the water (of sexual emission)”[1].<br />
[Reported by Muslim and its <i>Asl</i> (origin) is in Al-Bukhari].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): AllahÐh&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said that, &#8220;If one of you sits between her legs (of a woman) and penetrates her[2], Ghusl (bath) is obligatory.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon]<br />
And Muslim added: &#8220;Even if he does not ejaculate.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Umm Salama (رضي الله عنه): Umm Sulaim[3], the wife of Abu Talha said, &#8220;O Allah’s Messenger! (صلى الله عليه و سلم) A11ah is not ashamed of the truth. Is a Ghusl (bath) compulsory for a woman when she has a sexual dream.&#8221;[4] He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) replied, &#8220;Yes! When she sees signs of liquid.&#8221;<br />
[Agreed upon.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Said about the precept of a woman having ejaculation during sleep like a man, &#8220;She should take a Ghusl (bath)&#8221;.<br />
[Agreed upon]<br />
Added Muslim: Umm Salama said, &#8220;Does this happen (to a woman)?&#8221; He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Yes, otherwise where does the resemblance (of a child to its mother) come from)[5]?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to take a bath from four things; after sexual intercourse, on Fridays, after extracting blood from his body and after washing a dead body.[6].<br />
[Reported by Abu Da’ud and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه), regarding the story of Thumama bin Utha’l[7] when he embraced Islam: The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ordered him to take a bath.[8]<br />
[Narrated by Abdur- Razzaq and its origin is in Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">100. Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Taking a bath on Friday is a must for every adult&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by As-Sab&#8217;a[9]].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">101. Narrated Samura[10] [2] (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Whoever performs ablution on Friday has done a good thing and he who takes bath, taking bath is better (for him).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa[11] and At-Tirmidhi graded it Hasan (fair)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">102. Narrated &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to teach us the Quran except when he was in a state of sexual impurity[12].<br />
[Reported by Ahmad and Al-Arba’a·. This is the version of At-Tirmidhi who graded it Hasan (fair). And Ibn Hibban graded it Sahih (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">103. Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;If one of you has sexual intercourse with his wife, and wishes to repeat he should perform ablution [1] [13]between them.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Muslim.]<br />
Al-Hakim added: &#8220;Ablution makes one active for repeating (the sexual act).&#8221;<br />
Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to sleep in the state of sexual impurity without touching water[14].<br />
[Reported by Al-Arba &#8216;a. This Hadith is defective.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">104. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Whenever Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) took Ghusl (bath) after sexual intercourse, he would begin by washing his hands, then pour water with his right hand on his left hand and wash his sexual organ. He would then perform ablution, then take some water and run his fingers through the roots of his hair. Then he would pour three handfuls on his head, then pour water over the rest of his body and subsequently wash his feet.<br />
[Agreed upon and this version is of Muslim]. Narrated Maimuna (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) poured water over his private parts and washed them with his left hand. He then struck his hand against the earth. In another version: &#8216;He rubbed it on the earth.&#8217; And in the last of this version: “Then I brought him a towel[15] but he returned it and kept wiping off the water with his hand.”<br />
[Agreed upon].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">105. Narrated Umm Salama (رضي الله عنه): I said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I am a woman with tightly plaited hair on my head; should I undo it for taking a bath from sexual intercourse?<br />
&#8220;In another version is: &#8220;from menstruation?&#8221; He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;No, it is enough for you to throw three handfuls of water[16] on your head&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">106. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;I do not permit a woman in menstrual condition[17][3] or anyone in a state of sexual impurity to (enter) the mosque&#8221;.[18]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and Ibn Khuzaima graded it Sahih (sound)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">107.     Narrated (&#8216;Aisha رضي الله عنه): I and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) took a Ghusl (bath) due to sexual impurity from the same vessel and our hands alternated into it.<br />
[Agreed upon.] Ibn Hibban added &#8220;and (our hands) met.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">108. Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;There is sexual impurity under every hair[19], so wash the hair and cleanse the skin.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and At-Tirmidhi who both graded it Da&#8217;if (weak); and in the version of Ahmad, a similar Hadith is narrated by &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه), and in the chain is one narrator who is <i>Majhul</i> (unknown)].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           It means after seminal discharge, taking of bath is essential and obligatory. This Hadith is linked only with &#8216;night discharge&#8217; and not with coition. Most of the religious scholars believe in it. Ubai bin K&#8217;ab said that in the early period of Islam, in case of coition, taking of bath was not obligatory until the seminal discharge happened, but afterwards this order was abrogated. Some of the research scholars have reported the consensus of Muslims on this issue that as soon as coition is started, taking of Ghusl (bath) becomes obligatory, whether seminal discharge occurs or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           It means that with the start of coitus, taking of Ghusl (bath) becomes obligatory. This Hadith cancels the previous one, if linked with coition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Her name is Ar-Rumaisa&#8217; or Al-Ghumaisa&#8217; bint Milha’n, Anas bin Malik&#8217;s mother. She was among the virtuous Sahabiyat. She was married to Malik bin An-Nasr, then she became a Muslim and invited him to Islam, but he became angry and went to Sham where he died. She was then proposed to by Abu Talha while still a Mushrik, but she made a condition that he should become a Muslim, so he became one and married her. She died during the caliphate of&#8217; Uthman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           As Men, women also have “wet dreams”, so taking bath is obligatory for them too.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           It means that women also have seminal discharge otherwise how a child can take after the mother? Resemblance of children to their parents is on account of potency of semen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Among all these four, taking bath after coition is <i>Fard</i> (obligatory), on Friday is <i>Sunna </i>(the way of noble Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) and the rest of the two are <i>Mustahab </i>(desirable). Ahadith regarding obligation of Friday bath are more authentic, therefore, those are to be followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Thumama bin Utha’l was from Banu Hanifa and the chief of Al-Yamama people. He went to perform &#8216;Umrah while still a Mushrik and was captured by some horsemen of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم). They brought him to Al-Madina and tied him to one of the mosque&#8217;s pillars. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) released him after three days. He then became a devoted Muslim and stood firm, during the <i>Ridda</i> (apostasy) days, against his people who were cheated by Musailima Al-Kadhdhab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           When a non-Muslim embraces Islam, it is obligatory for him to take a bath. Abu Da’ud reported that the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) ordered Thumama to take a bath, when he embraced Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i, Ibn Majah and Musnad Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Samura bin Jundub is a well-known Sahabi nicknamed Abu .Abdullah. He was a Fazari and an ally of the <i>Ansar</i>. He was also one of the memorizers who narrated many Ahadith. He settled at Basra and was very harsh against Al-Haruriya. He died rewards the end of the year 59 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Abu Da’ud, Tirmidhi, Nasa’i, Ibn Majah and Musnad Ahmad</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] From this Hadith and from others it is proved that reading of noble Quran for a person, needing post-coition Ghusl (bath) is not right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] This ablution is desirable and not essential, it also brings about a pleasure and freshness in mood. It is reported that if the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to his different wives in one night, he used to take a Ghusl (bath) after going to each of them. It is also reported that he performed ablution in between and sometimes he did not. So, in this matter one can choose any mode.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] It means that before going to sleep, ablution is not essential for a <i>Junubi</i> (a man in the post-discharge state). There is a Hadith from Bukhari regarding this issue that the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to perform ablution before eating, drinking or sleeping. Therefore, it is better to follow the way of the noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) though it is merely preferable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] The issue of drying the limbs after performing ablution is discretionary, therefore, it depends on the choice whether to dry or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] This Hadith makes it clear that for a menstruating woman and Junubi (a man in the post-discharge state) it is not essential to unravel the hair. There is another Hadith from &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه), in which untying of hair is reported. Both the Ahadith are for different occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] A menstruating woman is not allowed to enter a mosque and circumambulate the Sacred Ka&#8217;ba. She should not pray or fast in this period. Prayers of this period are pardoned but she must fast later on. Reading and touching the noble Quran is also prohibited. She should also not recite a complete verse .f Quran at a time. Remembrance of Allah is allowed to her. She can participate in invocation upon Allah with other Muslims. She is allowed to go to the place of Eid prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] It means that a menstruating woman and a man in post-discharge state is not allowed to stay in a mosque but passing through is allowed. If somebody gets discharged as a result of wet dream during a sleep in a mosque, it is essential for him to go out. This is unanimously agreed upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] We come to know by this Hadith that it is obligatory to wash the whole body after having a sexual intercourse except rinsing of mouth and putting water in the nose because these two are controversial.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 9: Tayammum (Purification with Soil)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">109.    Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;I have been given five things which were not given to anyone else before me. Allah made me victorious by awe (of frightening my enemies) for a distance of one month&#8217;s journey. The earth has been made for me (and my followers) a place for praying and purification (performing <i>Tayammum</i>). Therefore, anyone (of my followers) should pray wherever the time of Salat (prayer)[1] becomes due.&#8221;[2]<br />
In the version of Muslim narrated by Hudhaifa: &#8220;The soil[3] of the earth has been made for us as a means of purification when we do not find water.&#8221;<br />
In the version of Ahmad narrated by &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): &#8220;The soil has been made for us a means of cleansing.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ammar bin Yasir[4] (رضي الله عنه): The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) sent me on an errand, then I had ejaculation (in my sleep) and I did not find water. (For performing Tayammum) I rolled on the soil like an animal. Then I returned to the Prophet and mentioned that to him. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;It was sufficient for you to do with your hands this way&#8221;. He then struck his hands once on the soil and then rubbed the left hand on the right and the exterior part of his palms and his face.<br />
[Agreed upon. The version is that of Muslim].<br />
And in the version of Al-Bukhari: &#8216;He (Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم) struck the earth with his palms of both hands[5] and then blew the dust and rubbed his palms of both hands over his face and hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Tayammum (purifying with the soil) consists of two strikings[6], of the soil, one for the face and one for the hands up to the elbows.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni, and the <i>Imam</i> graded it <i>Sahih</i> as Mawquf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira (رضي الله عنه): Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;The soil is a means of ablution for a believing Muslim, even if he does not find water for ten years[7]; but when he finds water he should guard against disobeying Allah and let it touch his skin.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by AI-Bazzar, and Al-Qattan graded it <i>Sahih</i>  (sound).  But Ad-Daraqutni approved it as <i>Mursal</i>, At-Tirmidhi also reported a similar version on the authority of Abu Dhar,[8] which he authenticated and so did Al-Hakim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Two men set out on a journey and when the time of Salat (prayer) came they had no water. They performed Tayammum with clean earth and prayed. Later on they found water within the time of the prayer.  One of them repeated the prayer and ablution but the other did not repeat. Then they came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), and related the matter to him. Addressing himself to the one who did not repeat, he said, &#8220;You followed the Sunna and your (first) prayer was enough for you.&#8221;[9] He said to the one who performed ablution and repeated: &#8220;For you there is a double reward&#8221;.[10]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and An-Nasa&#8217;i]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه) regarding the explanation of the Words of Allah “And if you are ill[11] or on a journey&#8230;” If a man sustains a wound in the cause of Allah and an injury, then becomes sexually impure and fears death if he takes Ghusl (bath), he should perform Tayammum.<br />
[Reported by Ad- Daraqutni in a <i>Mawqu</i>f (untraceable) <i>Hadith</i> and Al-Bazzar in a <i>Marfu&#8217;</i> (traceable) one. Ibn Khuzaima and Al-Hakim graded it <i>Sahih</i> (sound)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali (رضي الله عنه): One of my forearms was broken. Then I asked Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and he ordered me to wipe over the bandages.[12]<br />
[Reported by Ibn Majah with a very weak chain of narrators].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir (رضي الله عنه) concerning the man who had sustained a cut on his head and took a bath and died: (Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said) &#8220;It was enough for him to perform Tayammum then bind a bandage over the wound and wipe water on it and then wash the rest of his body.&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud, its chain is <i>Da&#8217;if</i> and there is disagreement concerning its narrator].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas (رضي الله عنه): It is the Sunna that a person should not pray more than once [13]with a (one) Tayammum and he should perform Tayammum for the next Salat (prayer).<br />
[Reported by Ad-Daraqutni with a very weak chain of narrators][14]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           It means that if water is not available, one should not miss the first part of prayer time in search of water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           Other three things are: a) Booty has been made lawful; b) Intercession on the Day of Judgment; c) Messengership for the whole universe</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Soil and all other things from the kind of soil are regarded as same and <i>Tayammum</i> is permissible with them, but things like lime, antimony and arsenic, etc. do not fall in the kind of soil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           &#8216;Ammar was nicknamed Abul-Yaqzan, and was among the most senior and early Muslims, and was tortured in Makka for his Faith. He made the two migrations and took part in Badr and all the other important battles. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told him, &#8220;O &#8216;Ammar, the transgressive party will kill you.&#8221; This happened in Siffin in 36 H. when he was with &#8216;Ali and he was killed by some soldiers of Mu’awiya at the age of 73 years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           This Hadith argues about Tayammum (purification with soil). Religious elites are of the opinion that one stroke on earth is enough for face and both hands. Some others say that two strokes are essential, one for face and the other for hands as is mentioned in the next Hadith. But all Ahadith, which mention ‘two strokes’, are Da’if (weak).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           The scholars of Ahadith have regarded this Hadith as <i>Da’if</i> (weak), and all its chains are also weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           It means that at the time of necessity soil is a complete substitute of water and fulfills all purposes of purification whether it concerns ablution, or <i>Ghusl</i> (bath). With one <i>Tayammum</i> many obligatory acts can be performed, if there is no factor, which nullifies it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           Abu Dhar&#8217;s name was Jundub bin Junada, and he was among the most prominent Sahaba and an ascetic. He became a Muslim very early at Makka. Then went back to his people. He came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), at Al-Madina and later settled and died at Rabdha in 32 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           It means that if somebody has already prayed a certain prayer by performing Tayammum, then there is no need to repeat the prayer, even afterwards water is found and still there is time for the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]         It was not necessary to pray again, if the prayer had been offered by performing Tayammum. The second person got double reward not for the reason that he prayed again but for the exercise of judgment regarding the problem, which was although wrong but there is one reward for a wrong judgment. Second reason for earning double reward may be that he prayed twice, once with <i>Tayammum</i> and once with ablution</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]         It means that when you intend for prayer and there is some hindrance in performing ablution or having <i>Ghusl</i> (bath), the <i>Tayammum</i> is essential. Here illness means some serious disease and not the ordinary boils and eruptions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12]     Ðp;    The word in Arabic is <i>Jaba&#8217;ir</i> used for those wooden strips, which are placed around the broken arm or leg for support and to keep it straight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13]         Since Tayammum (purification with soil) is a substitute for ablution, it works the same. Many prayers can be offered with one ablution, in the same way many prayers can be offered with one Tayammum. Some people after performing Tayammum for coition or wet dream hesitate to enter the mosque or to recite the Quran. This is only an evil apprehension and a satanic distraction and should not be cared for. In this Hadith Hasan bin &#8216;Ammar is weak in the chain of narrators. There are two other Ahadith on the same issue and both of them are <i>Da’if (</i>weak).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14]         This Hadith is weak because it was narrated by Hasan bin &#8216;Ammar who was weak, and due to this fact the Hadith scholars did not rely on it, but said that, &#8220;Allah has permitted for us the use of soil in the absence of water and since ablution becomes obligatory after passing urine, excreting or releasing air, so is the case of Tayammum.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter 10: Menstruation</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">118. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Fatima bint Abu Hubaish had a prolonged flow of blood[1] and Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم)· told her, &#8220;The menstruation blood is a dark recognizable blood, so if that comes then avoid prayer. And if it is the other  (light colored blood), then perform <i>Wudu</i> (ablution) and offer <i>Salat</i>  (prayer) (for that is blood of a vein).&#8221;<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and An-Nasa’i. Ibn Hibban and Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound). Abu Hatim termed it <i>Munkar</i> (unusual)]<br />
And in the Hadith of Asma bint ‘Umais[2] (رضي الله عنه) reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud, (the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:) &#8220;She should sit in a tub, and when she sees yellowish color on the top of the water, she should take a bath once for the <i>Zuhr</i> and <i>Asr</i> prayers, and take another bath for the <i>Maghrib</i> and <i>Isha</i> prayers, and take a bath once for the <i>Fajr</i> prayer, and in between these times she should perform ablution.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">119. Narrated Hamna bint Jahsh[3](رضي الله عنه): MY menstruation was too much and severe. So I came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to ask for his (religious) opinion. He said, &#8220;This is a stroke of the devil, so observe your menses for six or seven days, then take a bath and when you see that you are purified and quite clean, pray for twenty-three or twenty-four days, and fast and pray for that will suffice you. And do so every month just as the other women menstruate  (and are purified).  But if you are strong enough[4] to delay the Zuhr prayer and advance the Asr prayer then take a bath and combine the Zuhr and the Asr prayer; then delay the Maghrib prayer and advance the Isha prayer then take a bath and combine the two prayers, do so; and take a bath at Fajr.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم said of the two types of actions: &#8220;This one appeals more to my liking (i.e. taking a bath for every prayer)&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa except An- Nasa’i, At-Tirmidhi graded it Sahih (sound) and Al-Bukhari graded it Hasan (fair)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">120. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Umm Habiba bint Jahsh[5] complained to Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about the blood (which flows beyond the menstruation period). He said, &#8220;Keep away (from prayer) the length of time that your menses prevented you, then take a bath (and offer prayers)&#8221;. And she used to take a bath for every prayer[6].<br />
[Reported by Muslim.]<br />
In a version of Al-Bukhari is: &#8220;Perform ablution for every Salat (prayer)&#8221;. It has been reported by Abu Da’ud and others in another version</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">121. Narrated Umm Atiya[7] (رضي الله عنه): We considered it nothing (as impure) the muddiness and yellowness (of the fluids) after purification[8] (from menstruation).<br />
[Reported by Al-Bukhari and Abu Da&#8217;ud and version is of the latter].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">122. Narrated Anas (رضي الله عنه): The Jews used not to eat with a woman during her menstruation period, so the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Do every thing else apart from sexual intercourse (with your wives)&#8221;.<br />
[Reported by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">123. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), used to order me to put on an <i>Izar[9]</i> and then caress[10] me while menstruating.<br />
[Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">124. Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said regarding a husband who has sexual intercourse with his wife during her menstruation period, &#8220;He should give out (as atonement) one Dinar or ½ Dinar as alms”<br />
[Reported by Al-Khamsa. Al-Hakim and Ibn Al-Qattan graded it Sahih (sound). And others considered it to be Mawquf (untraceable)][11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">125. Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id AI-Khudri (رضي الله عنه): Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, &#8220;Is it not the case that a woman in her menstruation period neither prays nor fasts?&#8221;[12]<br />
[Agreed upon. It is part of a long Hadith]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">126. Narrated &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنه): When we came to a place called Sarif, I menstruated and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told me, &#8220;Do what a pilgrim does except that you don&#8217;t circumambulate round the Ka&#8217;ba until you are purified&#8221;.<br />
[Agreed upon and it is part of a long Hadith.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">127. Narrated Mu&#8217;adh (رضي الله عنه): He asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), “What is lawful for a man regarding his wife when she is menstruating?&#8221; and he replied, &#8220;What is above the waist wrapper (Izar).”[13]<br />
[Reported by Abu Da&#8217;ud and graded it Da&#8217;if.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">128. Narrated Umm Salama (رضي الله عنه): During the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) the women having bleeding after delivery (postnatal or puerperal blood) would refrain (from prayer) for forty days.[14]<br />
[Reported  by Al-Khamsa except An-Nasa’i, and the version is that of Abu Da’ud].<br />
And in another version of Abu Da’ud: &#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not command her to repeat the prayers (abandoned during the period of bleeding).&#8221; And Al-Hakim graded it Sahih (sound).</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]           <i>Istihada</i> may be either prolonged puerperium or prolonged menstruation period (and is regarded as bleeding between the periods). Period of menstruation, according to some scholars is from one to fifteen days; and according to others, its duration is from three to ten days. Experience confirms the later assertion. Every woman knows her period if bleeding exceeds the normal time then it would be <i>Istihada</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2]           She was the wife of Jafar bin Abu Talib. She had migrated with him to Abyssinia (Ethiopia) and bore him there children, among them was &#8216;Abdullah. Then Abu Bakr As-Siddiq married her after the martyrdom of Jafar at the battle of Mu&#8217;ta, and she bore him Muhammad. Ali bin Abu Talib also married her after the death of Abu Bakr and she bore him Yahya &#8216;Umar used to ask her the interpretation of dreams. She died after the death of &#8216;Ali.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]           Hamna bint Jahsh is the sister of the &#8216;Mother of the Believers&#8217; Zainab bint Jahsh. She was married to Mus&#8217;ab bin &#8216;Umair, who was martyred during the battle of Uhud after which she was married by Talha bin &#8216;Ubaidullah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4]           In this Hadith, Hamna was ordered to take a bath three times a day. One bath for Zuhr and Asr prayers; second for Maghrib and Isha; and third for Fajr. In the preceding Hadith Fatima bint Abu Hubaish was ordered merely to perform ablution before every prayer. It means in case of Istihada taking a bath is not compulsory but performing ablution is obligatory for every prayer. Taking a bath is preferable if weather conditions and health allows, otherwise there is no need to take bath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]           Habiba bint Jahsh was another sister of Zainab bint Jahsh,&#8217;the Mother of the Believers&#8217; and she was married to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf Muslim narrated that she had a prolonged flow of blood for seven years. She died in 44H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6]           It was only a precautionary or voluntary act of Umm Habiba to take a bath for every prayer. Authentic decision regarding this issue is to take a post-menstruation Ghusl (bath) and purify oneself. Concerning prolonged bleeding, there is an order to wash the blood and perform ablution for every prayer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]           Her name was Nusaiba bint Ka&#8217;b or bint Al-Harith Al-Ansariya. She was among the prominent Sahabiya women, and she used to accompany Allah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to battles, nursing the sick and treating the injured. She fought during the battle of Uhud like heroes. She witnessed the washing of the body of the daughter of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), which she perfected and narrated, and a number of Sahaba and Tabi’i Ulama at Basra recorded that from her. Her Hadith is considered to be the basis of washing the dead. She was counted to be among the Sahabiya who settled at Basra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8]           In the narration of&#8217; Aisha (رضي الله عنه), yellow and dusty colored water is considered as menses, but this Hadith states: &#8220;We considered it nothing.&#8221; Apparently both Ahadith appear to be opposing each other, but actually both are correct in their context. If the yellow or dusty color water oozes out in the menstruation period, it will be considered as &#8216;menses&#8217;; and if it percolates after the period, it is &#8216;nothing&#8217; as the word <i>B &#8216;ad At-Tuhr</i> gives the clue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9]           A cloth worn from the waistline downwards like a skirt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Those who do not believe in the Ahadith (i.e. deniers of Sunna), create ambiguity and doubt at this point, and make the people suspicious about the Ahadith. They assert that sexual intercourse in menstruation periods is prohibited by the noble Quran but according to this Hadith the Prophet would do it during that period, therefore, Hadith is not true. Literal meaning of <i>Mubasharat</i> is to touch and rub the body with the body, and speaking metaphorically it means coition.  In other Ahadith it has been clarified that sexual intercourse is strictly forbidden during menstruation, thus, it is quite a dishonesty to translate the word Mubasharat as sexual intercourse instead of &#8216;fondling&#8217; and create the suspicion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] This is a Da&#8217;if (weak) Hadith, therefore, most of the religious scholars do not deem it necessary to expiate, although some of the scholars are in favor of this opinion; but first opinion is correct because order is only for encouraging charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] This is a small portion of a long Hadith. The noble Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), while delivering a Khutba (religious talk) to the women, told them that their religion was imperfect. They asked, &#8220;How?&#8221; In the answer to their question, he spoke these words, which mean that a menstruating women should not pray or fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] &#8220;Everything above the Izar (dress worn below the waist)&#8221; may have two meanings: First, the Izar may be a figurative speech for &#8216;sexual intercourse&#8217;, in other words, except sexual intercourse everything is permitted. Secondly, it may metaphorically mean the portion of body related to Izar. But this meaning will contradict the other Hadith stating: &#8220;Do everything except intercourse·” Therefore, first meaning is preferable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] It means the maximum period of puerperal blood is forty days and minimum time for it is not fixed. If it continues more than forty days, it will be regarded as <i>Istihada</i> (bleeding between periods), which is not a hindrance for prayer, fasting and having sexual intercourse. Every command of the puerperium is identical to that of menstruation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Az-Zakah is Obligatory on the Wealth of the orphan and the Insane.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question: Is Az-Zakah obligatory on the wealth of the orphan and the insane?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is obligatory on the wealth of each of them, if the person is a free Muslim who has complete ownership of his wealth. This is due to what Ad-Daraqutni narrated that was reported as a statement of the Prophet (Sallallaahu alayhi wasallam): &#8220;Whoever is made the guardian over the wealth of an orphan, let him do business with it and he should not leave it to be devoured by chrity i.e, Az-Zakah).&#8221; [Ad-Daraqutni 2:109 no. 1951.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is due to what Malik narrated in Al-Muwatta&#8217; from &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Qasim from his father, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A&#8217;ishah used to keep me and my brother as two orphans in her appartment, and she used to pay Az-Zakah from our wealth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The view that Az-Zakah is obligatory upon the wealth of each of them (the orphan and the insane person)was held by &#8216;Ali, Ibn &#8216;Umar, Jabir, A&#8217;shah and Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali. Ibn Al-Mundhir related this from them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Az-Zakah on Wealth that is kept for Marriage 1.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man saved some money for his son over a number of years so that the son can get married. Is he obliged to pay any Zakah on this wealth of his? This is in consideration of the fact that he does not intend anything with this money other than getting his son married.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He must pay Az-Zakah on all of the money that he saved if it was in his possesion for a year, even if he intended to use this money to get his son married. This is because as long as the money was with him and it was considered his possession, and he must pay its Zakah every year until it is used for the marriage. This is due to the generality of the evidences from the Book and the Sunnah that prove this.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Az-Zakah on Wealth that is kept for Marriage 2.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am currently an employee in one of the governmental departments and I receive approximately four thousand riyals per month. In approximately one year, I collected seventeen thousand riyals. This money is currently in the bank and it does not increase (i.e., from interest or investment). I am ready to spend in the month of Shawwal – if Allaah wills – as I am getting married. I am going to take a loan that is many times more than this amount to cover the expenses of the wedding. My question is: Am I obliged to pay any Zakah on this seventeen thousand? This is while considering that it has been in my possession for about a year. If there is Az-Zakah due on it, how much is it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is due on the mentioned sum of money if it was possessed for a year, even if it was kept for marriage. The amount of Zakah that is due is one fortieth, i.e., 2.5%. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />
Fatawa Islamiyah, DARUSSALAM, Vol.3, Page Nos. 159/160</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Az-Zakah is due on whatever wealth is owned a year and reaches the minimum amount.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person saved a sum of money from his own earnings. Most of it he possessed for a year, but he spent it on some things that would bring benefit to himself. Therefore, he asks whether it is obligatory for him to pay Az-Zakah on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever wealth he saved or owned for a year while it had reached the minimum required amount, then Az-Zakah is due on it. This is the case even if he spent some of it after that on marriage or anything similar. If he did not pay the Zakah of his wealth which was due upon, then it is still due from him and he is responsible for it. It is incumbent upon him to pay it. However, what he did not possess for a year of his wealth due to his spending from it before a year’s time, then there is no Zakah due upon it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatawa Islamiyah, DARUSSALAM, Vol.3, Page Nos. 160/161</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Paying Az-Zakah in advance is permissible.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am an employee who receives a salary, and every month I save a portion of it. There is not a specific percentage for the savings, so how do I pay the Zakah of this wealth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is obligatory upon you is to pay the Zakah of every amount that you save if you have possessed it for a year. If you pay the Zakah of all of the money when a year has passed on the first amount that was saved, then that is sufficient. In this way, the Zakah of the latter sums is considered as being paid in advance before the completion of their year. And paying Az-Zakah in advance before it is possessed for a complete year is permissible, especially if there is a need for it or a religious benefit in that.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Land that is kept for building does not require paying of Az-Zakah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have a piece of land that I bought with the intent of building on it. Then after a period of time, I needed to sell it, so I sold it. Is there any Zakah due on me for the period of time that I was not trying to sell it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the matter is as you mentioned in the question, there is no Zakah due on you for whatever time passed before the sale. This is because the reason that necessitates the the payment of Az-Zakah is not present, which is the intent to sell, and you were not intending to sell it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The ruling of Az-Zakah on Jewellery, Diamonds and precious Stones</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am a married woman and I am almost 30 years old. For approximately 24 years I have had pieces of gold that are not kept for business. They are only for beautification and some times I sell them. Then I add some money to their price and buy better jewelry. Now I have some jewellery and I have herd that it is obligatory to pay Az-Zakah on gold that is kept for beautification. Thus, I would like a clarification of this matter for myself. If Az-Zakah was obligatory on me what is the ruling of the past period of time during which I did not pay Az-Zakah on the jewellery? This is while keeping in mind that I am not able to estimate the amount of gold that I had during all of these long years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is obligatory on you from the time you knew it was obligatory on you to pay Az-Zakah on jewellery. Whatever occurred before that in the previous years before your knowledge of this, then you do not have to pay Az-Zakah for it. This is because the Islamic laws only become obligatory after they are known. The amount that must be paid is 2.5% if the jewellery reaches the minimum amount required for Az-Zakah, which is 20 Mithqal (gold). This is equivalent to 11.5 Saudi Junayhs. If gold jewellery reaches this amount or more, then Az-Zakah must be paid on it. For every 1000 Junayhs, 25 Junayhs is due. In reference to silver, its minimum amount before Az-Zakah is due is 140 Mithqal, which is equivalent to it of monetary currency. The amount that must be paid is 2.5% just like with gold.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reference to diamond and other stones, no Zakah is due on them if they are for wearing. However, if they are for sale, then Az-Zakah is obligatory on them according to their value in gold and silver if they reach the minimum amount required for Az-Zakah. And Allaah is the Giver of success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />
Fatawa Islamiyah, DARUSSALAM, Vol.3, Page Nos. 178/179</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Az-Zakah on Jewellery is obligatory on its Owner</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My wife has gold that she wears that reaches the minimum amount required for Az-Zakah. Is there any Zakah due on it? Is paying its Zakah obligatory on me or on my wife? Is Az-Zakah given from the jewellery itself or is its value determined and then Az-Zakah paid according to the value?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is obligatory on jewellery that is made of gold and silver if its weight reaches the minimum amount required for Az-Zakah, which is 20 Mithqal of gold and 140 Mithqal of silver. The minimum amount of gold in the current currency is equal to 11 (and three sevenths) Saudi Junayhs. If the gold jewellery reaches this amount or more, Az-Zakah must be paid on it, even if it is only for wearing according to the most correct view of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The minimum amount of silver required for Az-Zakah is 56 Saudi Riyals (of silver). If the silver jewellery reaches this amount or more, Az-Zakah must be paid on it. The amount of Az-Zakah to be paid is 2.5% of gold, silver and sale merchandise. This is 2½ out of 100 or 25 out of 1000. Any amount more than this is calculated in this way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zakah is due upon the woman who owns the jewellery. If her husband or other than him pays it on her behalf with her permission, there is nothing wrong with that. It is not obligatory to give the Zakah from the jewellery itself. Rather, it suffices to pay its value every time a year passes on it. This is according to the value of gold and silver in the market at the completion of the year’s time. And Allaah is the Giver of success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Is it Lawful to Give Charity on their Behalf</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A number of years ago, I took a sum of one hundred Saudi Riyals from a number of my colleagues, after which, I travelled to another area and forgot those colleagues and they also forgot me. Now I do not know where they are, so what should I do with the sum of money which is my responsibility? Inform me and may Allah reward you with goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the matter is as you have mentioned in your question, which is that you forgot the owners of the hundred (Riyals) then it is lawful for you to give charity on their behalf. Then if you remembered any of them you must give him his right, unless he approves of your having given it in charity on his behalf. In that case, you will be absolved from blame and you and them will be rewarded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh `Abdul-`Azeez Bin Baz<br />
Fatawa Islamiyah, volume 5 / page 27</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Who is considered eligible to receive the Zakaat ?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It does not befit that the Zakaat be given to the one who does not utilize it for obedience to Allaah. For indeed Allaah The Most High has obligated it as an aid towards obedience to Him for whosoever is in need of it from the believers, such as the poor and those under debt or one who helps the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever does not pray from the people who are needy should not be given anything until he repents; and until he adheres to the performance of the prayers in their correct times.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Is the Zakaat ul Fitr due on behalf of the unborn child?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal said: I heard my father say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Zakaat ul Fitr is to be given on behalf of the unborn child – if it is known of.’*</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullaah bin Ahmad bin Hanbal said: I heard my father say: Mu’tamir bin Sulaimaan At-Taymee narrated to us from Humaid from Bakr and Qataadah that ‘Uthmaan would give the Sadaqatul Fitr on behalf of the small child and the elder and the unborn child.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">_____________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*Note: There occurs a narration from Imaam Ahmad with this meaning mentioned by Aboo Dawood in Al-Masaa’il page 86, and Ibn Haani’ in Al-Masaa’il vol 1 page 111 number 550.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the madhab itself (the Hanbali madhab): then within it the Zakaat ul Fitr is not obligatory on behalf of the foetus, this is because there is no ruling upon it until it is born. However; it is recommended that it is given on its behalf if it is known to exist due to the practice of ‘Uthmaan (radhiyallaahu ‘anhu). See: Mukhtasir Al-Kharqee page 75 and Al-Hidaayah vol 1 page 75 and Al-Mughnee vol 3 page 99 and Al-Furoo’ vol 2 page 526 and Al-Qawaa’id of Ibn Rajab page 189 and Al-Insaaf vol 3 page 168 and Al-Mubdi’ vol 2 page 388.</p>

Translated by Aboo Haatim Muhammad Farooq</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The particular group of people to whom the Zakaat ul Fitr is to be distributed to</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Scholars have differed concerning the issue of distributing the Zakaat ul Fitr, such that there are two sayings:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first saying: That it is to be distributed amongst the eight types of individuals that have been mentioned by Allaah in Soorah At-Tawbah in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((Indeed the Sadaqaat (obligatory Zakaat) are for the poor and the destitute and those employed to collect (the funds); and for those whose hearts have inclined (towards Islaam), and to free the captives; and for those in debt, and in the Path of Allaah (the Mujahideen), and for the wayfarer: an obligation imposed by Allaah, and Allaah is All-Knower All-Wise.)) Soorah At-Tawbah: 60</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a saying which is well-known from amongst the Shaafi’ee’s.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second saying: Is that it is not to be distributed except amongst the poor and the destitute as occurs in the Hadeeth of Ibn ‘Abbaas which preceded in which there was the statement: ((a sustenance for the destitute))*.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) said: ((It was from his guidance (Sallalaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) that he would specify those that were destitute for this particular Sadaqah, so he would not distribute it amongst the eight types of people – handful by handful. Nor did he command for that to be done that way, nor did any one of the companions do that, nor did those that came after them. Rather it is one of two sayings with us that it is impermissible to give it except to the destitute in particular.))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the saying which is to be taken, except if you see dire need amongst someone from the other categories or an acceptable advantage by way of the Sharee’ah (to give it such), in which case it is to be given from this Sadaqah after it has been given to the poor and the destitute – in an ample portion. This is because it is a means of sustenance for them as has been established through that narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here arises an issue which should be taken into consideration which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That it is permissible for one individual person to distribute his Zakaat to either one destitute person or to a number of them. Just as it is (allowed) for a group of people to give their fitrah to a single poor person so long as they are not committing an injustice in the right of the others who are present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second issue which is also recommended to pay attention to is that: It is impermissible to give it to those that it is impermissible to give the Zakaat to in accordance to that which we mentioned concerning the Zakaat of the types of wealth. And Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">__________________________</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*The full text of the Hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((Allaah’s Messenger (Sallalaahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) ordered the giving of Zakaat ul Fitr as a purification for the fasting person from idle talk and obscenity, and as a sustenance for the poor. So whosoever gives it before the prayer (of ‘Eid) then it is an accepted Zakaat, and whosoever gives it after the prayer, then it is a Sadaqah (charity) from the Sadaqaat.))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Aboo Dawood in the book of Zakaat chapter: Zakaat ul Fitr; number 1609 and Ibn Maajah in the book of Zakaat chapter: Sadaqatul Fitr; number 1827and Ad-Daaraqutnee in the book of Zakaat ul Fitr number 1.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fatawa on Zakah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Excerpted from Islamic Verdicts on the Pillars of Islam by Sheikh Muhammad Bin Salih Al-‘Uthaimeen, complied and arranged by Fahd Bin Nasir Ibrahim As-Sulaiman</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> What is the ruling on the Zakah of a rented house?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a rented house is rented out for profit, then there is no Zakah payable on the value of the house. The Zakah is only payable on the income that is generated from it if the hawl (passage of one Hijrah hear) is completed upon it from the time of the rental agreement. If the hawl has not been completed from the time of the rental agreement, then there is no Zakah payable upon it either.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if the person rented out the house for ten thousand riyals, of which he receives five thousand at the time of the agreement which he spends. Then he receives five thousand in the middle of the year, which he spends before the end of the year, there is no Zakah upon him in this case. This is because the hawl has not been completed upon this money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if he kept the house for sale and waited to receive the profit from it, but said: Since it has not been sold, I will rent it out,’ then in that case, he must pay Zakah for the value of the house because he has kept it for sale; he did not want to keep it and profit from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And everything which is intended for the purpose of trade and profit is liable for Zakah, according to the words of the Prophet (peace be upon him), “Deeds are according to intentions and every person shall have what he intended.” And Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A man has daughters and he gave them jewelry, and all the jewelry combined amounted to the nisab, but the jewelry of each of them did not amount to the nisab. Is all of the jewelry to be taken together for calculation and Zakah paid on it?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he gave this jewelry as a loan, then the jewelry is his property, and he must total it all and if that reaches the nisab, he must pay Zakah. But if he gave his daughters this jewelry with the intention that it was their property, then it is not incumbent upon him to combine the jewelry he gave to each one of them with the jewelry of the other daughters, because each of them owns it independently of the other. Based upon this, if the jewelry of one amounts to the nisab, she must pay Zakah for it, and if it does not, then she does not have to. And Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Is there Zakah payable on one’s personal car?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no Zakah payable on it. Everything a person uses for himself, except gold and silver jewelry, there is no Zakah to be paid on it, whether a car, a camel, a farm implement or anything else, according to a saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him), “<em>There is no Zakah payable by a Muslim on his slave, nor on his horse.</em>”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Al-Bukhari in the book of Zakah, in the Chapter: No sadaqah is payable by the Musli for his Slave (1464) ; and by Muslim in the Book of Zakah, in the Chapter: There is no Zakah Incumbent Upon the Muslim for His Slave or His Horse (982).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Imaam ’Abdullaah Ibn ’Abdul ’Azeez Ibn Baaz</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it permissible for a menstruating woman to recite the du’aa’s of the Day of ‘Arafaah despite the fact that they include aayaat from the Qur’aan?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing wrong with the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth reciting du’aa’s that are prescribed for the rituals of Hajj. Also, according to the correct opinion, there is nothing wrong with them reading Qur’aan as well, because there is no clear <i>saheeh</i> report that states that the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth should not read Qur’aan. It was reported that the man who is <i>junub</i> (in a state of impurity following sexual activity), in particular, should not read Qur’aan whilst he is <i>junub</i>, because of the hadeeth of ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with him). With regard to the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth there is the hadeeth of Ibn ‘Umar: &#8220;The menstruating woman and the man who is junub should not read Qur’aan&#8221; – but it is da’eef (weak), because the hadeeth was reported by Ismaa’eel ibn ‘Ayyaash from the Hijaaziyeen, and he is da’eef in his reports from them. But she should read without touching the Mus-haf (copy of the Qur’aan in Arabic), from memory. In the case of the man who is junub, he should not recite Qur’an at all, either from memory or from the Mus-haf, until he has done ghusl. The difference between them is that the timespan for the one who is junub is very short, he can do ghusl straightaway, as soon as he finished having intercourse with his wife. He is not junub for long, and it is up to him when he wants to do ghusl; if he cannot find water, he can do tayammum (&#8220;dry ablution&#8221; using dust etc.) and pray and read Qur’aan. But the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth has no control over her situation – it rests with Allaah, may He be glorified. The period lasts for a number of days and nifaas (post-natal bleeding) is the same. So it is permissible for them to recite Qur’aan so that they do not forget it and so that they do not miss out on the blessings of reciting Qur’aan and learning the rules of sharee’ah from the Book of Allaah. If that is the case, then it should certainly be permissible for them to read books containing du’aas that are a mixture of aayaat and ahaadeeth, etc… this is the more correct of the two opinions of the scholars, may Allaah have mercy on them. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I read some Tafseers (Qur’anic commentaries) when I am not taahir (ritually pure), such as during my monthly period. Is there any sin on me for doing that? Will I be committing a sin if I do that?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no sin on the woman who is menstruating or bleeding after childbirth if she reads books of Tafseer or even if she reads Qur’aan without touching the Mus-haf, according to the more correct of the two scholarly opinions. As for the man who is junub, he should not read Qur’aan at all until he has done ghusl, but he can read books of Tafseer and hadeeth etc., without reading whatever they contain of aayaat, because of the report that nothing would stop the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) from reading Qur’aan except janaabah (being junub). According to a hadeeth narrated by Imaam Ahmad with a jayyid isnaad, he said: &#8220;As for the man who is junub, he should not read even one aayah.&#8221; [2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from Fataawaa Islaamiyyah (3/264)]<br />
Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Ibn ‘Abdullaah Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Q]:</strong> What are the valid reasons for divorce, from your point of view your Eminence?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> [A]:</strong> For divorce there are many reasons: From them (i.e. the many reasons for divorce) is lack of harmony between the husband and the wife such that it does not cause love from either one for the other or from both of them. And from them is bad behaviour of the woman or lack of listening and obedience to the husband in what he commands of the good. And from them is bad behaviour of the husband and his oppressing the woman and lack of fairness/justice for her. And from them is his falling short of fulfilling her rights and her falling short of fulfilling his rights. And from this is the occurrence of wrongdoing from one of them or both of them such that the situation is made worse because of this, so the only route is divorce, and from this is the husband or the wife turning to intoxicants and smoking. And from them is the bad state of affairs between the woman and the husband&#8217;s parents or either of them, and the lack of use of wise politics in dealing with each other. And from them is the lack of the woman in caring and showing concern in cleanliness and dressing up and beautifying herself for her husband with perfume and good speech and cheerfulness when she meets her husband and when they have sexual intercourse.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>(Chapter &#8211; 65)</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b>Which was revealed in Al-Madinah</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يأيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ إِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَآءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ وَأَحْصُواْ الْعِدَّةَ وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ لاَ تُخْرِجُوهُنَّ مِن بُيُوتِهِنَّ وَلاَ يَخْرُجْنَ إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَـحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1. O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah and count their `Iddah. And have Taqwa of Allah, your Lord. And turn them not out of their homes nor shall they leave, except in case they are guilty of Fahishah Mubayyinah. And those are the set limits of Allah. And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah, then indeed he has wronged himself. You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>There is a Period during which Divorced Women remain in Their Homes</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet was addressed first in this Ayah, to honor him, even though his Ummah is also being addressed in Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[يأيُّهَا النَّبِىُّ إِذَا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّسَآءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah) Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar divorced his wife, during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Messenger , while she was menstruating. `Umar bin Al-Khattab mentioned that to Allah&#8217;s Messenger . Allah&#8217;s Messenger became angry and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لِيُرَاجِعْهَا ثُمَّ يُمْسِكْهَا حَتْى تَطْهُرَ، ثُمَّ تَحِيضَ فَتَطْهُرَ، فَإِنْ بَدَا لَهُ أَنْ يُطَلِّقَهَا، فَلْيُطَلِّقْهَا طَاهِرًا قَبْلَ أَنْ يَمَسَّهَا، فَتِلْكَ الْعِدَّةُ الَّتِي أَمَرَ بِهَا اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَل»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Order him to take her back and keep her until she is clean from her menses, and then to wait until she gets her next period and becomes clean again. Then, if he wishes to divorce her, he can divorce her when she is clean from her menses, before he has sexual intercourse with her. This is the `Iddah which Allah the Exalted and Most Honored has fixed.) Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith in several parts of his Sahih. Muslim collected this Hadith and his narration uses these words,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«فَتِلْكَ الْعِدَّةُ الَّتِي أَمَرَ اللهُ أَنْ يُطَلَّقَ لَهَا النِّسَاء»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(This is the `Iddah which Allah has fixed for the women being divorced.) In his Sahih, Muslim has recorded a Hadith which is a more appropriate version from a narration of Ibn Jurayj who said that Abu Az-Zubayr informed him that he heard `Abdur-Rahman bin Ayman, the freed slave of `Azzah, questioning `Abdullah bin `Umar. And Abu Az-Zubayr heard the question, &#8220;What about a man who divorces his wife while she is still on her menses&#8221; `Abdullah answered, &#8220;During the time of Allah&#8217;s Messenger , `Abdullah bin `Umar divorced his wife who was menstruating in the life time of Allah&#8217;s Messenger . So Allah&#8217;s Messenger said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لِيُرَاجِعْهَا»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Let him take her back.) so she returned and he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِذَا طَهُرَتْ فَلْيُطَلِّقْ أَوْ يُمْسِك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When she is pure, then either divorce or keep her.) `Abdullah bin `Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Messenger recited this Ayah: (ياأَيُّها النَّبِيُّ إِذا طَلَّقْتُمُ النِّساءَ فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ فِي قُبُلِ عِدَّتِهِنَّ) (O Prophet! When you divorce women, divorce them at their `Iddah) And `Abdullah (Ibn Mas`ud) commented on Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(divorce them at their `Iddah) He said, &#8220;Purity without intercourse.&#8221; Similar was reported from Ibn `Umar, `Ata&#8217;, Mujahid, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Qatadah, Maymun bin Mihran and Muqatil bin Hayyan. It is also reported from `Ikrimah and Ad-Dahhak.`Ali bin Abi Talhah reported from Ibn `Abbas about the Ayah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(divorce them at their `Iddah), &#8220;He does not divorce her while she is on her menses nor while she is pure if he has had intercourse during that (purity). Rather, he leaves her until she has her menses and after the menses ends, then he divorces her once.&#8221; And `Ikrimah said about</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَطَلِّقُوهُنَّ لِعِدَّتِهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(divorce them at their `Iddah), &#8220;The `Iddah is made up of clean- liness and the menstrual period.&#8221; So he divorces her while it is clear that she is pregnant, or he does not due to having sex, or since he does not know if she is pregnant or not. This is why the scholars said that there are two types of divorce, one that conforms to the Sunnah and another innovated. The divorce that conforms to the Sunnah is one where the husband pronounces one divorce to his wife when she is not having her menses and without having had sexual intercourse with her after the menses ended. One could divorce his wife when it is clear that she is pregnant. As for the innovated divorce, it occurs when one divorces his wife when she is having her menses, or after the menses ends, has sexual intercourse with her and then divorces her, even though he does not know if she became pregnant or not. There is a third type of divorce, which is neither a Sunnah nor an innovation where one divorces a young wife who has not begun to have menses, the wife who is beyond the age of having menses, and divorcing one&#8217;s wife before the marriage was consummated. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَحْصُواْ الْعِدَّةَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and count their `Iddah.) meaning, count for it and know its beginning and end, so that the `Iddah does not become prolonged for the woman and she cannot get married again,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ رَبَّكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And have Taqwa of Allah, your Lord.) in this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Spending and Housing is up to the Husband during the Revocable `Iddah Period</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُخْرِجُوهُنَّ مِن بُيُوتِهِنَّ وَلاَ يَخْرُجْنَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And turn them not out of their homes nor shall they leave,) meaning, during the duration of the `Iddah, she has the right to housing from her husband, as long as the `Iddah period continues. Therefore, the husband does not have the right to force her out of her house, nor is she allowed to leave his house, because she is still tied to the marriage contract. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِلاَّ أَن يَأْتِينَ بِفَاحِشَةٍ مُّبَيِّنَةٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(except in case they are guilty of Fahishah Mubayyinah.) meaning that the divorced wife is not to abandon her husband&#8217;s house unless she commits Fahishah Mubayyinah, in which case, she vacates her husband&#8217;s house. For example, Fahishah Mubayyinah implies adultery, according to `Abdullah bin Mas`ud, Ibn `Abbas, Sa`id bin Al-Musayyib, Ash-Sha`bi, Al-Hasan, Ibn Sirin, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Sa`id bin Jubayr, Abu Qilabah, Abu Salih, Ad-Dahhak, Zayd bin Aslam, `Ata&#8217; Al-Khurasani, As-Suddi, Sa`id bin Hilal and others. Fahishah Mubayyinah implies disobeying her husband openly or when she abuses her husband&#8217;s family in words and actions, according to Ubay bin Ka`b, Ibn `Abbas, `Ikrimah and others. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَتِلْكَ حُدُودُ اللَّهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And those are the set limits of Allah.) means, these are from His legislation and prohibitions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَعَدَّ حُدُودَ اللَّهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever transgresses the set limits of Allah,) meaning, whoever violates these limits, transgresses them and implements anything else besides them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَقَدْ ظَلَمَ نَفْسَهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then indeed he has wronged himself.) by doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Wisdom of `Iddah at the Husband&#8217;s House</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.) meaning, `We commanded that the divorced wife remains in her husband&#8217;s house during the `Iddah period, so that the husband might regret his action and Allah decides that the husband feels in his heart for the marriage to continue.&#8217; This way, returning to his wife will be easier for him. Az-Zuhri said that `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah said that Fatimah bint Qays said about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تَدْرِى لَعَلَّ اللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَلِكَ أَمْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You know not, it may be that Allah will afterward bring some new thing to pass.) &#8220;Taking her back.&#8221; Similar was said by Ash-Sha`bi, `Ata&#8217;, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak, Muqatil bin Hayyan and Ath-Thawri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Irrevocably Divorced Woman does not have a Right to Provisions and Accommodations from the Husband</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here the view of the scholars of the Salaf and those who follow them is that housing is not obligatory in the case of the irrevocably divorced woman. They also relied on the Hadith of Fatimah bint Qays Al-Fihriyah when her husband Abu `Amr bin Hafs divorced her the third and final time. He was away from her in Yemen at the time, and he sent her his decision to divorce her. He also sent some barley with his messenger, but she did not like the amount or method of compensation. He said, &#8220;By Allah I am not obligated to spend upon you.&#8221; So, she went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger , who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لَيْسَ لَكِ عَلَيْهِ نَفَقَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(There is no obligation on him to spend on you.) Muslim added in his narration,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«وَلَا سُكْنَى»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(nor housing.) And he ordered her to finish her `Iddah period in the house of Umm Sharik. He then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«تِلْكَ امْرَأَةٌ يَغْشَاهَا أَصْحَابِي، اعْتَدِّي عِنْدَ ابْنِ أُمِّ مَكْتُومٍ، فَإِنَّهُ رَجُلٌ أَعْمَى تَضَعِينَ ثِيَابَك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(She is a woman my Companions visit. Spend this period in the house of Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is a blind man; [he cannot see you if] you take off your garments.) Imam Ahmad collected this Hadith using another chain of narration. In his narration, the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«انْظُرِي يَا بِنْتَ آلِ قَيْسٍ إِنَّمَا النَّفَقَةُ وَالسُّكْنَى لِلْمَرْأَةِ عَلَى زَوْجِهَا، مَا كَانَتْ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ، فَإِذَا لَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ فَلَا نَفَقَةَ وَلَا سُكْنَى،اخْرُجِي فَانْزِلِي عَلَى فُلَانَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Look O daughter of the family of Qays! Spending and housing are required from the husband who can return to his wife. So if he does not have the right to return to her, then she does not have the right to spending and housing. So leave his house and go to so-and-so woman.) He then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّهُ يُتَحَدَّثُ إِلَيْهَا، انْزِلِي عَلَى ابْنِ أُمِّ مَكْتُومٍ فَإِنَّهُ أَعْمَى لَا يَرَاك»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They speak to her. Therefore, go to Ibn Umm Maktum, for he is a blind man and cannot see you.) Abu Al-Qasim At-Tabarani recorded that `Amir Ash-Sha`bi went to Fatimah bint Qays, sister of Ad-Dahhak bin Qays, from the tribe of Quraysh. Fatimah was married to Abu `Amr bin Hafs bin Al-Mughirah, from Bani Makhzum. She said, &#8220;Abu `Amr bin Hafs sent me his decision to divorce me while he was in an army that had gone to Yemen. I asked his friends to provide me with financial provisions and housing. They said, `He did not send us anything for that, nor did he request it from us.&#8217; I went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger and said to him, `O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Abu `Amr bin Hafs divorced me, and I asked his friends to provide me with spending and housing and they said that he did not send them anything for that.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«إِنَّمَا السُّكْنَى وَالنَّفَقَةُ لِلْمَرْأَةِ إِذَا كَانَ لِزَوْجِهَا عَلَيْهَا رَجْعَةٌ، فَإِذَا كَانَتْ لَا تَحِلُّ لَهُ حَتْى تَنْكِحَ زَوْجًا غَيْرَهُ:فَلَا نَفَقَةَ لَهَا وَلَا سُكْنَى»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Spending and housing are required from the husband for his divorced wife if he can return to her. If she is not permitted for him anymore, until she marries another husband, then he does not have to provide her with spending and housing.)&#8221; An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded this narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِذَا بَلَغْنَ أَجَلَهُنَّ فَأَمْسِكُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ أَوْ فَارِقُوهُنَّ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ وَأَقِيمُواْ الشَّهَـدَةَ لِلَّهِ ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً &#8211; وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2. Then when they are about to attain their term appointed, either take them back in a good manner or part with them in a good manner. And take as witness two just persons from among you. And establish the testimony for Allah. That will be an admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day. And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) (3. And He will provide him from where he never could imagine. And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him. Verily, Allah will accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ordaining Kindness towards Divorced Women</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted says that when the woman who is in her `Iddah nears the end of the `Iddah term, the husband must decide to reconcile with her, thus keeping their marriage together,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[بِمَعْرُوفٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(in a good manner) while being kind to her in their companionship. Otherwise, he must decide to divorce her on good terms, without abusing, cursing, or admonishing her. To the contrary, he should divorce her on good terms, observing kindness and good manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Command to have Witnesses for the Return</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take as witness two just persons from among you.) meaning when taking her back, if this is your decision. Abu Dawud and Ibn Majah recorded that `Imran bin Husayn was asked about a man who divorced his wife and then had sexual intercourse with her, without notifying witnesses of when he divorced her and when he took her back. `Imran said, &#8220;His divorce and taking her back was in contradiction to the Sunnah. Incorporate the presence of witnesses for divorcing her and taking her back, and do not repeat your conduct.&#8221; Ibn Jurayj said that `Ata&#8217; commented on the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأَشْهِدُواْ ذَوَى عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And take as witness two just persons from among you.) &#8220;It is not permissible to marry, divorce or take back the divorced wife except with two just witnesses, just as Allah the Exalted has said, except when there is a valid excuse.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ذَلِكُمْ يُوعَظُ بِهِ مَن كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الاٌّخِرِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(That will be an admonition given to him who believes in Allah and the Last Day.) means, `this, Our command to you to have witnesses in such cases and to establish the witness, is implemented by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day.&#8217; This legislation is meant to benefit those who fear Allah&#8217;s punishment in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allah provides, suffices, and makes a Way out of Every Hardship for Those Who have Taqwa</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاًوَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out. And He will provide him from where he never could imagine.) meaning, whoever has Taqwa of Allah in what He has commanded and avoids what He has forbidden, then Allah will make a way out for him from every difficulty and will provide for him from resources he never anticipated or thought about. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said, &#8220;The most comprehensive Ayah in the Qur&#8217;an is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالإْحْسَانِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah enjoins Al-`Adl (justice) and Al-Ihsan (doing good) (16:90). The greatest Ayah in the Qur&#8217;an that contains relief is,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.)&#8221; `Ikrimah also commented on the Ayah, &#8220;Whoever divorces as Allah commanded him, then Allah will make a way out for him.&#8221; Similar was reported from Ibn `Abbas and Ad-Dahhak.`Abdullah bin Mas`ud and Masruq commented on the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) &#8220;It pertains to when one knows that if Allah wills He gives, and if He wills He deprives,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(from where he never could imagine.) from resources he did not anticipate&#8221; Qatadah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make a way for him to get out.) &#8220;meaning, from every doubt and the horrors experienced at the time of death,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَيَرْزُقْهُ مِنْ حَيْثُ لاَ يَحْتَسِبُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And He will provide him from where he never could imagine) from where he never thought of or anticipated.&#8221; Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى اللَّهِ فَهُوَ حَسْبُهُ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him.) Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said that he rode the Prophet&#8217;s camel while sitting behind the Prophet , and the Messenger of Allah said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«يَا غُلَامُ إِنِّي مُعَلِّمُكَ كَلِمَاتٍ: احْفَظِ اللهَ يَحْفَظْكَ، احْفَظِ اللهَ تَجِدْهُ تُجَاهَكَ، وَإِذَا سَأَلْتَ فَاسْأَلِ اللهَ، وَإِذَا اسْتَعَنْتَ فَاسْتَعِنْ بِاللهِ، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ الْأُمَّةَ لَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَنْفَعُوكَ لَمْ يَنْفَعُوكَ إِلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ لَكَ، وَلَوِ اجْتَمَعُوا عَلَى أَنْ يَضُرُّوكَ لَمْ يَضُرُّوكَ إِلَّا بِشَيْءٍ قَدْ كَتَبَهُ اللهُ عَلَيْكَ، رُفِعَتِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَجَفَّتِ الصُّحُف»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O boy! I will teach you words [so learn them]. Be mindful of Allah and He will protect you, be mindful of Allah and He will be on your side. If you ask, ask Allah, and if you seek help, seek it from Allah. Know that if the Ummah gather their strength to bring you benefit, they will never bring you benefit, except that which Allah has decreed for you. Know that if they gather their strength to harm you, they will never harm you, except with that which Allah has decreed against you. The pens have been raised and the pages are dry.) At-Tirmidhi collected this Hadith and said: &#8220;Hasan Sahih.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّ اللَّهَ بَـلِغُ أَمْرِهِ]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[قَدْ جَعَلَ اللَّهُ لِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.) This is like His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكُلُّ شَىْءٍ عِندَهُ بِمِقْدَارٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Everything with Him is in (due) proportion.) (13:8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ يُسْراً &#8211; ذَلِكَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ أَنزَلَهُ إِلَيْكُمْ وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّئَـتِهِ وَيُعْظِمْ لَهُ أَجْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4. Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses. And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden; and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make his matter easy for him.) (5. That is the command of Allah, which He has sent down to you; and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will expiate from him his sins, and will increase his reward.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The `Iddah of Those in Menopause and Those Who do not have Menses</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted clarifies the waiting period of the woman in menopause. And that is the one whose menstruation has stopped due to her older age. Her `Iddah is three months instead of the three monthly cycles for those who menstruate, which is based upon the Ayah in (Surat) Al-Baqarah. [see 2:228] The same for the young, who have not reached the years of menstruation. Their `Iddah is three months like those in menopause. This is the meaning of His saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and for those who have no courses&#8230;) as for His saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(if you have doubt&#8230;) There are two opinions: First, is the saying of a group of the Salaf, like Mujahid, Az-Zuhri and Ibn Zayd. That is, if they see blood and there is doubt if it was menstrual blood or not. The second, is that if you do not know the ruling in this case, then know that their `Iddah is three months. This has been reported from Sa`id bin Jubayr and it is the view preferred by Ibn Jarir. And this is the more obvious meaning. Supporting this view is what is reported from Ubay bin Ka`b that he said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Some women were not mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an, the young, the old and the pregnant.&#8221; Allah the Exalted and Most Honored sent down this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses. And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden.) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded a simpler narration than this one from Ubay bin Ka`b who said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! When the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah was revealed prescribing the `Iddah of divorce, some people in Al-Madinah said, `There are still some women whose `Iddah has not been mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an. There are the young, the old whose menstruation is discontinued, and the pregnant.&#8217; Later on, this Ayah was revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَاللاَّئِى يَئِسْنَ مِنَ الْمَحِيضِ مِن نِّسَآئِكُمْ إِنِ ارْتَبْتُمْ فَعِدَّتُهُنَّ ثَلَـثَةُ أَشْهُرٍ وَاللَّـتِي لَمْ يَحِضْنَ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those in menopause among your women, for them the `Iddah, if you have doubt, is three months; and for those who have no courses.)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>`Iddah of Pregnant Women</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And for those who are pregnant, their `Iddah is until they lay down their burden;) Allah says: the pregnant woman&#8217;s `Iddah ends when she gives birth, whether in the case of divorce or death of the husband, according to the agreement of the majority of scholars of the Salaf and later generations. This is based upon this honorable Ayah and what is mentioned in the Prophetic Sunnah. Al-Bukhari recorded that Abu Salamah said, &#8220;A man came to Ibn `Abbas while Abu Hurayrah was sitting with him and said, `Give me your verdict regarding a lady who delivered a baby forty days after the death of her husband.&#8217; Ibn `Abbas said,` [Her `Iddah period lasts until] the end of the longest among the two prescribed periods.&#8217; I recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأُوْلَـتُ الاٌّحْمَالِ أَجَلُهُنَّ أَن يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For those who are pregnant, their prescribed period is until they deliver their burdens;) Abu Hurayrah said, `I agree with my cousin (Abu Salamah).&#8217; Then Ibn `Abbas sent his slave Kurayb to Umm Salamah to ask her. She replied, `The husband of Subay`ah Al-Aslamiyyah was killed while she was pregnant, and she delivered a baby forty days after his death. Then she received a marriage proposal and Allah&#8217;s Messenger married her to somebody. Abu As-Sanabil was one of those who proposed to her.&#8221; Al-Bukhari collected this short form of the Hadith, which Muslim and other scholars of Hadith collected using its longer form. Imam Ahmad recorded that Al-Miswar bin Makhramah said, &#8220;Subay`ah Al-Aslamiyyah gave birth to a child a few days after the death of her husband. When she finished the postdelivery term, she was proposed to. So she sought the permission of Allah&#8217;s Messenger for the marriage, and he permitted her to marry, so she got married.&#8221; Al-Bukhari collected this narration, as did Muslim, Abu Dawud, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah with a different chain of narration from the Hadith of Subay`ah. Muslim bin Al-Hajjaj recorded that `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah said that his father wrote to `Umar bin `Abdullah bin Al-Arqam Az-Zuhri, requesting that he go to Subay`ah bint Al-Harith Al-Aslamiyyah to ask her about the matter in question, and about what Allah&#8217;s Messenger said to her when she sought his verdict. `Umar bin `Abdullah wrote to `Ubaydullah bin `Abdullah bin `Utbah informing him that Subay`ah told him that she had been married to Sa`d bin Khawlah, and he was one of those who participated in the battle of Badr. He died during the Farewell Pilgrimage, while she was pregnant. Soon after his death, she gave birth. When she passed the postnatal term, she beautified herself for those who might propose to her. Abu As-Sanabil bin Ba`kak came to her and said, `Why do I see you have beautified yourself Do you wish to remarry By Allah, you cannot marry unless four months and ten days have passed.&#8221; Subay`ah said, &#8220;When he said that, I dressed myself in the evening and went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger and asked him about his verdict. He gave me a religious verdict that I was allowed to marry after I had given birth to my child, saying I could marry if I wish.&#8221; This is the narration that Muslim collected. Al-Bukhari collected this Hadith in a shorter form. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ يُسْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will make his matter easy for him.) means, Allah will make his matters lenient for him and will soon bring forth relief and a quick way out,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ذَلِكَ أَمْرُ اللَّهِ أَنزَلَهُ إِلَيْكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(That is the command of Allah, which He has sent down to you;) meaning, this is His commandment and legislation that He sent down to you through His Messenger ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يُكَفِّرْ عَنْهُ سَيِّئَـتِهِ وَيُعْظِمْ لَهُ أَجْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whosoever has Taqwa of Allah, He will expiate from him his sins, and will increase his reward.) means, Allah will prevent what he fears and multiply his reward even for the little good he does.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَسْكِنُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ سَكَنتُم مِّن وُجْدِكُمْ وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ وَإِن كُنَّ أُوْلَـتِ حَمْلٍ فَأَنفِقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ حَتَّى يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَـَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ وَأْتَمِرُواْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَى &#8211; لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِ وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَاهُ اللَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَآ ءَاتَاهَا سَيَجْعَلُ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6. Lodge them where you dwell, according to what you have, and do not harm them so as to suppress them. And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden. Then if they suckle the children for you, give them their due payment, and let each of you deal with each other in a mannerly way. But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may suckle for him.) (7. Let the rich man spend according to his means; and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him. Allah will grant after hardship, ease.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Divorced Woman has the Right to Decent Accommodations, and what is Reasonable</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted orders His faithful servants that when one of them divorces his wife, he should provide housing for her until the end of her `Iddah period,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَسْكِنُوهُنَّ مِنْ حَيْثُ سَكَنتُم]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Lodge them where you dwell,) means, with you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[مِّن وُجْدِكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(according to what you have,) Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid and several others said, it refers to &#8220;Your ability.&#8221; Qatadah said, &#8220;If you can only afford to accommodate her in a corner of your house, then do so.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Forbidding Ill-Treatment of Divorced Women</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not harm them in order to suppress them.) Muqatil bin Hayyan said, &#8220;meaning, do not annoy her to force her to pay her way out nor expel her from your house.&#8221; Ath-Thawri said from Mansur, from Abu Ad-Duha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَلاَ تُضَآرُّوهُنَّ لِتُضَيِّقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and do not harm them in order to suppress them) &#8220;He divorces her, and when a few days remain, he takes her back.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Irrevocable Divorced Pregnant Woman has the Right of Support (Maintenance) from Her Husband until She gives Birth</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَإِن كُنَّ أُوْلَـتِ حَمْلٍ فَأَنفِقُواْ عَلَيْهِنَّ حَتَّى يَضَعْنَ حَمْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if they are pregnant, then spend on them till they lay down their burden.) This is about the woman who is irrevocably divorced. If she is pregnant, then she is to be spent on her until she lays down her burden. This is supported due to the fact that if she is revocably divorced, the she has then right to receive her support (maintenance) whether she is pregnant or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Divorced Mother may take Compensation for suckling Her Child</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then if they suckle them for you,) meaning, when pregnant women give birth and they are irrevocably divorced by the expiration of the `Iddah, then at that time they may either suckle the child or not. But that is only after she nourishes him with the milk, that is the early on milk which the infant&#8217;s well-being depends upon. Then, if she suckles, she has the right to compensation for it. She is allowed to enter into a contract with the father or his representative in return for whatever payment they agree to. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِنْ أَرْضَعْنَ لَكُمْ فَـَاتُوهُنَّ أُجُورَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then if they suckle the children for you, give them their due payment,) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَأْتَمِرُواْ بَيْنَكُمْ بِمَعْرُوفٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and let each of you deal with each other in a mannerly way.) meaning, the affairs of the divorced couple should be managed in a just way without causing harm to either one of them, just as Allah the Exalted said in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ تُضَآرَّ وَلِدَةٌ بِوَلَدِهَا وَلاَ مَوْلُودٌ لَّهُ بِوَلَدِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(No mother shall be treated unfairly on account of her child, nor father on account of child.) (2:233) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَإِن تَعَاسَرْتُمْ فَسَتُرْضِعُ لَهُ أُخْرَى]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But if you make difficulties for one another, then some other woman may suckle for him.) meaning, if the divorced couple disagrees, because the woman asks for an unreasonable fee for suckling their child, and the father refuses to pay the amount or offers an unreasonable amount, he may find another woman to suckle his child. If the mother agrees to accept the amount that was to be paid to the woman who agreed to suckle the child, then she has more right to suckle her own child. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِيُنفِقْ ذُو سَعَةٍ مِّن سَعَتِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Let the rich man spend according to his means;) means, the wealthy father or his representative should spend on the child according to his means,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن قُدِرَ عَلَيْهِ رِزْقُهُ فَلْيُنفِقْ مِمَّآ ءَاتَاهُ اللَّهُ لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْساً إِلاَّ مَآ ءَاتَاهَا]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on any person beyond what He has given him.) This is as Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لاَ يُكَلِّفُ اللَّهُ نَفْسًا إِلاَّ وُسْعَهَا]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah does not burden a person beyond what He can bear.) [2:286]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A Story of a Woman who had Taqwa</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[سَيَجْعَلُ اللَّهُ بَعْدَ عُسْرٍ يُسْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah will grant after hardship, ease.) This is a sure promise from Him, and indeed, Allah&#8217;s promises are true and He never breaks them, This is an Allah&#8217;s saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً &#8211; إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْراً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief.) [94:5-6] There is a relevant Hadith that we should mention here. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, &#8220;A man and his wife from an earlier generation were poor. Once when the man came back from a journey, he went to his wife saying to her, while feeling hunger and fatigued, `Do you have anything to eat&#8217; She said, `Yes, receive the good news of Allah&#8217;s provisions.&#8217; He again said to her, `If you have anything to eat, bring it to me.&#8217; She said, `Wait a little longer.&#8217; She was awaiting Allah&#8217;s mercy. When the matter was prolonged, he said to her, `Get up and bring me whatever you have to eat, because I am real hungry and fatigued.&#8217; She said, `I will. Soon I will open the oven&#8217;s cover, so do not be hasty.&#8217; When he was busy and refrained from insisting for a while, she said to herself, `I should look in my oven.&#8217; So she got up and looked in her oven and found it full of the meat of a lamb, and her mortar and pestle was full of seed grains; it was crushing the seeds on its own. So, she took out what was in the mortar and pestle, after shaking it to remove everything from inside, and also took the meat out that she found in the oven.&#8221; Abu Hurayrah added, &#8220;By He in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Al-Qasim (Prophet Muhammad )! This is the same statement that Muhammad said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«لَوْ أَخَذَتْ مَا فِي رَحْيَيْهَا وَلَمْ تَنْفُضْهَا (لَطَحَنَتْهَا) إِلى يَوْمِ الْقِيَامَة»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Had she taken out what was in her mortar and not emptied it fully by shaking it, it would have continued crushing the seeds until the Day of Resurrection.)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكَأِيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ عَتَتْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهَا وَرُسُلِهِ فَحَاسَبْنَـهَا حِسَاباً شَدِيداً وَعَذَّبْنَـهَا عَذَاباً نُّكْراً &#8211; فَذَاقَتْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهَا وَكَانَ عَـقِبَةُ أَمْرِهَا خُسْراً &#8211; أَعَدَّ اللَّهُ لَهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ يأُوْلِى الأَلْبَـبِ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ قَدْ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكُمْ ذِكْراً &#8211; رَّسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَـتٍ لِّيُخْرِجَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ وَمَن يُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ وَيَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً قَدْ أَحْسَنَ اللَّهُ لَهُ رِزْقاً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(8. And many a town revolted against the command of its Lord and His Messengers; and We called it to a severe account, and We shall punish it with a horrible torment.) (9. So it tasted the evil result of its affair, and the consequence of its affair was loss.) (10. Allah has prepared for them a severe torment. So have Taqwa of Allah, O men of understanding, those who believe! Allah has indeed sent down to you a Reminder.) (11. A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations, that He may take out those who believe and do righteous good deeds, from the darkness to the light. And whosoever believes in Allah and performs righteous deeds, He will admit him into Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. Allah has indeed granted for him an excellent provision.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Punishment for defying Allah&#8217;s Commandments</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted threatens those who defy His commands, deny His Messengers and contradict His legislation, by informing them of the end that earlier nations met who did the same,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكَأِيِّن مِّن قَرْيَةٍ عَتَتْ عَنْ أَمْرِ رَبِّهَا وَرُسُلِهِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And many a town revolted against the command of its Lord and His Messengers;) meaning, they rebelled, rejected and arrogantly refused to obey Allah and they would not follow His Messengers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَحَاسَبْنَـهَا حِسَاباً شَدِيداً وَعَذَّبْنَـهَا عَذَاباً نُّكْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and We called it to a severe account, and We shall punish it with a horrible torment.) meaning, horrendous and terrifying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَذَاقَتْ وَبَالَ أَمْرِهَا]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So it tasted the evil result of its affair,) meaning, they tasted the evil consequences of defiance and they regretted their actions when regret does not avail,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكَانَ عَـقِبَةُ أَمْرِهَا خُسْراًأَعَدَّ اللَّهُ لَهُمْ عَذَاباً شَدِيداً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and the consequence of its affair was loss. And Allah has prepared for them a severe torment.) means, in the Hereafter, added to the torment that was sent down on them in this life. Allah the Exalted said, after mentioning what happened to the disbelieving nations,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[فَاتَّقُواْ اللَّهَ يأُوْلِى الأَلْبَـبِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So have Taqwa of Allah, O men of understanding,) meaning, `O you who have sound understanding, do not be like them because if you do, you will suffer what they suffered, O people of comprehension,&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(who believe) meaning, in Allah and His Messengers,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[قَدْ أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ إِلَيْكُمْ ذِكْراً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah has indeed sent down to you a Reminder.) meaning, this Qur&#8217;an. Allah also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَـفِظُونَ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr and surely, We will preserve it.) (15:9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Qualities of the Messenger</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[رَّسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَـتٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations,) Some said that the Messenger is the subject of what is being sent [as a reminder] because the Messenger is the one that conveys the Dhikr. Ibn Jarir said that what is correct is that the Messenger explains the Dhikr. This is why Allah the Exalted said here,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[رَّسُولاً يَتْلُو عَلَيْكُمْ ءَايَـتِ اللَّهِ مُبَيِّنَـتٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A Messenger, who recites to you the Ayat of Allah containing clear explanations,) meaning, plain and apparent. The statement of Allah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[لِّيُخْرِجَ الَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ وَعَمِلُواْ الصَّـلِحَـتِ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that He may take out those who believe and do righteous good deeds, from the darkness to the light.) Allah&#8217;s is like saying;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَـهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A Book which We have revealed unto you in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness) (14:1), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اللَّهُ وَلِيُّ الَّذِينَ ءامَنُواْ يُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ الظُّلُمَـتِ إِلَى النُّورِ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah is the Guardian of those who believe. He brings them out from darkness into light.) (2:257) meaning, out of the darkness of disbelief and ignorance into the light of faith and knowledge. Allah the Exalted called the revelation that He has sent down, light, on account of the guidance that it brings. Allah also called it Ruh, in that, it brings life to the hearts,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَكَذَلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ رُوحاً مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِى مَا الْكِتَـبُ وَلاَ الإِيمَـنُ وَلَـكِن جَعَلْنَـهُ نُوراً نَّهْدِى بِهِ مَن نَّشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِى إِلَى صِرَطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And thus We have sent to you Ruh of our command. You knew not what is the book, nor what is faith But We have made it a light wherewith we guide whosoever of Our servants We will. And verily, you are indeed guiding to the straight path.) (42:52) Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمَن يُؤْمِن بِاللَّهِ وَيَعْمَلْ صَـلِحاً يُدْخِلْهُ جَنَّـتٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا الاٌّنْهَـرُ خَـلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَداً قَدْ أَحْسَنَ اللَّهُ لَهُ رِزْقاً]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever believes in Allah and performs righteous good deeds, He will admit him into Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein forever. Allah has indeed granted for him an excellent provision.) was explained several times before, and therefore, we do not need to repeat its explanation here. All the thanks and praises are due to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ وَمِنَ الاٌّرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ يَتَنَزَّلُ الاٌّمْرُ بَيْنَهُنَّ لِّتَعْلَمُواْ أَنَّ اللَّهَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَىْءٍ قَدِيرٌ وَأَنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ أَحَاطَ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عِلْمَا ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(12. It is Allah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof. His command descends between them, that you may know that Allah has power over all things, and that Allah surrounds all things with (His) knowledge.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Allah&#8217;s Perfect Power</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted asserts His perfect power and infinite greatness, so that the great religion that He has legislated is honored and implemented,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[اللَّهُ الَّذِى خَلَقَ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is Allah Who has created seven heavens) Allah said in similar Ayat, like what Prophet Nuh said to his people,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[أَلَمْ تَرَوْاْ كَيْفَ خَلَقَ اللَّهُ سَبْعَ سَمَـوَتٍ طِبَاقاً ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(See you not how Allah has created the seven heavens one above another) (71:15), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[تُسَبِّحُ لَهُ السَّمَـوَتُ السَّبْعُ وَالاٌّرْضُ وَمَن فِيهِنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The seven heavens and the earth and all that is therein, glorify him.) (17:44) Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[وَمِنَ الاٌّرْضِ مِثْلَهُنَّ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and of the earth the like thereof.) means, He created seven earths. In the Two Sahihs, there is a Hadith that states,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«مَنْ ظَلَمَ قِيدَ شِبْرٍ مِنَ الْأَرْضِ طُوِّقَهُ مِنْ سَبْعِ أَرَضِين»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever usurps the land of somebody unjustly, even if it was a mere hand span, then his neck will be encircled with it down to the seven earths.) And in Sahih Al-Bukhari the wording is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«خُسِفَ بِهِ إِلَى سَبْعِ أَرَضِين»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;he will sink down to the seven earths.) In the beginning of my book, Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, I mentioned the various narrations for this Hadith when I narrated the story of the creation of the earth. All the thanks and praise is due to Allah. Those who explained this Hadith to mean the seven continents have brought an implausible explanation that contradicts the letter of the Qur&#8217;an and the Hadith without having proof. This is the end of the Tafsir of Surat At-Talaq, all the thanks and praise is due to Allah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement; (Allah will grant after hardship, ease.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a sure promise from Him, and indeed, Allah&#8217;s promises are true and He never breaks them, This is an Allah&#8217;s saying; (Verily, along with every hardship is relief. Verily, along with every hardship is relief.) [94:5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a relevant Hadith that we should mention here. Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A man and his wife from an earlier generation were poor. Once when the man came back from a journey, he went to his wife saying to her, while feeling hunger and fatigued, `Do you have anything to eat&#8217; She said, `Yes, receive the good news of Allah&#8217;s provisions.&#8217; He again said to her, `If you have anything to eat, bring it to me.&#8217; She said, `Wait a little longer.&#8217; She was awaiting Allah&#8217;s mercy. When the matter was prolonged, he said to her, `Get up and bring me whatever you have to eat, because I am real hungry and fatigued.&#8217; She said, `I will. Soon I will open the oven&#8217;s cover, so do not be hasty.&#8217; When he was busy and refrained from insisting for a while, she said to herself, `I should look in my oven.&#8217; So she got up and looked in her oven and found it full of the meat of a lamb, and her mortar and pestle was full of seed grains; it was crushing the seeds on its own. So, she took out what was in the mortar and pestle, after shaking it to remove everything from inside, and also took the meat out that she found in the oven.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah added, &#8220;By He in Whose Hand is the life of Abu Al-Qasim (Prophet Muhammad )! This is the same statement that Muhammad said, (Had she taken out what was in her mortar and not emptied it fully by shaking it, it would have continued crushing the seeds until the Day of Resurrection.)&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحْمَـنِ الرَّحِيمِ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَـهُ فِى لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ </span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(1. Verily, We have sent it down in the Night of Al-Qadr.) (2. And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr is) (3. The Night of Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months.) (4. Therein descend the angels and the Ruh by their Lord&#8217;s permission with every matter.) (5. There is peace until the appearance of dawn.)</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The Virtues of the Night of Al-Qadr(the Decree)</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah informs that He sent the Qur&#8217;an down during the Night of Al-Qadr, and it is a blessed night about which Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةٍ مُّبَارَكَةٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(We sent it down on a blessed night.)</span> (44:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Night of Al-Qadr and it occurs during the month of Ramadan. This is as Allah says,</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur&#8217;an.)</span> (2:185)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbas and others have said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allah sent the Qur&#8217;an down all at one time from the Preserved Tablet (<em>Al-Lawh Al-Mahfuz</em>) to the House of Might (<em>Baytul-`Izzah</em>), which is in the heaven of this world. Then it came down in parts to the Messenger of Allah based upon the incidents that occurred over a period of twenty-three years.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah magnified the status of the Night of Al-Qadr, which He chose for the revelation of the Mighty Qur&#8217;an, by His saying,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَآ أَدْرَاكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ &#8211; لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(And what will make you know what the Night of Al-Qadr is The Night of Al-Qadr is better than a thousand months.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Hurayrah &#8220;When Ramadan would come, the Messenger of Allah would say,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ، شَهْرٌ مُبَارَكٌ، افْتَرَضَ اللهُ عَلَيْكُمْ صِيَامَهُ، تُفْتَحُ فِيهِ أَبْوَابُ الْجَنَّةِ، وَتُغْلَقُ فِيهِ أَبْوَابُ الْجَحِيمِ، وَتُغَلُّ فِيهِ الشَّيَاطِينُ، فِيهِ لَيْلَةٌ خَيْرٌ مِنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ، مَنْ حُرِمَ خَيْرَهَا فَقَدْ حُرِم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Verily, the month of Ramadan has come to you all. It is a blessed month, which Allah has obligated you all to fast. During it the gates of Paradise are opened, the gates of Hell are closed and the devils are shackled. In it there is a night that is better than one thousand months. Whoever is deprived of its good, then he has truly been deprived.)&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded this same Hadith. Aside from the fact that worship during the Night of Al-Qadr is equivalent to worship performed for a period of one thousand months, it is also confirmed in the Two Sahihs from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ قَامَ لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ إِيمَانًا وَاحْتِسَابًا غُفِرَ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِه</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Whoever stands (in prayer) during the Night of Al-Qadr with faith and expecting reward (from Allah), he will be forgiven for his previous sins.)</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The Descent of the Angels and the Decree for Every Good during the Night of Al-Qadr</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Therein descend the angels and the Ruh by their Lord&#8217;s permission with every matter.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning, the angels descend in abundance during the Night of Al-Qadr due to its abundant blessings. The angels descend with the descending of blessings and mercy, just as they descend when the Qur&#8217;an is recited, they surround the circles of Dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and they lower their wings with true respect for the student of knowledge. In reference to Ar-Ruh, it is said that here it means the angel Jibril. Therefore, the wording of the Ayah is a method of adding the name of the distinct object (in this case Jibril) separate from the general group (in this case the angels). Concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(with every matter.)</span> Mujahid said, &#8220;Peace concerning every matter.&#8221; Sa`id bin Mansur said, `Isa bin Yunus told us that Al-A`mash narrated to them that Mujahid said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(There is peace)</span> &#8220;It is security in which Shaytan cannot do any evil or any harm.&#8221; Qatadah and others have said, <strong>&#8220;The matters are determined during it, and the times of death and provisions are measured out (i.e., decided) during it.&#8221;</strong> Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">فِيهَا يُفْرَقُ كُلُّ أَمْرٍ حَكِيمٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Therein is decreed every matter of decree.)</span> (44:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(There is peace until the appearance of dawn.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa`id bin Mansur said, &#8220;Hushaym narrated to us on the authority of Abu Ishaq, who narrated that Ash-Sha`bi said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَنَزَّلُ الْمَلَـئِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ &#8211; سَلَـمٌ هِىَ حَتَّى مَطْلَعِ الْفَجْرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(With every matter, there is a peace until the appearance of dawn.)</span> `<strong>The angels giving the greetings of peace during the Night of Al-Qadr to the people in the Masjids until the coming of Fajr (dawn)</strong>.&#8221;&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatadah and Ibn Zayd both said concerning Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلَـمٌ هِىَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(There is peace.)</span> &#8220;This means all of it is good and there is no evil in it until the coming of Fajr (dawn).&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Specifying the Night of Decree and its Signs</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is supported by what Imam Ahmad recorded from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَيْلَةُ الْقَدْرِ فِي الْعَشْرِ الْبَوَاقِي، مَنْ قَامَهُنَّ ابْتِغَاءَ حِسْبَتِهِنَّ فَإِنَّ اللهَ يَغْفِرُ لَهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِنْ ذَنْبِهِ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ، وَهِيَ لَيْلَةُ وِتْرٍ: تِسْعٍ أَوْ سَبْعٍ أَوْ خَامِسَةٍ أَوْ ثَالِثَةٍ أَوْ آخِرِ لَيْلَة</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(The Night of Al-Qadr occurs during the last ten (nights). Whoever stands for them (in prayer) seeking their reward, then indeed Allah will forgive his previous sins and his latter sins. It is an odd night: the ninth, or the seventh, or the fifth, or the third or the last night (of Ramadan).) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah also said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ أَمَارَةَ لَيْلَةِ الْقَدْرِ أَنَّهَا صَافِيَةٌ بَلْجَةٌ، كَأَنَّ فِيهَا قَمَرًا سَاطِعًا، سَاكِنَةٌ سَاجِيَةٌ، لَا بَرْدَ فِيهَا وَلَا حَرَّ، وَلَا يَحِلُّ لِكَوْكَبٍ يُرْمَى بِهِ فِيهَا حَتْى يُصْبِحَ، وَإِنَّ أَمَارَتَهَا أَنَّ الشَّمْسَ صَبِيحَتَهَا تَخْرُجُ مُسْتَوِيَةً لَيْسَ لَهَا شُعَاعٌ، مِثْلَ الْقَمَرِ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ، وَلَا يَحِلُّ لِلشَّيْطَانِ أَنْ يَخْرُجَ مَعَهَا يَوْمَئِذ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Verily, the sign of the Night of Al-Qadr is that it is pure and glowing as if there were a bright, tranquil, calm moon during it. It is not cold, nor is it hot, and no shooting star is permitted until morning. Its sign is that the sun appears on the morning following it smooth having no rays on it, just like the moon on a full moon night. Shaytan is not allowed to come out with it (the sun) on that day.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This chain of narration is good. In its text there is some oddities and in some of its wordings there are things that are objectionable. Abu Dawud mentioned a section in his Sunan that he titled, &#8220;Chapter: Clarification that the Night of Al-Qadr occurs during every Ramadan.&#8221; Then he recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah was asked about the Night of Al-Qadr while I was listening and he said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">هِيَ فِي كُلِّ رَمَضَان</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It occurs during every Ramadan.)&#8221; The men of this chain of narration are all reliable, but Abu Dawud said that Shu`bah and Sufyan both narrated it from Ishaq and they both considered it to be a statement of the Companion (Ibn `Umar, and thus not the statement of the Prophet ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been reported that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allah performed I`tikaf during the first ten nights of Ramadan and we performed I`tikaf with him. Then Jibril came to him and said, `That which you are seeking is in front of you.&#8217; So the Prophet performed I`tikaf during the middle ten days of Ramadan and we also performed I`tikaf with him. Then Jibril came to him and said; `That which you are seeking is ahead of you.&#8217; So the Prophet stood up and gave a sermon on the morning of the twentieth of Ramadan and he said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ كَانَ اعْتَكَفَ مَعِيَ فَلْيَرْجِعْ فَإِنِّي رَأَيْتُ لَيْلَةَ الْقَدْرِ، وَإِنِّي أُنْسِيتُهَا، وَإِنَّهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ فِي وِتْرٍ، وَإِنِّي رَأَيْتُ كَأَنِّي أَسْجُدُ فِي طِينٍ وَمَاء</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Whoever performed I`tikaf with me, let him come back (for I`tikaf again), for verily I saw the Night of Al-Qadr, and I was caused to forget it, and indeed it is during the last ten (nights). It is during an odd night and I saw myself as if I were prostrating in mud and water.)</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The roof of the Masjid was made of dried palm-tree leaves and we did not see anything (i.e., clouds) in the sky. But then a patch of wind-driven clouds came and it rained. So the Prophet lead us in prayer until we saw the traces of mud and water on the forehead of the Messenger of Allah , which confirmed his dream.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration it adds that this occurred on the morning of the twenty-first night (meaning the next morning). They both (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) recorded it in the Two Sahihs. Ash-Shafi`i said, &#8220;This Hadith is the most authentic of what has been reported.&#8221; It has also been said that it is on the twenty-third night due to a Hadith narrated from `Abdullah bin Unays in Sahih Muslim. It has also been said that it is on the twenty-fifth night due to what Al-Bukhari recorded from Ibn `Abbas that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الْتَمِسُوهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ مِنْ رَمَضَانَ فِي تَاسِعَةٍ تَبْقَى، فِي سَابِعَةٍ تَبْقَى، فِي خَامِسَةٍ تَبْقَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Seek it in the last ten (nights) of Ramadan. In the ninth it still remains, in the seventh it still remains, in the fifth it still remains.)</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many have explained this Hadith to refer to the odd nights, and this is the most apparent and most popular explanation. It has also been said that it occurs on the twenty-seventh night because of what Muslim recorded in his Sahih from Ubay bin Ka`b that the Messenger of Allah mentioned that it was on the twenty-seventh night. Imam Ahmad recorded from Zirr that he asked Ubayy bin Ka`b, &#8220;O Abu Al-Mundhir! Verily, your brother Ibn Mas`ud says whoever stands for prayer (at night) the entire year, will catch the Night of Al-Qadr.&#8221; He (Ubayy) said, &#8220;May Allah have mercy upon him. Indeed he knows that it is during the month of Ramadan and that it is the twenty-seventh night.&#8221; Then he swore by Allah. Zirr then said, &#8220;How do you know that&#8221; Ubayy replied, &#8220;By a sign or an indication that he (the Prophet ) informed us of. It rises that next day having no rays on it &#8212; meaning the sun.&#8221; Muslim has also recorded it. It has been said that it is the night of the twenty-ninth. Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal recorded from `Ubadah bin As-Samit that he asked the Messenger of Allah about the Night of Decree and he replied,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فِي رَمَضَانَ فَالْتَمِسُوهَا فِي الْعَشْرِ الْأَوَاخِرِ، فَإِنَّهَا فِي وِتْرٍ إِحْدَى وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ ثَلَاثٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ خَمْسٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ سَبْعٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ تِسْعٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، أَوْ فِي آخِرِ لَيْلَة</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Seek it in Ramadan in the last ten nights. For verily, it is during the odd nights, the twenty-first, or the twenty-third, or the twenty-fifth, or the twenty-seventh, or the twenty-ninth, or during the last night.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad also recorded from Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah said about the Night of Al-Qadr,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهَا لَيْلَةُ سَابِعَةٍ أَوْ تَاسِعَةٍ وَعِشْرِينَ، وَإِنَّ الْمَلَائِكَةَ تِلْكَ اللَّيْلَةَ فِي الْأَرْضِ أَكْثَرُ مِنْ عَدَدِ الْحَصَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">(Verily, it is during the twenty-seventh or the twenty-ninth night. And verily, the angels who are on the earth during that night are more numerous than the number of pebbles.) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad was alone in recording this Hadith and there is nothing wrong with its chain of narration. At-Tirmidhi recorded from Abu Qilabah that he said, &#8220;<strong>The Night of Al-Qadr moves around (i.e., from year to year) throughout the last ten nights.</strong>&#8221; This view that At-Tirmidhi mentions from Abu Qilabah has also been recorded by Malik, Ath-Thawri, Ahmad bin Hanbal, Ishaq bin Rahuyah, Abu Thawr, Al-Muzani, Abu Bakr bin Khuzaymah and others. It has also been related from Ash-Shafi`i, and Al-Qadi reported it from him, and this is most likely. And Allah knows best.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Supplication during the Night of Decree</b></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recommended to supplicate often during all times, especially during the month of Ramadan, in the last ten nights, and during the odd nights of it even more so. It is recommended that one say the following supplication a lot: &#8220;O Allah! Verily, You are the Oft-Pardoning, You love to pardon, so pardon me.&#8221; This is due to what Imam Ahmad recorded from `A&#8217;ishah, that she said, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! If I find the Night of Al-Qadr what should I say&#8221; He replied,</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>قُولِي: اللْهُمَّ إِنَّكَ عَفُوٌّ تُحِبُّ الْعَفْوَ فَاعْفُ عَنِّي</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#808000;">O Allah! Verily, You are the Oft-Pardoning, You love to pardon, so pardon me.</span></strong>&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i and Ibn Majah have all recorded this Hadith. At-Tirmidhi said, &#8220;This Hadith is Hasan Sahih.&#8221; Al-Hakim recorded it in his Mustadrak (with a different chain of narration) and he said that it is authentic according to the criteria of the two Shaykhs (Al-Bukhari and Muslim). An-Nasa&#8217;i also recorded it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end of the Tafsir of Surah Laylat Al-Qadr, and all praise and blessings are due to Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">See <em>Fataawa Arkaan al-Islam</em> by Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Uthaymeen (may Allaah have mercy o­n him), p. 398; <em>Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daa’imah</em>, 8/300-316).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Eid prayer is o­ne where the imam attends and leads the people in praying two rak’ahs. ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: “The prayer of al-Fitr is two rak’ahs and the prayer of al-Adha is two rak’ahs, complete and not shortened, o­n the tongue of your Prophet, and the o­ne who fabricates lies is doomed.” Narrated by al-Nasaa’i, 1420 and Ibn Khuzaymah. Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <em>Saheeh al-Nasaa’i</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was narrated that Abu Sa’eed said: The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to come out o­n the day of al-Fitr and al-Adha to the prayer place, and the first thing he would do was to offer the prayer. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 956</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the first rak’ah he should say Takbeerat al-ihraam (say “Allaahu akbar” to start the prayer), after which he should say six or seven more takbeers, because of the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her), “The takbeer of al-Fitr and al-Adha is seven takbeers in the first rak’ah and five takbeers in the second, apart from the takbeer of rukoo’.” Narrated by Abu Dawood and classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in <em>Irwa’ al-Ghaleel</em>, 639. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he should recite al-Faatihah, and recite Soorat Qaf in the first rak’ah. In the second rak’ah he should stand up saying takbeer, and when he has stood up completely he should say takbeer five times, and recite Soorat al-Faatihah then Soorat al-Qamr. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite these two soorahs during the two Eids. Or if he wishes he can recite Soorat al-A’la in the first rak’ah and Soorat al-Ghaashiyah in the second, because it was narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to recite al-A’la and al-Ghaashiyah in the Eid prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The imam should revive the Sunnah be reciting these soorahs so that the Muslims will become familiar with the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the prayer, the imam should address the people. Part of the khutbah should be addressed specifically to the women, telling them of the things that they should do and warning them against the things that they should avoid, as the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) used to do.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>From Umm &#8216;Abdillah Al-Waadi&#8217;iyyah&#8217;s &#8220;My Advice to the Women&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Umm &#8216;Abdillah Al-Waadi&#8217;iyyah&#8217;s &#8220;Naseehati Lin-Nisaa&#8217; &#8221; (My Advice to the Women).   I typed this excerpt from the english translation published by Tarbiyyah Bookstore.  To save time in typing, I omitted the chains of narration for the ahadeeth (but still included all references), as some of them were rather long.  Other than that, I didn&#8217;t deviate from the translated text, translated by the brother Abul-Layth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Chapter: Whoever Does Not Show Mercy Will Not Be Shown Mercy (pages 117-122):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurayrah narrated that the Messenger of Allah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa salam, kissed Al-Hasan while Al-Aqra ibn Haabis at-Tameemee was sitting near him.  A-Aqra said, &#8220;Indeed I have ten children and I have never kissed any of them.&#8221;  The Messenger of Allah looked at him and said,  &#8220;Whoever does not show mercy will not be shown mercy.&#8221;  [Saheeh al-Bukhaari, 426/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Shaddaad ibn Aws who said that the Messenger of Alah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa salam, said, &#8220;Verily Allah has perscribed al-ihsaan (excellence) for everything.  So when you kill, you should kill in the best manner.  And when you slaughter, you should slaughter in the best manner.  Let each of you sharpen his knife to provide ease for his animal.&#8221;  [Saheeh Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Al-ihsaan&#8221; or &#8220;excellence&#8221; in the arabic language is procifency in performing an action, while perfecting it with sincerity.  In Islaamic law, Al-Ihsaan is what the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa salam, has explained in his statement:  &#8220;That you worship Allah as though you see Him, but since you are un able to see Him, then He most certainly sees you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab said concerning the prophetic narration of Shaddaad, &#8220;This prophetic narration indicates the obligation of excellence in all of the actions.&#8221;  [Jami&#8217;Al-Uloom 151]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the types of mercy which can be shown to a child is kissing him:  &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah said that a Bedouin man came to the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa salam, and  said, &#8220;You (people) kiss the children and we do not kiss them.&#8221;  So the Prophet said, &#8220;Is there anything that I can do once Allah has removed mercy from your heart?&#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhari 426/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umayr ibn Ishaaq said, &#8220;I was with Al-Hasan ibn &#8216;Alee when we met with Aboo Hurayrah who said, &#8220;Show me where I might kiss you in the place where I saw the messenger of Allah kiss.&#8221;  He replied, &#8220;Al-Qameesah&#8221; (shirt or upper garment), He said, &#8220;So he kissed the front of his stomach.&#8221;  [Ahmed with a hasan chain]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the types of mercy that can be shown to a child is carrying him while in prayer.  Abu Qataadah said that the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, came out to us with Umaamah bint Abeel-&#8216;Aas on his shoulders.  Then he prayed.  When he bowed, he placed her on the ground and when he rose from bowing, he lifted her back off the ground.&#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhaari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Shaddaad, from his father, who said that the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, came out to us for one of the &#8216;ishaa prayers carrying Hasan and Husayn.  The Messenger of Allah stepped forward and set them both down.  Then he prayed and prostrated between their backs a single prostration that was lengthy.  My (Abu Shaddaad&#8217;s) father said, &#8216;Then I raised my head and the child was on the back of the Messenger of Allah while he was prostrating.  I then returned to my prostration.&#8217;  So once the Messenger of Allah had completed his prayer, the people said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allah, certainly you have prostrated between two backs in your prayer.  Certainly the length of this prostration led us to believe that something had happened or that revelation had decended upon you.&#8217;  He, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, said, &#8216;None of that occured, rather this child moved around me and I didn&#8217;t wish to disturb him until he had finished.&#8217;  [hadeeth collected in An-Nasaa&#8217;ee, authenticated by Shaykh Muqbil]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the types of mercy that can be shown to smaller children is playing with them:  Umm Khaalid bint Khaalid ibn Sa&#8217;eed said, &#8220;I came to the Messenger of Allah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, along with my father and I was wearing a yellow shirt.  The messenger of Allah said, &#8216;Sanah, sanah!&#8217; (this means &#8216;good&#8217; in the ethiopian langauge)  Umm Khaalid further said, &#8216;Then I started playing with the seal of Prophethood.  My father admonished me, but the Messenger of Allah said (to my father) &#8216;Leave her.&#8217;  The Messenger of Allah then addressed me saying, &#8216;Ablee wa akhliqee, thumma ablee wa akhliqee, thumma ablee wa akhliqee.&#8217; (Trans. note: This phrase &#8216;ablee wa akhliqee&#8217; is used by the arabs to supplicate for an extended life.  Its meaning could be conveyed in the following expression: &#8216;May you live so long that your garments become worn and ragged.&#8217;)  So she (Umm Khaalid) remained this way until (this supplication for her became actualized and subsequently) she would be mentioned by the people,&#8221; meaning that she would remain until her garments became old and ragged.  [Saheeh Al-Bukhaari 425/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mahmood ibn Ar-Rabee&#8217; said, &#8220;I remember when I was a boy of Five years old, the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, took water from a bucket with his mouth (majjatan majjahaa) and threw it in my face.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh said, &#8221; &#8216;Majj&#8217; is the expelling of water from the mouth.  It is said that nothing is refered to as &#8216;majj&#8217; except if it is from a distance.   The action of the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, with Mahmood was either from his play with him or it was a means of blessing him with it just as he used to do with the children of his companions.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas ibn Maalik said, &#8220;Certainly the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, used to spend time with us to the extent that he even said to my young brother, &#8216;Oh father of &#8216;Umayr, what did the little birdie do?&#8217;  &#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhaari 526/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, from the types of mercy that can be shown to a child is placing the child in one&#8217;s lap.  &#8216;Usaamah ibn Zayd said that the Messenger of Allah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, used to take me and place me on his thigh and he would place al-Hasan ibn &#8216;Alee on his other thigh, then he would come close to us and say, &#8220;Oh Allah!  Please be merciful to them, for indeed, I am merciful to them.&#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhaari 434/10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this is how one might be affectionate with the smaller children concerning everything they might need or how they might be amused.  This is an appropiate means of showing them mercy and affection, as long as this does not lead towards bringing about improper behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly the Prophet, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, has praised the women of Quraysh because they possessed praiseworthy characteristics and from them is their affection for children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated upon Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah, salallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, said, &#8220;The best wome to ever ride the camel were the women of Quraysh.&#8221;  [Saheeh Al-Bukhari 511/9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said, &#8220;The most righteous from the women of Quraysh are those who are most affectionate (&#8220;ahnaah&#8221;) to the child during its youth and who are most protective concerning their husband&#8217;s property.&#8221;  Al-Haafidh said that &#8220;ahnaah&#8221; is from affection, which is compassion and tenderness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mercy that is shown to the young children and other than them is from the reasons that cause a person to achieve the mercy of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also reached us from the Prophet, slallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, that he said, &#8220;He is not from us who does not show mercy to the young and does not honor the old.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ill Allaah, Muhammad-ur- Rasul-Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah, and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam = May the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) is the Messenger of Allaah ].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have noticed that most of the Europeans and others, who embrace Islam, do not understand the reality of the meaning of the first fundamental principle of Islam, i.e. &#8220;La ilaha ill Allaah (None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah &#8211; and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah.&#8221; So I consider it essential to explain something of the meanings of this Great Sentence (i.e. Principle) in some detail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ill Allaah, Muhammad-ur-: Rasulullah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah &#8230;.. and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah&#8221; It has <strong>three aspects</strong> : A, B and C.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aspect A: It is that, you have. to pledge a covenant with (Allaah), the Creator of the Heavens and Earth, the Ruler of all that exists, the Lord of Majesty and Highness, on four points (or conditions):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point 1</strong>: A confession with your heart that the-Creator (of everything) is Allaah, it is that you have to say: &#8220;I testify that the Creator of all the universe including the stars, the planets, the sun, the moon, the heavens, the earth with all its known and unknown forms of life, is Allaah.. He is the Organizer and Planner of all its affairs. It is He Who gives life and death, and He (i.e. .Allaah -Alone) is the Sustainer, and the Giver of Security, etc. &#8220;And this is called your confession for the Oneness of the Lordship of Allaah,&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;TAUHID Ar-Rububiyya&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point 2</strong>: A confession with your heart that you have to say: &#8220;I testify that: None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah Alone. The word &#8220;Worship&#8221; (i.e. &#8216;Ibadah) carries a great number of meanings in the Arabic language: It conveys that all kinds of worship are meant for Allaah (and none .else, whether it be an angel, Messenger, Prophet, Jesus-son of Mary, Ezra, Muhammad, saint, idol, the sun, the moon and all other kinds of false deities). So pray to none but Allaah, invoke none but Allaah, ask for help from none (unseen) but Allaah, swear by none but Allaah, offer an animal as sacrifice to none but Allaah,&#8230;etc., and that means &#8211; all what Allaah and His Messenger (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) order you to do, (in His Book. The Qur&#8217;an and in the As-Sunna (Legal ways of Prophet Muhammad , sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) you must do, and all that Allaah and His Messenger (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) forbid you, you must not do.&#8221; And this is called (your confession for the) &#8220;Oneness of the Worship of Allaah.&#8221;&#8211; &#8220;Tauhid Al-Uluhiyya&#8221;. And that you (mankind) worship none but Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point 3</strong>: A confession with your heart that you have to say: &#8220;O Allaah! I testify that all the best of names and the most perfect qualities with which You have named or qualified Yourself in Your Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) or as Your Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) has named or qualified You, with his statement,&#8221; &#8230;&#8230; I confirm that all those (names and qualifications) are for You without changing their meanings or neglecting them completely or giving resemblance to others.&#8221; As Allaah said: &#8220;There is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 42:11). This Holy Verse confirms the quality of hearing and the quality of sight for Allaah without resemblance to others (the creation), and likewise. He also said: &#8220;To one whom I have created with Both My Hands,&#8221; ( Qur&#8217;an 38:75).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and He also said: &#8220;The Hand of Allaah is over their hands.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 48: 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This confirms two Hands for Allaah, but there is no similarity (i.e. they are NOT like human hands) for them. Similarly Allaah said: &#8220;The Most Beneficent (Allaah) &#8220;Istawa&#8221; (rose over) the (Mighty) Throne.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 20:5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He rose over the Throne really in a manner that suits His Majesty. And Allaah is over His Throne over the seventh Heaven, as the slave-girl pointed towards the Heavens, when Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Muhammad sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) asked her as to where Allaah is? He only comes down over the first (nearest) Heaven to us on the Day of &#8216;Arafat (Hajj, i.e. the 9th of Dhul-Hijja), and also during the last third part of the night as mentioned by the Prophet (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam), but He is with us by His Knowledge only, not by His Personal-Self (bidhatihi). It is not like that, as some people say that Allaah is present everywhere, here. there, and even inside the breasts of men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sees and hears all that we do or utter, etc. And this is called (your confession for the) &#8220;Oneness of the Names and Qualities of Allaah&#8221; &#8220;Tauhid Al-Asma was-Sifat&#8221; and this is the Right Faith, the faith which was followed by the Messengers of Allaah (from Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, Solomon, Jesus to Muhammad ( peace of Allaah be upon them all) and the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) and the righteous followers of these Messengers (peace of Allaah be upon them all).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point IV</strong>:A confession with your heart that you have to say: &#8220;O Allaah! I testify that Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is Your Messenger.&#8221; That means that none has the right to be followed after Allaah. but the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam), as he is the Last of His Messengers. As Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is not the father of any man among you but he is the Messenger of Allaah and the last (end) of the Prophets and Allaah is Ever All-Aware of everything&#8221; ( Qur&#8217;an 33:40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) gives you, take it and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain from it,&#8221;(Qur&#8217;an 59:7).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said: &#8220;Say (O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, to mankind): If you (really) love Allaah, then follow me.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;an 3:31).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for others than Muhammad ( sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ), their statements are to be taken or rejected as to whether these are in accordance with Allaah&#8217;s Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) or with the Sunna (legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) of the Prophet (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) or not. As the Divine Inspiration has stopped after the death of the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) and it will not resume except at the time of the Descent of Jesus, son of Mary and he (i.e. Jesus) will rule with justice according to the Islamic Laws. during the last days of the world as it has been mentioned in the authentic Hadith (i.e. Narration of the Prophet Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ) (sahih-Al-Bukhari Vol. 3, Hadith No. 425)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aspect B:. It is essential to utter, &#8220;La ilaha ill Allaah, Muhammad-ur-Rasul Allaah&#8221; (&#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah, and Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah &#8220;. As it has come in the statement of the Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alayhi wa sallam) to his uncle Abu Talib at the time of the latter&#8217;s death: &#8220;O uncle, if you utter it (&#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah, and Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, is the Messenger of Allaah&#8217;), then I shall be able to argue on your behalf before Allaah, on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; Similarly, when Abu Dhar Al-Ghifari embraced Islam, he went to Al-Masjid-al-Haram and he proclaimed it loudly in front of the Quraish infidels Until he was beaten severely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aspect C: . It is essential that the limbs and all other parts and organs of one&#8217;s body testify to it, and this is very important as regards its meaning (i.e., the meaning of &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah. and Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, is the Messenger of Allaah&#8221;). So whoever has confessed this (with his Lord), he shall not Commit sins like robbing. killing, stealing, illegal sexual intercourse, eating pig meat. drinking alcoholic beverages, taking undue advantage of orphan&#8217;s property. cheating in trade. bribery and earning money through illegal means. etc&#8230; or otherwise the limbs, all other parts and organs of his body will testify against him that he was a liar in his words which he pledged to Allaah. In case he commits the above sins, he should know that it is a sin that obliges him to repent to Allaah, and ask His Forgiveness, as (his) body parts (i.e. skin, private parts, hands, tongue ears. etc.) will testify to the above mentioned crimes (i.e. actions) against his self on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And with the confession of this Great Sentence (i.e. Principle) a person enters in the fold of (i.e. embraces) the Islamic Religion accordingly, it is essential for him to believe in all the Messengers of Allaah and not to differentiate between them. As it is mentioned in His Book, Allaah said: &#8220;Do then those who disbelieve think that they can take My Slaves (i.e. the angels; Allaah&#8217;s Messengers; Jesus, son of Mary, etc.) as Auliya&#8221; (Lords, Gods, Protectors etc.) besides Me? Verily, We have prepared Hell as an entertainment for the disbelievers (in the Oneness of Allaah&#8211;Islamic Monotheism). Say (O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam): Shall We tell you the greatest losers in respect of (their) deeds?&#8221; Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life, while they thought they were acquiring good by their deeds&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Those are they who deny the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of their Lord and in the meeting with Him (in the Hereafter). So their works are in vain, and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall not give them any weight.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;That shall be their recompense, Hell, because they disbelieved and took My Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, revelations, etc.) and My Messengers by way of jest and mockery. &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily! Those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah Islamic&#8211;Monotheism), and do righteous deeds, they shall have the gardens of Al-Firdaus (Paradise) for their entertainment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Wherein they shall dwell (for ever). No desire will they have to be removed there from.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Say ( O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ! to Mankind): If the sea were ink ( with which to write) the Words of my Lord, surely the sea would be exhausted, before the Words of my Lord would be finished even if We brought (another sea) like it for its aid.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Say (O Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam ), I am only a man like you, it has been inspired to me that your Ilah (God) is One Ilah (God &#8212; i.e. Allaah). So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.&#8221; (The Qur&#8217;an 18: 102-1 10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This introduction is necessary for anyone who wishes to embrace Islam. After this confession he (or she ) should take a bath (i.e. Ghusl) and then offer a two Rak&#8217;at prayer, and act upon the five Principles of Islam, as narrated by Ibn &#8216;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) in the Book, Sahih Al-Bukhari. Vol. I Hadith No.7 : Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him), Allaah&#8217;s Messenger , sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, said: Islam is based on (the following five (principles):</p>
<p>1. To testify La ilaha ill Allaah wa anna Muhammad-ar-Rasul Allaah (None has the right to be worshipped but Allaah and that Muhammad, sallalahu alayhi wa sallam, is Allaah&#8217;s Messenger).</p>
<p>2. To offer the (compulsory congregational) prayers dutifully and perfectly (Iqamat-as -Salat).</p>
<p>3. To pay Zakat (i.e. obligatory charity).</p>
<p>4. To perform Hajj (i.e. Pilgrimage to Makka).</p>
<p>5. To observe fast during the month of Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and must believe in the six Articles of Faith, i.e. to believe in:</p>
<p>(I) Allaah,<br />
(2) His Angels,<br />
(3) His Messengers,<br />
(4) His Revealed Books,<br />
(5) the Day of Resurrection, and<br />
(6) Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainments i.e. whatever Allaah has ordained must come to pass).]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad ibn Salih al-`Uthaymeen<br />
Explanation of the Three Fundamental Principles of Islaam<br />
© 1997 al-Hidaayah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ihsaan is the opposite of behaving badly, and it means that a person strives to do what is good and to repel harmful things. So he strives to benefit the servants of Allaah through his wealth, position, knowledge and his person. So as for the case of doing good with ones wealth, then he spends and gives in charity, and pays the zakaat, and the best of the types of doing good through wealth is the zakaat since it is one of the pillars of Islaam, and one of its great foundations. A person&#8217;s Islaam will not be complete without it. It is the charity most loved by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and that is followed by that which it is obligatory upon a person to spend upon his wife, mother, father, children, brothers, children of his brothers, sisters, paternal uncles, paternal aunts, maternal aunts, and so on. Then by charity given to the poor and to the rest of those deserving of charity &#8211; such as students of knowledge for example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the case of doing good by means of ones position, then it is that people are found in different levels. Some of them have status with someone in authority and so strive to benefit the people by means of his position. So if a man comes to him and requests that he should intercede for him with the one in authority then he does so, either to repel some harm from him or to attain some good for him, As for doing good by means of his knowledge, then it is that he strives to pass on his knowledge to Allaah&#8217;s servants, in open and private gatherings and assemblies. Even if people sit socially, to drink coffee, then it pertains to good and fine behaviour that he should teach the people. Even if you are in a public gathering it is from what is good that you teach the people. However wisdom is to be used in this matter. So you should not weary the people making it a habit that every single time you sit in a gathering you admonish and address the people, since the Prophet used to give them admonition now and then, and not too frequently. This is because the souls become weary and bored. When they become bored they become languid and weak and may even come to dislike what is good merely because of the frequency with which the per son stands and addresses them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for seeking to benefit the people with ones person, then the Prophet sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallam said: &#8220;&#8230; that you help a man to mount and ride his riding beast, or you lift up his luggage on to it for him, is a charity&#8221; [Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. Transl. 4/90-94/no. 161) and Muslim (Eng. transl. 2/483-484/ no. 2204)]. So you help this man to carry his luggage, or you guide him to the correct road to take and so on, all of this pertains to ihsaan. So this is with regard to striving to do good to the servants of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for ihsaan in the worship of Allaah, then it is that you worship Allaah as if you were seeing Him, as the Prophet ( said. So worship done in this way, that a person worships his Lord as if he were actually seeing Him is worship that is accompanied by yearning and seeking. So a person will find that his soul encourages him upon worship done in this way, since he is yearning for the one he loves. Therefore he worships Him as if he were seeing Him, and he directs his heart to Him and turns to Him and seeks to draw near to Him, He the One free of all imperfections and the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then even though you do not see Him, then He certainly sees you.&#8221; This part shows worship done whilst fleeing and fearing, and is therefore the second level of ihsaan. So if you do not worship Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, as if you are seeing Him and seeking Him and your soul is encouraging you towards Him, then worship Him keeping in mind that He sees you. So you will then worship Him as one who fears Him and seeks to flee from His retribution and punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This level is held by those having knowledge of these affairs to be lower than the first level. Worship of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, is, as Ibn al-Qayyim, rahimahullaah, said: &#8216;Worship of the Most Merciful is utmost love of Him, along with the worshippers submission and humility, they are its two pillars.&#8217; So worship is built upon these two matters: utmost love, and utmost humility and submission. Love causes one to desire and seek, and humility causes one to fear and flee. This is ihsaan in the worship of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. If a person worships Allaah in this manner, then he will become one who is pure and sincere in his worship of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. He will not desire with his worship that he is seen by the people, or heard of, nor will he desire their praise. It will be the same to him whether the people notice him or do not notice him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He will worship with ihsaan in every condition. Indeed part of the completion of purity and sincerity of worship (al-ikhlaas) is that a person should seek not to be seen by the people when he worships, and that his worship should be a secret between him and his Lord. That is unless there is some benefit for the Muslims or for Islaam in his performing it openly, for example if he is a person who is followed and taken as an example and he wishes to manifest his worship to the people so that they should take it as an example to follow; or that he manifests his worship so that his companions, friends and associates should follow his example, then this is good. This benefit which he takes account of may be more excellent and greater than the benefit of keeping it hidden. Therefore, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, has praised those who spend of their wealth in charity secretly and openly. So whenever performing it secretly is better and more beneficial for the heart, and causes one to be more humble and submissive, and to turn to Allaah more attentively, then they give in secret. But when performing it openly produces benefit for Islaam, due to manifestation of its prescribed practices, and will mean that the people follow this persons example, then they do this openly. The Believer looks to what is most appropriate. So whatever is most appropriate and most beneficial in worship, then it will be what is most complete and most excellent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the ruling on Insurance, wether it be life insurance or property insurance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Insuring one&#8217;s life and property is forbidden; it is not permissible due to the fact that Al-Gharar (Uncertainty, Risk or Speculation) and usury are involved therein. And Allah &#8211; the Almighty the All-Powerful &#8211; has forbidden all types of dealings that involver usury and dealings in which there is Al-Gharar (Uncertainty, Risk or Speculation), as a mercy for the (muslim) community and a protection for them for what is harmful to them. Allah &#8211; Most Glorified, Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;where as Allah has permitted trading and forbidden riba&#8221; (usury). Al-Baqarah 2:275</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has been authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) that he forbade selling AL-Gharar. And Allah is the granter of success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The following is taken from the Book <strong>&#8216;Words of Advice Regarding Da&#8217;wah&#8217;</strong> from Shaykh &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Azeez ibn &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Baaz, compiled by Ziyaad ibn Muhammad as-Sa&#8217;doon</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;The youth in any nation are the backbone which form the element of movement and vitality in society. They have the energy to bring about effective results&#8230;Usually a nation is never revived except due to the awareness and continuous enthusiasm of the youth. However, <strong>over-enthusiasm of the youth must be guided through the wisdom of the old</strong>. The youth must contemplate and look into the experiences of the old, they shouldn&#8217;t leave one for the other, but rather must preserve both of these qualities&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;<strong>The leaders and the scholars</strong> should exert efforts to enlighten and direct the population of Muslims and combat the efforts of the enemies of Islaam, by retaliating with their own efforts&#8230;The Muslim Ummah is an Ummah that has been entrusted with this religion and has the responsibility of conveying it. If we are careful to arm our boys and girls in Islamic societies, with knowledge, understanding and comprehension of Islamic Jurisprudence and accustom them to apply these things from a small age, then we will not fear, by the permission of Allaah, the Most High, as long as they continue holding onto the deen of Allaah, glorifying it, following its laws, and fighting that which contradicts it. And indeed their enemies will fear them&#8230;There are many verses in the Qur&#8217;aan which convey this message. The most important factor for us in fighting against the efforts of our enemies is <strong>raising and preparing a generation that knows the reality of Islaam</strong>. This can be achieved through guidance, taking care of the house and family, the method of educating them, the media and improvement of the society&#8230;In addition to this is the role of steering and guiding which needs to be taken by the Muslim leadership, persevering in beneficial work and continually reminding the people that which will benefit them and make the belief within them grow and flourish&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have read and heard in the news much about our Muslim brothers in communities where the majority of the population is non-Muslim. They are under authorities which impose restrictions on them, in practicing their religion and establishing their rites of worship, in order to distance them from their religion through compulsion and in other ways. We ask Allaah to firmly establish these Muslim minorities, and indeed all the Muslims upon Islaam and keep them safe from the plots of the enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that they are in a seriously vulnerable situation. Because of this situation, these <strong>Islamic minorities need all the help, co-operation and assistance</strong>, from the political sphere and this is specially from the Islamic governments from the Arab world as well as others that have special concern for Islaam. They have relations with these nations through sending delegates, dispatching messages and urging their embassies to act, or any other similar methods that will help their brothers in these regions. This will raise the morale of the minorities and make the (oppressing) nations realize that these minorities have brothers from the same faith, who are concerned about their situation and who follow their news. If Allaah, the Most High wills, the injustice and oppression will then be lifted from the Muslims when these oppressing nations and others begin to realize that behind the minority of Muslims is a nation which feels their pain and is interested in their affairs. As a result they will give into their requests and will raise their hand from oppressing them, especially when the majority of these nations need Islamic countries for their economic and other affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the minority of Muslims everywhere are in urgent need of moral support and material help and resources to build mosques and schools that will help them in their Islamic work&#8230;So therefore it is obligatory upon every Muslim to help in accordance to his ability&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally I advise my Muslim brothers and sisters in Islaam, to have taqwa (fear) of Allaah in all matters and to be firmly established on His deen. They should fear Him wherever they are and be heedful of Him. They should take account of themselves, and be careful not to leave what Allaah has made obligatory upon them, nor to commit a sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise them to <strong>co-operate upon Birr and Taqwa</strong> and to be sincere to each other and advise each other with truth and patience wherever they are. I also advise them to gain a deep and good understanding of the deen and attend circles of knowledge and question the scholars&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to make those in charge of the Muslims and their leaders, upright and honest and to guide everyone to the straight path. I ask Him to make their leaders and their aides successful, and all their people to rule by the Islamic laws and rulings. And to be ruled by them, to be firmly established upon them, and to advise each other upon them, and to beware of and forbid that which contradicts them&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah, the Most High, and peace and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and his Companions.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The following is taken from &#8216;Al-Ibaanah&#8217; magazine (Vol 1, No.2, pp.7-8), being a translation of Ad-Da&#8217;wah Ilallaah wa Akhlaaqud-Du&#8217;aat (pp.37-43) by Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz:</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon the da&#8217;ee (caller) to have <strong>ikhlaas</strong> (sincerity and purity of intentions and actions) for Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; <strong>neither desiring to show-off, nor desiring reputation, nor desiring the praises and the accolades of the people</strong>. Rather, the da&#8217;ee should only call to Allaah, seeking the Face of Allaah&#8230;and this is the most important etiquette and the greatest quality&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;call the people to Allaah upon <strong>&#8216;ilm (knowledge)</strong>, and not ignorance&#8230;so beware of calling to Allaah based upon ignorance, and beware of speaking without due knowledge. Indeed, ignorance destroys, it does not build; and it causes corruption, not reformation and correction&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the akhlaaq that it is necessary to have &#8211; O da&#8217;ee &#8211; is to be <strong>mild and forbearing</strong> in your da&#8217;wah, and being gentle and patient in it, as were all the Messengers &#8216;alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam. <strong>Beware of being hasty, harsh</strong> and strict in your da&#8217;wah, rather be patient, mild and gentle&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not turn the people away from the Deen due to your harshness, ignorance, or other such behavior. On the contrary, be mild, forbearing and patient; and be soft and pleasant in speech, so your words may have an effect upon the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect upon the one you are addressing the call to. Then the people will better appreciate your call and invitation. So undue strictness causes people to become distant, not close; and it causes separation, not unity. Therefore, it is a must to be gentle, as the Messenger &#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed gentleness does not enter into anything except it beautifies it, nor is it removed from anything except that it disfigures it</span>.&#8221; [Muslim 12/212].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he &#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam also said:</p>
<p> &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Whosoever is prevented from gentleness, is actually prevented from all good and excellence</span>.&#8221; [Muslim 16/145].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the necessary &#8211; or rather obligatory &#8211; etiquettes and qualities that a da&#8217;ee must possess is <strong>acting in accordance to what he is calling to</strong>, and being a righteous example of what is being called to. He should not call to do something and then not do it himself, nor call to leave something, whilst engaging in it himself. This is the condition of the losers &#8211; we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge in this!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;the daa&#8217;ee should have an <strong>excellent character and praiseworthy conduct</strong>, <strong>being patient</strong> and inviting to patience. The daa&#8217;ee should be <strong>sincere in his da&#8217;wah</strong> and strive in spreading goodness to the people and keeping them away from falsehood. At the same time the daa&#8217;ee should <strong>supplicate for the guidance of others</strong>, saying: &#8220;O Allaah! Guide him, and grant him the ability to accept the truth.&#8221; So from the excellent manners of the da&#8217;ee is supplicating, guiding and being patient with the harms that come with this da&#8217;wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet &#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam was informed that the tribe of Daws had become disobedient he said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O Allaah! Guide Daws and bring them.&#8221;</span> [Bukhaaree 6/105]. So the daa&#8217;ee should&#8230;not despair, nor feel hopeless, nor say anything except good. He should not be harsh and strict, nor should he say a word which may cause aversion to the truth. However, if anyone commits aggression and oppression, then a different treatment is to be afforded to such people&#8230;if possible such a person should be imprisoned, or something similar to that &#8211; depending upon the nature of his opposition to the da&#8217;wah. However, as long as he causes no harm, then it is upon you to be patient and self-evaluating and to debate with him in ways that are best. If any personal harm was caused by such a person, then such harm should be borne with patience &#8211; as did the Messengers and those who followed them in goodness and righteousness, patiently bear such harms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to grant us all the well-being and the ability to convey this da&#8217;wah in a wise manner, that He corrects our hearts and our actions, and that He grants to us the understanding of the Deen and firmness upon it &#8211; making us of those who are guided and guiding others, righteous and teaching others righteousness. Indeed He is the Most Majestic, the Supreme, the Most Generous.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Two Episodes of Jewish Mischief [From Tafsir Soorah al-`Isra]<br />
Imam Ibn Kathir<br />
Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged), Volume 5<br />
© Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surah 17. Al-Isra&#8217; (4-8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. And We decreed for the Children of Israel in the Scripture:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed you would do mischief in the land twice and you will become tyrants and extremely arrogant!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. So, when the promise came for the first of the two, We sent against you servants of Ours given to terrible warfare. They entered the very innermost parts of your homes. And it was a promise (completely) fulfilled. 6. <i>Then We gave you a return of victory over them. And We helped you with wealth and children and made you more numerous in manpower.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>7. (And We said): &#8220;If you do good, you do good for your own selves, and if you do evil (you do it) against yourselves.&#8221; Then, when the second promise came to pass, (We permitted your enemies) to disgrace your faces and to enter the Masjid as they had entered it before, and to destroy with utter destruction all that fell in their hands.</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>8. It may be that your Lord may show mercy unto you, but if you return (to sins). We shall return (to Our punishment). And We have made Hell a prison for the disbelievers.</i></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">It was mentioned in the Tawrah that the Jews would spread Mischief twice</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah tells us that He made a declaration to the Children of Israel in the Scripture, meaning that He had already told them in the Book which He revealed to them, that they would cause mischief on the earth twice, and would become tyrants and extremely arrogant, meaning they would become shameless oppressors of people, Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And We made known this decree to him, that the root of those (sinners) was to be cut off in the early morning. </strong>(15:66),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning, We already told him about that and informed him of it.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The First Episode of Mischief caused by the Jews, and their Punishment for it</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So, when the promise came for the first of the two</strong>, meaning the first of the two episodes of mischief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We sent against you servants of Ours given to terrible warfare.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">means, &#8216;We unleashed soldiers against you from among Our creatures who were given to terrible warfare,&#8217; i.e., they had great strength and weapons and power. They entered the very innermost parts of your homes, meaning they took possession of your land and invaded the very innermost parts of your homes, going between and through your houses, coming and going freely with no fear of anyone. This was the promise (completely) fulfilled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The earlier and later commentators differed over the identity of these invaders. Many <i>Isra`iliyyat</i> (reports from Jewish sources) were narrated about this, but I did not want to make this book too long by mentioning them, because some of them are fabricated, concocted by their heretics, and others may be true, but we have no need of them, praise be to Allah. What Allah has told us in His Book (the Qur&#8217;an) is sufficient and we have no need of what is in the other books that came before. Neither Allah nor His Messenger required us to refer to them. Allah told His Messenger sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam that when (the Jews) committed transgression and aggression, Allah gave their enemies power over them to destroy their country and enter the innermost parts of their homes. Their humiliation and subjugation was a befitting punishment, and your Lord is never unfair or unjust to His servants. They had rebelled and killed many of the Prophets and scholars. Ibn Jarir recorded that Yahya bin Satd said: &#8220;I heard Sa&#8217;id bin Al-Musayyib saying: &#8216;Nebuchadnezzar conquered Ash-Sham (Greater Syria, including Palestine), destroying Jerusalem and killing them, then he came to Damascus and found blood boiling in a censer. He asked them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is this blood? They said: We found our forefathers doing this. Because of that blood, he killed seventy thousand of the believers and others, then the blood stoppedboiling.&#8221;[At-Tabari 17:369.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This report is <i>Sahih</i> from Said bin Al-Musayyib, and this event is well-known, as he (Nebuchadnezzar) killed their nobles and scholars, and did not leave alive anyone who knew the Tawrah by heart. He took many prisoners from the sons of the Prophets and others, and did many other things that would take too long to mention here. If we had found anything that was correct or close enough, we could have written it and reported it here. And Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(And We said): &#8220;If you do good, you do good for your own selves, and if you do evil (you do it) against yourselves.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Allah says elsewhere:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Whosoever does a righteous good deed, it is for (the benefit of) himself; and whosoever does evil, it is against himself. </strong>[45:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second Episode of Mischief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Then, when the second promise came to pass</strong>, meaning, the second episode of mischief, when your enemies came again,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(We permitted your enemies) to disgrace your faces</strong>, meaning, to humiliate you and subdue you,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>and to enter the Masjid</strong>, meaning, Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>as they had entered it before</strong>, when they entered the very innermost parts of your homes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and to destroy wrecking and inflicting ruin upon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>all that fell in their hands</strong>, everything they could get their hands on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>with utter destruction. It may be that your Lord may show mercy unto you</strong> , meaning that He may rid you of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>but if you return (to sins). We shall return (to Our punishment)</strong>,  meaning, if you return to causing mischief,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We shall return </strong>means We will once again punish you in this world, along with the punishment and torment We save for you in the Hereafter.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And We have made Hell a prison [Hasir] for the disbelievers</strong>, meaning, a place of permanent detention, a prison which cannot be avoided or escaped. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;<i>Hasiir </i>here means a jail.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:390] Mujahid said, &#8220;They will be detained in it.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:390] Others said likewise. Al-Hasan said, &#8220;<i>Hasir </i>means a bed of Fire.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:390] Qatadah said: &#8220;The Children of Israel returned to aggression, so Allah sent this group against them, Muhammad sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam and his companions, who made them pay the <i>Jizyah</i>, [a tax levied from People of the Book (Jews and Christians) who are under the protection of a Muslim government] with willing submission, and feeling themselves subdued.&#8221; [At-Tabari 17:389]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2.246. Have you not thought about the group of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Musa When they said to a Prophet of theirs, &#8220;Appoint for us a king and we will fight in Allah&#8217;s way.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Would you then refrain from fighting, if fighting was prescribed for you&#8221; They said, &#8220;Why should we not fight in Allah&#8217;s way while we have been driven out of our homes and our children (families have been taken as captives)&#8221; But when fighting was ordered for them, they turned away, all except a few of them. And Allah is All-Aware of the wrongdoers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujahid said that the Prophet (mentioned in the Ayah 2:246 above) is Shamwil (Samuel). Wahb bin Munabbih said: The Children of Israel remained on the straight path for a period of time after Moses. They then innovated in the religion and some of them even worshipped the idols. Yet, there were always Prophets sent among them who would command them to work righteous deeds, refrain from doing evil and who would rule them according to the commands of the Torah. When they (Israelites) committed the evil that they committed, Allah caused their enemies to overwhelm them, and many fatalities fell among them as a consequence. Their enemies also captured a great number of them, and took over large areas of their land. Earlier, anyone who would fight the Israelites would lose, because they had the Torah and the Tabut, which they inherited generation after generation ever since the time of Moses, who spoke to Allah directly. Yet, the Israelites kept indulging in misguidance until some king took the Tabut from them during a battle. That king also took possession of the Torah, and only a few of the Israelites who memorized it remained. The prophethood halted among their various tribes and only a pregnant woman remained of the offspring of Lavi (Levi), in whom the prophethood still appeared. Her husband had been killed, so the Israelites kept her in a house so that Allah may give her a boy, who would be their Prophet. The woman also kept invoking Allah to grant her a boy. Allah heard her pleas and gave her a boy whom she called `Shamwil&#8217; meaning `Allah has heard my pleas.&#8217; Some people said that the boy&#8217;s name was Sham`un (Simeon), which also has a similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As that boy grew, Allah raised him to be a righteous person. When he reached the age of prophethood, Allah revealed to him and commanded him to call (his people) to Him and to His Tawhid (Oneness). Shamwil called the Children of Israel (to Allah) and they asked him to appoint a king over them so that they could fight their enemies under his command. The kingship had also ended among them. Their Prophet said to them, &#8220;What if Allah appoints a king over you, would you fulfill your vow to fight under his command&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They said, &#8220;Why should we not fight in Allah&#8217;s way while we have been driven out of our homes and our children&#8221;) meaning, `After our land had been confiscated and our children had been taken from us&#8217; Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But when fighting was ordered for them, they turned away, all except a few of them. And Allah is All-Aware of the wrongdoers) meaning, only a few of them kept their promise, but the majority abandoned Jihad and Allah has full knowledge of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(247. And their Prophet said to them, &#8220;Indeed Allah has appointed Talut (Saul) as a king over you.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How can he be a king over us when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Verily, Allah has chosen him above you and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature. And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills. And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures&#8217; needs, All-Knower.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Israelites asked their Prophet to appoint a king over them, he appointed Talut (Saul), who was then a soldier. But, Talut was not a descendant of the house of kings among them, which was exclusively in the offspring of Yahudha (Judah). This is why they said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(How can he be a king over us) meaning, how can he be the king for us,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(when we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and he has not been given enough wealth) They said that Talut was also poor and did not have the wealth that justifies him being king. Some people stated that Talut used to bring water to the people, while others stated that his profession was dyeing skins. The Jews, thus, disputed with their Prophet while they were supposed to obey him and to say good words to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their Prophet answered them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah has chosen him above you) meaning, `Allah chose Talut from amongst you while having better knowledge about him.&#8217; Their Prophet stated, &#8220;I did not choose Talut to be your king on my own. Rather, Allah has commanded that upon your request.&#8221; Further:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and has increased him abundantly in knowledge and stature.) meaning, `Talut is more knowledgeable and honorable than you, and stronger and more patient during combat, and has more knowledge of warfare. In short, he has more knowledge and is stronger than you are. The king should have sufficient knowledge, be fair looking and should have a strong soul and body.&#8217; He then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah grants His kingdom to whom He wills.) meaning, Allah Alone is the Supreme Authority Who does what He wills and no one can ask Him about His actions, while they will be asked (about their actions by Him). This is because Allah has perfect knowledge, wisdom and kindness with His creation. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures&#8217; needs, All-Knower.) meaning, His favor is encompassing and He grants His mercy to whom He wills. He also knows those who deserve to be kings and those who do not deserve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(248. And their Prophet said to them: &#8220;Verily! The sign of His kingdom is that there shall come to you At-Tabut, wherein is Sakinah (peace and reassurance) from your Lord and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind, carried by the angels. Verily, in this is a sign for you if you are indeed believers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their Prophet then proclaimed, &#8220;The sign of the blessings of Talut&#8217;s kingship over you is that Allah will give you back the Tabut (wooden box) that has been taken from you.&#8221; Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(wherein is Sakinah from your Lord) meaning, peace (or grace) and reassurance. `Abdur-Razzaq stated that Qatadah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(wherein is Sakinah) means grace. In addition, Ar-Rabi` said that Sakinah means mercy. This is also the meaning given by Ibn `Abbas, as Al-`Awfi narrated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind,)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir related that Ibn `Abbas said about this Ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind, ) Meaning, Moses&#8217; staff and the remnants of the Tablets. This is the same Tafsir of Qatadah, As-Suddi, Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and `Ikrimah, who added, &#8220;And also the Torah.&#8221; `Abdur-Razzaq said that he asked Ath-Thawri about the meaning of,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and a remnant of that which Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron) left behind,)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ath-Thawri said, &#8220;Some said that it contained a pot of manna and the remnants of the Tablets, while some others said that it contained (Moses&#8217;) staff and two shoes (and refer to 20:12).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;carried by the angels.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj stated that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;The angels came down while carrying the Tabut between the sky and the earth, until they placed it before Talut while the people were watching.&#8221; As-Suddi said, &#8220;The Tabut was brought to Talut&#8217;s house, so the people believed in the prophethood of Sham`un (Simeon) and obeyed Talut&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, in this is a sign for you) testifying to my truth in what I was sent with, my prophethood, and my command to you to obey Talut,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(if you are indeed believers. ) in Allah and the Hereafter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(249. Then when Talut set out with the army, he said: &#8220;Verily, Allah will try you by a river. So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me; and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand.&#8221; Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them. So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: &#8220;We have no power this day against Jalut (Goliath) and his hosts.&#8221; But those who knew with certainty that they were going to meet Allah, said: &#8220;How often has a small group overcome a mighty host by Allah&#8217;s leave&#8221; And Allah is with As-Sabirin (the patient).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that Talut, the king of the Children of Israel, marched forth with his soldiers and the Israelites who obeyed him. His army was of eighty thousand then, according to As-Suddi, but Allah knows best. Talut said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah will try you) meaning, He will test you with a river, which flowed between Jordan and Palestine, i.e. , the Shari`ah river, according to Ibn `Abbas and others. He continued,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me;) meaning, shall not accompany me today,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand.) meaning, there is no harm in this case. Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj stated that Ibn `Abbas commented, &#8220;Whoever took some of it (the river&#8217;s water) in the hollow of his hand, quenched his thirst; as for those who drank freely from it, their thirst was not quenched.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jarir reported that Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib said, &#8220;We used to say that the Companions of Muhammad who accompanied him on the battle of Badr were more than three hundred and ten, just as many as the soldiers who crossed the river with Talut. Only those who believed crossed the river with him.&#8221; Al-Bukhari also reported this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: &#8220;We have no power this day against Jalut (Goliath) and his hosts.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah indicates that the Israelites (who remained with Saul) thought that they were few in the face of their enemy who were many then. So, their knowledgeable scholars strengthened their resolve by stating that Allah&#8217;s promise is true and that triumph comes from Allah Alone, not from the large numbers or the adequacy of the supplies. They said to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;How often has a small group overcome a mighty host by Allah&#8217;s leave&#8221; And Allah is with As-Sabirin (the patient).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(250. And when they advanced to meet Jalut (Goliath) and his forces, they invoked: &#8220;Our Lord! Pour forth on us patience, and set firm our feet and make us victorious over the disbelieving people.&#8221;) (251. So they routed them by Allah&#8217;s leave and Dawud (David) killed Jalut (Goliath), and Allah gave him (Dawud) the kingdom ﴿after the death of Talut and Samuel﴾ and Al-Hikmah (prophethood), and taught him of that which He willed. And if Allah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief. But Allah is full of bounty to the `Alamin (mankind, Jinn and all that exists).) (252. These are the verses of Allah, We recite them to you (O Muhammad ) in truth, and surely, you are one of the Messengers (of Allah.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the faithful party, who were few under the command of Talut, faced their enemy, who were many under the command of Jalut,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(they invoked: &#8220;Our Lord! Pour forth on us patience&#8230;&#8221;) meaning, send down patience on us from You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and set firm our feet) meaning, against the enemy and save us from running away and from feebleness,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and make us victorious over the disbelieving people.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So they routed them by Allah&#8217;s leave) meaning, they defeated and overwhelmed them by Allah&#8217;s aid and support. Then,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and Dawud killed Jalut)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Israelite accounts claimed that (Prophet) David killed Goliath with a slingshot that he had, which he launched at Goliath causing his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Talut promised that whoever killed Jalut, would marry his daughter and would share his kingship and authority. He kept his promise. Later, the kingship was transferred to Prophet Dawud in addition to being granted Prophethood by Allah. So, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;and Allah gave him (Dawud) the kingdom) that Talut had and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and Al-Hikmah) that comes with the prophethood, meaning, after Shamwil. ﴿Allah then said:﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and taught him of that which He willed.) meaning, what He willed of the knowledge that He bestowed on (Prophet) Dawud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Next, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if Allah did not check one set of people by means of another, the earth would indeed be full of mischief.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah indicates that if it were not for the fact that Allah checks one set of people with another, such as when Talut and the bravery of Dawud helped the Children of Israel (against Goliath), then people would have perished. Similarly, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For had it not been that Allah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and Masjids, wherein the Name of Allah is mentioned much, would surely, have been pulled down.) (22:40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But Allah is full of bounty to the `Alamin (mankind, Jinn and all that exists)) meaning, by His mercy and favor He fixes some of them by some others. Surely, Allah has the wisdom, the supreme authority and the clear proof against His creation in all of His actions and statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(These are the verses of Allah, We recite them to you (O Muhammad ) in truth, and surely, you are one of the Messengers (of Allah).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah states, `These Ayat (verses) of Allah that We have narrated for you in truth conform to the exact manner that these stories have occurred and to the truth that still remain in the (Divine) Books that the scholars of the Children of Israel have and know. Allah said: O Muhammad,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(you are)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(one of the Messengers (of Allah)) emphatically stating the truth of his prophet hood</p>

Say: &#8220;Bring here the Tawrah and recite it, if you are truthful. &#8221;) (94. Then after that, whosoever shall invent a lie against Allah, then it is these that are the wrongdoers.) (95. Say:&#8221;Allah has spoken the truth; follow the religion of Ibrahim the Hanif (monotheist), and he was not of the Mushrikin (idolators).&#8221;)</span></p>
<p><strong>The Questions that the Jews Asked Our Prophet</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;A group of Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Prophet and said, `Talk to us about some things we will ask you and which only a Prophet would know.&#8217; He said, `Ask me about whatever you wish. However, give your pledge to Allah, similar to the pledge that Ya`qub took from his children, that if I tell you something and you recognize its truth, you will follow me in Islam.&#8217; They said, `Agreed.&#8217; The Prophet said, `Ask me about whatever you wish.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, `Tell us about four matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What kinds of food did Isra&#8217;il prohibit for himself</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. What about the sexual discharge of the woman and the man, and what role does each play in producing male or female offspring</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Tell us about the condition of the unlettered Prophet during sleep,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. And who is his Wali (supporter) among the angels&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet took their covenant that they will follow him if he answers these questions, and they agreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, `I ask you by He Who sent down the Tawrah to Musa, do you not know that Isra&#8217;il once became very ill When his illness was prolonged, he vowed to Allah that if He cures His illness, he would prohibit the best types of drink and food for himself. Was not the best food to him camel meat and the best drink camel milk&#8217; They said, `Yes, by Allah.&#8217; The Messenger said, `O Allah, be Witness against them.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then said, `I ask you by Allah, other than Whom there is no deity (worthy of worship), Who sent down the Tawrah to Musa, do you not know that man&#8217;s discharge is thick and white and woman&#8217;s is yellow and thin If any of these fluids becomes dominant, the offspring will take its sex and resemblance by Allah&#8217;s leave. Hence, if the man&#8217;s is more than the woman&#8217;s, the child will be male, by Allah&#8217;s leave. If the woman&#8217;s discharge is more than the man&#8217;s, then the child will be female, by Allah&#8217;s leave.&#8217; They said, `Yes.&#8217; He said, `O Allah, be Witness against them.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said, `I ask you by He Who sent down the Tawrah to Musa, do you not know that the eyes of this unlettered Prophet sleep, but his heart does not sleep&#8217; They said, `Yes, by Allah!&#8217; He said, `O Allah, be Witness.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said, `Tell us now about your Wali among the angels, for this is when we either follow or shun you.&#8217; He said, `My Wali (who brings down the revelation from Allah) is Jibril, and Allah never sent a Prophet, but Jibril is his Wali.&#8217; They said, `We then shun you. Had you a Wali other than Jibril, we would have followed you.&#8217; On that, Allah, the Exalted revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;Whoever is an enemy to Jibril&#8230;&#8221;) ﴿2:97﴾.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(before the Tawrah was revealed) ﴿3:93﴾, means, Isra&#8217;il forbade that for himself before the Tawrah was revealed. There are two objectives behind revealing this segment of the Ayah. First, he forbade himself the most delightful things for Allah&#8217;s sake. This practice was allowed during his period of Law, and is, thus, suitable that it is mentioned after Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(By no means shall you attain Al-Birr, unless you spend of that which you love) ﴿3: 92﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we are allowed in our Law is to spend in Allah&#8217;s obedience from what we like and covet ﴿but not to prohibit what Allah has allowed﴾. Allah said in other Ayat;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And gives his wealth, in spite of love for it,) ﴿2:177﴾, and;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they give food, in spite of their love for it,) ﴿76:8﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second reason is that after Allah refuted the false Christian beliefs and allegations about `Isa and his mother. Allah started refuting the Jews here, may Allah curse them, by stating that the abrogation of the Law, that they denied occurs, already occurred in their Law. For instance, Allah has stated in their Book, the Tawrah, that when Nuh departed from the ark, Allah allowed him to eat the meat of all types of animals. Afterwards, Isra&#8217;il forbade the meat and milk of camels for himself, and his children imitated this practice after him. The Tawrah later on prohibited this type of food, and added several more types of prohibitions. Allah allowed Adam to marry his daughters to his sons, and this practice was later forbidden. The Law of Ibrahim allowed the man to take female servants as companions along with his wife, as Ibrahim did when he took Hajar, while he was married to Sarah. Later on, the Tawrah prohibited this practice. It was previously allowed to take two sisters as wives at the same time, as Ya`qub married two sisters at the same time. Later on, this practice was prohibited in the Tawrah. All these examples are in the Tawrah and constitute a Naskh (abrogation) of the Law. Therefore, let the Jews consider what Allah legislated for `Isa and if such legislation falls under the category of abrogation or not. Why do they not then follow `Isa in this regard Rather, the Jews defied and rebelled against `Isa and against the correct religion that Allah sent Muhammad with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(All food was lawful to the Children of Israel, except what Isra&#8217;il made unlawful for himself before the Tawrah was revealed) ﴿3:93﴾ meaning, before the Tawrah was revealed, all types of foods were allowed, except what Isra&#8217;il prohibited for himself. Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;Bring here the Tawrah and recite it, if you are truthful.&#8221;),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">for the Tawrah affirms what we are stating here. Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then after that, whosoever shall invent a lie against Allah, then these it is that are the wrongdoers.) ﴿3:94﴾, in reference to those who lie about Allah and claim that He made the Sabbath and the Tawrah eternal. They are those who claim that Allah did not send another Prophet calling to Allah with the proofs and evidences, although evidence indicates that abrogation, as we have described, occurred before in the Tawrah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then these it is that are the wrongdoers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say, &#8220;Allah has spoken the truth;&#8221;) ﴿3:95﴾ meaning, O Muhammad, say that Allah has said the truth in what He conveyed and legislated in the Qur&#8217;an,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(follow the religion of Ibrahim the Hanif, and he was not of the idolators.&#8221;) ﴿3:95﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, follow the religion of Ibrahim that Allah legislated in the Qur&#8217;an. Indeed, this is the truth, there is no doubt in it, and the perfect way, and no Prophet has brought a more complete, clear, plain and perfect way than he did. Allah said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;Truly, my Lord has guided me to a straight path, a right religion, the religion of Ibrahim, the Hanif, and he was not of the idolators.&#8221;) ﴿6:161﴾</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then, We have sent the revelation to you (saying): &#8220;Follow the religion of Ibrahim, the Hanif, and he was not of the idolaters.) ﴿16:123﴾.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews are the Enemies of Jibril</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Al Baqara 2.97). Say (O Muhammad ): &#8220;Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart by Allah&#8217;s permission, confirming what came before it (i.e. the Tawrah and the Injil) and guidance and glad tidings for the believers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(98. &#8220;Whoever is an enemy to Allah, His Angels, His Messengers, Jibril and Mika&#8217;il, then verily, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews are the Enemies of Jibril</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Abu Ja`far bin Jarir At-Tabari said, &#8220;The scholars of Tafsir agree that this Ayah (2: 97-98) was revealed in response to the Jews who claimed that Jibril (Gabriel) is an enemy of the Jews and that Mika&#8217;il (Michael) is their friend.&#8221; Al-Bukhari said, &#8220;Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy of Jibril (let him die in his fury)). `Ikrimah said, &#8220;Jibr, Mik and Israf all mean, worshipper, while il means, Allah&#8221;. Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;When `Abdullah bin Salam heard of the arrival of the Prophet in Al-Madinah, he was working on his land. He came to the Prophet and said, `I am going to ask you about three things which nobody knows except a Prophet. What will be the first portent of the Hour What will be the first meal taken by the people of Paradise Why does a child resemble its father, and why does it resemble its maternal uncle&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger said, (Jibril has just told me the answers.) `Abdullah said, `He (i.e. Jibril), among all the angels, is the enemy of the Jews.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger recited the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart). Allah&#8217;s Messenger then said, (The first portent of the Hour will be a fire that will bring together the people from the east to the west; the first meal of the people of Paradise will be the caudate lobe of the liver of fish. As for the child resembling his parents: If a man has sexual intercourse with his wife and his discharge is first, the child will resemble the father. If the woman has a discharge first, the child will resemble her side of the family.) On that `Abdullah bin Salam said, `I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and you are the Messenger of Allah.&#8217; `Abdullah bin Salam further said, `O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! The Jews are liars, and if they should come to know about my conversion to Islam before you ask them (about me), they will tell a lie about me.&#8217; The Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger , and `Abdullah went inside the house. Allah&#8217;s Messenger asked (the Jews), (`What kind of man is `Abdullah bin Salam&#8217;) They replied, `He is the best among us, the son of the best among us, our master and the son of our master.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger said, (What do you think if he would embrace Islam) The Jews said, `May Allah save him from it.&#8217; Then `Abdullah bin Salam came out in front of them saying, `I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.&#8217; Thereupon they said, `He is the evilest among us, and the son of the evilest among us.&#8217; And they continued talking badly about him. Ibn Salam said, `This is what I feared, O Messenger of Allah!.&#8221;&#8217; Only Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bukhari and Muslim recorded this Hadith from Anas using another chain of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people say that `il&#8217; means worshipper while whatever word that is added to it becomes Allah&#8217;s Name, because `il&#8217; is a constant in such conjunction. This is similar to the names `Abdullah, `Abdur-Rahman, `Abdul-Malik, `Abdul-Quddus, `Abdus-Salam, `Abdul-Kafi, `Abdul-Jalil, and so forth. Hence, `Abd&#8217; is constant in these compound names, while the remainder differs from name to name. This is the same case with Jibril, Mika&#8217;il, `Azra&#8217;il, Israfil, and so forth. Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Choosing Some Angels to believe in over Others is Disbelief like choosing Some Prophets over Others</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart by Allah&#8217;s permission,) meaning, whoever becomes an enemy of Jibril, let him know that he is Ruh Al-Qudus who brought down the Glorious Dhikr (Qur&#8217;an) to your heart from Allah by His leave. Hence, he is a messenger from Allah. Whoever takes a messenger as an enemy, will have taken all the messengers as enemies. Further, whoever believes in one messenger, is required to believe in all of the messengers. Whoever rejects one messenger, he has rejected all of the messengers. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, those who disbelieve in Allah and His Messengers and wish to make distinction between Allah and His Messengers (by believing in Allah and disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, &#8220;We believe in some but reject others.&#8221;) (4:150)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah decreed that they are disbelievers, because they believe in some Prophets and reject others. This is the same with those who take Jibril as an enemy, because Jibril did not choose missions on his own, but by the command of his Lord,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And we (angels) descend not except by the command of your Lord) (19: 64), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And truly, this (the Qur&#8217;an) is a revelation from the Lord of all that exists. Which the trustworthy Ruh (Jibril) has brought down. Upon your heart (O Muhammad ) that you may be (one) of the warners) (26:192-194).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari reported that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah said, `Whoever takes a friend of Mine as an enemy, will have started a war with Me.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah became angry with those who took Jibril as an enemy. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy to Jibril (Gabriel) (let him die in his fury), for indeed he has brought it (this Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart by Allah&#8217;s permission, confirming what came before it) meaning, the previous Books,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and guidance and glad tidings for the believers) meaning, as guidance to their hearts and bringer of the good news of Paradise, which is exclusively for the believers. Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say: &#8220;It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing.&#8221;) (41:44), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And We send down of the Qur&#8217;an that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe) (17:82).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever is an enemy to Allah, His Angels, His Messengers, Jibril and Mika&#8217;il (Michael), then verily, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah stated that whoever takes Him, His angels and messengers as enemies, then&#8230;Allah&#8217;s messengers include angels and men, for Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah chooses Messengers from angels and from men) (22:75). Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Jibril (Gabriel) and Mika&#8217;il (Michael)). Allah mentioned Jibril and Mika&#8217;il specifically &#8211; although they are included among the angels who were messengers &#8211; only because this Ayah was meant to support Jibril the emissary between Allah and His Prophets. Allah also mentioned Mika&#8217;il here, because the Jews claimed that Jibril was their enemy and Mika&#8217;il was their friend. Allah informed them that whoever is an enemy of either of them, then he is also an enemy of the other as well as Allah. We should state here that Mika&#8217;il sometimes descended to some of Allah&#8217;s Prophets, although to a lesser extent than Jibril, because this was primarily Jibril&#8217;s task, and Israfil is entrusted with the job of blowing the Trumpet for the commencement of Resurrection on the Day of Judgment. It is recorded in the Sahih that whenever the Messenger of Allah would wake up at night, he would supplicate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah, Lord of Jibril, Mika&#8217;il and Israfil, Creator of the heavens and earth and Knower of the seen and the unseen! You judge between Your servants regarding what they differ in, so direct me to the truth which they differ on, by Your leave. Verily, You guide whom You will to the straight path.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(then verily, Allah is an enemy to the disbelievers) informed the disbelievers that whoever takes a friend of Allah as an enemy, then he has taken Allah as an enemy, and whoever treats Allah as an enemy, then he shall be Allah&#8217;s enemy. Indeed, whoever is an enemy of Allah then he will lose in this life and the Hereafter, as stated earlier;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Whoever takes a friend of Mine as an enemy, I shall wage war on him.)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer from SuratAl Baqara</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2.80. And they (Jews) say, &#8220;The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days.&#8221; Say (O Muhammad to them): &#8220;Have you taken a covenant from Allah, so that Allah will not break His covenant Or is it that you say of Allah what you know not&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah mentioned the claim of the Jews, that the Fire will only touch them for a few days, and then they will be saved from it. Allah refuted this claim by saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad to them): &#8220;Have you taken a covenant from Allah&#8217;). Hence, the Ayah proclaims, `if you had a promise from Allah for that, then Allah will never break His promise. However, such promise never existed. Rather, what you say, about Allah, you have no knowledge of and you thus utter a lie about Him.&#8217; Al-`Awfi said that Ibn `Abbas said about the Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they (Jews) say, &#8220;The Fire shall not touch us but for a few numbered days.&#8221;). &#8220;The Jews said, `The Fire will only touch us for forty days.&#8221;&#8217; Others added that this was the period during which the Jews worshipped the calf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Al-Hafiz Abu Bakr bin Marduwyah reported Abu Hurayrah saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When Khaybar was conquered, a roasted poisoned sheep was presented to the Prophet as a gift (by the Jews). The Messenger of Allah ordered, `Assemble before me all the Jews who were here.&#8217; The Jews were summoned and the Prophet said (to them), `Who is your father&#8217; They replied, `So-and-so.&#8217; He said, `You have lied; your father is so-and-so.&#8217; They said, `You have uttered the truth.&#8217; He said, `Will you now tell me the truth, if I ask you about something&#8217; They replied, `Yes, O Abul-Qasim; and if we should tell a lie, you will know our lie as you have about our fathers.&#8217; On that he asked, `Who are the people of the (Hell) Fire&#8217; They said, `We shall remain in the (Hell) Fire for a short period, and after that you will replace us in it.&#8217; The Prophet said, `May you be cursed and humiliated in it! By Allah, we shall never replace you in it.&#8217; Then he asked, `Will you tell me the truth if I ask you a question&#8217; They said, `Yes, O Abul-Qasim.&#8217; He asked, `Have you poisoned this sheep&#8217; They said, `Yes.&#8217; He asked, `What made you do so&#8217; They said, `We wanted to know if you were a liar, in which case we would get rid of you, and if you were a Prophet then the poison would not harm you.&#8217;) Imam Ahmad, Al-Bukhari and An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded similarly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer : Al-Ma&#8217;idah surah 5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They change the words from their places:) by altering their meanings and knowingly distorting them after they comprehended them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(they say, &#8220;If you are given this, take it, but if you are not given this, then beware!&#8221;) It was reported that this part of the Ayah was revealed about some Jews who committed murder and who said to each other, &#8220;Let us ask Muhammad to judge between us, and if he decides that we pay the Diyah, accept his judgement. If he decides on capital punishment, do not accept his judgement.&#8221; The correct opinion is that this Ayah was revealed about the two Jews who committed adultery. The Jews changed the law they had in their Book from Allah on the matter of punishment for adultery, from stoning to death, to a hundred flogs and making the offenders ride a donkey facing the back of the donkey. When this incident of adultery occurred after the Hijrah, they said to each other, &#8220;Let us go to Muhammad and seek his judgement. If he gives a ruling of flogging, then implement his decision and make it a proof for you with Allah. This way, one of Allah&#8217;s Prophets will have upheld this ruling amongst you. But if he decides that the punishment should be stoning to death, then do not accept his decision.&#8221; There are several Hadiths mentioning this story. Malik reported that Nafi` said that `Abdullah bin `Umar said, &#8220;The Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Messenger and mentioned that a man and a woman from them committed adultery. Allah&#8217;s Messenger said to them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What do find of the ruling about stoning in the Tawrah) They said, `We only find that they should be exposed and flogged.&#8217; `Abdullah bin Salam said, `You lie. The Tawrah mentions stoning, so bring the Tawrah.&#8217; They brought the Tawrah and opened it but one of them hid the verse about stoning with his hand and recited what is before and after that verse. `Abdullah bin Salam said to him, `Remove your hand,&#8217; and he removed it, thus uncovering the verse about stoning. So they said, He (`Abdullah bin Salam) has said the truth, O Muhammad! It is the verse about stoning.&#8217; The Messenger of Allah decided that the adulterers be stoned to death and his command was carried out. I saw that man shading the woman from the stones with his body.&#8221; Al-Bukhari and Muslim also collected this Hadith and this is the wording collected by Al-Bukhari. In another narration by Al-Bukhari, the Prophet said to the Jews,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What would you do in this case) They said, &#8220;We would humiliate and expose them.&#8221; The Prophet recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring here the Tawrah and recite it, if you are truthful.) So they brought a man who was blind in one eye and who was respected among them and said to him, &#8220;Read (from the Tawrah).&#8221; So he read until he reached a certain verse and then covered it with his hand. He was told, &#8220;Remove your hand,&#8221; and it was the verse about stoning. So that man said, &#8220;O Muhammad! This is the verse about stoning, and we had hid its knowledge among us.&#8221; So the Messenger ordered that the two adulterers be stoned, and they were stoned. Muslim recorded that a Jewish man and a Jewish woman were brought before Allah&#8217;s Messenger because they committed adultery. The Messenger of Allah went to the Jews and asked them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What is the ruling that you find in the Tawrah for adultery) hThey said, &#8220;We expose them, carry them (on donkeys) backwards and parade them in public.&#8221; The Prophet recited;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring here the Tawrah and recite it, if you are truthful.) So they brought the Tawrah and read from it until the reader reached the verse about stoning. Then he placed his hand on that verse and read what was before and after it. `Abdullah bin Salam, who was with the Messenger of Allah , said, &#8220;Order him to remove his hand,&#8221; and he removed his hand and under it was the verse about stoning. So the Messenger of Allah commanded that the adulterers be stoned, and they were stoned. `Abdullah bin `Umar said, &#8220;I was among those who stoned them and I saw the man shading the woman from the stones with his body.&#8221; Abu Dawud recorded that Ibn `Umar said, &#8220;Some Jews came to the Messenger of Allah and invited him to go to the Quff area. So he went to the house of Al-Midras and they said, `O Abu Al-Qasim! A man from us committed adultery with a woman, so decide on their matter.&#8217; They arranged a pillow for the Messenger of Allah and he sat on it and said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring the Tawrah to me.) He was brought the Tawrah and he removed the pillow from under him and placed the Tawrah on it, saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(I trust you and He Who revealed it to you.) He then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring me your most knowledgeable person.) So he was brought a young man&#8230; &#8221; and then he mentioned the rest of the story that Malik narrated from Nafi`. These Hadiths state that the Messenger of Allah issued a decision that conforms with the ruling in the Tawrah, not to honor the Jews in what they believe in, for the Jews were commanded to follow the Law of Muhammad only. Rather, the Prophet did this because Allah commanded him to do so. He asked them about the ruling of stoning in the Tawrah to make them admit to what the Tawrah contains and what they collaborated to hide, deny and exclude from implementing for all that time. They had to admit to what they did, although they did it while having knowledge of the correct ruling. What made them go to the Prophet for judgement in this matter was their lusts and desires, hoping that the Prophet would agree with their opinion, not that they believed in the correctness of his judgment. This is why they said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(If you are given this,) referring to flogging, then take it,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but if you are not given this, then beware!) and do not accept or implement it. Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whomsoever Allah wants to put in Fitnah, you can do nothing for him against Allah. Those are the ones whose hearts Allah does not want to purify; for them there is a disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a great torment. They (like to) listen to falsehood, to devour Suht) `Suht&#8217; refers to bribes, as Ibn Mas`ud and others stated. The Ayah states that if one is like this, how can Allah cleanse his heart and accept his supplication Allah said to His Prophet ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So if they come to you&#8230;) so that you judge between them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(either judge between them, or turn away from them. If you turn away from them, they cannot hurt you in the least.) meaning, there is no harm if you do not judge between them. This is because when they came to you to judge between them, they did not seek to follow the truth, but only what conformed to their lusts. We should mention here that Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, `Ikrimah, Al-Hasan, Qatadah, As-Suddi, Zayd bin Aslam, `Ata&#8217; Al-Khurasani, and several others said that this part of the Ayah was abrogated by Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And so judge among them by what Allah has revealed.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And if you judge, judge with justice between them.) and with fairness, even if the Jews were unjust and outcasts from the path of fairness,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, Allah loves those who act justly.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then refutes the Christians&#8217; and Jews&#8217; false claims and lies,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And the Jews and the Christians say, &#8220;We are the children of Allah and His loved ones.&#8221;) They claim: &#8220;We are the followers of Allah&#8217;s Prophets, who are His children, whom He takes care of. He also loves us.&#8221; The People of the Book claim in their Book that Allah said to His servant Isra&#8217;il, &#8220;You are my firstborn.&#8221; But they explained this statement in an improper manner and altered its meaning. Some of the People of the Book who later became Muslims refuted this false statement saying, &#8220;This statement only indicates honor and respect, as is common in their speech at that time.&#8221; The Christians claim that `Isa said to them, &#8220;I will go back to my father and your father,&#8221; meaning, my Lord and your Lord. It is a fact that the Christians did not claim that they too are Allah&#8217;s sons as they claimed about `Isa. Rather this statement by `Isa only meant to indicate a closeness with Allah. This is why when they said that they are Allah&#8217;s children and loved ones, Allah refuted their claim,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say, &#8220;Why then does He punish you for your sins&#8221;) meaning, if you were truly as you claim, Allah&#8217;s children and loved ones, then why did He prepare the Fire because of your disbelief, lies and false claims</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Nay, you are but human beings, of those He has created,) Allah states: you are just like the rest of the children of Adam, and Allah is the Lord of all His creation,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He forgives whom He wills and punishes whom He wills.) Allah does what He wills, there is none who can escape His judgement, and He is swift in reckoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And to Allah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them;) Therefore, everything is Allah&#8217;s property and under His power and control,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and to Him is the return.) In the end, the return will be to Allah and He will judge between His servants as He will, and He is the Most Just Who is never wrong in His judgment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged)<br />
Ale Imraan Verses 3.65 and 3.67 © Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(65. O people of the Scripture! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim, while the Tawrah and the Injil were not revealed till after him Have you then no sense) (66. Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge It is Allah Who knows, and you know not.) (67. Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa and he was not of the Mushrikin ) (68. Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed. And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah censures the Jews and Christians for their dispute with Muslims over Ibrahim Al-Khalil and the claim each group made that he was one of them. Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar reported that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;The Christians of Najran and Jewish rabbis gathered before the Messenger of Allah and disputed in front of him. The rabbis said, `Ibrahim was certainly Jewish.&#8217; The Christians said, `Certainly, Ibrahim was Christian.&#8217; So Allah sent down,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Why do you dispute about Ibrahim,) meaning, `How is it that you, Jews, claim that Ibrahim was Jew, although he lived before Allah sent down the Tawrah to Musa How is it that you, Christians, claim that Ibrahim was Christian, although Christianity came after his time&#8221; This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you then no sense)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, you are those who have disputed about that of which you have knowledge. Why do you then dispute concerning that of which you have no knowledge)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah criticizes those who argue and dispute without knowledge, just as the Jews and Christians did concerning Ibrahim. Had they disputed about their religions, which they had knowledge of, and about the Law that was legislated for them until Muhammad was sent, it would have been better for them. Rather, they disputed about what they had no knowledge of, so Allah criticized them for this behavior. Allah commanded them to refer what they have no knowledge of to He Who knows the seen and unseen matters and Who knows the true reality of all things. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(It is Allah Who knows, and you know not.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Ibrahim was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Hanifa), shunning Shirk and living in Iman,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and he was not of the Mushrikin.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah is similar to the Ayah in Surat Al-Baqarah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they say, &#8220;Be Jews or Christians, then you will be guided&#8230;&#8221;) 2:135</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said next,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him, and this Prophet and those who have believed. And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah means, &#8220;The people who have the most right to be followers of Ibrahim are those who followed his religion and this Prophet, Muhammad , and his Companions from the Muhajirin, Ansar and those who followed their lead.&#8221; Sa`id bin Mansur recorded that Ibn Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Every Prophet had a Wali (supporter, best friend) from among the Prophets. My Wali among them is my father Ibrahim, the Khalil (intimate friend) of my Lord, the Exalted and Most Honored)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then recited,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, among mankind who have the best claim to Ibrahim are those who followed him&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah is the Wali (Protector and Helper) of the believers.) means, Allah is the Protector of all those who believe in His Messengers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged) &#8211; Al-Nisa surah 4 © Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And because of their (Jews) disbelief and uttering against Maryam a grave false charge.) `Ali bin Abi Talhah said that Ibn `Abbas stated that the Jews accused Maryam of fornication.This is also the saying of As-Suddi, Juwaybir, Muhammad bin Ishaq and several others. This meaning is also apparent in the Ayah, as the Jews accused Maryam and her son of grave accusations: They accused her of fornication and claimed that `Isa was an illegitimate son. Some of them even claimed that she was menstruating while fornicating. May Allah&#8217;s continued curse be upon them until the Day of Resurrection. The Jews also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;We killed Al-Masih, `Isa, son of Maryam, the Messenger of Allah,&#8221;) meaning, we killed the person who claimed to be the Messenger of Allah. The Jews only uttered these words in jest and mockery, just as the polytheists said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you to whom the Dhikr (the Qur&#8217;an) has been sent down! Verily, you are a mad man!) When Allah sent `Isa with proofs and guidance, the Jews, may Allah&#8217;s curses, anger, torment and punishment be upon them, envied him because of his prophethood and obvious miracles; curing the blind and leprous and bringing the dead back to life, by Allah&#8217;s leave. He also used to make the shape of a bird from clay and blow in it, and it became a bird by Allah&#8217;s leave and flew. `Isa performed other miracles that Allah honored him with, yet the Jews defied and bellied him and tried their best to harm him. Allah&#8217;s Prophet `Isa could not live in any one city for long and he had to travel often with his mother, peace be upon them. Even so, the Jews were not satisfied, and they went to the king of Damascus at that time, a Greek polytheist who worshipped the stars. They told him that there was a man in Bayt Al-Maqdis misguiding and dividing the people in Jerusalem and stirring unrest among the king&#8217;s subjects. The king became angry and wrote to his deputy in Jerusalem to arrest the rebel leader, stop him from causing unrest, crucify him and make him wear a crown of thorns. When the king&#8217;s deputy in Jerusalem received these orders, he went with some Jews to the house that `Isa was residing in, and he was then with twelve, thirteen or seventeen of his companions. That day was a Friday, in the evening. They surrounded `Isa in the house, and when he felt that they would soon enter the house or that he would sooner or later have to leave it, he said to his companions, &#8220;Who volunteers to be made to look like me, for which he will be my companion in Paradise&#8221; A young man volunteered, but `Isa thought that he was too young. He asked the question a second and third time, each time the young man volunteering, prompting `Isa to say, &#8220;Well then, you will be that man.&#8221; Allah made the young man look exactly like `Isa, while a hole opened in the roof of the house, and `Isa was made to sleep and ascended to heaven while asleep. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And (remember) when Allah said: &#8220;O `Isa! I will take you and raise you to Myself.&#8221;) When `Isa ascended, those who were in the house came out. When those surrounding the house saw the man who looked like `Isa, they thought that he was `Isa. So they took him at night, crucified him and placed a crown of thorns on his head. The Jews then boasted that they killed `Isa and some Christians accepted their false claim, due to their ignorance and lack of reason. As for those who were in the house with `Isa, they witnessed his ascension to heaven, while the rest thought that the Jews killed `Isa by crucifixion. They even said that Maryam sat under the corpse of the crucified man and cried, and they say that the dead man spoke to her. All this was a test from Allah for His servants out of His wisdom. Allah explained this matter in the Glorious Qur&#8217;an which He sent to His honorable Messenger, whom He supported with miracles and clear, unequivocal evidence. Allah is the Most Truthful, and He is the Lord of the worlds Who knows the secrets, what the hearts conceal, the hidden matters in heaven and earth, what has occurred, what will occur, and what would occur if it was decreed. He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared as that to them,) referring to the person whom the Jews thought was `Isa. This is why Allah said afterwards,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture.) referring to the Jews who claimed to kill `Isa and the ignorant Christians who believed them. Indeed they are all in confusion, misguidance and bewilderment. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(For surely; they killed him not.) meaning they are not sure that `Isa was the one whom they killed. Rather, they are in doubt and confusion over this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(But Allah raised him up unto Himself. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful,) meaning, He is the Almighty, and He is never weak, nor will those who seek refuge in Him ever be subjected to disgrace,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(All-Wise.) in all that He decides and ordains for His creatures. Indeed, Allah&#8217;s is the clearest wisdom, unequivocal proof and the most glorious authority. Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;Just before Allah raised `Isa to the heavens, `Isa went to his companions, who were twelve inside the house. When he arrived, his hair was dripping water and he said, `There are those among you who will disbelieve in me twelve times after he had believed in me.&#8217; He then asked, `Who volunteers that his image appear as mine, and be killed in my place. He will be with me (in Paradise)&#8217; One of the youngest ones among them volunteered and `Isa asked him to sit down. `Isa again asked for a volunteer, and the young man kept volunteering and `Isa asking him to sit down. Then the young man volunteered again and `Isa said, `You will be that man,&#8217; and the resemblance of `Isa was cast over that man while `Isa ascended to heaven from a hole in the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Jews came looking for `Isa, they found that young man and crucified him. Some of `Isa&#8217;s followers disbelieved in him twelve times after they had believed in him. They then divided into three groups. One group, Al-Ya`qubiyyah (Jacobites), said, `Allah remained with us as long as He willed and then ascended to heaven.&#8217; Another group, An-Nasturiyyah (Nestorians), said, `The son of Allah was with us as long as he willed and Allah took him to heaven.&#8217; Another group, Muslims, said, `The servant and Messenger of Allah remained with us as long as Allah willed, and Allah then took him to Him.&#8217; The two disbelieving groups cooperated against the Muslim group and they killed them. Ever since that happened, Islam was then veiled until Allah sent Muhammad .&#8221; This statement has an authentic chain of narration leading to Ibn `Abbas, and An-Nasa&#8217;i narrated it through Abu Kurayb who reported it from Abu Mu`awiyah. Many among the Salaf stated that `Isa asked if someone would volunteer for his appearance to be cast over him, and that he will be killed instead of `Isa, for which he would be his companion in Paradise.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer . </span><span style="line-height:1.5em;">From 58 Surah Al Mujadlah</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Najih reported from Mujahid,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden,) He said, &#8220;The Jews.&#8221; Similar was said by Muqatil bin Hayyan, who added, &#8220;The Prophet had a peace treaty with the Jews. When one of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions would pass by a gathering of Jews, they would speak among themselves in secret, prompting the believer to think that they were plotting to kill or harm him. When the believer saw this, he feared for his safety and changed the route he was taking. The Prophet advised them to abandon their evil secret talks, but they did not listen and kept on holding the Najwa. Allah the Exalted sent down this Ayah in their case,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you not seen those who were forbidden to hold secret counsels, and afterwards returned to that which they had been forbidden).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and conspired together for sin and wrongdoing and disobedience to the Messenger.) means, they used to talk to each other,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(for sin) which involves themselves,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and wrongdoing) which effects others. They speak about disobedience and defying of the Messenger , with persistence and recommending each other to follow their way,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not,) Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that `A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;Some Jews came to the Prophet and greeted him by saying, `As-Sam `Alayka, O Abul-Qasim.&#8217; So I said to them, `wa `Alaykum As-Sam (the same death be upon you).&#8217; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O `A&#8217;ishah, Allah does not like rudeness and foul speech.) I said, `Didn&#8217;t you hear them say, `As-Sam Alayka&#8217; He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Didn&#8217;t you hear me answering them back by saying, `Wa `Alaykum (And the same upon you)&#8217;) Allah the Exalted then sent down this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not,)&#8221; The narration collected in the Sahih states that `A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;And be upon you the death, disgrace and curse.&#8221; The Messenger of Allah said to her,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah accepts our supplication against them, but not theirs against us.) Ibn Jarir recorded that Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;A Jew passed by Allah&#8217;s Messenger , who was sitting with his Companions, he greeted them and they greeted him back. Allah&#8217;s Messenger then said to his Companions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do you know what he just said) They said, `He said: As-Salam, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8217; The Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Rather he said, Sam `Alaykum.) meaning, `may you disgrace your religion.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Messenger then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Bring him back,) and when he was brought back, the Prophet asked him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Did you say: Sam `Alaykum) He said, `Yes.&#8217; The Prophet then said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When the people of the Book greet you, say, `Wa `Alaykum.&#8217;)&#8221; meaning, `and the same on you too.&#8217; The basis for the Hadith of Anas is in the Sahih and similar to this Hadith of `A&#8217;ishah is in the Sahih. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and say within themselves:&#8221;Why should Allah punish us not for what we say&#8221;) means, the Jews say these words, changing the meaning of the Islamic greeting, into an abusive statement, and then say, `Had he been a Prophet, Allah would have punished us for what we said. Allah knows what we conceal. Therefore, if Muhammad were a Prophet, Allah would have sent His punishment on us sooner, in this life.&#8217; Allah the Exalted replied,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Hell will be sufficient for them;) ell should be sufficient for them in the Hereafter,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin `Amr said that the Jews used to say, &#8220;Sam `Alayka,&#8221; to Allah&#8217;s Messenger . They would say then within themselves, &#8220;Why does Allah not punish us for what we say&#8221; This Ayah was later revealed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And when they come to you, they greet you with a greeting wherewith Allah greets you not, and say within themselves: &#8220;Why should Allah punish us not for what we say&#8221; Hell will be sufficient for them; they will enter therein. And worst indeed is that destination!) Its chain of narration is Hasan, but they (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) did not collect it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Manners of the Najwa, (Secret Counsel)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted teaches His believing servants to avoid the ways of the disbelievers and hypocrites,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O you who believe! When you hold secret counsel, do it not for sin and wrongdoing, and disobedience to the Messenger,) meaning, do not hold evil secret counsels like the ignorant disbelieving People of the Scriptures and their allies among the hypocrites, who imitate their ways,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(but do it for Al-Birr and Taqwa; and have Taqwa of Allah unto Whom you shall be gathered.) and He will then inform you of all your deeds and statements; He has counted and recorded them and will justly hold you accountable for them. Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(An-Najwa are only from the Shaytan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers. But he cannot harm them in the least, except as Allah permits. And in Allah let the believers put their trust.) Allah states that secret talks, where the believers feel anxious, are</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(only from Shaytan, in order that he may cause grief to the believers.) meaning, that those who hold such counsels do so because of the lures of the devil,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(in order that he may cause grief to the believers.) The devil seeks to bother the believers, even though his plots will not harm the believers, except if Allah wills it. Those who are the subject of evil Najwa, should seek refuge in Allah and put his trust in Him, for none of it will harm them, Allah willing. The Sunnah also forbids the Najwa so that no Muslim is bothered by it. Imam Ahmad recorded that `Abdullah bin Mas`ud said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(If you were three, then two of you should not hold a secret counsel in the presence of the third person, because that would cause him to be worried.) This Hadith is collected in the Two Sahihs using a chain of narration that contained Al-A`mash. `Abdur-Razzaq narrated that `Abdullah bin `Umar said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(If you were three, then two of you should not hold a secret counsel in the presence of the third person, except with his permission, because that would cause him to be worried.) Muslim collected this Hadith.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He it is Who drove out the disbelievers among the People of the Scripture) referring to the Jewish tribe of Bani An-Nadir, according to Ibn `Abbas, Mujahid, Az-Zuhri and several others. When the Messenger of Allah migrated to Al-Madinah, he made a peace treaty with the Jews stipulating that he would not fight them and they would not fight him. They soon betrayed the treaty that they made with Allah&#8217;s Messenger . Therefore, Allah sent His torment down on them; it can never be averted, and His appointed destiny touched them; it can never be resisted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet forced them to evacuate and abandon their fortified forts that Muslims did not think they would ever control. The Jews thought that their fortifications will save them from Allah&#8217;s torment, but they did not help them against Allah in the least. Then, that which they did not expect came to them from Allah, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger forced them to leave Al-Madinah. Some of them went to Adhri`at in the area of Ash-Sham, which is the area of the grand Gathering and Resurrection, while others went to Khaybar. The Prophet allowed them to evacuate their forts and take whatever their camels could carry. They destroyed the property that they could not carry. This is why Allah the Exalted said, (they demolished their own dwellings with their own hands and the hands of the believers Then take admonition, O you with eyes.) meaning, &#8220;Contemplate the end of those who defied Allah&#8217;s command, contradicted His Messenger and denied His Book. See how Allah&#8217;s humiliating torment struck them in this life, as well as, the painful torment that Allah has reserved for them in the Hereafter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud recorded that `Abdur-Rahman bin Ka`b bin Malik said that one of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions said, &#8220;The Quraysh idolators wrote to `Abdullah bin Ubayy and those who were still worshipping idols among the tribes of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj. The Messenger of Allah was in Al-Madinah at the time, before the battle of Badr occurred. They wrote: `You have given refuge to our citizen. We swear by Allah, you should fight him, or we will expel you or gather all our forces, until we kill your soldiers and take your women captive.&#8217; When the news of this threat reached `Abdullah bin Ubayy and the idolators of Al-Aws and Al-Khazraj, they prepared to fight the Prophet . The news of this reached the Prophet and he went to them saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The threat of the Quraysh has caused you extreme anxiety! The Quraysh cannot cause you more harm than what you will cause yourselves by your actions. Do you want to fight your children and brethren) When they heard these words from the Prophet , they dis- persed and the news of what happened reached the Quraysh idolators. After the battle of Badr, the Quraysh idolators wrote to the Jews of Al-Madinah, `You have armor and forts! You should fight our citizen or we will do such and such to you, and nothing will prevent us from acquiring your women.&#8217;The news of this letter also reached the Prophet and Bani An-Nadir intended to betray their treaty. Bani An-Nadir sent a message to the Prophet asking him to come with thirty of his Companions to meet thirty of their rabbis half way, from either side. They said that the rabbis would listen to the Prophet and if they believe in him, the rest of Bani An-Nadir would believe. They intended to kill the Messenger , and Allah informed His Messenger of this plot before they could harm him. The next day, the Prophet gathered his forces and laid siege to their area, saying to them,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(By Allah ! You will not be safe until and unless you renew your peace treaty with me.) They refused to do so, and the Prophet fought them the rest of that day. The next morning, the Prophet laid siege to the tribe of Bani Qurayzah and left Bani An-Nadir alone that day. The Prophet ordered Bani Qurayzah to sign a new treaty of peace, and they accepted. The Prophet left Bani Qurayzah and went back to Bani An-Nadir with his forces and fought them until they agreed to surrender in return for safe passage out of Al-Madinah. Bani An-Nadir evacuated Al-Madinah and took with them all whatever their camels could carry from their furniture, including even the wood and the doors to their houses. The date trees of Bani An-Nadir were granted to the Messenger by Allah when He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And what Allah gave as booty to His Messenger from them &#8212; for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry) that is, what you earned without a fight. The Prophet divided most of their trees between the emigrants and gave to only two men who were poor from Al-Ansar. He did not give the Ansar any of it, except for these two men. The Prophet kept a part of the war booty for himself and that part of charity of the Prophet was transferred to the administration of his daughter&#8217;s children, i.e., children of Fatimah.&#8221; However, let us summarize the battle of Bani An-Nadir here. From Allah alone we seek help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Reason behind the Battle of Bani An-Nadir</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the seventy Companions whom the Prophet sent to teach the Qur&#8217;an were killed at the area of Bi&#8217;r Ma`unah, excluding `Amr bin Umayyah Ad-Damri, who killed two men from the tribe of Bani `Amir on his way back to Al-Madinah. He did not know that these two men had a promise of safe passage from Allah&#8217;s Messenger . When he went back to Al-Madinah, he told the Prophet what happened and the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You have killed two men, I shall pay the blood money for them.) Bani An-Nadir and Bani `Amir were allies and had treaties. The Prophet asked Bani An-Nadir to help pay the blood money for the two dead men. The area of Bani An-Nadir was in a suburb of Al-Madinah, a few miles to the east. In his book of Sirah, Muhammad bin Ishaq bin Yasar said; &#8220;Then the Messenger of Allah went to Bani An-Nadir to ask them for financial help to pay the blood money of the two men from Bani `Amir, who were killed by `Amr bin Umayyah Ad-Damri. They had a promise of safe passage from the Prophet according to the (subnarrator) Yazid bin Ruman. Bani An-Nadir and Bani `Amir had a treaty and were allies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Messenger went to Bani An-Nadir asking them for help to pay the blood money for the two men, they said, `Yes, O Abu Al-Qasim! We will help you, since you asked us for help.&#8217; Yet, when they met each other in secret, they said, `You will not find a better chance with this man than this,&#8217; while the Messenger of Allah was sitting next to a wall of one of their houses. They said, `Who will ascend this wall and drop a stone on this man and rid us of his trouble&#8217; `Amr bin Jihash bin Ka`b volunteered and ascended the wall of the house to drop a stone on the Messenger .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah was sitting with several of his Companions, such as Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Ali. The news of this plot was conveyed to the Prophet from heaven, and he stood up and went back to Al-Madinah. When the Companions thought that the Messenger was absent for a long time, they went to see where he was and saw a man coming from Al-Madinah. They asked him, and he said that he saw the Prophet enter Al-Madinah. The Messenger&#8217;s Companions went to him, and he told them the news of the betraying plot that the Jews planned against him. He ordered them to prepare for war and to march forth to Bani An-Nadir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet gathered his forces and marched to the area of Bani An-Nadir, who had taken refuge in their fortified forts. The Messenger ordered their date trees be cut down and burned. The Jews heralded at the Prophet, `O Muhammad! You used to forbid mischief in the earth and blame those who did it. Why is it that you had the date trees cut down and burned&#8217; Meanwhile, `Abdullah bin Ubayy bin Salul, Wadi`ah, Malik bin Abi Qawqal, Suwayd, Da`is and several other men who all belonged to the tribe of Al-Khazraj bin Bani `Awf, sent a message to Bani An-Nadir saying, `Be firm and strong. We will never abandon you. If you are fought against, we will fight along with you and if you are forced to leave Al-Madinah, we will accompany you.&#8217; The Jews waited for this claim of support, but the hypocrites did not deliver. Allah cast terror in the hearts of the Jews. They asked the Messenger to allow them safe passage out of Al-Madinah and to spare their lives. In return, they would only take what their camels could carry, except for weapons. The Prophet agreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews collected all the wealth their camels could transport. One of the Jews would demolish his own house around its door, so that he could carry the door on the back of his camel. Bani An-Nadir moved to Khaybar, and some of them went to Ash-Sham. They left all that remained behind for the Messenger of Allah , who had control over how it was to be divided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet divided it between the emigrants and none of Al-Ansar got a share, except for Sahl bin Hunayf and Abu Dujanah Simak bin Kharashah. They said that they were poor and the Messenger of Allah gave them their share. Only two men from Bani An-Nadir embraced Islam, Yamin bin Umayr bin Ka`b bin `Amr bin Jihash and Abu Sa`d bin Wahb and they saved their wealth due to their acceptance of Islam.&#8221; Ibn Ishaq continued, &#8220;Some of the offspring of Yamin narrated to me that the Messenger of Allah said to Yamin,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Have you not heard what your cousin plotted to do against me) Yamin bin `Umayr promised someone a reward if he killed his cousin `Amr bin Jihash, and someone killed him, according to their claim&#8221; Ibn Ishaq then said, &#8220;All of Surat Al-Hashr was revealed about Bani An-Nadir. &#8221; A similar story was recorded by Yunus bin Bukayr from Ibn Ishaq. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(He it is Who drove out the disbelievers among the People of the Scripture) refers to Bani An-Nadir,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(from their homes at the first gathering.) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(You did not think that they would get out.) i.e., within the few days you laid siege against them. The Companions had surrounded their forts for only six days, and their forts were fortified and formidable. This is why Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And they thought that their fortresses would defend them from Allah! But Allah reached them from a place where they expected it not.) meaning, there came to them from Allah what they did not expect or anticipate. Allah said in another Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Those before them indeed plotted, but Allah struck at the foundation of their building, and then the roof fell down upon them, from above them, and the torment overtook them from directions they did not perceive.)(16:26) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and He cast terror into their hearts) means, Allah cast fear, terror and fright in their hearts, and why would that not happen to them He who was given victory, by Allah frightening his enemies the distance of a month, laid siege to them. May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be on the Prophet. As in Ibn Ishaq&#8217;s explanation &#8212; which preceded;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(that they demolished their own dwellings with their own hands and the hands of the believers.) the Jews brought down what they wanted to transport from their roofs and doors, so that they could carry them on camels. Similar was said by `Urwah bin Az-Zubayr, `Abdur-Rahman bin Zayd bin Aslam and several others. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And had it not been that Allah had decreed exile for them, He would certainly have punished them in this world;) meaning, if it was not for the fact that Allah had already decreed that they would evacuate Al-Madinah, leaving behind their homes and wealth, He would have sent another type of punishment upon them, such as being killed and captured. This was said by Az-Zuhri. `Urwah, As-Suddi and Ibn Zayd said that Allah decreed that the Jews would be punished in the life of this world and face the torment of the fire of Hell He prepared for them in the Hereafter. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and in the Hereafter theirs shall be the torment of the Fire.) meaning, it is a matter ordained that they will surely face,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(That is because they opposed Allah and His Messenger.) means, Allah prepared this specific punishment and sent His Messenger and his Companions against them, because they defied Allah and His Messenger and denied the good news that Allah sent forth in the Books of previous Messengers regarding the coming of Muhammad . The Jews knew these facts about Muhammad just as they knew their own children. Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And whosoever opposes Allah, then verily, Allah is Severe in punishment.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet Cut down the Date Trees of the Jews by the Leave of Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.) Linah is an especially good type of date tree. Abu `Ubaydah said that Linah is a different kind of dates than `Ajwah and Barni. Several others said that Linah refers to every type of date fruits, except for the `Ajwah (ripen dates), while Ibn Jarir said that it refers to all kinds of date trees. Ibn Jarir quoted Mujahid saying that it also includes the Buwayrah type. When the Messenger of Allah laid siege to Bani An-Nadir, to humiliate them and bring fear and terror to their hearts, he ordered their date trees to be cut down. Muhammad bin Ishaq narrated that Yazid bin Ruman, Qatadah and Muqatil bin Hayyan said, &#8220;Bani An-Nadir sent a message to the Messenger , saying that he used to outlaw mischief in the earth, so why did he order that their trees be cut down Allah sent down this honorable Ayah stating that whatever Linah was felled or left intact by the Muslims, has been done by His permission, will, leave and pleasure to humiliate and disgrace the enemy and degrade them.&#8221; Mujahid said, &#8220;Some of the emigrants discouraged others from chopping down the date trees of Jews, saying that they were war spoils for Muslims. The Qur&#8217;an approved of the actions of those who discouraged and those who approved of cutting these trees, stating that those who cut them or did not, did so only by Allah&#8217;s leave.&#8221; There is also a Hadith narrated from the Prophet with this meaning. An-Nasa&#8217;i recorded that Ibn `Abbas said about Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.) &#8220;They forced them to come down from their forts and were ordered to cut their trees cut down. So the Muslims hesitated, and some of them said, `We cut down some and left some. We must ask Allah&#8217;s Messenger if we will earn a reward for what we cut and if we will be burdened for what we left intact.&#8217; Allah sent down this Ayah, t</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah).&#8221; Imam Ahmad recorded that Ibn `Umar said that the Messenger of Allah ordered that the date trees of Bani An-Nadir be cut down and burned. The Two Sahihs collected a similar narration. Al-Bukhari recorded that `Abdullah bin `Umar said,&#8221;Bani An-Nadir and Bani Qurayzah fought (against the Prophet ), and the Prophet exiled Bani An-Nadir and allowed Bani Qurayzah to remain in their area until later, when the Prophet fought against Qurayzah. Their men were executed and their women, children and wealth were confiscated and divided among Muslims. Some of them, however, were saved because they returned to the Prophet&#8217;s side, who granted them asylum, and they embraced Islam. All of the Jews of Al-Madinah, Bani Qaynuqa`, the tribe of `Abdullah bin Salam, Bani Harithah and the rest of the Jewish tribes in Al-Madinah were exiled.&#8221; The Two Sahihs also recorded from Ibn `Umar that the Messenger of Allah burned down the date trees of Bani An-Nadir and had them cut down the date palms of Al-Buwayrah. Allah the Exalted and Most Honored revealed this Ayah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What you cut down of the Linah, or you left them standing on their stems, it was by leave of Allah, and in order that He might disgrace the rebellious.)&#8221; Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that the battle of Bani An-Nadir occurred after the battles of Uhud and Bi&#8217;r Ma`unah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Tafseer Ibn Katheer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Al-Bukhari reported that Al-Bara&#8217; bin `Azib narrated: &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Messenger offered his prayers facing Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months, but he wished that he could pray facing the Ka`bah (at Makkah). The first prayer which he offered (facing the Ka`bah) was the `Asr (Afternoon) prayer in the company of some people. Then one of those who had offered that prayer with him, went out and passed by some people in a mosque who were in the bowing position (in Ruku`) during their prayers (facing Jerusalem). He addressed them saying, `By Allah, I bear witness that I have offered prayer with the Prophet facing Makkah (Ka`bah).&#8217; Hearing that, those people immediately changed their direction towards the House (Ka`bah) while still as they were (i.e., in the same bowing position). Some Muslims who offered prayer towards the previous Qiblah (Jerusalem) before it was changed towards the House (the Ka`bah in Makkah) had died or had been martyred, and we did not know what to say about them (regarding their prayers towards Jerusalem). Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost (i.e., the prayers of those Muslims were valid)) (2:143).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari collected this narration, while Muslim collected it using another chain of narrators. Muhammad bin Ishaq reported that Al-Bara&#8217; narrated: Allah&#8217;s Messenger used to offer prayers towards Bayt Al-Maqdis (in Jerusalem), but would keep looking at the sky awaiting Allah&#8217;s command (to change the Qiblah). Then Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you, so turn your face in the direction of Al-Masjid Al-Haram (at Makkah).) (2:144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man from among the Muslims then said, &#8220;We wish we could know about those among us who died before the Qiblah was changed (i.e., towards Makkah) and also about our own prayers, that we had performed towards Bayt Al-Maqdis.&#8221; Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah would never make your faith (prayers) to be lost.) (2:143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fools among the people, meaning the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), said, &#8220;What made them change the former Qiblah that they used to face&#8221; Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The fools (idolators, hypocrites, and Jews) among the people will say&#8230;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until the end of the Ayah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abu Talhah related that Ibn `Abbas said: When Allah&#8217;s Messenger migrated to Al-Madinah, Allah commanded him to face Bayt Al-Maqdis (Jerusalem). The Jews were delighted then. Allah&#8217;s Messenger faced Jerusalem for over ten months. However, he liked (to offer prayer in the direction of) Prophet Ibrahim&#8217;s Qiblah (the Ka`bah in Makkah) and used to supplicate to Allah and kept looking up to the sky (awaiting Allah&#8217;s command in this regard). Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction.) meaning, its direction. The Jews did not like this change and said, &#8220;What made them change the Qiblah that they used to face (meaning Jerusalem)&#8221; Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad ): &#8220;To Allah belong both, east and the west. He guides whom He wills to the straight way.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several other Ahadith on this subject. In summary, Allah&#8217;s Messenger was commanded to face Bayt Al-Maqdis (during the prayer) and he used to offer prayer towards it in Makkah between the two corners (of Ka`bah), so that the Ka`bah would be between him and Bayt Al-Maqdis8. When the Prophet migrated to Al-Madinah, this practice was no longer possible; then Allah commanded him to offer prayer towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, as Ibn Abbas and the majority of the scholars have stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari reported in his Sahih that the news (of the change of Qiblah) was conveyed to some of the Ansar while they were performing the `Asr (Afternoon) prayer towards Bayt Al-Maqdis, upon hearing that, they immediately changed their direction and faced the Ka`bah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Sahihayn (Al-Bukhari Muslim) that Ibn `Umar narrated: While the people were in Quba&#8217; (Mosque) performing the Fajr (Dawn) prayer, a man came and said, &#8220;A (part of the) Qur&#8217;an was revealed tonight to Allah&#8217;s Messenger and he was commanded to face the Ka`bah. Therefore, face the Ka`bah. They were facing Ash-Sham, so they turned towards the Ka`bah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Hadiths prove that the Nasikh (a Text that abrogates a previous Text) only applies after one acquires knowledge of it, even if the Nasikh had already been revealed and announced. This is why the Companions mentioned above were not commanded to repeat the previous `Asr, Maghrib and `Isha&#8217; prayers (although they had prayed them towards Jerusalem after Allah had changed the Qiblah). Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the change of Qiblah (to Ka`bah in Makkah) occurred, those inflicted with hypocrisy and mistrust, and the disbelieving Jews, both were led astray from the right guidance and fell into confusion. They said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(What has turned them (Muslims) from their Qiblah to which they used to face in prayer.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They asked, &#8220;What is the matter with these people (Muslims) who one time face this direction (Jerusalem), and then face that direction (Makkah)&#8221; Allah answered their questions when He stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad ): &#8220;To Allah belong both, east and the west.) meaning, the command, the decision and the authority are for Allah Alone. Hence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allah (and He is High above, over His Throne).) (2:115),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness) that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Al-Birr is the one who believes in Allah.) (2:177) This statement means, the best act is to adhere to Allah&#8217;s commands. Hence, wherever He commands us to face, we should face. Also, since obedience requires implementing Allah&#8217;s commands, if He commands us every day to face different places, we are His servants and under His disposal, and we face whatever He orders us to face. Certainly, Allah&#8217;s care and kindness towards His servant and Messenger, Muhammad , and certainly, his Ummah (Muslim nation) is profoundly great. Allah has guided them to the Qiblah of (Prophet) Ibrahim &#8212; Allah&#8217;s Khalil (intimate friend). He has commanded them to face the Ka`bah, the most honorable house (of worship) on the face of the earth, which was built by Ibrahim Al-Khalil in the Name of Allah, the One without a partner. This is why Allah said afterwards:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Say (O Muhammad ): &#8220;To Allah belong both, east and the west. He guides whom He wills to the straight way.&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad reported that `A&#8217;ishah (the Prophet&#8217;s wife) said that Allah&#8217;s Messenger said about the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(They do not envy us for a matter more than they envy us for Jumu`ah (Friday) to which Allah has guided us and from which they were led astray; for the (true) Qiblah to which Allah has directed us and from which they were led astray; and for our saying `Amin&#8217; behind the Imam (leader of the prayer).)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews had Knowledge that the (Muslim) Qiblah would later be changed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah stated that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Certainly, the people who were given the Scripture (i.e., Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka`bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah means: The Jews, who did not like that you change your Qiblah from Bayt Al-Maqdis, already knew that Allah will command you (O Muhammad) to face the Ka`bah. The Jews read in their Books their Prophets&#8217; description of Allah&#8217;s Messenger and his Ummah, and that Allah has endowed and honored him with the complete and honorable legislation. Yet, the People of the Book deny these facts because of their envy, disbelief and rebellion. This is why Allah threatened them when He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And Allah is not unaware of what they do.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(145. And even if you were to bring to the People of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) all the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), they would not follow your Qiblah (prayer direction), nor are you going to follow their Qiblah. And they will not follow each other&#8217;s Qiblah. Verily, if you follow their desires after that which you have received of knowledge (from Allah), then indeed you will be one of the wrongdoers.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why was changing the Qiblah mentioned thrice</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a third command from Allah to face Al-Masjid Al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque) from every part of the world (during prayer). It was said that Allah mentioned this ruling again here because it is connected to whatever is before and whatever is after it. Hence, Allah first said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s) face towards the heaven. Surely, We shall turn you to a Qiblah (prayer direction) that shall please you) (2:144), until:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Certainly, the people who were given the Scripture (i.e., Jews and the Christians) know well that, that (your turning towards the direction of the Ka`bah at Makkah in prayers) is the truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do.) (2:144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah mentioned in these Ayat His fulfillment of the Prophet&#8217;s wish and ordered him to face the Qiblah that he liked and is pleased with. In the second command, Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And from wheresoever you start forth (for prayers), turn your face in the direction of Al-Masid Al-Haram that is indeed the truth from your Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what you do.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah states here that changing the Qiblah is also the truth from Him, thus upgrading the subject more than in the first Ayah, in which Allah agreed to what His Prophet had wished for. Thus Allah states that this is also the truth from Him that He likes and is pleased with. In the third command, Allah refutes the Jewish assertion that the Prophet faced their Qiblah, as they knew in their Books that the Prophet will later on be commanded to face the Qiblah of Ibrahim, the Ka`bah. The Arab disbelievers had no more argument concerning the Prophet&#8217;s Qiblah after Allah commanded the Prophet to face the Qiblah of Ibrahim, which is more respected and honored, rather than the Qiblah of the Jews. The Arabs used to honor the Ka`bah and liked the fact that the Messenger was commanded to face it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The First Abrogation in the Qur&#8217;an was about the Qiblah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali bin Abu Talhah related that Ibn `Abbas narrated: The first abrogated part in the Qur&#8217;an was about the Qiblah. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger migrated to Al-Madinah, the majority of its people were Jews, and Allah commanded him to face Bayt Al-Maqdis. The Jews were delighted then. Allah&#8217;s Messenger faced it for ten and some months, but he liked to face the Qiblah of Ibrahim (Ka`bah in Makkah). He used to supplicate to Allah and look up to the sky (awaiting Allah&#8217;s command). Allah then revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Verily, We have seen the turning of your (Muhammad&#8217;s) face towards the heaven), until,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(turn your faces (in prayer) in that direction.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews did not like this ruling and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8220;What has turned them (Muslims) from their Qiblah (prayer direction) to which they used to face in prayer.&#8221; Say (O Muhammad), &#8220;To Allah belong both, east and the west.&#8221;) (2:142)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(. ..so wherever you turn (yourselves or your faces) there is the Face of Allah) (2:115),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And We made the Qiblah (prayer direction towards Jerusalem) which you used to face, only to test those who followed the Messenger (Muhammad ) from those who would turn on their heels (i.e., disobey the Messenger).) (2:143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Wisdom behind abrogating the Previous Qiblah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;so that men may have no argument against you)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the People of the Book knew from the description of the Muslim Ummah that they would be ordered to face the Ka`bah. If the Muslims did not fit this description, the Jews would have used this fact against the Muslims. If the Muslims had remained on the Qiblah of Bayt Al-Maqdis, which was also the Qiblah of the Jews, this fact could have been used as the basis of argument by the Jews against other people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;except those of them that are wrongdoers,) indicates the Mushrikin (polytheists) of Quraysh. The reasoning of these unjust persons was the unsound statement: &#8220;This man (Muhammad) claims that he follows the religion of Ibrahim! Hence, if his facing Bayt Al-Maqdis was a part of the religion of Ibrahim, why did he change it&#8221; The answer to this question is that Allah has chosen His Prophet to face Bayt Al-Maqdis first for certain wisdom, and he obeyed Allah regarding this command. Then, Allah changed the Qiblah to the Qiblah of Ibrahim, which is the Ka`bah, and he also obeyed Allah in this command. He, obeys Allah in all cases and never engages in the defiance of Allah even for an instant, and his Ummah imitates him in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(. ..so fear them not, but fear Me!) meaning: `Do not fear the doubts that the unjust, stubborn persons raise and fear Me Alone.&#8217; Indeed, Allah Alone deserves to be feared.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;so that I may complete My blessings on you.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Ayah relates to Allah&#8217;s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;so that men may have no argument against you), meaning: I will perfect My bounty on you by legislating for you to face the Ka`bah, so that the (Islamic) Shari`ah (law) is complete in every respect. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(&#8230;that you may be guided.), meaning: `To be directed and guided to what the nations have been led astray from, We have guided you to it and preferred you with it.&#8217; This is why this Ummah is the best and most honored nation ever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Tafsir Ibn Kathir (Abridged) &#8211; Al Baqarah surah 2 © Darussalam 2000</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Prescription of the Sabbath for the Jews</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that for every nation, Allah prescribed one day of the week for people to gather to worship Him. For this Ummah He prescribed Friday, because it is the sixth day, on which Allah completed and perfected His creation. On this day He gathered and completed His blessings for His servants. It was said that Allah prescribed this day for the Children of Israel through His Prophet Musa, but they changed it and chose Saturday because it was the day on which the Creator did not create anything, as He had completed His creation on Friday. Allah made observance of the Sabbath obligatory for them in the laws of the Tawrah (Torah), telling them to keep the Sabbath. At the same time, He told them to follow Muhammad when he was sent, and took their promises and covenant to that effect. Hence Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Sabbath was only prescribed for those who differed concerning it,) Mujahid said: &#8220;They observed the Sabbath (Saturday) and ignored Friday.&#8221; Then they continued to observe Saturday until Allah sent `Isa bin Maryam. It was said that he told them to change it to Sunday, and it was also said that he did not forsake the laws of the Tawrah except for a few rulings which were abrogated, and he continued to observe the Sabbath until he was taken up (into heaven). Afterwards, the Christians at the time of Constantine were the ones who changed it to Sunday in order to be different from the Jews, and they started to pray towards the east instead of facing the Dome (i.e., Jerusalem). And Allah knows best. It was reported in the Two Sahihs that Abu Hurayrah heard the Messenger of Allah say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(We are the last, but we will be the first on the Day of Resurrection, even though they were given the Book before us. This is the day that Allah obligated upon them, but they differed concerning it. Allah guided us to this day, and the people observe their days after us, the Jews on the following day and the Christians on the day after that.) This version was recorded by Al-Bukhari. It was reported that Abu Hurayrah and Hudhayfah said that the Messenger of Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah let the people who came before us stray from Friday, so the Jews had Saturday and the Christians had Sunday. Then Allah brought us and guided us to Friday. So now there are Friday, Saturday and Sunday, thus they will follow us on the Day of Resurrection. We are the last of the people of this world, but will be the first on the Day of Resurrection, and will be the first to be judged, before all of creation.) It was reported by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Jews breach the Sanctity of the Sabbath</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2.65. And indeed you knew those amongst you who transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday). We said to them: &#8220;Be you monkeys, despised and rejected.&#8221;) (66. So We made this punishment an example for those in front of it and those behind it, and a lesson for Al-Muttaqin (the pious.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed you knew). This Ayah means, O Jews! Remember that Allah sent His torment on the village that disobeyed Him and broke their pledge and their covenant to observe the sanctity of the Sabbath. They began using deceitful means to avoid honoring the Sabbath by placing nets, ropes and artificial pools of water for the purpose of fishing before the Sabbath. When the fish came in abundance on Saturday as usual, they were caught in the ropes and nets for the rest of Saturday. During the night, the Jews collected the fish after the Sabbath ended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they did that, Allah changed them from humans into monkeys, the animals having the form closest to humans. Their evil deeds and deceit appeared lawful on the surface, but they were in reality wicked. This is why their punishment was compatible with their crime. This story is explained in detail in Surat Al-A`raf, where Allah said (7:163),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And ask them (O Muhammad ) about the town that was by the sea; when they transgressed in the matter of the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday): when their fish came to them openly on the Sabbath day, and did not come to them on the day they had no Sabbath. Thus We made a trial of them, for they used to rebel (disobey Allah).)(7:163)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his Tafsir, Al-`Awfi reported from Ibn `Abbas that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(We said to them: &#8220;Be you monkeys, despised and rejected&#8221;) means, &#8220;Allah changed their bodies into those of monkeys and swines. The young people turned into monkeys while the old people turned into swine.&#8221; Shayban An-Nahwi reported that Qatadah commented on,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(We said to them: &#8220;Be you monkeys, despised and rejected&#8221;), &#8220;These people were turned into howling monkeys with tails, after being men and women.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Monkeys and Swine that exist now are not the Descendants of Those that were transformed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abi Hatim recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;Those who violated the sanctity of the Sabbath were turned into monkeys, then they perished without offspring.&#8221; Ad-Dahhak said that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;Allah turned them into monkeys because of their sins. They only lived on the earth for three days, for no transformed person ever lives more than three days. They did not eat, drink or have offspring. Allah transformed their shapes into monkeys, and He does what He wills, with whom He wills and He changes the shape of whomever He wills. On the other hand, Allah created the monkeys, swines and the rest of the creation in the six days (of creation) that He mentioned in His Book.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So We made this punishment an example) means, Allah made the people of this village, who violated the sanctity of the Sabbath,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(an example) via the way they were punished. Similarly, Allah said about Pharaoh,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(So Allah, seized him with punishing example for his last and first transgression) (79:25). nAllah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(for those in front of it and those behind it) meaning, for the other villages. Ibn `Abbas commented, &#8220;Meaning, `We made this village an example for the villages around it by the manner in which We punished its people.&#8221;&#8217; Similarly, Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(And indeed We have destroyed towns (populations) round about you, and We have (repeatedly) shown (them) the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in various ways that they might return (to the truth and believe in the Oneness of Allah ـ Islamic Monotheism)).(46:27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah made them an example for those who lived during their time as well as a reminder for those to come, by preserving their story. This is why Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and a lesson for Al-Muttaqin (the pious)), meaning, a reminder. This Ayah means, &#8220;The torment and punishment that this village suffered was a result of indulging in Allah&#8217;s prohibitions and their deceit. Hence, those who have Taqwa should be aware of their evil behavior, so that what occurred to this village does not befall them as well.&#8221; Also, Imam Abu `Abdullah bin Battah reported that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Do not commit what the Jews committed, breaching what Allah has forbidden, by resorting to the lowest types of deceit.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith has a good (Jayid) chain of narration. Allah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:Are there any authentic Hadeeths that mention the virtues of Zamzam water?<strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are Hadeeths which indicate that Zamzam water is noble and blessed. In a Hadeeth confirmed in the Sahih, the Prophet (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) said about Zamzam water:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed it is blessed, and that like food, it fills.&#8221; (Muslim no. 2473)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Abu Dawud&#8217;s narration, there is this addition:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And a cure for illness.&#8221; (Abu Dawud At-Tiyalsi 2nd Volume no. 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this Hadeeth proves its virtues, that it is a <strong>filling food, a cure for illness, and that it is blessed.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah is to drink it as the Prophet (sallAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam) drank it, but it is also <em><strong>permissible to make ablution with it, to use it to purify yourself after you have relieved yourself, and if necessary, to take a shower using it when you are Junub (impure).</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed that on one occasion, water poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers, and then people took what they needed from that water, using it to drink, to make ablution, to wash their clothes, or to purify themselves after relieving themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zamzam water may not be the same as the water that poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers, but it is also not more blessed, for each has its place as pure water. If it is permissible to use the water that miraculously poured forth from between the Prophet&#8217;s fingers for all the purposes mentioned above, then it is also permissible in the case of Zamzam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa by Shaykh Ibn Baz Fatawa Islamiyah , Darussalam, Vol 4, Page 127</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q. Is it better for the Muhrim to cover the two shoulders or to uncover one of them during the Ihram?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. The sunnah for the Muhrim is that he places the Rida&#8217; (upper garment) over both of his shoulders and put its ends on his chest. This is the Sunnah and it is what the Prophet (Sallalahu Alahi wa Sallam) did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if the person wants to perform the Tawaf of Arrival (Tawaful-Qudum) , he does Al-Idhtiba&#8217;. This is by him placing the center of his Rida&#8217; under his right armpit and its edges over his left shoulder. Thus he uncovers his right shoulder. This is specifically for the Tawaf of Arrival, meaning when the person first arrives in Makkah for Hajj or &#8216;Umrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when he completes the Tawaf, he adjusts the Rida&#8217; and places it over both of his shoulders, and he prays two Rak&#8217;ahs of Tawaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who always keeps one shoulder uncovered, this is opposed to the Sunnah, and so is uncovering both of the shoulders. The Sunnah is only to cover both of them with the Rida&#8217; while the person is in Ihram. If the person takes off the Rida&#8217; and does not cover his shoulders while he is sitting or eating or talking with his brothers, there is no harm in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the Sunnah is that when the person wears the Rida&#8217;, it should be over his two shoulders and its ends should be on his chest.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">You should know &#8211; may Allah have mercy upon you &#8211; that when the slave [of Allah] leaves his house to go to the mosque, that he is going to face Allah, the Irresistible, the One, the Omnipotent, the Exalted in Might, the Oft-forgiving, in the knowledge that nothing is hidden from Allah, wherever it might be, and that nothing is hidden from Allah and that even something as small as a mustard seed is not concealed from Him, nor even something smaller, nor larger &#8211; in the seven earths or the seven heavens, in the seven seas or the lofty mountains, fixed and firm. And  verily, the mosque to which he comes is one of the Houses of Allah. He desires only Allah and he sets out to one of Allah&#8217;s Houses, which:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">In houses (mosques), which Allah has ordered to be raised (to be cleaned, and to be honored), in them His Name is glorified in the mornings and in the afternoons or the evenings, Men whom neither trade nor sale diverts them from the Remembrance of Allah (with heart and tongue), nor from performing As-Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), nor from giving the Zakat. They fear a Day when hearts and eyes will be overturned (from the horror of the torment of the Day of Resurrection).</span></strong> [Qur&#8217;an 24:36-37, Muhsin Khan Translation]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when anyone from amongst you sets out from his house (for the mosque) he should say quietly to himself words of remembrance [of Allah] &#8211; words unconnected with the affairs and business of this world. He should set out calmly, somberly, for this is what the Prophet, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam, ordered us to do; he should set out with (his heart full of) longing and desire [for Allah&#8217;s pleasure] and fear and apprehension [of Allah&#8217;s anger] and with humility and meekness towards Allah. For the more humble, the more meek, the more submissive he is to Allah, the more virtuous and righteous does he become in Salah and the greater becomes his reward, and the more noble and nearer to Allah becomes the worshipper. <span style="line-height:1.5;">But should he be filled with pride, Allah will destroy him and will reject his deeds, for the deeds of the proud are never accepted. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">It has been narrated in a hadith concerning Prophet Ibrahim, `alaihis salam, Allah&#8217;s Khalil, that he spent the night in worship and remembrance of Allah, and in the morning, he was pleased with the night&#8217;s worship and he said: &#8220;How Good is the Rabb (Lord), and how good is the slave, Ibrahim (`alaihis salam).&#8221; On the following day, finding none to share his food with him &#8211; and he loved to share his food &#8211; he took his food outside to the road and sat, waiting for any passerby to eat with him. then two angels descended from the heavens and approached him.So he invited them to eat with him and they accepted. Then Ibrahim `alaihis salam suggested that they approach a nearby garden which contained a fresh water spring. They agreed to this and approached the garden, only to find that the spring had run underground, so there was no water. This was a severe blow to Ibrahim, `alaihis salam, and he was  embarrassed by what he had said (because there was no spring in evidence) and so the angels said to him: &#8220;Ask your Rabb to return the spring.&#8221; He did so, but the spring did not appear, and this was a great blow to him and so he said to the angels: &#8220;You ask Allah.&#8221; So one of them asked Him, and behold! The water returned, then the other supplicated Allah and the water flowed near to them. Then they informed him that his being impressed by his own standing in prayer the previous night had caused his supplication to be rejected.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So beware &#8211; may Allah have mercy on you &#8211; of pride, for no deed will be accepted if it is accompanied by pride. Be humble in your Salah. Should any of you stand in Salah before his Rabb, he should know Allah, in his heart by the great blessings which He bestows upon him and the abundant favour which He grants him, for Allah has honoured him with great goodness, but he has saddled himself with sins. Therefore it is incumbent upon him to be excessive in his humility and meekness towards Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from Abu ad-Darda that he said, &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">That may face be covered in dust for my Rabb (is most loved by me), &#8211; for that is the best kind of worship for Allah</span></strong>.&#8221; So let none of you fear the dust, nor find it distasteful to make sujud in it, for there is no doubt that every one of you comes from it (i.e. mankind was created from dust). Nor should any of you fear an excess of it, for verily, it is by this means that one attempts to attain freedom from slavery and salvation from the Hellfire &#8211; a fire before which the fixed lofty mountains which were placed as pegs (holding the earth) could not stand, nor the seven strong heavens, built one above another, which are placed as a well graded canopy over us, nor the earth, which was placed as a dwelling for us, nor the seven seas, of which none knows their depths or their size except the One Who created them. Then what about us, with our feeble bodies, our delicate bones, our flimsy skin? We seek refuge with Allah from the Fire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So should any of you stand in Salah &#8211; may Allah have mercy on you &#8211; then let him be as if he sees Allah before him, for though he may not see Allah, verily, Allah sees him. It is narrated in a hadith that Allah&#8217;s Messenger, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam, advised a man, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>&#8220;Fear Allah as though you see Him, for verily, though you may not see Him, He sees you.&#8221; </em></strong></span>[Something similar to this wording is quoted in the hadith in which the Prophet, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam spoke to Jibril, `alaihis salam, informing him about the meaning of ihsan, as reported by Bukhari and Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This then, is the advice of the Prophet, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam, to the slave in all his affairs, so what about when he performs Salah, when he stands before Allah, in a particular place, a sacred place, desiring Allah and turning his face towards Him? Does not his standing, his situation in Salah merit the same ihsan as all his affairs? It says in a hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>&#8220;Verily, the slave, when he starts his Salah, should turn his face to Allah, and he should not turn it away from Him until he leaves or turns to right and left.&#8221;</em></strong></span> [That is, when he makes taslim at the end of the prayer.] (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud and an-Nasa&#8217;i).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also narrated in a hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<em>Verily, the slave, as long as he is in Salah, possesses three qualities: Blessings are showered upon his head from the heavens above, the angels sit around him, from his feet to the heavens and a caller says: &#8216;If the slave knew the One Who hears his whispered utterances, he would never leave his Salah.'&#8221;</em></span></strong> [This narration was mentioned by Muhammad ibn Nasr al-Mirwazi in Kitab as-Salah from the hadith of Al-Hasan Al-Basri in a mursal form (an incomplete chain of narrations, in which no Companion is mentioned).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah showers His Mercy upon the worshipper who approaches prayer  in a state of humility and meekness towards Allah, in fear and supplicating Him with desire (for His Pleasure), and in hope (of His Mercy), making Salah to his Rabb, his most important consideration, dedicating his whispered utterances to Him and his standing erect in worship and his ruku` and his sujud, poring out his heart and his feelings and struggling to perfect his acts of worship, for he knows not whether he will perform another prayer after it, or whether he will be overtaken (by death) before he can perform Salah again. He stands before his Rabb, earnestly, with deep feelings, hoping for its acceptance and fearing its rejection, for verily, its acceptance is a cause for joy, while its rejection is a cause for misery and wretchedness. Nothing could be more important to you &#8211; O my brother &#8211; in this Salah, or indeed in any of your actions [i.e. that Allah should accept them]. What is more deserving of your distress and misery, your fear &#8211; indeed your terror &#8211; you know not whether your Salah will find favour with Allah at all, nor whether any of your good deeds will be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you know if your sins will be forgiven at all? After all this, you have no assurance that you will be spared from it (i.e. the punishment of the Hellfire). So who is more deserving of your tears and sadness [than Allah] &#8211; that He may accept from you (your deeds)? In addition to this, you know not whether or not you will awaken in the morning, nor if you will still be here in the evening &#8211; will you be given the good news of Paradise, or the bad news of the Hellfire? I only desire to warn you &#8211; O my brother &#8211; of this terrible danger. It is not fitting that you should be happy because of your family, your wealth or your children. It is a most amazing thing that you should continue to be unmindful, chasing after vain desires, wasting your time in disregard of this most important matter, for you are being driven at a fierce pace (towards death) day and night, hour by hour, like the blink of an eye. You should expect &#8211; O my brother &#8211; that your time may come at any moment and do not be unmindful of this great danger which may visit you. Most assuredly, you must (eventually) taste death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Your time may come in the morning or in the evening. You will be separated from all that you possessed &#8211; either (to be rewarded with) Paradise or (to be punished in) the Hellfire. Descriptions and stories of them (have become) superfluous. Have you not heard &#8211; O my brother the words of the pious slave: &#8220;I am amazed concerning the Hellfire &#8211; how does the one who could flee from it sleep? And I am amazed concerning the Jannah &#8211; how does the one who desires it sleep? For by Allah! If you neither desire Paradise, nor fear the Hellfire, then you are destroyed and grievous will be your sorrow, interminable your sadness and without limit your tears; you will be amongst the wretched, the punished ones. So if you claim that you are amongst those who seek refuge from the Fire and desire Paradise, then strive for that which you seek and do not be misled by your worldly desires.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam <strong>Ibnul-Qayyim al-Jawziyyah</strong> (d.751H)<br />
Source : Kitaabur-Rooh<em> (p. 44)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The soul (<i>ar-rooh</i>) is connected to the body in five different ways, to which different rules apply.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Its connection to the body as a fetus in his mother’s womb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Its connection to the body after a person is born.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Its connection to the body when a person is asleep, when the soul is connected in one way and separated from it in another way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Its connection to the body in <i>al-Barzakh</i> (the period between a person’s death and the Day of Resurrection), when it has departed from the body and separated from it, but is not separated completely in such a way that there is no connection at all. We have mentioned at the beginning of this reply that there are <i>ahaadeeth </i>and reports which indicate that the soul is returned to the body when somebody sends the greeting of salaam to a deceased person. This returning is of a special nature which does not mean that the life is restored to the body before the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Its connection to the body on the Day when bodies will be resurrected. This is the most perfect type of connection to the body, and has no comparison to the previous types, because after that the body will never die, sleep or have anything wrong with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person is asleep, his soul is in his body and he is alive, although his being alive is not the same as that of a person who is awake, for sleep is comparable to death. Similarly, when a dead person’s soul is returned to his body (when the greeting is sent upon him), he is in a state between one who is alive and one who is dead, whose soul is not restored to his body. This is like the case of a sleeping person who is in a state between life and death. We hope that this will dispel a lot of your confusion.</p>
