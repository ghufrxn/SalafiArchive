<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: </strong>What is the difference between<strong> Ittiba&#8221; </strong>(following one&#8217;s traditions; imitation) and <strong>Al Ibtidah </strong>(innovation)</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">?</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Ittiba&#8217; is what we are required to do according to the Shari&#8217;ah (Islamic law), i.e. following what the Prophet (peace be upon him) has brought of orders and prohibitions. It is said &#8220;We should follow&#8221; because Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (the Qur&#8217;an and Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s Sunnah)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and follow not any Auliya&#8217;</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (protectors and helpers who order you to associate partners in worship with Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, besides Him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">: &#8220;O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allâh &#8211; to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(none has the right to be worshipped but He)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. It is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allâh and His Messenger</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, the Prophet who can neither read nor write </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e. Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, who believes in Allâh and His Words [(this Qur&#8217;ân), the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">Gospel)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and also Allâh&#8217;s Word: &#8220;Be!&#8221; &#8211; and he was, i.e. &#8216;Isa </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Jesus)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> son of Maryam </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Mary)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and follow him so that you may be quided.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are ordered to follow the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the Qur&#8217;an. Holding on to what has been revealed by Allah in the Qur&#8217;an and what the Prophet (peace be upon him) has said or done is Ittiba. It is to follow the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in what he ordered or prohibited. This is Ittiba, which is Wajib <em>(</em>obligatory) in matters which we are obliged to do, and it is Mustahab (desirable) in matters which we are desired to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ibtida&#8217;, it is innovation of something in the religion which Allah has not permitted, for example: worship in a way that Allah has not made lawful. This is called Ibtida&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: (&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours </strong>(Islam)<strong> that is not part of it will have it rejected</strong></span>.&#8221;) and he also said: (<strong><span style="color:#000000;">The most evil of matters are those which are newly introduced in religion</span></strong>), and every Bid&#8217;ah is a Dalalah (deviation from what is right).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person was to perform more than five Prayers and said they would perform six Prayers, increasing one Prayer at any time of the day, is a Batil (null/void) and Bid&#8217;ah. It is prohibited to perform or to invite people to perform it with the intention that it is a Fard (obligatory, based on a definitive text). Or if someone said the two Sajdahs (prostrations) are not enough, lets make a third Sajdah in every Rak&#8217;ah (unit of Salah); this is Bid&#8217;ah, which if purposely done, will make the Prayer Batil. Likewise if a person decides to perform a second Ruku&#8217; (bowing) in Prayer, this is Bid&#8217;ah except for the eclipse Prayer. Also if someone says: lets allocate a night for worship and we shall pray ten or twenty Rak ahs on the Thursday or Friday night every week, this is Bid&#8217;ah for it is not something which Allah prescribed, as is the night of the Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him) birthday, or the night of the birth of Fatimah, Al-Husayn, Al Badawy, Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, or &#8216;Umar, it is Bid&#8217;ah and the celebration where they pray, talk, perform Dhikr; this is all Bid&#8217;ah because neither Allah nor the Prophet made it lawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Ibtida&#8217; is to innovate a worship which Allah did not prescribe, whether it is a verbal or practical; all this is Bid&#8217;ah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has not prescribed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of such Bid&#8217;ah is the construction domes and Masjids (mosques) over the graves. People think that this is a way to get closer to Allah, and it is from the Din (religion). Rather it is Bid&#8217;ah because the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade construction over graves, because this could lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). Of such Shirk acts are to touch the graves with the intention of getting closer to Allah. This is Bid&#8217;ah and the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade building over the graves or plastering them, because this could lead to Shirk. This is also true for those who invoke the dead say &#8220;I invoke You (Allah) by (the intercession of) the dead of the graves&#8221;, &#8220;I invoke You (Allah) with the honor or sake of the Prophet&#8221;, or &#8220;with the honor or sake of the righteous people&#8221;; all this is Bid&#8217;ah. But if someone says: I invoke You (Allah) with my love for You, or with my belief in Your Messenger or with Your Noble Names; this is acceptable and lawful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bid&#8217;ah is what people have innovated in the religion and not sanctioned by Allah and His Prophet. Ittiba&#8217; is to follow the approach prescribed by Allah to His servants, and follow in the footsteps of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>37- Merits of learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A questioner from Hadhramaut is asking about &#8216;Aqidah (creed): Your Eminence, is learning the Attributes of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Wajib (obligatory) or Mustahab (desirable)? Does learning these Attributes make any difference? What is the ruling on those who believe that it is not Wajib to learn the Attributes because this might entangle one into asking why and what? What are the books you recommend in this regard?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes from the Noble Qur&#8217;an and the purified Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) is <strong>one of the best acts of worship that brings us nearer to Allah</strong>. Learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes <strong>helps one to glorify, praise and call on Allah by His Names and Attributes</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allâh, so call on Him by them)&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that we should know Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes and use them while calling on Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah has ninety-nine Names; anyone who learns them will be admitted to Jannah (Paradise).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p>This Hadith indicates that Allah is Witr (&#8216;Odd&#8217;, i.e. He is one) and He loves odd numbers.  It also indicates that scholars and believers should learn the Names and Attributes of Allah to invoke and praise Him and act upon them so that they enter Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A believer should know that to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) belongs all Magnificent Names and that He has no peer, equal or rival. He is Perfect in His Essence, His Names, His Attributes and His Deeds and none is comparable to Him. Allah (Glorified be He) says: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</span></strong>.) None of Allah&#8217;s Attributes such as His Mercy, Highness, Istiwa&#8217; (Allah&#8217;s rising over the Throne in a manner that befits Him), Wrath , Laughter etc, is similar to ours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">As for the books we recommend in this regard,</span> </strong>the Noble Qur&#8217;an is the greatest Book. We advise you and all Muslims to adhere to it and recite it frequently because it is the Book of Allah which contains light and guidance. Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, this Qur&#8217;ân guides to that which is most just and right</strong>&#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing.&#8221;</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(This is) a Book (the Qur&#8217;an) which we have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember</strong></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they not then think deeply in the Qur&#8217;ân, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?)&#8221;</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We advise all Muslims to frequently recite, ponder over, and memorize the entire Qur&#8217;an or parts thereof. It is the Book of Allah and the source of light and guidance. It calls for adopting good morals, performing righteous deeds, following that which Allah has enjoined, and avoiding that which He has forbidden. It contains the stories of the prophets, messengers, and the righteous so that people may follow in their footsteps and the stories of the wrongdoers, so people may avoid their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also recommend those who are versed to read the books of Hadith such as the Two Sahihs (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) and the four Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) books (of Imams Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, Al-Nasa&#8217;y and Ibn Majah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, we recommend novices to read the abridged versions of these books which can be easily memorized, such as, Bulugh Al-Maram by Al-Hafidh ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani, Kitab Al-Tawhid, Thalathat Al-Usul, Al Qawa&#8217;id Al &#8216;Arba&#8217;, and Kashf Al-Shubuhat by Shaykh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah be merciful to him), Al-`Aqidah Al-Wasatiyyah by Shaykh Al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah, and Umdat Al-Hadith by Shaykh Al-Hafidh Abdul Ghani Al-Maqdisi. These are some important books which should be read and studied because they are useful.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">(Part No. 11; Page No. 58)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>27- Ruling on performing the Sunnah of Wudu&#8217; during a time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Depending on the indication of the Hadith reported by Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him): Whenever I perform Wudu&#8217; (ablution), I offer a two-Rak&#8217;ah (unit of Prayer) Salah after it) I sometimes perform Wudu&#8217; during a time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah, such as the times after the &#8216;Asr (Afternoon) Prayer, after the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer, or during sunset or sunrise. Will I be blamed if I perform the two Rak&#8217;ah Salah of Wudu then? May Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Wudu&#8217; is <em><strong>Mustahab</strong></em> (desirable) and offering Salah is Mustahab, so whenever a person performs Wudu&#8217;, it is recommended to pray the two-Rak&#8217;ah Salah of Wudu&#8217; at any time, even during the times when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah, because the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever performs Wudu like this Wudu&#8217; of mine and then prays a two-Rak&#8217;ah Salah without being distracted with worldly matters during them will have their previous sins forgiven.)&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that whenever he (peace be upon him) performed Wudu&#8217;, he would pray the two-Rak&#8217;ah Salah of Wudu&#8217; and would encourage people to pray them, may Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon him. This Salah is called the Sunnah (supererogatory) Salah of Wudu&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is nothing wrong with praying this Salah during the time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah, because it is a stressed Sunnah.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q: A questioner from Bahrain asks: Is it permissible for me to offer Salah (Prayer) at the time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah? For example, I may hasten to perform Wudu&#8217; (ablution) and start reciting the Qur&#8217;an and supplication, especially on Fridays after the &#8216;Asr (Afternoon) Prayer, knowing that I do not perform Wudu&#8217; for Salah, but I do it for supplication as mentioned. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If one performs Wudu&#8217; during the time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah, one may offer <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship) of Wudu&#8217; (ablution)</strong></span>, as there is no forbidden time for it. So, when performing Wudu&#8217; after Fajr (Dawn) Prayer or after Asr Prayer, it is prescribed to offer two Rak ahs (unit of Prayer) as Sunnah of Wudu&#8217;. This applies to both males and females.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, when entering the Masjid after &#8216;Asr or Fajr Prayer, it is prescribed to offer two Rak&#8217;ahs as <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Tahiyyat-ul-Masjid</strong></span> (two-unit-Prayer to greet the mosque) and there is no restriction regarding the time of these ceremonial Salahs; it may be offered during the time when it is impermissible to offer supererogatory Salah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same equally applies to the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Salat-ul-Kusuf</span> </strong>(Prayer on a solar eclipse) when a solar eclipse takes place after &#8216;Asr Prayer. Muslims should perform Salat-ul-Kusuf, because this Salah is one of the ceremonial Salahs that are offered for specific reasons and there is no restriction imposed regarding the time when these Salahs are offered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 11; Page No. 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is permissible to perform these ceremonial Salahs that are <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>offered for specific reasons</strong> </span>even during the time when it is impermissible to offer supererogatory Salah.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">29- Ruling on postponing the Sunnah of Wudu&#8217;</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q: A female questioner says: Should the Sunnah (supererogatory Prayer) of Wudu&#8217; (ablution) be offered immediately after Wudu&#8217; or is it permissible to postpone it due to some affairs while holding the intention of performing it after finishing my work? Which of these two practices is better; to perform it immediately or postpone it until I finish my work? May Allah reward you with the best! </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is better to hasten to perform the two-Rak&#8217;ah (unit of Prayer) Salah (Prayer) immediately after Wudu&#8217;, and if a person is occupied with work and thus prays it after that, this is acceptable. Both cases are good, but it is better to perform the Salah immediately.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Slaughtering animals upon building houses</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Q: In our residential area, people are accustomed to slaughtering an animal upon starting or finishing the construction of a house. Neighbors and relatives are invited on this occasion. What is Your Eminence&#8217;s opinion about this practice? Is there any recommendable act to be performed before going to live in a new house? Benefit us may Allah reward you well!</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 2; Page No. 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This practice needs to be clarified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If by slaughtering the animal the owners of the house seek to protect themselves from jinn or ensure that the house is safe to live in or any similar issue, this practice will be considered an act of <strong>Bid&#8217;ah</strong> (innovation in religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the slaughter is offered for the sake of the jinn, then it will be considered an act of <strong>major Shirk</strong> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) as it involves offering an act of Ibadah (worship) to someone other than Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if by doing this, one intends <strong>to show gratitude to Allah&#8217;s Blessings</strong> for reaching the roof or completion of construction works there is nothing wrong with this and with inviting the relatives and neighbors. This is the custom of many people who offer thanks to Allah due to Him helping them construct a house of their own instead of renting a house to live in. There is nothing wrong in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the <strong>intention</strong> behind this is to protect oneself from jinn or to fulfill any other non-Islamic purpose, then this practice is impermissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This practice will be valid only if the intention is to show gratitude to Allah for enabling one to construct a house of their own. This practice is similar to being hospitable to one&#8217;s relatives and neighbors.This is also similar to holding a <strong>marriage banquet</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A similar practice is performed when people <strong>return from travel</strong> when animals are sacrificed and relatives are entertained. It was the Prophet&#8217;s (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wasallam</em>) regular practice that upon returning from a journey he would slaughter a camel and invite people to dine with him.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>32- Description of the relationship between the mind and the soul</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Human beings have both minds and souls. Can the soul oppose or agree with the mind? Is there a relationship between both the soul and the mind? Or does each of them operate independently?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mind and the soul are one entity. The mind thinks, considers and contemplates through the soul. If the soul departs the body, every other thing stops to be. While the soul is in the body, the mind thinks and distinguishes between good and evil, as the mind operates through the soul. Therefore, one can think, consider, plan, and decide as long as his soul resides in his body. When it is gone, one cannot think anymore.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>7- Ruling on offering supererogatory Salah (Prayer) fifteen minutes before Zhuhr (Noon) Prayer?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A sister from Riyadh asks: What is the ruling on offering supererogatory Salah (Prayer) fifteen or ten minutes before Zhuhr (Noon) Prayer? Please, clarify this matter, for a fellow Muslim sister told me that it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah at this time. May Allah reward you with the best.</span> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baaz (rahimahullah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for a Muslim to offer supererogatory Salah before Zhuhr when the sun is straight overhead, as this is included among the periods during which it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah. It is authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There are three hours at which the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wasallam) forbade us to pray or bury our dead: when the sun begins to rise until it is fully up, when the sun is at its height at midday until it has passed the meridian, and when the sun inclines to setting until it sets.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that shortly before noon no Salah should be offered. This is not a long period; rather, it is only the period when the sun reaches the meridian, the highest point reached by the sun when it is directly overhead.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 11; Page No. 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During this time, it is impermissible to offer Salah until its passes the meridian, i.e. until the Adhan (call) to Zhuhr Prayer is announced. After this time, a person may offer Salah as much as they like. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Thus, it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah until the sun passes the meridian, a relatively short period; it is almost fifteen or twenty minutes before noon. However, it is better to be on the safe side and stop offering supererogatory Salah thirty minutes before noon</span></strong>.</span> After the sun passes the meridian, the time of impermissibility ends up to the &#8216;Asr (Afternoon) Prayer.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">31-Ruling on making Du&#8217;a&#8217; the dead</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on those who make Du&#8217;a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead are Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). If they make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to the dead, idols, trees, stones, angels or jinn, they will be regarded as Kafirs (disbelievers) as making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to all these leads to one thing; namely, Kufr (disbelief that takes the Muslim out of Islam),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing that can be excluded from this ruling which is seeking help from his fellow Muslim brother or non-Muslim like buying a commodity from a non-Muslim, asking him to build a shop or mend a car while the person while he is alive. This case is considered to be exceptional and is not a kind of Shirk. It is similar to what Allah (Exalted be He) mentions in the story of Musa (Moses): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(The man of his own) party asked him for help against his foe)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one asks his fellow Muslim brother or the non-Muslim, who is present, to do something for him like building a house, mending the car, or plowing the land in return for something, or they agree upon doing something that is legally permitted, there will be nothing wrong as all these things are normal and can be done by human beings who are alive and present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) is making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to those who are not present and cannot hear him, the dead or a living person whom he thinks to be supernatural and has a mysterious power. This understanding leads him to think that if he makes Du&#8217;a&#8217; to this person for forgiveness and admittance to paradise, he will be able to do this because of something secret about this person. This is Munkar even if the person who is invoked besides Allah (Exalted be He) is living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Sufis who worship their Shaykhs and their senior and prestigious persons who are dead. They ask them for help and make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to them to cure the sick. All these things are considered to be major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) <strong>even if the person whom they make Du`a&#8217; to is alive because they ask him something beyond his abilities</strong>. This behavior differs from asking a person to lend you something, build a house for you, cultivate some land, mend a car, bring your belongings from the car, and so on. All these things are normal and contain there is nothing wrong in them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">23- Sincerity in dedicating one&#8217;s deeds to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Q: Sister M. H. from Makkah Al-Mukarramah asks: What is the correct way to sincerely dedicate one&#8217;s deeds to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He)? How can deeds be done sincerely for His sake?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808080;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baaz (rahimahullah):</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To act sincerely, a person must turn to Allah (Exalted be He) and have an attentive heart. A person should perform all deeds such as Salah (Prayer), Sawm (Fast), Sadaqah (voluntary charity), Hajj (Major Pilgrimage), Umrah (Minor Pilgrimage), and so on, seeking the Pleasure of Allah, salvation from the Hellfire, and attainment of Allah&#8217;s Mercy and Forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sincerity is to seek the Pleasure of Allah (Exalted be He), to draw close to Him, to hope for His Mercy, to have one&#8217;s deeds accepted, to be saved from Hellfire, and to be admitted to Jannah (Paradise), not for the purposes of Riya&#8217; (showing-off) or enhancement of one&#8217;s reputation. A believer should perform deeds for the sake of Allah (Exalted be He) in order to attain salvation in the Hereafter, to be saved from the Hellfire, and to be granted absolution. Hence, every believer, male and female, should dedicate all their deeds to Allah seeking His Pleasure so that Allah may accept their deeds.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1- Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Is it true that some Muslims will enter Jannah (Paradise) without being called to account?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Yes, it is true, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(<strong>&#8220;All the nations were shown to me, and I saw a prophet accompanied by a small group of his followers, another with two or three people of his followers and a third not accompanied by any follower.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the end of the Hadith, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Among my Ummah there are seventy thousand who would enter Jannah without being brought to account or being punished.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) asked who these people were, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah (recitation for healing or protection); they are those who do not get themselves cauterized; and they are those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith implies that the Mu&#8217;min (believer), who continues obeying Allah&#8217;s commands and avoiding His prohibitions until death, will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds and without suffering punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Falling under this category are the Mu&#8217;mins who do not ask others to recite Ruqyah over them. There is nothing wrong, however, if they themselves are accustomed to reciting Ruqyahs over other Muslims. This is because one who recites Ruqyah basically does a good deed by asking Allah (Exalted be He) to cure the illness of the person for whom they recite the Ruqyah. This is based on the authentic Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Whosoever among you is able to benefit his fellow believer, let him do so.)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Istirqa</strong></span>&#8216; means to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. For example, you may ask a person to recite Rygyah for you. It is better not to ask others for Ruqyah unless one happens to be suffering from an ailment, In this case, it is not wrong to ask others to recite Ruqyah. It has been reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) asked Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) saying: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Seek healing through asking for Ruqyah</span></strong>) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered her to treat herself by means of asking others for Ruqyah, He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to recite Ruqyah to the children of Jafar when they were under the influence of the evil eye. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is no Ruqyah (reciting Qur&#8217;an and supplicating over the sick seeking healing) better than that which is said as a treatment for an evil eye or (a sting of) a venomous animal</strong></span>.&#8221; It is not wrong to seek treatment by means of Istirqa’ when necessary. However, it is better not to resort to such means if it is possible to cure oneself by means of some other kind of medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also better not to treat oneself by means of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>cauterization</strong> </span>if another means of treatment is available. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The best of all remedies are three; cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I hate to be cauterized.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version it states: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">..and I forbid my Ummah (nation) from cauterization.</span></strong>) This denotes that cauterization should be used as a last resort when all other means prove unsuccessful. It is better to seek treatment by other means if possible. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah. However, cauterization may only be resorted to when necessary. It is, however, better to apply another means of treatment like drinking honey, cupping, or reciting the Qur&#8217;an, The Prophet&#8217;s (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) statement: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are those who do not seek Ruqyah; they are those who do not get themselves cauterized&#8230;</strong></span>) does not denote that seeking Ruqyah or cauterization are prohibited; rather, it denotes that one may resort to other means of treatment in preference to these kinds. However, if one is forced by necessity to seek Ruqyah or cauterization, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“T<strong><span style="color:#008000;">hey are these who do not believe in bad omens</span></strong>&#8220;: Believing in the occurrence of evil omens, a custom practiced by the pre-Islamic Arabs, constitutes an act of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the characteristics of the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account is that they avoid the prohibited practice of believing in bad omens and the reprehensible practice of seeking Ruqyah and cauterization when there is no need for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>,&#8221; means that such Muslims avoid these things because they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He) and seek to attain His Pleasure. The statement implies that they steadfastly obedient to Allah (Exalted be He) and they avoid not only what He has declared as prohibited but also some of what He has declared as permissible if there is something better than it. By doing so, they hope for Allah&#8217;s Reward and fear His Punishment. They draw near to Him through doing deeds that He loves and do so with their hearts filled with trust and confidence in Him (Glorified and Exalted be He),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another similar Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand&#8230;)</span></strong> According to another Hadith: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allah promised to increase the number by as many as three Handfuls added by my Lord, Glorified be He.</span></strong>) This increase in number is known to none but Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize, every upright Mu&#8217;min who avoids Allah&#8217;s Prohibitions and does not allow themselves to go beyond the limits set by Allah (Exalted be He) will be counted among the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without Allah calling them to account or consigning them to punishment.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment. When the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) inquired about their characteristics, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told them that they are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omen. We ask Your Eminence to clarify these characteristics so that we may develop them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that <strong><span style="color:#008000;">seventy thousand people of his Ummah (nation) will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment.</span></strong> In another Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand.,.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was asked about their characteristics, he said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah from others, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith refers to pious and faithful Muslims who adhere steadfastly to Allah&#8217;s Din (religion), those who worship Allah Alone, those who fulfill their religious duties, those who avoid His Prohibitions and strive hard to do good to the point that they decline to do what is permissible, yet undesirable, like seeking Ruqyah and cauterization. This perfects their Iman (faith). They do not ask others to make Ruqyah for them nor do they get themselves cauterized. It is better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization unless under necessity. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah when they were under the influence of the evil eye. This indicates that seeking Ruqyah is permissible only when necessary. However, it is better not to treat oneself by means of Istirqa&#8217; or cauterization if another means of treatment is available, Some of the Sahabah were treated by means of cauterization. Khabbab ibn Al-Arat and other Sahabah were also treated by means of cauterization, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have used cauterization as a means of treating the sickness of some of his Sahabah. Having oneself cauterized does not necessarily mean that one will not be counted among the seventy thousand people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds. However, one of their good characteristics includes their uprightness, truly obeying Allah (Exalted be He) and avoiding disobedience to Him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the meaning of the following Hadith: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) once asked his Sahabah: &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; They asked him about those people who will enter Jannah without being called to account. Whereupon the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This has been reported in the Hadith about the seventy thousand Muslims who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told his Sahabah that his Ummah were displayed before him. Among them were seventy thousand people who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment, Some people said; &#8220;The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) may be referring to those who were born Muslims.&#8221; Others said: &#8220;He may be referring to those who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) during the early days of Islam and did not associate any partners with Allah.&#8221; When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) entered upon them, he asked them about the topic they were discussing, When they told him that they were inquiring about the Muslims who will enter Jannah without being judged, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said; (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to the characteristics mentioned in the above Hadith, they also fear Allah, believe in Him and hold steadfastly to His Din (religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not get themselves cauterized</span></strong>&#8221; means that they do not resort to cauterization when they are ill. Another great characteristic is that they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He), However, it is permissible to treat sickness by means of cauterization or seeking Ruqyah as the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have permitted them both. He permitted “Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also permitted the mother of Ja ‘far&#8217;s children to treat them by means of seeking Ruqyah. However, if another means of treatment is available, then it will be better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I do not like to be cauterized</span></strong>. )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Believing in bad omens is prohibited because it leads to pessimism. There is a narration from Imam Muslim that states: &#8220;They do not recite Ruqyah to others,&#8221; but its status has been classified as weak. Some narrators have mistaken seeking Ruqyah for Ruqyah. There is nothing wrong if the Muslim recites Ruqyah for his fellow Muslim, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing wrong with Ruqyahs as long as they do not contain formulas that bear the meaning of Shirk</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have recited Ruqyah to his Sahabah, “Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) is also reported to have recited Ruqyah over the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) when he fell sick. The Sahabah are also on reported to have recited Ruqyah to each other. There is nothing wrong with reciting Ruqyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is better not to seek Ruqyah unless there is a necessity. This is based on the fact that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered Aishah saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over you.</strong></span>&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) also said to the mother of the children of Ja ‘far &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over them (her children).</span></strong>&#8221; There is nothing wrong to ask someone saying: “<strong>O so and so, recite the Qur&#8217;an over me so that Allah may cure my sickness. May Allah reward you greatly</strong>.&#8221; There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is need for that.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Who are the people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds? Are they those who do not recite Ruqyah for themselves nor for others? Kindly explain this to us. May Allah reward you with the best.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Those who follow Allah&#8217;s Din, fulfill His religious duties, and avoid His Prohibitions are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account or suffering punishment. Among them are the seventy thousand who do not seek Ruqyah, have themselves cauterized or believe in bad omens, but put their trust in Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also do not believe in bad omens because believing in them is prohibited. Moreover, they prefer to avoid cauterization as a form of treatment, This is because the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said that these are among the characteristics of the seventy thousand (who will enter Paradise without being called to account). It would be better to use another form of treatment instead of cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey, yet I do not like to be cauterized, ) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah, Therefore, it is better not to treat oneself by means of cauterization, especially when another means of treatment is available. If no other means is available, then there is nothing wrong to resort to this. That does not necessarily mean that they will not be accounted among the seventy thousand. This is because the seventy thousand are those who adhere to the Din of Allah, avoid His Prohibitions, and fulfill the duties He prescribed. Among their good characteristics is that they do not seek Ruqyah. However, seeking Ruqyah does not necessarily mean that they will not be included among the seventy thousand. Seeking Ruqyah is to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. There is nothing wrong to ask for Ruqyah if there is need for that. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah, He also ordered the mother of the children of Ja far to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah, so there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is a need for that. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three things: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey.) This Hadith denotes that though it is permissible to seek treatment by means of cauterization, it is preferable not to resort to it, especially when some other sort of medicine is available.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">7- The most authentic books on “Aqidah</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Q: Please guide me to the most authentic book on true Islamic Aqidah (creed)! May Allah grant you success!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A: The most authentic, noblest and greatest book dealing with the subject of Aqidah and other subjects is <strong>the Glorious Qur&#8217;an</strong>. It contains the most truthful speech. </span><span style="color:#000000;">No falsehood can approach it from before or behind it. It is a revelation from Allah, the All-Wise, the Praiseworthy. I advise the inquirer and all Muslims to hold fast to the Qur&#8217;an and to give it due attention by reciting it often, reflecting on its meanings and trying hard to memorize as many chapters of it as possible. It is the Greatest Book which Allah has sent down to His servants so that they may memorize it, follow its teachings and act upon it. It contains plain truths and clear guidance. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states, «<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, this Qur’an guides to that which is most just and right</strong></span>» </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He (Glorified be He) also says,« <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>it is an honourable well-fortified respected Book (because it is Allah’s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption)</strong></span>» «<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it: (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allah azza wa jal)</strong></span></span>».<span style="color:#000000;"> and: «<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur’an) as an exposition of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and glad tidings for those who have submitted themselves (to Allah as Muslims)</span></strong>.»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I thus advise the inquirer to care for this Great Book, recite it frequently, ponder over its meanings, study it together with colleaques and fellows, and refer to reliable books of Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an), such as the book entitled <strong>&#8220;Adwa&#8217; Al-Bayan&#8221;</strong> for Al-Baghawy, <strong>Tafsir Ibn Kathir </strong>(may Allah be merciful to them all), and the like. They may also refer to commentaries of other Mufassirs (exegetes of the Qur&#8217;an) who clarified the meanings of the Ayahs of the Qur&#8217;an, citing related Hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I advise you my fellow brother to study the Book of Allah and to pay due concern to the <strong>Sunnah</strong> (whatever reported from the Prophet) of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), which contains guidance and light. You may refer to such books as <strong>Sahih Al-Bukhari</strong>, <strong>Sahih Muslim</strong> and the remaining four collections of Hadith (<strong>Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, Al-Nasa&#8217;i, and Ibn Majah</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There are also many other books which </span><span style="color:#000000;">explain the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him), including the <strong>Muwatta&#8217; of Imam Malik</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), the <strong>Sunan of Al-Darimi</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), the <strong>Sahih of Ibn Khuzaymah</strong>, the <strong>Sahih of Ibn Hibban</strong>, <strong>Al-Hakim</strong> and other books which are very beneficial. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">If you have some knowledge of Hadith, you will be able to differentiate between authentic and false Hadiths cited in the books referred to above. The Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) are an exception to this. The Muslim Ummah (community) has unanimously agreed on the authenticity of all the Hadiths compiled in them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">You are also advised to follow in the footsteps of the righteous scholars of Hadith. The Two Sahih Books of Hadith have gained the credibility of AhI-ul- Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream). The Muslim Ummah has also acknowledged them as authentic. Therefore, you must adhere to them tenaciously. You must also hold fast to the Book of Allah, the remaining four books of Sunan and the books we just mentioned. Scholars of Hadith have pointed out weak Hadiths and have given reasons for their weakness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">As for books on the topic of “Aqidah, they are many. One of the best books in this regard is the <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221; by Ibn Khuzaymah</strong>, <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Sunnah&#8221; by *Abdullah Ibn Ahmad Ibn Hanbal</strong>, <strong>&#8220;Minhaj Al-Sunnah&#8221;, by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>, which refutes the claims of the Mutazilites, and <strong>&#8220;Zad Al-Ma‘ad&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong>, knowing that the latter is very good reference in the field of “Aqidah and rulings of Shariah (Islamic Law). Other books include <strong>&#8220;Ijtima Al-Juyush Al-Islamiyyah&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> which refutes the claims of innovators in religious matters, &#8220;<strong>Al-Sawa ‘iq Al-Mursalah&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong>, which also involves refutation of the claims of innovators in religious matters, and <strong>&#8220;Al- Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah&#8221; by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>. This is a concise book which involves great benefit to Muslims. It is in line with the guidance of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah, and Shaykh- ul-Islam advised all Muslims, particularly seekers of knowledge, to memorize it, as it contains clear illustration of the doctrine of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah. Shaykh-ul-Islam also authored a book entitled <strong>&#8220;Al-Risalah Al-Hamawiyyah&#8221;</strong> which answers questions posed by the people of Hamah </span><span style="color:#000000;">concerning proper understanding of Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes, and other questions related to Aqidah. Upon visiting the people of Tadmur, he also wrote an epistle which he entiteled <strong>&#8220;Al-Risalah Al-Tadmuriyyah&#8221;.</strong> It is a great piece which clarifies sound Aqidah. There is also a book entitled &#8220;<strong>Al- Aqidah Al-Tahawiyyah&#8221; by Imam Al- Izz</strong>. It is wonderfully written. There is also another book called <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221; written by Shaykh-ul-Islam Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), which is a valuable book. He also wrote <strong>“At-Thatlathat Al-Usul&#8221;</strong>. He also wrote a short treatise on Aqidah. Another book called <strong>&#8220;Fat-h Al-Majid Sharh Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221;</strong> was written by his grandson Shaykh ‘Abdul-Rahman Ibn Hasan Ibn Al-Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab. It is a great and useful book. The book was annotated by Shaykh Sulayman Ibn ‘Abdullah Ibn Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab. He titled it &#8220;<strong>Taysir Al- Aziz Al-Hamid li-Sharh Kitab Al-Tawhid</strong>&#8220;. It is also a great and useful book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I advise all Muslims to refer to and benefit from these and other beneficial books on the subject of Aqidah. I again stress the fact that the Qur&#8217;an is the greatest, noblest and most truthful of all books. It is the greatest remedy for those who seek healing for their souls. The Salaf (righteous predecessors) did not have any other book except the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). The Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) and the Tabi‘un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) had only the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and the Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and they were sufficient for them. They contain every type of guidance. However, there is nothing wrong in referring to the books of well known and reliable scholars as has been mentioned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There is no harm in making use of their writings, benefiting from them or calling other people to benefit from them. Some people may not trust their own understanding of the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah, and when they refer to books written by reliable scholars and such references happen to be in conformity with their understanding, their knowledge is further enhanced and their hearts are set at ease. Allah alone grants success.</span></p>

<p>(Part No. 6; Page No. 147)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>From among the helping means is to sleep early after ‘Isha’ (Night) Prayer. One should sleep early and should not stay up late and set the alarm to wake up an hour before the Adhan (call to Prayer) in order to benefit and profit from this blessed time. One can also ask their household members to wake them up for Fajr Prayer. The point is that one has to make use of all possible means along with asking Allah for help and success.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 4; Page No. 17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4- Observing causes does not contradict Tawakkul</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The questioner asks: “I recite many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) that talk about Tawakkul (putting one’s trust in Allah). How can we observe Tawakkul in our life? I hope you will give me examples of that.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Tawakkul is one of the duties of the believers. Allah (Glorified be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and put your trust in Allah if you are believers indeed</strong></span>.) , (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him</span></strong>.) and, (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and in Allah (Alone) let those who trust, put their trust.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawakkul is one of the acts of worships and obligations upon Muslims. It means entrusting all affairs with Allah (may he be Exalted) and depending upon Him in everything. It also means putting one&#8217;s trust in Allah along with observing the causes. One should believe that Allah is the Causer of causes and the Disposer of all affairs and that everything rests in Allah&#8217;s Hands (Glorified and Exalted be He). One should also believe that no one can hinder what Allah gives and no one can give what Allah hinders and that Allah is the benefit Giver and the harm Inflicting, and the Supreme Giver and the Preventer. But, at the same time, one should follow legal causes that can bring him benefit by eating when he is hungry, drinking when he is thirst, marrying, earning lawful provision through selling and buying and other things. One should not neglect observing causes and put his trust in Allah along with believing that nothing happens to him except what is predestined by Allah (Exalted be He) and that he will not succeed without Allah&#8217;s support and help. Therefore, one should observe causes and put his trust in Allah and rely upon Him alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 4; Page No. 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should treat the patient while putting his trust in Allah as He is the One Who brings cure. You should follow the causes by seeing a physician, carrying out his instructions, having medicine, Cauterization, dietary or the like. You should sell and buy while putting trust in Allah and believing that nothing will occur except what Allah predestines for you. You can rent your estates in order to receive their due revenues, irrigate your farm, give your animals to drink and eat in order to gain their benefits while depending upon Allah in all these things. This means that one should observe the causes in everything while putting his trust in Allah and believing that He is the Causer of causes, Disposer of all affairs, benefit Giver, harm Inflicting, the Supreme Giver and the Preventer. One should only observe the causes that are ordained for him. You travel for performing Hajj (Pilgrimage), Umrah (Lesser Pilgrimage) or for trading while observing causes and believing that Allah is the Causer of causes and He is the Only One Who can make you reach your destination, support you in performing rites of Hajj and help you to achieve your goals in trade, return from your journey, and so on.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">20- The wisdom of creating the universe</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: It has become quite common knowledge that this world came into existence only for the sake of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and that had it not been for his sake, it would not have come into existence. I hope that our grand Shaykh will answer this question and mention related evidence. May Allah reward you richly.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This claim is adopted by some common people who lack proper understanding of the purpose of life. Some people say that the world was created for the sake of Muhammad. They say that were it not for Muhammad (peace be upon him), neither the world nor the people living in it would have been created. This is a false and groundless claim which is based on corrupt understanding. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allah (Exalted be He) created the world so that people would know Him, realize His existence and worship Him Alone (Glorified and Exalted be He)</strong></span>. He created the world and human beings so that His Names and Attributes, His Graciousness and Knowledge would be known and so that He Alone would be obeyed and worshipped with no partner. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">He did not create this world for the sake of Muhammad, Nuh (Noah), Musa (Moses), Isa (Jesus) or any other prophet</span></strong>. Rather, Allah (Exalted be He) created the universe so that He Alone would be worshiped with no partner or associate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)</span><span style="color:#008000;">. )</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) states that He created mankind so that they would worship Him and not for the sake of Muhammad (peace be upon him), Being one of the prophets, Muhammad (peace be upon him) was also created to worship His Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) states, (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e, death).</span> </strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Surah Al-Talaq, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is Allah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e. seven). His Command descends between them (heavens and earth), that you may know that Allah has power over all things, and that Allah surrounds all things in (His) Knowledge</span></strong>. )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says,(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose!</span> </strong>}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) created mankind so that He would be worshipped, obeyed, glorified and so that people may know that He has power over all things and that He disposes of all affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the questioner must realize that the things which he heard are void and groundless. It was not for the sake of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) nor for the sake of any other messenger that Allah (Exalted be He) created the jinn, mankind, the heavens, the earth or other objects. Rather, Allah (Exalted be He) created life and mankind so that He will be worshipped Alone without any partner and that His Names and Attributes are known to everyone. This is the truth of the matter as is indicated by many proofs. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">This is by no means in contradiction with the fact that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the best and most honorable of men, the last and final Prophet, and the master of the children of Adam</span></strong>. It must be known that Allah (Exalted be He) created him for the purpose of worshipping Him, which is the very purpose for which all mankind was created. Again, Allah (Exalted be He) did not create people for the sake of Muhammad (peace be upon him). At the same time, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the best of all people. Therefore, you must understand this and convey it to others because this matter is very important.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some &#8216;so-called&#8217; scholars and uneducated extremists have misunderstood this matter and this may confuse common Muslims. On the contrary, people of knowledge and far-reaching insight know very well that these are but false claims and that Allah (Glorified be He) created mankind for the purpose of worshipping Him Alone and that they may come to know about His Names and Attributes, like the All-Wise, the All-Knowing, the Hearer, the Answerer of supplications, the One Who has Power overall things, and the One Whose Being, Names and Attributes and Actions are perfect.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1- Definition of Islam</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Please, illustrate to me the meaning of Islam.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>Islam</strong> means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>total submission to Allah (Exalted be He) through belief in His Oneness, and showing subservient and servile obedience to Him</strong></span>. This is the meaning of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic root word ‘<strong>Aslama</strong>&#8216; means to show submission and surrender to someone and obey his commands. Accordingly, Islam means surrender and submission to Allah&#8217;s Will by means of believing in His Oneness, being devoted to Him, obeying His commandments and abandoning what He has prohibited. Such is Islam, about which Allah (Exalted be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam</strong></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides, a Muslims are thus called as they show complete submission to Allah and obey Him, abiding by His Commandments and refraining from what He has prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is also a name for <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>all the Commandments of Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him)</strong></span>, including Salah (Prayer), Sawm (fast), Zakah (obligatory charity), Hajj (pilgrimage), faith and so on. Such categories fall under Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this regard, Allah (Exalted be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion</b></span></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers</strong></span>, )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, a Muslim is a person who submits himself to Allah (Exalted be He) as far as words, practical behavior and belief are concerned. In other words, Islam stands for total submission to and abidance by His Commandments in all aspects of life.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">167. The difference between the Fard and Nafilah Prayers</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Are there differences between the Fard and Nafilah Prayers ?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Yes, there are differences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Nafilah</em> is a desirable supererogatory act, while the <em>Fard</em> is obligatory, based on a definitive text. If one does not offer the <em>Nafilah</em> Prayer, such as <em>Salat-ul-Duha</em> (supererogatory Prayer before noon), <em>Al-Witr</em> (Prayer with an odd number of units), or the <em>Sunnah Ratibah</em> (supererogatory Prayer performed on a regular basis) related to the the <em>Zhuhr</em> (Noon), <em>Fajr</em> (Dawn), <em>Maghrib</em> (Sunset), and ‘<em>Isha</em>’ (Night) Prayers, one is not regarded as sinful for this. On the other hand, if one gives up the the Fard Prayers, one is sinful and may even be considered a disbeliever if one does so intentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Nafilah Prayer may be offered while sitting, even if the person performing it is healthy, while the Fard Prayer cannot be performed while sitting unless the person offering it has a reason for this; such as being sick or disabled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) would sometimes offer the optional late night Prayer while sitting, and he (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said: (<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever prays while standing will get greater reward;one who prays while sitting will get half of the reward of the person praying while standing; and one who prays laying will get half of the reward of the person who prays sitting</strong></span>.) Peace and blessings be upon the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is permissible in general to pray the Nafilah during the night or day while sitting. However, this is not the case with the Fard Prayer. The latter must be offered while standing, as the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said to “Imran: (<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Offer Prayer while standing).</span></strong> He said to ‘Imran ibn Al-Husain (may Allah be pleased with him): (<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Pray while standing and if you cannot, pray while sitting, and if you cannot do even that, then pray lying on your side.) (If you cannot do even that, you can pray lying on your back</span></strong>.) This Hadith is about the Fard; as for the Nafilah, there is no problem if one performs it while sitting; if he or she finds himself or herself too tired to stand while praying the same, they may sit.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source : Nur `Ala Al-Darb Fatwas , alifta.net</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q62: I would like to perform Tawbah (repentance to Allah) from envying others. I am trying to get rid of this quality as hard as I can, but Satan often tempts me to do this through jealousy. If I become jealous of my colleagues or other women, I begin to envy them. A friend told me, &#8220;Suppress your jealousy and envy inside your heart, and don&#8217;t talk about it, so Allah will not punish you for it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A62: Yes, it is true, if you feel something you should try to struggle against yourself and suppress your feelings, and do not do anything contrary to the Shari`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Do not try to harm the person that you envy, whether by actions or by words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Ask Allah to remove this from your heart so it will not harm you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; If one person envies another, but they do not act upon it, it will not harm them if they do not harm the person they envy, take their blessing from them, or speak ill about them. If it is something that is in their mind and they suppress it, it will not cause them any harm. However, they should be careful to avoid saying or doing anything to harm the person they envy. It was narrated the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said,<a>Avoid envy, as envy devours good deeds just as a fire devours fuel. </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Envy is a malicious thing that harms the one who feels it before it harms others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Believers should beware of this and ask Allah for protection. They should supplicate to Allah to remove this from their hearts, until there is nothing left of it. And, whenever they feel anything like it, they should struggle against themselves to suppress it and keep it inside their hearts, without hurting the person they envy, whether by actions or by words. And may Allah help us all!</p>

<p>Q: Please inform us about the ruling on interlacing the hands in the Masjid (mosque).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">It is Makruh (reprehensible) for the Muslims to interlace their <strong>fingers</strong> when they <strong>go and wait for Salah (Prayer)</strong> and <strong>during Salah</strong> itself</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported about the Prophet (peace be upon him) that this act is Makruh. When people go to Salah, it means that they are regarded as if they are in Prayer. Thus, they should not interlace their fingers. Also, they should not do that in the Masjid waiting for Salah or during Salah itself, as this act is Makruh. After offering the Salah, there is nothing wrong with doing that even if they are still in the Masjid. It is authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) that when he offered Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer), he regarded Salah as completed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, he sat in the front of the Masjid and interlaced his fingers (peace be upon him). Thus, there is nothing wrong with interlacing the fingers after offering the Salah even if in the Masjid.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">68- The meaning of the Hadith &#8221; If anyone asks by Allah, you should give them&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A questioner asks: Some people embarrass us when they ask us by Allah to give, sell or even tell them anything. We often refuse their request when it is inappropriate. Is there any sin upon us for rejecting their request after they have asked us by Allaht? Please advise us about this. May Allah reward you well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If the person in need has no right to do this, there is no harm in refusing his request insha`a Allah (If Allah wills). For example, when someone asks you by Allah to give them your house, car, or money, they have no right to do this. But, if they claim their right, such as asking for their due money or demanding Zakah (obligatory charity)-provided that they deserve it- you should give them as available, for the Messenger (peace be upon him) said: If anyone asks (for something) by Allah, you should give them. Thus, it is acceptable to give a to person so long as they have the right to do so, such as a poor person who asks for Zakah, a lender who claims their money, one who needs your support against an oppressor, or in stopping an act of Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, it becomes your duty to respond and help them since they have asked for their right. The Messenger (peace be upon him) said: If anyone asks (for something) by Allah, you should give them On the other hand, if a person claims that which he has no right, or asks for something that involves an act of disobedience, there is no sin upon you if you refuse their request as such demanders should not do this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">145- Ruling on hanging supplications on the body</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Is it permissible to hang some of the Du`a&#8217;s (supplications) which are mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) on the chest of a man or woman as protection for them from the Jinn (creatures created from fire) and devils? [1]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is not permissible whether it be from the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah or anything else. This is called <strong>&#8220;Tama&#8217;im (amulets)&#8221;</strong>, &#8220;<strong>Jami`at</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Hujub</strong>&#8221; and it is not permitted to wear or hang them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said about this matter: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;</span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Anyone who ties an amulet, may Allah not fulfill his aim; and anyone who ties a seashell, may Allah not give him peace</span></strong><span style="color:#000000;">&gt;&gt;<b> </b>[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:<span style="color:#000000;"> &lt;&lt;<strong>Ruqyahs (recitations for healing or protection), amulets and love-charms are Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)</strong>&gt;&gt; [3].</span> Ruqyah here is referring to any words recited that are unknown or involve Shirk or Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect), they are absolutely prohibited! All amulets are prohibited, that is, what is written on a paper or parchment and placed in a piece of cloth or a bag and tied to a child or a sick person, these are all forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This prohibition applies even if the amulets are made of Words of the Qur&#8217;an or lawful Du`a&#8217;s, they are still forbidden, because the correct scholarly opinion is that all amulets are absolutely prohibited. However, there is greater prohibition regarding the amulets which are not made using Words of the Qur&#8217;an. The prohibition of the amulets made using the Qur&#8217;an is to close any of the doors which may lead to sin or Shirk, as a Muslim is obliged to stay away from these acts, so that they do not fall into what Allah (Exalted be He) has made Haram (prohibited). Allah has made lawful for His Servants the things which lead to happiness, well-being and protection. He did not make lawful that which will harm them; rather, He made lawful that which will bring well-being and happiness in this life and the Hereafter. Humans are not permitted to introduce a Bid`ah (innovation in religion); hanging these things constitutes a Bid`ah, even if they contain Qur&#8217;an or Hadiths. The Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade the use of amulets and warned those who wear or hang them that Allah will not fulfill their aim; anyone who ties an amulet or a seashell, Allah will not fulfill their aim of wearing them. It is obligatory on every believing man and woman to protect themselves by reciting the Islamic supplications not by hanging them; supplications for recovery and well-being should be made for the sick and the children. Du`a&#8217; for protection should also be made on their behalf before sleeping by saying: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>I seek refuge for you in the Perfect Words of Allah from the evil of what He has created</strong>&gt;&gt; [4]</span>. This is following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) because it is reported that: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>The Prophet (peace be upon him) used to seek refuge with Allah for Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn, by saying, &#8216;I seek refuge for you both in the Perfect Words of Allah, from every devil and every poisonous vermin, and from every evil (envious) eye.&#8217;</strong>&gt;&gt; [5]</span> Muslims must accustom themselves to reciting Adhkar (invocations and Remembrances said at certain times on a regular basis) and supplications for refuge and protection, and should seek refuge with Allah, as long as they are a sane adult, before sleeping, when entering and leaving their house etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that there is no need to wear amulets. Some scholars have permitted wearing amulets which contain Qur&#8217;an or lawful invocations, and they said: It is a form of Ruqyah (recitation for healing or protection), and since Ruqyah is lawful if it is using the Qur&#8217;an and lawful supplications, an amulet made using the Qur&#8217;an and supplications is also lawful. The answer is that there is a difference between the two; we have evidence that the prophet (peace be upon him) performed Ruqyah and Ruqyah was performed for him. He (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>There is nothing wrong with Ruqyah as long as it does not involve any Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)</strong>.&gt;&gt; [6]</span> This is evidence of the exception of Islamically lawful Ruqyah (i.e., reciting Qur&#8217;an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing), which is excluded from his saying: <span style="color:#000000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>Ruqyahs (recitations for healing or protection), amulets and love-charms are Shirk</strong>.&gt;&gt;[7]</span> This is based on the fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) performed Ruqyah and Ruqyah was performed for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No exceptions were made for amulets and there is no evidence that the Prophet (peace be upon him) hung an amulet on anyone; therefore, it is not permissible to regard amulets the same as Ruqyahs; rather, all amulets are absolutely prohibited. Wearing amulets of the Qur&#8217;an and lawful supplications could lead to wearing all other amulets, while being unaware of which is right and which is wrong, and thus opens the door to Shirk and wearing charms. The Shari`ah (Islamic law) has closed all of the doors which may lead to Shirk, and the Hadiths stated regarding amulets are general and the prohibition applies to all. Closing the doors which may lead to Shirk is an obligation, consequently, this entails prohibiting all amulets, even if they contain Qur&#8217;an or lawful invocations. This is to block the means leading to Shirk and act upon the general meaning of the Hadiths, so that the believer grows accustomed to putting their trust in Allah, relying on Him, supplicating to Him, and asking Him to protect them from all evil and relieve them from any distress, and not to rely on an object which they wear around their neck or anywhere else.</p>
<p>The teachings of the Shari`ah sufficiently contain all goodness and well-being, for the young and old, sick and healthy. May Allah grant everyone success and guidance!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some people commonly give their children names such as `Abdul-Nabiy (the servant of the Prophet), `Abdul-Hussayn (the servant of Al-Hussayn). What is the opinion of your Eminence on such names? Please advise us. May Allah reward you well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is impermissible to give names indicating servitude to other than Allah (Exalted be He), i.e. it is prohibited to say <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abdul-Nabiy, `Abd Aly, `Abdul-Hussayn</span> and so on. This is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect), for such names should be denoting servitude to Allah Alone like `Abdul-Rahman (The Servant of The Most Compassionate), `Abdul-Rahim (The Servant of the Most Merciful), `Abdul-Malik (The Servant of The Sovereign), `Abdul-Quddus (The Servant of The Most Holy) etc. This is the right form of servitude, which is to be declared to None but Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Hazm</strong> Abu Muhammad said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The widely-known opinion of scholars is to prohibit any name indicating servitude to other than Allah, such as <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abd `Umar, `Abd Al-Ka`bah</span> and the like with the exception of <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abdul-Muttalib</span>, as there is disagreement on that. In other words, scholars agree upon prohibiting this. Therefore, it is impermissible to give names showing servitude to other than Allah (Exalted be He) regardless of who the person is. Accordingly, it is impermissible to say: <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abdul-Hussayn, `Abd `Umar, `Abdul-Nabiy, `Abdul-Ka`bah</span> and the like. Rather, a person should use either names signifying servitude to Allah (Exalted be He) or other names like Salih, Muhammad, Ahmad, Zayd, Khalid, Bakr and the like.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the meaning of Allah&#8217;s `Arsh (Allah’s Throne)?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: According to Muslim scholars, and the Arabic language, <span style="color:#808000;">`Arsh means a throne or a throne belonging to a king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The `Arsh of Allah is an extremely large and great Throne; it is the greatest thing created by Allah. It has four legs, and is carried by Angles. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) is above the `Arsh as He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says about Himself: <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;The Most Gracious (Allâh) rose over (Istawâ) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)&gt;&gt;</span> (Surah Taha 20:5). And: <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;Indeed, your Lord is Allâh, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawâ) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty)&gt;&gt;</span> (Surah Al-A&#8217;raf 7:54).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is a significantly large `Arsh; none knows how great the size of its magnificence is except Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Who created it (but we are told by the Prophet that it is very large). This `Arsh is like a dome stretching over the entire universe; it is the ceiling of the whole universe. It is also the ceiling of Paradise; nothing is above it except Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, `Arsh in Arabic is a very large throne, and the thrones of kings are called `Arsh. It is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an that the hoopoe told Sulayman (Solomon) that Bilqis (the Queen of Saba [or Sheba] in Yemen, who ruled during the lifetime of Prophet Sulayman): <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;and she has a great throne&gt;&gt;(Surah Al-Naml 27:23)</span>. Yet, Allah&#8217;s `Arsh is unique; there is no similarity between Allah&#8217;s `Arsh and those of His Creatures. In general, we know from Arabic that `Arsh is a generic name standing for a throne. However, none knows the essence, nature, substance, or greatness of Allah&#8217;s `Arsh except Allah Himself (Glorified and Exalted be He). Yet, authentic Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him) are our authority in this matter. If an authentic Hadith mentions something about it, we must believe it, and accept it without doubt. The Prophet (peace be upon him) does not utter any untruth. Thus, we must believe in what we are told about the `Arsh in the Qur&#8217;an and the authentic Hadiths without further questions. There is no authentic Hadith to tell us what it is made of. However, it is established that it is a very large, and great `Arsh created by Allah and carried by some Angels. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;</span><span style="color:#339966;">And the angels will be on its sides, and eight angels will, that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord above them&gt;&gt;</span> (Surah Al-Haqqah 69:17). The day meant here is the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is known from the Hadiths that four Angels carry the `Arsh now, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be eight Angels. It is reported that Umayah ibn Abu Al-Salt composed a poem, which the Prophet approved, to this effect, namely that four Angels carry the `Arsh of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) now. It reads:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">On the right side, one in the shape of a man, and the other in the shape of an ox<br />
On the left side, one in the shape of a vulture, and the other in the shape of a lion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that now four Angels carry the `Arsh; one in the shape of a man, another in the shape of an oxen, the third in the shape of a vulture, and the fourth in the shape of a lion. These four Angels were created by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) exclusively to bear the `Arsh. Yet, it is reported on the authority of Al-`Abbas ibn `Abdul Muttalib that on the Day of Resurrection eight Angels in the shapes of ibexes will carry the `Arsh. These Angels are so giant, and extremely tall. However, this Hadith has some weakness in relation to its chain of narrators. But, another evidence for this is the Qur&#8217;anic verse mentioned above, that is <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;And the angels will be on its sides, and eight angels will, that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord above them&gt;&gt;</span>(Surah Al-Haqqah 69:17). which states that this will be on the Day of Resurrection. To sum up, they are now four angels, and on the Day of Resurrection they shall be eight. Allah (Glorified be He) is the One sought for help, and He knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A Hadith was reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in which he prohibits making the face ugly, and states that Allah (Exalted be He) created Adam in His image. What is the correct belief regarding this Hadith?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This Hadith is authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in which he said: &#8220;<span style="color:#339966;">If any of you strikes (another), let them avoid the face, for Allah created Adam in His image</span>&#8221; . In another narration: &#8220;<span style="color:#339966;">In the Image of Ar-Rahman (The Gracious)</span>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This does not mean <strong>Tashbih</strong> (comparison) or <strong>Tamthil</strong> (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the view of scholars, this means that Allah (Exalted be He) created Adam hearing, seeing and talking as He wishes. These are also the Attributes of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), for He is All-Hearer, All-Seer, Speaker and has a Face (Glorified and Exalted be He). Yet, that does not mean Tashbih or Tamthil, since the Image of Allah is completely different from the image of any creature. Rather, it means that He is Hearer, Seer, has a Face and Speaker if He wishes. Similarly, Allah (Exalted be He) created Adam in the same image; possessing hearing, sight, face, hands and feet and speech when he wants to talk. Yet, his hearing is not like Allah&#8217;s and so is his sight and speech. His face does not also resemble Allah&#8217;s Face for there is no match to Allah&#8217;s Attributes (may He be Exalted and Glorified). Rather, they befit Him (Glorified be He) alone. The servants (of Allah) have characteristics that befit them as well. Such characteristics are doomed to extinction, defect and weakness. However, the Attributes of Allah are Perfect without defect, weakness or extinction. For that, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <em><span style="color:#339966;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</span></em>. He (Glorified be He) says: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#339966;">And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him</span></em>.&#8221; Accordingly, it is not permissible to strike or make the face ugly.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 33: Is it permissible for women to pray the &#8216;Isha&#8217; (night) Prayer after twelve o&#8217;clock at night? Is it disliked to perform it at eleven thirty, for instance ?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The time of &#8216;Isha&#8217; Prayer extends until midnight. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The time of &#8216;Isha&#8217; Prayer extends until midnight. It is impermissible for women to delay the &#8216;Isha&#8217; Prayer until midnight.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>The length of the night varies, so if there are nine hours of night, for instance, then half of this is four hours and half, according to the time of sunset. If it is twelve hours, according to the time of sunset, then its half will be six hours and a half. After this that, it is not permissible for the sick or women to delay it until midnight.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for men who are not ill, they are to pray with the people in the Masjid (mosque).However, if a man prays at home due to illness, he should pray before midnight and the same applies to the woman.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Your Eminence, once we heard you mention that a woman who offers Salah with her hands and feet uncovered must repeat the whole Salah. Please clarify this matter for us, knowing that we are practicing Muslims abiding by Shari`ah (Islamic law). Since we have heard this ruling, my wife has been covering her feet and hands during Salah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Scholars (may Allah be merciful to them) stated that a woman&#8217;s entire body is `Awrah, and thus she has to cover it all in Salah except the face. This is based on what was reported in the Hadiths from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) that state that all a woman&#8217;s body is `Awrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars differed as to whether the hands should be covered or not. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Regarding the feet, the Jumhur stated that they should be covered</span><span style="text-decoration:underline;">.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the face, there is nothing wrong in uncovering it according to Ijma` (consensus of scholars). In fact, uncovering it in Salah is Sunnah unless there is an Ajnaby present. <span style="color:#800080;">The correct view in this regard is that a woman when offering Salah must cover all her body except the face and hands</span>. According to the correct scholarly opinion, it is not obligatory to cover her hands, but if she covers them, this is better in order to avoid the divergent opinions of scholars who hold that covering them is obligatory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">As for the feet, it is obligatory to cover them according to Jumhur because all a woman&#8217;s body is `Awrah and the feet are considered `Awrah. Thus, there is no reason to uncover them and <span style="color:#ff0000;">they should be covered whether by wearing socks or long garments</span> while offering Salah.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I said and clarified more than once on the program &#8220;Nur `ala Al-Darb (Light on the Way)&#8221; is that it is obligatory for a woman to cover her entire body so that nothing of it shows. She should not wear something see-through. Her garments must be concealing, not showing her hair and body except the face; for it is Sunnah to uncover it if there is no Ajnaby present. As for the hands, scholars differed as to the ruling on them, but it is better to cover them. If a woman uncovers them, there is nothing wrong with this. As for the feet, as mentioned above, it is obligatory to cover them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">As for having to make up for the Salah, this is due to having violated one of the conditions of Salah by offering Salah without covering the feet. Therefore, if a woman offers Salah without covering her feet, she has to make up for it. But if she does so out of ignorance of the ruling, may Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) forgive her for what is past and she does not have to make up for the past Salahs.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that: He saw a man offering Salah quickly. He called him and the man came and greeted him. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him, &#8220;Go back and offer Salah, for you have not offered Salah.&#8221; The man went back and offered Salah as he had offered it before, then he came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and greeted him. The Prophet (peace be upon him) returned the greeting and said to him, &#8220;Go back and offer Salah, for you have not offered Salah.&#8221; The man again offered Salah as he had offered it before. When he had done this three times, he said: By the One Who sent you with the Truth as a Prophet, I cannot do any better than this. Please, teach me. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “When you go to offer Salah, perform Wudu&#8217; (ablution) properly, face the Qiblah (Ka`bah-direction faced in Prayer), pronounce Takbir (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;), and then recite whatever you can of the Qur&#8217;an. Then bow until you are at ease in that position, then rise until you are standing erect, then prostrate until you are at ease in your prostration, then raise yourself and sit until you are at ease in sitting. Do this throughout the entire Salah.” (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) The Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered this man to repeat the presently due Salah and did not order him to repeat any past Salah, because the man was ignorant about the ruling. It seemed that the man was accustomed to offering Salah in such a manner; but because he was ignorant about the ruling, the Prophet (peace be upon him) excused him from making up for the past Salahs and merely ordered him to repeat the Salah due at that time. This indicates that whoever is ignorant about a ruling of Salah then becomes informed about it has to only repeat the presently due Salah. As for past Salahs, they are waived because of ignorance. This is what is implied by the Hadith, for the Messenger (peace be upon him) did not order the man who offered Salah incorrectly to repeat his past Salahs due to ignorance and because this entails hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the same way, if a woman is used to offering Salah without covering her feet out of ignorance about the ruling, she does not have to repeat the past Salahs, in sha’a-Allah, according to the correct scholarly opinion. This is because she is excused because of ignorance. Thereafter, she has to abide by covering her feet and the rest of her body when offering Salah. This excludes the face and hands as mentioned above because they are not `Awrah according to scholars. But if she covers her hands to avoid the divergent opinions of scholars, this is good as stated above.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Demonstrating that men and women are on an equal footing with regard to Salah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Is there any difference between men and women with regard to the actions of Salah (Prayer) like raising hands to the ears and putting them over the chest?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The correct opinion maintains that the way in which women perform Salah is the same as that of men, as the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Perform Salah as you see me perform it. and he (peace be upon him) made no exclusions for women. So men and women are equally addressed with the prescribed actions of Salah such as raising the hands, putting them over the chest, putting them on the knees when bowing down, and resting them on the ground opposite the shoulders or ears in Sujud (prostration). Similarly, they both have to recite Al-Fatihah (Opening Chapter of the Qur&#8217;an) and some verses of the Qur&#8217;an in both the first and second Rak`ahs (units of Prayer) of Zhuhr (Noon), `Asr (Afternoon), Maghrib (Sunset), `Isha&#8217; (Night) and Fajr (Dawn) Prayers. Yet, only Al-Fatihah is to be recited in the third Rak`ah of Maghrib Prayer, and the third and fourth of Zhuhr, `Asr and `Isha&#8217; Prayers. So women are on an equal footing with men in this regard.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I heard that there is a woman who deals with Jinn (creatures created from fire). She was told by Jinn that she will be a good mediator between mankind and Jinn in order to treat incurable diseases that physicians failed to treat. The woman is only a mediator, while the Jinn are the ones who will prescribe medicines and perform operations. But people cannot see them. What is the ruling on this regard?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is no basis for what you mentioned and such statements can not be relied upon. The tales of Jinn, very old women and those who serve the Jinn are unauthentic and can not be relied upon. It is not permissible to deem as authentic the sayings of old women, old men, youth or any other person who reports from the Jinn. One should guard himself against using or serving them. This is because if the Jinn use him, they will draw him to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) if they are unbelievers. Moreover, there is no certain way whereby we can distinguish the believer from the unbeliever. They may be hypocrites who deceive Mu&#8217;mins (believers) by these acts. This is because one can not discern their affairs or deal with them openly in order to know their status and morals from authentic sources to distinguish between the reliable and the unreliable ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Briefly, there is great ambiguity and difference in morals and attributes between us and them whereby we can not know their realities. Whoever is a believer among them, we supplicate to Allah (Exalted be He) to grant him success and guidance. But we can not trust or rely upon them in treating patients, counseling with them or any thing else as this leads to claiming to know the Ghayb (the Unseen). Man may be tried by dealing with the Jinn and thinks that he knows the Ghayb through the Jinn. He will be, in this case, like those people about whom Allah (may He Glorified and Exalted) says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘And verily, there were men among mankind who took shelter with the males among the jinn, but they (jinn) increased them (mankind) in sin and transgression&#8217;</strong></span>. Man will be in great danger if he deals with the Jinn. They may lead him to commit Shirk, Bid`ah (innovation in religion) and sins. Thus, man can cause harm to himself or to others unknowingly. Consequently, it is not permissible to deal with them for the sake of curing or any other purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one knows or deals with any one of the Jinn, he has to call him to worship Allah alone, teach him goodness, call him to Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and obedience to Allah (Exalted be He). One should also advise him to teach others goodness and obedience to Allah (Exalted be He). <strong>But man should not trust them or ask them anything for people because they may give him something that brings harm to people</strong>. They may give him something good and then deceive him. Briefly, he who deals with them faces great danger because one cannot certainly discern their affairs because they see you and you cannot see them. They may conceal many things from you. They may also claim to be Muslims while they are hypocrites. They may deal with you in order to achieve certain purposes and then do whatever they desired when their purposes are achieved. If you deal with them, you will be in danger. Therefore, you have to avoid them<b> </b>except for the sake of calling them to Allah (Exalted be He), informing, and guiding them to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: There is a woman called Masasah (sucker) who lives in a village. Men and women used to visit her for treatment especially those who suffer diseases in their abdomens, back or chest. Every one pays her one hundred Riyals. If a man suffers pains in his abdomen, she makes him lie down on his back and sucks his abdomen with her mouth. This means that she puts her mouth on the place of pain and sucks like the process of cupping without using anything. Then, she ejects from her mouth a pebble, vein or anything else. Is it permissible to do this? May Allah reward you well!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It seems that this woman is a sorcerer who deceives people by these acts. People think that she has knowledge and extraordinary abilities that are unknown to physicians as she sucks a man&#8217;s abdomen and then ejects pebbles and the like from her mouth. This woman may use the Jinn in order to trick people by showing them that she brings something out of their abdomens while there is nothing. She only deceives people&#8217;s sight as was done by the sorcerers during the confrontation between Musa (Moses) and Pharaoh. She might also have something in her mouth like pebbles upon visiting the patient. Then, she ejects it when she sucks his abdomen in order to convince people that this thing comes out of his abdomen. We believe that it is not permissible to visit or seek treatment with this woman and others like her. This is because this woman and those like her are sorcerers who deceive people with lies or with using Jinn and things that were prohibited by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) as Shirk and other evil things that she does with patients for the sake of curing them. Briefly, it appears that this woman is a liar and a sorcerers who uses Jinn. Therefore, it is not permissible to visit her or those like her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He who visits a diviner and asks him about anything, his Salahs (Prayers) extending to forty nights will not be accepted</strong></span>. This Hadith was reported by Muslim in his Sahih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was reported in another narration: He who visits a diviner or a fortuneteller and believes him in what he says disbelieves what was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This women and those like her lie and invent things that are baseless. These false things are told by Jinn in order to deceive people and lead them astray without knowing the truth. Allah is the One sought for help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I have a story that I desire to tell you about in order to give me an interpretation or advice about it. My neighbor&#8217;s daughter who is eighteen years old was sick. She had a psychological disorder. Her father brought her to physicians, but they did not achieve any progress. Then, he brought her to diviners and sorcerers who told him that she was touched by Jinn and they would treat her. The girl stayed with them for one day only. Then, she returned home as she had completely recovered from her disease. She now leads a normal and tranquil life with her father. What is the ruling on this regard? May Allah reward you well!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This may be done by Jinn and their supporters. They may cause harm to a woman or a man in order to make him feel sick. Then, if the guardian of the patient visits them and asks them for help, they will help him and remove the causes of diseases they have done. They do this in order to deceive people and lead them to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and glorifying, resorting, seeking help and invoking Jinn and devils. All these acts are from evil acts and the machinations plotted by devils. Therefore, a Muslim should not be deceived by these things. He should not visit, resort or ask those people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: He who visits a diviner and asks him about anything, his Salah (Prayer) extending to forty nights will not be accepted. And: He (peace be upon him) said when he was asked about diviners: &#8220;Do not visit them!&#8221; He said: &#8220;They are nothing.&#8221; And: He who visits a diviner or a fortuneteller and believes him in what he says disbelieves what was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him). And: He is not from us; who performs sorcery or has it performed for him, performs divination or has it performed for him or sees an evil omen or has it seen for him. All these acts, machinations and deception do not give people an excuse to visit them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>People should avoid them and seek cure from these diseases through legal remedies which includes reciting the Qur&#8217;an. Reciting the Qur&#8217;an is a remedy for diseases caused by Jinn and others. A Mu&#8217;min (believer) should recite for the patient and supplicate to Allah (Exalted be He) to grant him cure and recovery. Then, harm will be removed by Allah&#8217;s Will. This remedy was tried by the Imams (initiator of a School of Jurisprudence) and scholars in past and modern ages and was a cause of cure and remedy.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one died because of this disease, it would be his moment of death. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) predestined for him to die because of this disease that they think to be the handwork of sorcerers and Jinn. Therefore, one should not prefer his temporal desire for obtaining a cure at their hands through something that causes harm in his religion and incurs Allah&#8217;s wrath upon him to what pleases Allah (Exalted be He) and brings about His satisfaction. Therefore, one should follow legal instructions and remedies. If he dies, he will die according to his appointed moment of death. This is what should man think and do. He is not permitted to visit sorcerers or diviners out of fear of death. All these acts are great falsehoods, mischief in the earth, defiance of religion and aggression against what is legislated by Allah (Glorified be He). Allah is the One sought for help.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The questioner says that she has a sister who complains about obsessive insinuations, especially while performing ablution. She requests His Eminence Shaikh to guide her to the best way which, by Allah&#8217;s Permission, will relieve her from this anxiety. </span> (Question no. 1, tape no. 247)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Many people, men and women, complain about the obsessive misgivings. The treatment of this disease is to <strong>seek refuge with Allah</strong> (Most Exalted be He) from Satan, because it is one of his manifold wicked insinuations and one of his plots.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well-known that Satan is the open enemy of Allah, about whom He (Most Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, Shaitân </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Satan)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> is an enemy to you, so take </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(treat)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> him as an enemy. He only invites his Hizb </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(followers)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> that they may become the dwellers of the blazing Fire</span></strong>&#8220;. (Surah Fatir, 35: 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Most Exalted and Sublime be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And if an evil whisper from Shaitân (Satan) tries to turn you away (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) (from doing good), then seek refuge in Allâh. Verily, He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower&#8221;. </strong></span>(Surah Fussilat, 41: 36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the treatment of this disease is to seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the outcast, while performing ablution, during prayer and in all other situations. Whenever one feels the evil misgivings, he should seek refuge with Allah from Satan by saying: I seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the outcast, and one should have strong will and sincerity to get rid of these misgivings and should have hope in Allah (Most Exalted and Sublime be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to fight against this enemy, one need <strong>strong will </strong>and <strong>sincerity</strong>, and be sure that no one saves man from Satan except Allah, Who is All-Omnipotent to do all things (Most Exalted be He). Therefore, it is the duty of all Muslims, men and women, to resort to Allah (Most Exalted be He) with sincerity and seek His Help to save them from this enemy whenever they feel these evil misgivings and in all other situations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer should seek help and support from Allah (Most Exalted be He) by saying: <em>O Lord, protect me from Satan and from his insinuations! O Lord, keep me away from his evil! O Allah, save me from his evil temptations and wicked thoughts.</em> One should ask his Lord and seek help from Allah, and Allah (Most Exalted be He) will protect him so long as the servant is sincere in his supplication. Allah (Most Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Call upon Me; I will respond to you</strong></span>. Allah does not break His Promise (Most Exalted and Sublime be He). However, man might not be serious in seeking help from Allah, and thus become heedless and call upon Allah without sincerity. Thus, there has to be sincerity and true desire in seeking the protection of Allah (Most Exalted be He). The person should resort to Allah and wholly submit himself to Him with complete faithfulness and hope in order to gain protection from this open enemy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone performs ablution he <strong>should not repeat</strong> his ablution due to devilish insinuations. Likewise, he should not repeat his prayer because of such insinuations. He should full trust that his ablution and prayer are valid and should not repeat any part of them due to Satan&#8217;s insinuations. For, if he inclines to obey Satan and repeats ablution or the prayer, then the enemy of Allah will prompt him with more evil temptations. Thus, whenever you perform ablution and you are confident that you have fulfilled all its requirements, then do not let doubt creep into your heart. Fear Allah and do not repeat some or all of its acts. Do not respond to the misgivings of Satan. The same should be done with regard to prayer which you should complete with no insinuations as having made mistakes therein. Do the same thing in every similar situation in which you withstand the misgivings of the enemy of Allah and beat him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">What are the Qur&#8217;anic verses that repel witchcraft?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Some scholars mentioned that one of the ways of protection from what may touch a person of witchcraft and Jinn possession or what may turn him away from his wife is to read <strong>Ayat-ul-Kursy</strong> and blowing it into water, and Surahs (Qur&#8217;anic chapters) <strong>Al-Fatihah</strong> (Opening Chapter of the Qur&#8217;an), <strong>Al-Kafirun, Al-Ikhlas</strong> and <strong>Al-Mu`awwidhatayn</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone recites these Surahs and the noble verse of Ayat-ul-Kursy, and the verses relating to witchcraft in <strong>Surah Al-A`raf</strong> and the two <strong>Surahs of Yunus</strong> and <strong>Taha</strong>; this is one of the causes of recovery.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man drinks the water (over which these Surahs and verses are recited) and washes up with it, it will protect him witchcraft and free him from anything that makes him dislike and keep away from his wife.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verses of <strong>Surah Al-A`raf </strong>(7: 117-119)<strong> </strong> are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And We revealed to Mûsâ (Moses) (saying): &#8220;Throw your stick,&#8221; and behold! It swallowed up straight away all the falsehoods which they showed. Thus truth was confirmed, and all that they did was made of no effect. So they were defeated there and returned disgraced.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses from Surah Al-A`raf are one ofthe causes of healing, by reciting them over water or blowing them into the sick person together with Surahs Al-Fatihah, Al-Kafirun, Al-Ikhlas, Mu`awwidhatayn as well as Ayat-ul-Kursy. One can either breath them over the patient or recite them over water and then have them drink it and wash up with the rest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In <strong>Surah Yunus</strong> (verses 79-82), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) said: &#8220;Bring me every well-versed sorcerer.&#8221; And when the sorcerers came, Mûsâ (Moses) said to them: &#8220;Cast down what you want to cast!&#8221; Then when they had cast down, Mûsâ (Moses) said: &#8220;What you have brought is sorcery; Allâh will surely make it of no effect. Verily, Allâh does not set right the work of Al-Mufsidûn (the evil-doers, corrupters). &#8220;And Allâh will establish and make apparent the truth by His Words, however much the Mujrimûn (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners) may hate it.&#8221; </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that one may either recite them over patients or recite them over water and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verses of <strong>Surah Taha</strong> are verses 65-69:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>They said: &#8220;O Mûsâ (Moses)! Either you throw first or we be the first to throw?&#8221; [Mûsâ (Moses)] said: &#8220;Nay, throw you (first)!&#8221; Then behold! their ropes and their sticks, by their magic, appeared to him as though they moved fast. So Mûsâ (Moses) conceived fear in himself. We (Allâh) said: &#8220;Fear not! Surely, you will have the upper hand. &#8220;And throw that which is in your right hand! It will swallow up that which they have made. That which they have made is only a magician’s trick, and the magician will never be successful, to whatever amount (of skill) he may attain.&#8221;</em></span></p>

Fatwas of Nur `Ala Al-Darb&gt;Volume 3&gt;A chapter on issues related to witchcraft&gt;<a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/fatawaDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=357&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Legal Wirds and supplications for seeking refuge in Allah are causes of protection from witchcraft</a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: A questioner asks: Nowadays people talk a lot about witchcraft, may Allah protect you and us from it! What is the right protection of Qur&#8217;an and <em>Sunnah</em> (acts, sayings or approvals of the Prophet) from it? May Allah reward you with the best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Witchcraft is practiced and it is well-known. There is no doubt that some people may bring it about. A witchcraft practitioner is a <em>Mushrik</em> (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) that must be referred to authorities for possible capital punishment if he is found guilty. We ask Allah for protection and well-being.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) ordered his governors to execute practitioners of witchcraft. The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The prescribed penalty for a witchcraft practitioner is to be struck with the sword.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>[Related by Al-Tirmidhy, Book on ordained punishments, Chapter on the ordained punishment for a magician, no. 1460]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because he is a disbeliever calling to <em>Kufr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for protection, it is to &#8220;<em>seek refuge in the perfect words of Allah from the evil of what He created</em>&#8221; three times in the morning and three times in the evening, and saying: &#8220;<em>In the name of Allah with whose Name nothing is harmful on Earth nor in the Heavens and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing</em>&#8221; three times in the morning and three times in the evening. These supplications are reported in Hadiths. Whoever does so will be protected by Allah from the evil of all things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reciting Surahs Al-Ikhlas and Al-Mu`awwidhatayn three times in the morning and three times in the evening are a cause of protection from witchcraft and any other harm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ayat-ul-Kursy can also be recited three times upon going to bed, and this is a cause of protection from witchcraft and Satan. It can also be recited following each <em>Salah</em> (Prayer). All these bring protection and safety. We ask Allah for protection and well-being.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Actions and Attributes of Allah are Eternal (Qadimah)</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: A person from Chad asks: Are the actions of Allah Qadimah (eternal) or Hadithah (adaptable) or both? And if both, how is this so? May Allah reward you with the best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Basically, the actions (or Attributes describing the Actions) of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) are <strong>Qadimah</strong>;<strong><span style="color:#666699;"> He ever has always had His Attributes even before creating anything</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has been, is and will always be the Creator. At all times He is the One able to do all that He wills. He does what He wills at the time He wills. But His Actions come to pass in relation to the conditions of His Creation. To illustrate this, Allah created Adam from nothingness. Likewise, He created the Angels, heavens, the earth, and everything else. Thus, we know that Allah is the Creator at all times, but He &#8220;creates&#8221; when He wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example, Allah was pleased with the believers of the past and He will be so with those of the future; Allah was angry with the disbelievers among the people of the past and he will be so with the disbelievers that will come. Thus, the basic characteristics of Allah&#8217;s Action and Attributes are Qadimah.</p>
<p>The Attributes of Allah may be divided into two main categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first category is <strong>Sifat Dhatiyah (Allah&#8217;s Intrinsic and Essential Attributes)</strong>, such as knowledge, hearing, sight, etc. These are the Attributes which do not cease to exist nor will ever cease to be descriptive of Him [Note: There is no similarity between Allah&#8217;s Attributes and that of His Creatures]. Thus, Allah (Glorified be He) has been and will always be described as the All-Hearer, the All-Seer, the All-Knower, the All-Powerful, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second category is <strong>Sifat Fi`liyah</strong>, and these are the Attributes, which describe the actions of Allah and are connected to His Mashi&#8217;ah (Will) in relation to the variable nature of His Creation. For instance, Allah (Glorified be He) created the heavens and the earth, Adam, Paradise, and Hellfire, etc., after they were all nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The creation of all of them is subject to time, that is, it happens at an appropriate time. This does not deny the fact that Allah (Glorified be He) is the &#8216;Khaliq&#8217; (Creator of all things), the Omnipotent over all things, etc. These Attributes are originally intrinsic of Allah, but Allah does whatever He wills at the time He wills. In the Qur&#8217;an, Allah (Exalted be He) says about Himself: <span style="color:#993300;">[Verily, (O Muhammad Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam)) the Seizure (punishment) of your Lord is severe and painful. [See V.11:102]. Verily, He it is Who begins (punishment) and repeats (punishment in the Hereafter) (or originates the creation of everything, and then repeats it on the Day of Resurrection). And He is Oft-Forgiving, full of love (towards the pious who are real true believers of Islâmic Monotheism), Owner of the throne, the Glorious, (He is the) Doer of whatsoever He intends (or wills</span>)]. Also, He (Glorified be He) says about Himself: <span style="color:#993300;">Verily, Allâh does what He wills</span>. Thus, Allah (Glorified be He) does what He wills, in the past and in the future. Allah is the Creator of all things at all times; He created and He is still creating, etc. He (Glorified be He) is the All-Powerful, the All-Knower, the Ever-Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists, the All-Hearer, the All-Seer,&#8230;etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Merit of memorizing the Magnificent Names of Allah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Allah has ninety-nine names; anyone who memorizes them will enter Jannah (Paradise). Does this mean that anyone who memorizes the Names of Allah will enter Jannah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is one of the Hadiths that promise Jannah and speaks of virtues and good deeds. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Allah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one. Anyone who learns them will enter Jannah. According to another narration: Anyone who memorizes them will enter Jannah. (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith urges us to consider carefully, ponder over, memorize and learn the Names of Allah, so that we can benefit from their great meanings, gain Khushu` (the heart being submissively attuned to the act of worship), obey Allah and fulfill our duty towards Him(Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who memorizes the Names of Allah, fulfills their duties towards Him, and shuns the major sins will be admitted to Jannah while those who commit major sins subject themselves to Allah&#8217;s Wrath and their fate is left to His Will: He may punish them or admit them to Jannah. Memorizing and learning the Names of Allah is one means to enter Jannah if a person does not commit major sins. Attaining Jannah has certain conditions that must be fulfilled and certain obstacles that must be avoided. Committing sins is one of the obstacles which prevent one from entering Jannah with those who will enter first. A Muslim who commits sins and does not repent before death will eventually enter Jannah after being punished and purified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah may forgive and admit them to Jannah without punishment. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The Fve (Obligatory Daily) Prayers, from one Jumu’ah (Friday Prayer) to the next and from one Ramadan to the next are expiation for (sins committed) in between, as long as major sins have been avoided. Major sins include those prohibited acts for which a warning of severe punishment is given. These include all those which incur Allah&#8217;s Wrath, and are cursed by our Prophet (peace be upon him) such as Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage), consuming Khamr (intoxicant), undutifulness to parents, involvement in Riba (usury/interest), Ghibah (backbiting), Namimah (tale-bearing), etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some major sins whose committers will be left to Allah&#8217;s Will: He may forgive and admit them to Jannah due to their belief in His Oneness and their Islam or punish them in a manner commensurate with their sins and eventually bring them out of the Fire and into Jannah after purifying them of their sins. There are various Hadiths Mutawatir (Hadiths reported by a significant number of narrators throughout the chain of narration, whose agreement upon a lie is impossible) reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that indicate that many disobedient Muslimswill enter the Fire because of their sins and will be punished in a manner commensurate with these sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards, the disobedient will be taken out of the Fire due to the Shafa`ah (intercession) of the Prophet (peace be upon him), angels, other prophets, and the children who died before they reached the age of puberty while others will be granted forgiveness due to Allah&#8217;s Mercy. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those disobedient Muslims are subject to Allah&#8217;s Will: He may forgive them and admit them to Jannah, or punish them in a manner commensurate with their sins and then take them out of the Fire as they will not stay therein forever. None will abide eternally in the Fire except the Kafir (disbeliever) and Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) who will not be forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, disobedient Muslims will not remain eternally in the Fire, according to Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) unlike the Khawarij (separatist group that believes committing a major sin amounts to disbelief) and Mu`tazilah (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that those who commit major sins are in a state between belief and disbelief) who believe that the disobedient will stay eternally in the Fire. However, Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah hold the view that the disobedient who have died as Muslims believing in the Oneness of Allah, but have not repented of their sins shall be subject to Allah&#8217;s Will. May Allah grant us all success!</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Will the one who memorize the Magnificent Names of Allah be admitted to Jannah (Paradise)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is reported in a Hadith Sahih (authentic Hadith) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Allah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one. Anyone who learns them will enter Jannah. According to another narration: Anyone who memorizes them will enter Jannah. These ninety-nine Names were not reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in any Hadith Sahih. However, the Muslim who is guided to learning them, by heart and put into action &#8211; and they are ninety-nine Names, is promised that goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above is one of the Hadiths which speak of the virtues of memorizing the ninety-nine Names of Allah, provided that one does not die while insisting on committing major sins because they are one of the causes that deprive a person from entering Jannah and cause him to be thrown into the Fire, unless one attains Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basic principle is that unrestricted Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and Hadiths should be interpreted in light of restricted ones, because neither the Ayah nor the Hadith contradicts each other. They rather confirm one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise). Therefore, Allah indicates that avoiding major sins is a condition for expiating sins and entering Jannah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, The Five (Obligatory Daily) Prayers, from one Jumu’ah (Friday Prayer) to the next and from one Ramadan to the next are expiation for (sins committed) in between, as long as major sins have been avoided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who memorize the ninety-nine Magnificent Names of Allah but commit Zina or consume Khamr are subject to Allah&#8217;s punishment and will be thrown into the Fire unless they repent and Allah forgives them.Contrary to the belief of Khawarij and Mu`tazilah, Muslims who believe in the Oneness of Allah will not abide eternally in the Fire for committing major sins. Those sinful people will be punished in a manner commensurate with their sins and then Allah will take them out of the Fire due to His Grace and Kindness. None will abide forever in the Fire except those whom the Qur&#8217;an and the Hadith rule as Kafir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A disobedient person such as a fornicator, a thief, and those who are undutiful to their parents etc., will not abide eternally in the Fire. The disobedient, who did not repent of their sins before death, will not abide in the Fire forever. They are threatened to suffer the torment of the Fire. If Allah forgives them, He (Glorified and Exalted be He) is the Source of Generosity and Benevolence; otherwise He will punish them to a degree commensurate with their sins and will eventually take them out of the Fire after being purified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) informed us in many concurrent Hadiths that the disobedient will be taken out of the Fire and he (peace be upon him) will intercede several times for them as will the angels, the believers, and the children who died before reaching the age of puberty. This is the truth which Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah follow and which differs from the view of Khawarij and Mu`tazilah. The view of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is supported by Allah&#8217;s statement in His Noble Book: Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states that if one commits sins, the matter is subject to His Will but He will not forgive whoever dies as a Mushrik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who dies as Mushrik will not be forgiven and will reside eternally in the Fire. A Mushrik is not considered to be one of Ahl-ul-Fatrah (people having no access to Divine Messages) or those who come under the same ruling as them, we seek refuge with Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever dies before repenting of their sins shall be subject to Allah&#8217;s Will; if He wills, He can pardon themout of His Grace, and if He wills He can punish them in a manner commensurate with their sins and then take them out of the Fire by His immense Bounty and Mercy after they have been purified. Khawarij and Mu`tazilah hold a different view, as they believe that the disobedient will remain eternally in the Fire but according to the followers of the Truth, this is false.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Your Eminence, it was reported on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: Allah has ninety-nine Names, one hundred less one. Anyone who &#8216;ahsaha&#8217; will enter Jannah. Does the word &#8216;ahsaha&#8217; mentioned in the Hadith mean memorizing or just reading them? Please advise me, may Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This Hadith was related in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the Prophet (peace be upon him). It was reported in two different wordings: first, &#8220;ahsaha&#8221; and second, anyone who memorizes them, will enter Jannah. The word &#8216;ahsaha&#8217; means to memorize by heart and to act according to them. Thus, whoever learns the Names of Allah by heart and acts accordingly will be admitted to Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if one memorizes the Names of Allah by heart, but does not act or believe in them, they will be of no avail. The word &#8216;ahsaha&#8217; means to memorize and act upon them. Therefore, it is Wajib upon whoever memorizes Allah&#8217;s Names to act accordingly. For example, a person should be &#8216;Rahim&#8217;, i.e. show mercy to others and should also believe that Allah is Al-`Aziz (the Ever-Mighty), Al-Hakim (the Most Wise), Al-Ra&#8217;uf (the Most Compassionate), Al-Rahim (the Most Beneficent), Al-Qadir (the All Powerful) Who has unlimited knowledge of all things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such a person should fear Allah and remember that He is watching them and should not persist in committing sins of which HisLord knows. They should avoid sins and all forms of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should exert all his efforts to memorize and act upon the Names of Allah, believe in Him and His Messenger, affirm the Names and the Attributes which Allah has affirmed for Himself in a manner befitting His majesty without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), Ta`til (negation of the meaning or function of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), Takyif (descriptive designation of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), or Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation) and believe that Allah is Perfect in His Essence, His Names, His Attributes and His Deeds, with no peer, equal or rival. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says in His Noble Book: Say (O Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam): &#8220;He is Allâh, (the) One. &#8220;Allâh-us-Samad  [Allâh the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither eats nor drinks)]. &#8220;He begets not, nor was He begotten. &#8220;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&#8221; .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One must believe that Allah is the Self-Sufficient, Who is similar to nothing and nothing is comparable to Him; Whom all creatures need, Who is Perfect in His Essence, Who neither begets nor was He begotten, and Whom none is co-equal or is similar to Him. Allah (Exalted be He) says: There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. And: Do you know of any who is similar to Him? And: So put not forward similitudes for Allâh (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor He resembles anything).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing equal, comparable, or that can rival Allah (Exalted be He). He is Perfect in all things; His Knowledge, His Essence, His Wisdom, His Mercy, His Honor, His Power, and in all His Names which if one memorizes and acts accordingly, will allow them admission to Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if the disobedient memorize and enumerate the Names of Allah, they will be subject to Allah&#8217;s Will; if He wills, He may forgive them, and if He wills He may punish them and eventually admit them to Jannah after they are taken out of the Fire and are purified provided that they have died as Muslims believing in the Oneness of Allah. Allah (Glorified be He) says: If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Major sins include all forms of Shirk, Kufr (disbelief), and the sins that were forbidden by Allah and their doers cursed, and warned of a severe punishment and Allah&#8217;s Wrath. The servant to Allah, male and female, must shun them for Allah (Glorified be He) says: If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins i.e., the minor sins and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The Five (Obligatory Daily) Prayers, from one Jumu’ah (Friday Prayer) to the next and from one Ramadan to the next are expiation for (sins committed) in between, as long as major sins have been avoided. According to another narration: &#8230;so long as major sins are not committed. Major sins include Zina, theft, undutifulness to parents, severing the ties of kinship, consuming Riba, Ghibah, Namimah, fleeing during battle, and magic, in addition to other sins which Allah forbids.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, memorizing the Magnificent Names of Allah is one means of true happiness and being admitted into Jannah provided that one acts according to them, remains steadfast in obeying Allah and His Messenger, and does not persist in committing major sins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Does mere pronouncement of Shahadah (Testimony of Faith) suffice for a person to be rightfully called a Muslim, or does one have to do other things in order for their Islam and Iman (faith) to be complete?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is enough for a non-Muslim to pronounce the first pillar of Islam, that is, to bear witness that La ilaha illa Allah (there is no deity but Allah) and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah to be rightfully called a Muslim provided that this testimony is pronounced out of one’s certainty, knowledge, true belief, and sincere work. A person will then be asked to perform Salah (Prayer) and observe other acts of `Ibadah (worship).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him) to Yemen, he said: Invite them to bear witness that La ilaha illa Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they do that, then inform them that Allah has made it obligatory upon them to offer the Five Obligatory Daily Prayers. If they obey, then inform them that Allah has made it obligatory upon them to pay Zakah (obligatory charity) which is taken from the rich among them and distributed among the poor. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not ask Mu`adh to command them to offer Salah until their Tawhid (monotheism) and Iman in the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) were firmly established. First of all, they are required to declare the Oneness of Allah and believe in Muhammad as the Messenger of Allah. Once they embrace Islam, the former Kafir (disbeliever) will hold the same rulings applied to Muslims. Then they will be required to offer Salah and perform all other religious acts. If they refrain from performing these acts, other rulings will be applicable to them.For example, if they abstain from offering Salah, they are given the chance to offer Tawbah (repentance). Otherwise, the Muslim ruler may punish him by capital punishment. If they arrogantly refuse to pay or and fight for that, they will also be fought. This is based on the fact that the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) fought those who denied Zakah. If they deny Sawm (fast), the Imam (ruler) may inflict Ta`zir (discretionary punishment) on them in a way that serves as a deterrent for them. The same applies to abstention of performing Hajj in case a person is financially and physically capable of performing it. This ruling is applicable to all sins which are liable to Ta`zir or Had (ordained punishment for violating Allah&#8217;s Law).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In conclusion, a person will be considered as having embraced Islam once they declare Shahadah whereby they will be treated as Muslims. If they die soon after declaring Shahadah, they will dwell in Jannah (Paradise). For example, if they embrace Islam after sunrise and die before they can offer the Zhuhr (Noon) Prayer, they will be regarded as Muslims though they have not performed any Salah. This was the case with some of the Sahabah who were killed on the battlefield soon after they embraced Islam. They belong to the dwellers of Jannah, even though they did nothing except having declared Allah&#8217;s Oneness and believed in the Messenger of Allah. However, if they live until the time of Salah is due, they will be commanded to offer it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If they amass wealth which reaches Nisab (the minimum amount on which Zakah is due), they will be commanded to pay Zakah. They will also be required to observe Sawm if they witness the month of Ramadan. They will also be obliged to perform Hajj if they have the means.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In general, they will hold the same rulings applied to Muslims whether those related to this life or the Hereafter. They will be obliged to fulfill all the duties of Islam. However, if they die before the time of Salah has become due, they will be regarded as Muslims and shall be consigned to Jannah. In case of their persistent refusal to offer Salah, they will be treated as Kafirs. This is the view held by a large number of scholars. Other scholars hold that theywill be considered as having committed minor Kufr (disbelief that is not tantamount to taking the Muslim out of Islam). Although they will have to be put to death, they will not be considered as having committed major Shirk (disbelief that takes the Muslim out of Islam). The same applies to abandoning Zakah or Sawm. The correct opinion is that whenever a person abandons Salah intentionally, they are regarded as having denied its obligatory status. Accordingly, they will be executed according to the correct view maintained by scholars. The majority of Fuqaha&#8217; (Muslim jurists) hold the view that they will be considered disobedient Muslims. This is the view held by the majority of later Fuqaha&#8217;. However, `Abdullah ibn Shaqiq Al-`Aqily reported that the Companions were unanimous on the fact that whoever abandons Salah will be considered as having committed Kufr.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Is it necessary for new converts to Islam to change their names? Should an adult convert be circumcised?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is permissible for new Muslims to change their names if they carry wrong or bad meanings, as this is a sign of conversion to Islam. If one asks the reason for a convert having changed their name, in most cases, their names before converting to Islam were not suitable, thus they felt it necessary to change them to Islamic names such as Saleh, Ahmad, `Abdullah, `Abdul-Rahman, Muhammad, etc. Names which suggest slavery to other than Allah such as `Abdul- Messiah, `Abdul-Zahra, or `Abd-Musa must be changed to `Abdullah, `Abdul-Rahman and the like, as servitude is to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Alone. Therefore, it is best to change names which express servitude to other than Allah and which are familiar and used by the Kuffar (disbelievers) to Islamic names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is better for new Muslims to get circumcised by highly-skilled, experienced doctors, even when accepting Islam as adults. A group of scholars hold that it is Wajib (obligatory) upon new converts be circumcised unless there is fear of harm. If a doctor feels that circumcision may harm them, it is waived in this case. However, if a doctor know that it will not cause them any harm, they should be circumcised.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Circumcision is a stressed Sunnah and Wajib according to a group of scholars. Therefore, if it is feasible for an adult to be circumcised without suffering any harm, it is better and safer to undergo such procedure, otherwise they do not have to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If getting circumcised will drive a person away from Islam, it should not be mentioned to them. It can also be abandoned, for embracing Islam is a great bounty even without being circumcised. Therefore, a new convert need not be informed of this if it will turn them away from Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a new convert becomes steadfast in Islam, they should be circumcised, if it would not pose any risk to their health; otherwise they should not undergo this procedure.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some people hasten to explain some matters to new Muslims, some of these matters may be minor details, for example, wearing the complete Hijab (veil) for women and growing a beard for men and circumcision and other such matters. Can you comment on this subject?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: These are minor details, if they are clarified at the beginning, there is nothing wrong with that, and if they are delayed to a later time, there is also nothing wrong with that. The most important thing is to explain the basics of the religion so that the person can enter Islam. As for subsidiary matters like shaving the beard or shortening it, or wearing Hijab, or circumcision and the like, these should better be delayed to a later time so that the person is not repelled or discouraged and just to teach them the foundations of Islam first and its great pillars. After they embrace Islam, they can be encouraged to perform the rest of the practices of Islam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Q: Someone from Al-Sharqiyyah governorate, the Arab Republic of Egypt, asks: If a man touches his private parts or the private parts of one of his children, or if the mother touches the private parts of one of her children, must they renew their Wudu&#8217; (ablution)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Yes, if a man touches the private parts without a barrier; namely, the skin of the hand touches the skin of the private part, penis or anus, his ablution will be nullified. Similarly, if a woman touches her private parts or the private parts of her children, her ablution will be nullified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: He who touches his penis should perform ablution. He (peace be upon him) also stated: He who touches his private parts without a barrier should perform ablution.</p>
<p>Therefore, if someone touches their private parts without a barrier, their ablution will be nullified. But if they do this over a barrier of clothing, loincloth or pants, there is nothing wrong with this and their Wudu&#8217; remains valid. What invalidates Wudu&#8217; is the bare hand touching the skin of the private parts without a barrier between them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fatwas of Nur `Ala Al-Darb</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: There are some people who have a house. They were in prosperity. Then, adversities inflicted them in this house until they were pessimistic and sold it. Some of the events that inflicted them in this house were temptations and suicide of some of the family members. Is this a kind of pessimism? Guide people to the truth! May Allah reward you well!</span></p>
<p>A: This is not a kind of forbidden pessimism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Pessimism is in three things; house, beast of burden and a woman. <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Evil omens may be of these three things. It was mentioned in another narration: &#8220;If there is an evil omen, it will be in three things;&#8221;</span> Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) mentioned the previous.It may happen that a woman may bring evil to her husband. If it appears what denotes evil omens in her morals, behavior or the sequence of calamities that inflict her husband as loss and depression of his commerce, destruction of his farm and the like, it will be permissible for him to divorce her. Similarly, if evil events come successively as bad circumstances or diseases for him and his children and family in this house, it will be permissible for him to move to another one because of the authentic Hadith mentioned in this regard. The same ruling is applied also to the beast of burden, such as camels, horses and the like. If he finds no benefit in a beast of burden and evil events come repeatedly because of it, there will be nothing wrong to sell it and exchange it with another one according to the text of the Hadith reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>

<p>References added for the clarity:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Bukhaari (5093) and Muslim (2252) narrated from ‘Abd-Allaah ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “Bad omens are in a woman, a house and a horse.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Bukhaari (5094) and Muslim, (2252) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar said: Mention of bad omens was made in the presence of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “If bad omens are to be found in anything, it is in a house, a woman and a horse.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Abu Dawood (3924) narrated that Anas ibn Maalik said: A man said: “O Messenger of Allaah, we were in a house and our numbers and wealth were great, then we moved to another house where our numbers and wealth decreased.” The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, “Leave it, it is bad.” This hadeeth was classed as hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.<span style="color:#808000;"><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:x-small;"><br />

<p><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the difference between Tawassul and Wasilah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Tawassul (supplicating to Allah in the name of …/by virtue of the status of…) is the supplications recited by a person. It is a kind of supplication. One can say, &#8220;I invoke You by Your Names.&#8221; This is a sort of Tawassul. Also, one may say, &#8220;I invoke You by my faith in You.&#8221; This is also a way of Tawassul. Here the Wasilah (the means of approach to Allah) is faith, piety and Allah&#8217;s Most Beautiful Names. You are the person practicing Tawassul. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Tawassul itself is your supplications.  Wasilah refers to the words used in your supplications</strong></span>. When you say, &#8220;O Allah! I invoke You by Your Most Beautiful Names and Sublime Attributes to forgive me,&#8221; you are the person practicing Tawassul through this supplication. The Wasilah or the means of approach to Allah here is His Names and Attributes. Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes are called Wasilah. This means that supplicating to Allah by His Names and Attributes is a sort of Wasilah. The wording of supplication is called Tawassul. It is a sort of supplicating to Allah by faith, by Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes, or by one&#8217;s good deeds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source: <a href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=213&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">alifta.net</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: My question is about celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em> (the Prophet&#8217;s birthday). In our locality there is a custom that after three days of a person&#8217;s death, the family of the deceased holds a celebration of the birthday of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Some people hold it one month or one year after a person&#8217;s death. They slaughter a cow or buy meat, prepare food and distribute it to the people of the village; afterwards, they hold a celebration of the birthday of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Is this permissible? Is it recommended to do this? Was it practiced by the <em>Sahabah</em> (Companions of the Prophet) or by anyone from the Salaf (righteous predecessors)? Please explain this issue, may Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Celebrating the birthday of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is one of the Bid`ahs (innovations in religion) introduced into Islam. There is no difference between celebrating the birthday of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and other&#8217;s birthdays. The Prophet (peace be upon him) is the best of creatures and he is the teacher and adviser, yet he (peace be upon him) did not celebrate his birth. Similarly, his Rightly-Guided Caliphs did not celebrate his birthday, and the rest of Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them all) who were the most knowledgeable, loved the Prophet (peace be upon him) more than anyone of us, and were the most well-informed of his Sunnah did not celebrate it. This indicates that this celebration is Bid`ah and all kinds of Bid`ah are deviation from the right way as stated by the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him): Every Bid‘ah is a Dalalah (deviation). The earliest and best three centuries of Islam passed and there was no celebration of the birthday of the Prophet (peace be upon him) during these times and, as far as we know, the Salaf did not celebrate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="more-1952"></span>Therefore, it is Bid`ah introduced by those who came after the best centuries in virtue and righteousness. It is said that the first to introduce this Bid`ah were the rulers of Egypt from Al-&#8216;Ubaydiyyun, who were Shiites, as reported by a group of historians. They introduced it during the fourth century after Hijrah. It is said that they are the first who held these celebrations. In any case, it is a newly-introduced matter in Islam having no basis which some people from past centuries and in our age thought it to be recommended and there is nothing wrong in celebrating it, because it is a good Bid`ah. This is not only an incorrect opinion, but it goes against the Messenger (peace be upon him) as well. It is also in contradiction with the way of the Sahabah who were the most knowledgeable and the best people; however, they did not hold these celebrations. Therefore, it is a duty upon Muslims to reject this act. The biography of the Prophet (peace be upon him) can be studied in educational circles and daily and weekly lessons in which people can learn about the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) and know his words and deeds. They can also learn the Islamic rulings brought by the Prophet (peace be upon him). This is what should be taught in school classes, in the educational circles in the Masjids (mosques) and in admonitions and reminders from which people learn the Sunnah and the biography of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and reject the celebration of the Mawlid and what takes place there. All these acts are possible and they are sufficient for Muslims and meet their needs. As for holding such birthday celebrations and preparing banquets, there is no basis for doing this. It is a newly-invented Bid`ah and every Bid`ah introduced in Islam is misguidance. It is not proper for any person of sound mind to be tricked by these people, because their actions are baseless and most of these people do not have insight into Islamic issues. The Almighty states: And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly. Therefore, the decisive criterion is the evidence and proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected</strong></span>. He (peace be upon him) also stated: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected</span></strong>. Also, the manners of the Prophet (peace be upon him), his biography, his birth and his Hijrah (the Prophet&#8217;s migration to Madinah) are all taught by scholars at schools, in educational circles, in admonitions and reminders without any need to hold such celebrations invented by <em>Mubtadi`s</em> (those who introduce innovations in religion). Acts of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and excessive praising of the Prophet (peace be upon him) take place at some of these celebrations, and different forms of wrongdoing known only by Allah. Therefore, we need to shut this door and be satisfied with the Islamic lessons in the Masjids, in the educational circles, in reminders and admonitions related to important religious affairs and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and its rulings. This is the truth, and what people do nowadays and in the past of celebrating the birthday of the Messenger (peace be upon him) or the birthdays of Al-Badawy, Shaykh `Abdul-Qadir or any other person are all innovations having no basis. It is obligatory to reject all these newly-introduced matters in compliance with the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected. And: E<strong>very Bid‘ah is a Dalalah (deviation).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em> (the Prophet&#8217;s birthday)? What is the ruling regarding those who attend it? Will those who celebrate it be punished if they die upon this practice?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is nothing in Shari`ah (Islamic law) which permits the celebration of birthdays, whether that of the Prophet (peace be upon him) or any other. What we know from the study of purified Shari`ah and from what has been established and confirmed by the verifiers from the people of knowledge is that such birthday celebrations are, undoubtedly, Bid`ah (innovation in religion). The Messenger (peace be upon him), who was the sincerest adviser, the most knowledgeable of Allah&#8217;s Law, who delivered Allah&#8217;s Message, did not celebrate his birthday or the birthday of any other person. By the same token, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>none of his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), his Rightly-Guided Caliphs or other followers celebrated his birthday</strong></span>. If such celebrations were correct, good or recommended, they would not have been neglected by the Prophet (peace be upon him) or by his Sahabah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) would not have disregarded it; rather, he would have taught his followers and would have done it himself. His Sahabah after him would have practiced this along with his Rightly-Guided Caliphs (may Allah be pleased with them all). The Sahabah not having held such gatherings gives us certainty that such celebrations are not part of Shari`ah. Furthermore, during the best centuries of Islam such celebrations were not conducted, and therefore, it becomes clear that they are Bid`ah. He (peace be upon him) stated: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected</span></strong>. And: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected</strong></span>. There are other Hadiths referring to this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, it is known that such celebrations of the Prophet&#8217;s birthday during the month of Rabi` Awwal or other days, as well as others birth celebrations of Al-Badawy, Al-Husayn and others are all condemned Bid`ahs which Muslims must reject because Allah has instead gifted us with two great annual celebrations: `Eid-ul-Fitr (the Festival of Breaking the Fast) and `Eid-ul-Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice). These two festivals are sufficient for Muslims and protect them from inventing new festivals and rejected celebrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Love of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is not achieved by holding such birthday celebrations, but his love requires following him, acting according to the rules of his legislation, defending it, inviting others to it and being steadfast on it. This is the love of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) states: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad peace be upon him to mankind): &#8220;If you (really) love Allâh then follow me (i.e. accept Islâmic Monotheism, follow the Qur’ân and the Sunnah), Allâh will love you and forgive you your sins</span></strong>. Thus, the love of Allah and His Messenger is not expressed through birthday celebrations or Bid`ahs, but by obedience to Allah and His Messenger, being upright in Allah&#8217;s Legislation and striving in the Cause of Allah by inviting to the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him), raising it to the highest position, defending it and denying the actions of those who go against it. This is the way of expressing love of the Messenger (peace be upon him). It is also achieved by following his example in words and deeds, and following his path and inviting others to it. This is the true love proved by adherence to Islamic ethics and acting in accordance with Allah&#8217;s Legislation (may He be Glorified and Exalted).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the punishment of those holding these celebrations, it is a different issue because it is up to Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted). Bid`ahs and sins are among the reasons for being punished; however, Muslims may deserve punishment for their sins and Allah may forgive them, perhaps because of their ignorance of the ruling regarding these celebrations or because they just imitated those who think it is the right thing to do; or because of righteous actions and good deeds they forwarded for themselves and become a reason for obtaining Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness; or because of the Shafa`ah (intercession) of the Prophets, the believers, or children who died at an early age. The point is that sins and Bid`ahs are reasons for punishment and the perpetrator is subject to Allah&#8217;s Will (may He be Glorified and Exalted). This applies if the Bid`ah committed does not tantamount to <em>Kufr</em> (disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Bid`ah introduced into religion leads to <em>Kufr</em>, such as those involving major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), then the perpetrator will abide in Hellfire forever, we seek the refuge with Allah from this! On the other hand, if the Bid`ah does not involve major Shirk, but it is related to subsidiary matters that contradict Shari`ah (Islamic law) such as innovated <em>Salahs</em> (Prayers) or celebrations which do not include or lead to Shirk, then the perpetrator will be subject to Allah&#8217;s Will the same as all sins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Fatwas of Nur `Ala Al-Darb&gt;Volume 1&gt;Chapter on `Aqidah&gt;Chapter on Tawhid-related topics&gt;Claiming that humans evolved from apes is a false claim</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I have read a lot about the theory that humans evolved from an apelike ancestor. The theory proposes that humans went through several stages until they developed into the modern man. Is this true? Are the organs of apes similar to those of humans? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This statement is false, unacceptable, and contradictory to the Book of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) as well as the Ijma` (consensus) of the Salaf (righteous predecessors). This theory which was introduced by Darwin is proven to be a lie, for modern humans originated from a human ancestry, not from an ape or anything else. Allah created our father Adam (peace be upon him) from clay.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states, And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth). Allah created Adam from clay and molded him in His Image. Adam was sixty cubits tall, but people have been decreasing in stature since then. He was created in the form and shape of today humans. His children were created in his image; they have ears, eyes, minds, and the same shape of today human. They stand upright, they speak, hear and see, and they can use their hands. They do not have the form of apes and do not share apes the same organs. Human beings are of a special origin as are apes, pigs, dogs, donkeys, cats, etc. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states, There is not a moving (living) creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered. These communities will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection to have the scores among them settled and it will be said to them, &#8216;Be dust.&#8217; On the other hand, Jinn and mankind will be called to account and will be rewarded according to their deeds; whoever obeys Allah will enter Jannah (Paradise) and whoever disbelieves in Him will enter the Hellfire. These communities are distinct species; apes are a species that have their own nature, form, and characteristics, and so are the pigs, dogs, donkeys, camels, cows, sheep, etc. Each of these species has its own shape and characteristics which Allah (Exalted be He) molded. He is the All-Wise and All-Knowing of the minute details and formation of each species.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A servant of Allah must believe that the creation of Adam differs from the creation of apes and the form of Adam is the same as that of today&#8217;s man and not as apes or anything else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The claim that man descended from an apelike ancestor is false and unacceptable. Therefore, <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>it is correct to assume that anyone who espouses this theory is a Kafir (disbeliever). The most correct view is that whoever believes this theory while knowing the ruling of Shari`ah in this regard is a Kafir</strong></span> and such a person then belie Allah, His Messenger and the Qur&#8217;an which gives a clear description of the creation of Adam .</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on reading the Bible?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Divine Books revealed before the Qur&#8217;an now include many distortions, alterations, and omissions, as Allah says in the Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is not permissible for Muslims to read any of these Books, unless they have deep-rooted knowledge of the Din (religion) and want to explain the distortions and inconsistencies in these books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

`Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz ,`Abdul-Razzaq `Afify , `Abdullah ibn Ghudayyan , `Abdullah ibn Qa`ud</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on a Muslim who reads the Bible or swears by it?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for a Muslim to read the Bible as it has almost entirely undergone interpolation. Even the parts of the Bible that have undergone no interpolation are needless as the Qur&#8217;an replaces them. This ruling is not applicable to scholars who need to read it in order to refute the claims of the People of the Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible either to swear by the Bible in its present form as it has undergone partial interpolation and distortion, and thus cannot be the words of Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Excerpt from <a href="http://www.alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=9911&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=9911&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ruling on Reading the Tawrah and the Injil by Shaykh Ibn Baz rahimahullah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q &#8211; Is it permissible for me as a Muslim to leaf through the Injil (Gospel) and read in it, just to have a look, and not for any other purpose? Does believing in the Divine Books mean believing in their being revealed by Allah or believing in their content? Please enlighten me, may Allah enlighten you!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Every Muslim should believe that these books: the Tawrah (Torah), the Injil (Gospel), and the Zabur (Psalms), were revealed by Allah, and that Allah revealed them to His Prophets. Included in these Books were: commands, prohibitions, admonitions, warnings, stories of ancient events, information on Paradise and Hell, and other matters. However, Muslims should not use these books as they have been distorted and altered, and they should not own copies of them, or read in them. They pose a danger in that they may lead Muslims to deny a truth or believe in a falsehood, because they have been distorted, altered, and falsified by the Jews, the Christians and others; whereas Allah has made us stand in no need of them, by the great Book He revealed: the Noble Qurýan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saw a portion of the Tawrah in the hands of &#8220;Umar, so he became angry and said: Are you confused about it, O Ibn Al-Khattab? By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, I brought it to you white and pure. And he added, &#8221;By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, if Musa (Moses) were alive, he could not but follow me. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We just want to advise you, and others, not to take anything from the Tawrah, the Injil, and the Zabur, not to acquire copies of them, and not to read in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, if you have any of them, bury or burn it, because the truth that was in them has been given, instead, in the Qurýan; they are now so mixed with changes and distortions, which are all condemned and false. Therefore, the believer must be on his guard against this, and beware of reading these books for they may lead to belief in a falsehood or denial of a truth. To be safe, it is better to just dispose of these books, either by burying or burning them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledgeable Muslim scholars are permitted to look at these books to refute the allegations of the opponents of Islam from among the Jews and the Christians. This was what the Prophet (peace be upon him) did when the Jews denied that stoning of adulterers was the punishment prescribed in the Tawrah, so he asked for a copy of the Tawrah until they finally acknowledged it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this is that the scholars, who are knowledgeable about the Shariýah (Islamic law), may need to read the Tawrah, the Injil, and the Zabur for the sake of Islam, to refute allegations from the opponents of Allah and show the merits of the Qurýan and the truth and guidance it contains. As for ordinary people, they do not need to do this. So, if they have any of these books, they should bury them in a pure place or burn them to avoid misleading anyone through them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=2&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=8" target="blank" rel="nofollow">Nur &#8216;Ala Al-Darb Fatwa</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: Is it permissible for Muslims to  read the Injil (Gospel) to know how far it is distorted?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for a believer to read the Tawrah (Torah) and Injil, even though they were distorted and changed and Allah (may He be Glorified) has given Muslims what is best, which is the Noble Qur&#8217;an that has been preserved from any change or distortion. Moreover, the Shari`ah (Islamic law) has abrogated all other earlier laws, and it is the perfect, the greatest, and the most useful to the Servants of Allah. Allah (may He be Exalted) states:Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 3 This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islým as your religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Glorified) addressed His Prophet (peace be upon him) stating:Surah Al-Jathiyah, 45: 18 Then We have put you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) on a (plain) way of (Our) commandment [like the one which We commanded Our Messengers before you (i.e. legal ways and laws of the Islýmic Monotheism)]. So follow you that (Islýmic Monotheism and its laws), and follow not the desires of those who know not. (Tafsir At-Tabarý). It was authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he saw `Umar ibn Al-Khattab holding some pages of the Tawrah. He, thus, became angry and said: Are you doubtful regarding it (Islam) O Ibn Al-Khattab? By Him in Whose Hand is my life, I have brought it to you plain and pure&#8230; By Him in Whose Hand is my life, if Musa (Moses) was alive he would have followed me. (Related by Imam Ahmad in his Musnad (Hadith compilation)).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We, thus, advise you to increase your recitation of the Qur&#8217;an, take care of it, and act according to its teachings, for it will definitely suffice you from reading the earlier books revealed by Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatwas &gt; Sha`ban Fatwas &gt; Visits made during Sha‘ban to the grave of Prophet Hud</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Source : alifta.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Q: A brother from Hadramawt asks: During the month of Sha‘ban, people come to out town Hadramawt to visit the grave of Prophet Hud (Peace be upon him), whose grave is thought to be located in Al-Ahqaf, near Hadramawt. The journey there takes five hours by car. With this false belief, from our viewpoint, a great number of people, i.e. thousands of people, drive to this place, where they ascend a mountain to a room at the top of it that contains two or three graves. They lean against these graves, touch them, weep over them, call upon them and seek their blessings. When they have finished doing this they descend. They do this for about four days. They liken this practice to Sa‘y (going between Safa and Marwah during Hajj). They appointed certain places incarnating the body of Prophet Hud (peace be upon him): There is a pebble they call the nose of Prophet Hud; there is another smooth one that has the trace of his foot, which is called Al-Dahqah and its length is about three cubits; and a third one is claimed to be his feet wherein women hoping for husbands put some pebbles in the hope that they will find what they aspire to and similarly this is practiced by wives hoping to have babies. They claim that it is advised that one should pay this visit and that the predecessors among the Awliya’ (pious people) established this visit and called people to make it, like for example, the Faqih (Jurisprudent) immigrating to Allah, Ahmad ibn ‘Isa, and so on. They continue in this way describing this practice. O Shaykh ‘Abdul-‘Aziz finally, we seek your instruction and advice. What should they do?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: First: The location of the grave of Allah’s Prophet, Hud (Peace be upon him), is not known. Their claim that this grave belongs to Prophet Hud in Al-Ahqaf is baseless. The only known graves among those attributed to the Prophets are that of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and that of Ibrahim Al-Khalil (Abraham, peace be upon him) in the well-known cave in Al-Khalil, the Levant, Palestine. The graves of Prophets Hud, Salih, Nuh, and the other prophets are not known. Likewise, the claim that the grave of Prophet Hud lies in Al-Ahqaf and that it is in the room mentioned by the inquirer, is all baseless and false. No graves are known among the graves of the Prophets other than that of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and that of Al-Khalil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What these people are doing is Munkar (unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and is not permissible. Rather, it is one of the forbidden acts tantamount to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). Supplicating to Allah’s Prophet Hud and Tabarruk (seeking blessings) through the pebbles claimed to belong to his grave and his body are acts tantamount to major Shirk. Seeking blessings through this; seeking husbands or offspring are all Munkar and among the forbidden acts that are tantamount to Shirk. Children are to be sought only from Allah, Who (may He be Glorified and Exalted) gives progeny. The same applies to hoping for a husband as this is to be sought from Allah, not from stones attributed to Hud or a grave attributed to Hud. One’s needs cannot be demanded from Hud himself (peace be upon him). One cannot say: “O Hud, grant us children or bless them for us.” This is to be directed to Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) Alone. All that is practiced by the ignorant people in this regard is Munkar that must be condemned. Muslims of sound intellect have to forbid them from this and scholars have to warn them against this. They should not be misled by the practice of ignorant people or acts introduced by some Sufis or some idolaters in this regard; all this is wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ibadah (worship) is an exclusive Right of Allah (may He be Exalted):Surah Al-Fatihah, 1: 5 You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). It is Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) Who confers blessings that cannot be sought from neither stones, nor graves, nor trees, nor from Allah’s Prophet, Hud, nor from anyone else. When the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) saw a tree (called Dhat Anwat) that was loved by the Kafirs (disbelievers) who would hang their weapons on it hoping for its blessing, they asked the Prophet (peace be upon him), saying: “O Messenger of Allah! Make for us a Dhat Anwat as they have a Dhat Anwat.” He (peace be upon him) said, “Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Greatest)! Verily these are the ways of earlier nations. By the One in Whose Hand is my soul, you have said exactly as the Children of Israel had said to Musa (Moses): Make for us an ilah (a god) as they have alihah (gods).” The Prophet (peace be upon him) likened their saying: &#8220;Make for us a Dhat Anwat…&#8221; to the saying of the Children of Israel: &#8220;Make for us an ilah (a god)&#8230;&#8221; It is well-known that associating another god with Allah is major Kufr (disbelief). Accordingly, it is not permissible to associate any other god with Allah, neither from idols, nor from trees, nor from angels, nor from the Messengers, nor from any human beings or Jinn. Rather, ‘Ibadah is due only to Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted). The Right of Allah over His Slaves is that they should worship Him and not associate anything with Him. It is Allah (may He be Glorified) Who says:Surah Al-Baiyyinah, 98: 5 And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allâh, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him) And:Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, 17: 23 And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. And:<br />
Surah Ghafir, 40: 14 So, call you (O Muhammad peace be upon him and the believers) upon (or invoke) Allâh making (your) worship pure for Him (Alone) (by worshipping none but Him and by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allâh’s sake only and not to show off and not to set up rivals with Him in worship), however much the disbelievers (in the Oneness of Allâh) may hate (it). And:Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 2 So worship Allâh (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allâh’s sake only. The Prophet (peace be upon him) after asking Mu‘adh about the Right of Allah over His Slaves to which Mu‘adh answered, &#8220;Allah and His Messenger know best&#8221;, taught him saying, The Right of Allah over His Slaves is that they should worship Him and not associate anything with Him. Thus, the Right of Allah over His Slaves is that they should worship Him Alone in their making Du‘a’ (supplication), asking help, Salah (Prayer), Sawm (Fasting), sacrificing animals, vowing and seeking blessings. All this must be dedicated to Allah Alone (may He be Glorified and Exalted):Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 163 And your Ilâh (God) is One Ilâh (God &#8211; Allâh), Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (there is none who has the right to be worshipped but He), the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: If you ask, ask Allah; and if you seek help, seek help from Allah. The same ruling applies to what is practiced by some ignorant people by the grave of the Prophet (peace be upon him) regarding supplicating to him or seeking his help or support. All these are forbidden acts that are tantamount to Shirk. The same applies to what is practiced by some people by the grave of Al-Badawy, Al-Husayn ibn ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), or by the grave of Ibn ‘Araby in Syria or by the grave of Shaykh ‘Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilany in Iraq. With regard to the practices of ignorant people who call upon deceased people and seek their help, all this is tantamount to Kufr and Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory: to dedicate all ‘Ibadah (worship) to Allah Alone, to call upon none but Him (may He be Glorified and Exalted), and not to seek victory, support or remedy neither from the deceased, nor from trees or stones. All this is to be sought from Allah Alone (may He be Glorified and Exalted). Human beings are to be asked for what is within their ability to do, provided that they are alive and present, not dead or absent; the dead should not be sought out for anything. Rather, one can seek the help of those who are alive and present, if this is within their capacity. One can say: O brother, help me to do such and such a thing, if this is within their capacity; loan us such and such a thing; or help me repair my house or my car. There is nothing wrong to say this verbally, by sending a letter, or by phoning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the deceased, the trees, stones, idols, or stars, are not to be asked for anything because this is tantamount to major Shirk, may Allah protect us! In fact, this is tantamount to worshipping them besides or instead of Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted). Thus, Muslims should beware of what Allah forbade them from. They should have sound knowledge of their religion and address their questions to qualified scholars who are well-known for adhering to the Sunnah and have correct ‘Aqidah (creed). People should ask them about the Religion of Allah and about what is ambiguous for them. They should not blindly follow the customs and practices that are only done by ignorant people. Allah (may He be Glorified) says:Surah Al-An`am, 6: 163 He has no partner. And of this I have been commanded, and I am the first of the Muslims. And:Surah Al-Kawthar, 108: 1 Verily, We have granted you (O Muhammad peace be upon him) Al-Kauthar (a river in Paradise). Surah Al-Kawthar, 108: 2 Therefore turn in prayer to your Lord and sacrifice (to Him only). Thus, Salah (Prayer) and sacrifice are to be made to Allah Alone. The same applies to Du‘a’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (May He be Glorified) says:Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 18 And the mosques are for Allâh (Alone); so invoke not anyone along with Allâh. Thus, it is Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) Alone Who is to be supplicated and hoped in. It is He Who is to be drawn nearer to by vows, sacrifices, Salah, and Sawm. May Allah help Muslims be enlightened in their religion! May He set right the affairs of Muslim scholars and guide them to enlighten their brothers and teach them what confuses them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q57: Allah (may He be Exalted) says in His Book: Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, 17: 15<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="MEDIA-B1.GIF" /><a> And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning)</a><strong><a>. </a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="MEDIA-B2.GIF" /></strong>(Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, 17:15). It was narrated in some Hadiths that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that his parents will be in the Fire. The question is: Were they not from Ahlul-Fatrah (those to whom Da`wah has not reached in an uncorrupted manner), those whom the Qur&#8217;an clearly mentioned as being saved in the Hereafter. Please answer me, may Allah guide you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> A: </strong>There is nothing in the Qur&#8217;an that explicitly states that Ahlul-Fatrah will be saved or destroyed. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, 17: 15<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="MEDIA-B1.GIF" /><a> And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning). </a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="MEDIA-B2.GIF" />(Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, 17:15).Due to His Perfect Justice, Allah does not punish anyone until after He has sent a Messenger. So, whomsoever the message of Islam did not reach, they will not be punished until the proof is established against them. This is what was told by Allah (may He be Praised). It is also narrated in the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) that the proof will be established against Ahlul-Fatrah and they will be tested on the Day of Resurrection, and those who satisfy and follow the straight path will be safe, but those who disobey will enter the Fire. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to the man who asked him:<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="MEDIA-H2.GIF" /><a> &#8220;Where is my father?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;In Hellfire.&#8221; When he saw the man&#8217;s face change, he (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;My father and yours are in the Fire.&#8221; </a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="MEDIA-H1.GIF" />This was done to console the man and let him know that this was not just for his father. It may have been that both the Prophet&#8217;s and the man&#8217;s fathers had heard Daw`ah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and when the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="MEDIA-H2.GIF" /><a> My father and yours are in the Fire </a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="MEDIA-H1.GIF" />he was talking about something that he knew, as he (peace be upon him) never told lies or spoke through his own desire, as Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) says:Surah Al-Najm, 53: 1<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="MEDIA-B1.GIF" /><a> By the star when it goes down (or vanishes). </a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="MEDIA-B2.GIF" />Surah Al-Najm, 53: 2<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="MEDIA-B1.GIF" /><a> Your companion (Muhammad, peace be upon him) has neither gone astray nor has erred. </a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="MEDIA-B2.GIF" />Surah Al-Najm, 53: 3<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="MEDIA-B1.GIF" /><a> Nor does he speak of (his own) desire. </a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="MEDIA-B2.GIF" />Surah Al-Najm, 53: 4<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="MEDIA-B1.GIF" /><a> It is only a Revelation revealed. </a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="MEDIA-B2.GIF" />(Surah Al-Najm, 53:1-4).If evidence had not been established about the Prophet&#8217;s father, `Abdullah ibn `Abdul-Muttalib, he (peace be upon him) would not have said that about him. He might have been told about Ibrahim&#8217;s (Abraham) religion, and that was enough to establish proof against him. People had been following Prophet Ibrahim&#8217;s religion until `Amr ibn Luhay Al-Khuza`y propagated the worship of idols and they followed him and supplicated to them instead of Allah. It may also have been the case that `Abdullah had knowledge that enabled him to discern that what the Quraysh were doing in worshipping idols was null and void, but he still followed what they were doing, and that was the proof against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also narrated in the Hadith that the Prophet (peace be upon him) asked Allah&#8217;s Permission to ask forgiveness for his mother, but he was not granted it, and that he asked Permission to visit her grave and he was granted that. He was not permitted to ask forgiveness for his mother maybe because sufficient Daw`ah that established proof against her had reached her. It may also be because people of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance) are treated the same as other disbelievers with regard to worldly rulings, and therefore it is not permissible to supplicate to Allah or ask forgiveness for them, and that their situation is left to Allah in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If no proof is established against a person in this world, they will not be punished until they are tested on the Day of Resurrection, because Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) says:Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, 17: 15<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="MEDIA-B1.GIF" /><a> And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning). </a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="MEDIA-B2.GIF" />(Surah Al-Isra&#8217;, 17:15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it is known that a prophet&#8217;s Daw`ah did not reach people in a certain era, they will be tested on the Day of Resurrection; if they are successful they will enter Jannah (Paradise), but if they fail they will enter into the Fire. The same applies to the elderly, those who are mentally ill, and others whom Daw`ah did not reach, and the children of the disbelievers; all of these people, according to the most correct opinion in this regard, will be tested. This is because when the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about them, he said,<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="MEDIA-H2.GIF" /><a> Allah knows best what they were doing. </a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="MEDIA-H1.GIF" />So, children of the disbelievers will be examined on the Day of Resurrection along with Ahlul-Fatrah; if they give the correct replies they will be saved, otherwise they will be with those perishing in the Fire. Praise be to Allah, the matter concerning the Prophet&#8217;s parents is not a problem for those who know the Sunnah and the rules of the Shari`ah (Islamic law).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Various groups, each claiming to be the victorious one!</strong><br />
by Ibn Baz (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) in Nur Al-Adab Session.<br />
<a href="http://alifta.net/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://alifta.net</a><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q3- There are many religious sects and groups, each claiming that they are the victorious one. This matter is perplexing to many people, so what should we do, especially as there are groups that are related to Islam, such as <strong>Al-</strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/sufism-soofiyyah/"><strong>Soofiyyah</strong> (صُوفِيَّة)</a> <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/salafiyyah/">Al-Salafiyah</a></strong>, and others, and how can we distinguish between them? May Allah bless you<strong>.<br />
</strong></span><br />
A: It is confirmed that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;The Jews split into seventy-one sects; one will be in Paradise (i.e., those who followed Moses) and seventy will be in the Fire. The Christians split into seventy-two sects; seventy-one will be in the Fire and one will be in Paradise (i.e., those who followed Jesus). And by the One in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, this Ummah (nation) of mine will split into seventy-three sects; one will be in Paradise and seventy-two will be in the Fire. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>It was asked, &#8220;Who are they, O Messenger of Allah?&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>He (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;<em>Al-Jama‘ah</em> (i.e., the group which adheres steadfastly to the way of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and his Companions).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;</strong>(Those who follow)<strong> what I and my Companions are following.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the saved group; those who adhere steadfastly to the truth that the Messenger (peace be upon him) came with, and adopt the way of the Messenger (peace be upon him) and that of his Companions. They are <em>Ahl Al-Sunnah wal-Jama‘ah</em> (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community). They are the people who adhere to the Hadith; the righteous predecessors who follow in the footsteps of the early generations in acting upon the Qur’an and the Sunnah. Any sect that contradicts them is threatened with the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">Dear questioner, you have to study every group that claims to be the victorious one. Scrutinize their deeds; if they are in conformity with the Shari‘ah, they are included in the victorious group; otherwise they are not.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The measure here is the Qur’an and the Sunnah</strong>, so any group whose words and deeds are in accordance with the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) is within the victorious one and any that contradict this, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/jahmiyyah/"><strong>Jahmiyyah</strong> (الجهمية)</a><strong> </strong>(an Islamic sect denying some of the Attributes of Allah, claiming they are ascribed to people and cannot be ascribed to Allah),</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/mutazilah/"><strong>Mu’tazilah</strong> (المعتزلة)</a> (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that those who commit major sins are in a state between belief and disbelief),</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/shia-raafidah/"><strong>Raafidah</strong> (<span dir="rtl" lang="ar" xml:lang="ar"><b>الرافضة</b></span>‎)</a><strong> </strong>(a Shi`ah group denying the caliphates of Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq and ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab, and making accusations against them and many other Companions),</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/al-murjiah/"><strong>Murji’ah</strong> (المرجئة)</a> (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that Faith is restricted to belief not deeds), and others, as well as most of the <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/sufism-soofiyyah/">Sufis</a> </strong>who invent matters in the religion, which Allah does not permit.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are all among the groups that the Messenger (peace be upon him) forewarned of the Fire, until they repent from going against <em>Shari‘ah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any group that adopts anything contrary to <em>Shari‘ah</em> have to repent from it, and return to the right path and the truth that our Prophet, Muhammad (peace be upon him), brought. In this way they will be saved from the threat. But if they insist on the rejected innovations they have introduced in religion and do not follow the way of the Messenger (peace be upon him), they will be among the threatened groups. <span style="color:#808000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Not all of these groups are disbelievers, but they are threatened with the Fire</span></strong></span>. Among them are those who are disbelievers for committing acts of disbelief, and among them are those who are not disbelievers, but they are still threatened with the Fire, because they have introduced heresies in religion and sanctioned what Allah has not permitted (may He be Glorified and Exalted).</p>
