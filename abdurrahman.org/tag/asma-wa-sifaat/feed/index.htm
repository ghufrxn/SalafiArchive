										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What should be said concerning Allaah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;Allaah mocks at them…&#8221; [13] and &#8220;Allaah ridicules them…&#8221;, [Surah At-Tawbah: 79] as well as what is similar to that from the <em>Mutashaabihaat</em> (unclear) verses?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf (Predecessors) used to say concerning these ayaat as well as those similar to them: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Leave them as they are stated</strong></span>.&#8221; But they did not mean by this to leave them the way they are without attaching any understanding to them. Rather, they meant by it, to leave them the way they are stated according to their correct understanding, without making comparisons for (the Attributes of Allaah stated in) them (<em><strong>tashbeeh</strong></em>), describing their manner (<em><strong>takyeef</strong></em>), misinterpreting them (<em><strong>ta&#8217;weel</strong></em>) and denying them (<em><strong>ta&#8217;teel</strong></em>). Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the All-Hearer, the All- Seer.&#8221;</span></em> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this ayah, there is <em><strong>tanzeeh</strong> </em>(negation of all anthropomorphic qualities from Allaah) as well as <em><strong>ithbaat</strong> </em>(affirmation) for two attributes for Himself, which are hearing and seeing. The understanding of this elimination of all similarities to Allaah (tanzeeh) is that we must (also) affirm the attributes that Allaah has described Himself with or the Messenger, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, has described Him with, as it befits His grandness, may He be Glorified and Exalted. And we do not say &#8220;how&#8221; that is, such as by saying: &#8220;His hearing is like our hearing and His seeing is like our seeing.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, we do not misinterpret that (i.e. make ta&#8217;weel) as has been done by some of the extremists from the Mu&#8217;tazilah, such that they have misinterpreted Allaah&#8217;s hearing and seeing to be His knowledge. And this is in spite of Allaah&#8217;s describing Himself with knowledge in many other ayaat of the Noble Qur&#8217;aan! Thus, the misinterpretation (ta&#8217;weel) of these individuals of hearing and seeing for knowledge constitutes ta&#8217;teel (denial of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes). The scholars say about this: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The one who commits ta&#8217;teel worships nothing, while the one who commits tajseem worships a statue</strong></span>.&#8221; [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, we say, concerning the two ayahs mentioned previously in the question, which contain Allaah&#8217;s mocking and ridiculing, that it is a mocking and a ridiculing that is befitting for Allaah. And it is not like that which limited intellects may perceive it to be, from that which has comparisons to the<br />
creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Surah Al-Baqarah: 15<br />
[14] Translator&#8217;s Note: This is because the one who commits ta&#8217;teel (mu&#8217;attil) denies all of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes, so it is as if he is worshipping nothing. On the other hand, the one who commits tajseem (mujassim) ascribes anthropomorphic qualities to Allaah, for example saying His eyes are like our eyes and His hand is like our hands. So it is like He is worshipping a statue.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The following is Translated &amp; Compiled by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, Allaah is not ashamed to set forth a parable</span></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Baqarah: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – What is mentioned in the hadeeth of Ya’ala bin Umayyah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saw a man bathing at an open place where there was no partitioning and without a wrapping garment, so the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> climbed the <em>Mimbar</em>, and he praised Allaah and glorified Him and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Indeed Allaah <em>– Azza wa Jal –</em> is The Shy One, The One who Conceals, He loves modesty and covering up, so if one of you bathes (outside) then he should cover up.’</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – The hadeeth of Salman <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Indeed your Lord <em>– Tabaaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> is The Shy One, The Generous, Allaah is Shy from His slave if the slave raises his hands towards Him, that He would return them without anything.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah – authenticated by Albaani in ‘Irwa’ no. 2335]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – The author Muhammad al-Hamood an-Najdi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Know – may Allaah have mercy upon me and you – that the greatest modesty which is necessary to have is with Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>, He Who fluctuates His blessings and His virtue day and night. We cannot do without Him even for a blink of an eye. We are under His Hearing and Sight, and nothing of our condition, statements and actions is absent from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just like Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whatever you (O Muhammad) may be doing, and whatever portion you may be reciting from the Qur’aan, – and whatever deed you (mankind) may be doing (good or evil), We are Witness thereof, when you are doing it. And nothing is hidden from your Lord (so much as) the weight of an atom on the earth or in the heaven. Not what is less than that or what is greater than that but is (written) in a Clear Record</span>.</strong> &gt;&gt; [Yunus: 61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Summarised from ‘an-Nahaj al-Asma’ fee Sharh ‘Asmaa Allaah al-Hussna 3/99-]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5  – Shaykh Muhammad Khaleel Haraas <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Name of Allaah Ta’ala <em>al-Hayyee</em> (The Shy One) is a Name which is appropriate to Him, and it is not like the <em>Hayya</em> (Modesty) of the creation, which is a change and effect, which seizes a person when he is frightened by that which brings him shame or fault.  Rather it is leaving that which is not appropriate with His abundant Mercy and His perfect Generosity and Kindness, and His great Pardoning and His Gentleness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the slave of Allaah openly sins even though modesty is the thing that he is in most need of, and modesty is the weakest thing he has, and he uses Allaah’s blessings to sin.  However, Allaah <em>– Subhanahu–</em> along with His perfection in not needing anything whatsoever and His complete ability over modesty, is shy from the slave from removing his veil and humiliating him, so Allaah covers up the slave with that which disguises him from the means of covering up, then after that Allaah pardons his sins and forgives them.  Just like the hadeeth of Ibn Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘Indeed Allaah comes close to the believer, and covers him then asks him, between Himself and the slave: Did you not do such and such, on such and such day? Until the slave of Allaah acknowledges his sins, and is certain that he will definitely be destroyed and Allaah says to him: I covered up your sins in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and today I will forgive them for you.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim &#8211; Taken from ‘an-Nahaj al-Asma’ fee Sharh ‘Asmaa Allaah al-Hussna 3/103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allāh , may His Praise and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Selected pearls from the books of the People of Knowledge and Fiqh</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The consensus (amongst Ahlus Sunnah) which has been conveyed regarding three principles related to Allah&#8217;s Attributes</span></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Principle:</strong> Regarding Allah the Most High&#8217;s Attributes, there is no place for the intellect (in deriving) them.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh as-Sijzee mentioned in his book &#8220;Ar-Radd &#8216;ala man Ankara al-Harf wa as-Sawt&#8221;, pg. 121:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;The Imaams have agreed that the Attributes are not derived except by way of refrainment&#8221; (i.e.refraining from affirming an Attribute for Allah until there is proof).</span></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Principle:</strong> Belief in the Attributes of Allah is by affirming their literal meaning not figurative.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn &#8216;Abdil Barr mentioned in his book &#8220;at-Tamheed&#8221;, 145/7:</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;There is a consensus amongst Ahlus Sunnah that the Attributes (of Allah) are affirmed, all of them, which have come in the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah and believing in them and understanding them according to their apparent meaning, not figuratively, except that they (Ahlus Sunnah) do not establish the &#8216;how&#8217; of these Attributes nor do they establish or determine the reality of them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">However, Ahlul Bid&#8217;ah, the Jahmiyyah and Mu&#8217;tazilah &#8211; all of them &#8211; and the Khawaarij deny them (Allah&#8217;s Attributes) and they do not understand any of them according to their literal meaning.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Those who deny Allah&#8217;s Attributes also claim that whoever affirms them, then he is one who has likened Allah to His creation and conversely, those who do so are considered from amongst the people who negate the One Who is worshipped according to those who affirm Allah&#8217;s Attributes.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">The &#8216;Allaamah al-Maqreezee  mentioned in his book &#8220;al-Muwaa&#8217;idh wal I&#8217;tibaar bi Dhikr al-Khutat wal Aathaar&#8221;, 188/4:</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And all of them (Ahlus Sunnah) have narrated understanding the Attributes as they have come.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Principle:</strong> The literal meaning texts of the Attributes are known to us in light of their linguistic meaning and they are unknown to us with regards to the &#8216;how&#8217; of these Attributes.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Al-Imaam adh-Dhahabee mentioned in his book &#8220;al-&#8216;Arsh&#8221;, 195/1 whilst commenting on the statement of Imaam Maalik: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The ascension of Allah on His Throne is not unknown (its known linguistically) and the &#8216;how&#8217; of it is incomprehensible&#8221;:</span></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And what Imaam Maalik said is what the texts have come with and this is what ALL of the Salaf were upon.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: <strong>Al-Ibaanah Magazine</strong> &#8211; Issue No.2 &#8211; Rabî’ul-Awwal 1416H / August 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh &#8211; <i>hafidhahullâh</i> &#8211; said: [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From <i>îmân</i> (faith) in Allâh is to have <i>îmân</i> in those of His <i>Asmâul-Husnâ</i> (beautiful Names) and <i>Sifâtul-’Ulyâ</i> (lofty Attributes) that occur in His Great Book and that have been affirmed by His trustworthy Messenger <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> &#8211; without <i>tahrîf</i> (distorting the wording or the meaning), <i>ta’tîl</i> (divesting or denying the Attributes), <i>takyîf</i> (asking how) or <i>tamthîl</i> (resembling Allâh to any of His creation). Rather, it is obligatory to leave them as they came, without <i>takyîf.</i> Along with this, it is also obligatory to have <i>îmân</i> in the meaning that Allâh &#8211; <i> the Mighty and Majestic</i> &#8211; has been described with, in a way which befits Him; without resembling Him to His creation in any of His Attributes. Allâh &#8211; <i> the Most High</i> &#8211; says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“There is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.”</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh &#8211; <i> the Mighty and Majestic</i> &#8211; also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And do not put forward any similitude for Allâh. Indeed, Allâh knows and you do not know.”</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the <i>’aqîdah</i> (belief) of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamâ’ah</i> from the Companions of the Messenger of Allâh <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> and those that followed them in goodness. This is what has been recorded also by Imâm Abûl-Hasan al-Ash’arî (d.324H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; in his book: <i>“Al-Maqâlât ‘an Asbâbul-Hadîth wa Ahlus-Sunnah.”</i> This has also been stated by many others from the people of knowledge and <i>îmân</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imâm al-Awzâ’î [4] &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said:<br />
“I asked az-Zuhrî and Makhûl about the <i>âyât</i> pertaining to the <i>Sifât</i> (Attributes of Allâh), so they said: Leave them as they are.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Walîd ibn Muslim &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said:<br />
“I asked Mâlik, al-Awzâ’î, Layth ibn Sa’d and Sufyân ath-Thawrî &#8211; <i>rahimahumullâh</i> &#8211; about the reports related about the Attributes, so they all said: Leave them as they are, without asking how.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awzâ’î &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said:<br />
“We &#8211; whilst the <i>Tâbi’ûn</i> were many &#8211; would say: Indeed Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most Perfect</i> &#8211; is above His Throne, and we have <i>îmân</i> in what is related in the Sunnah about the Attributes.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rabî’ah ibn Abî ’Abdur-Rahmân [8] &#8211; <i>rahimahumullâh</i> &#8211; said:<br />
“<i>Al-Istiwâ</i> (Allâh ascending) is not unknown, and how is not comprehendible, and from Allâh is the Message, upon the Messenger is to clearly convey it, and upon us is to affirm it.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imâm Mâlik [10] &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said:<br />
“<i>Al-Istiwâ</i> is known, and how is unknown, to have <i>îmân</i> in it is obligatory and to question it is an innovation.” Then he said to the questioner: “I do not think, except that you are an evil man.” So he ordered him to be expelled. [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This has also been related about <i>Ummul-Mu‘minîn</i> Umm Salamah <i>radiallâhu ’anhâ</i>. [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Abdullâh ibn al-Mubârak [13] &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said:<br />
“We know that our Lord &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; is above the heavens, above His ’Arsh (Throne), separate from His creation.” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words of the Scholars about this matter are very numerous indeed, and it is not possible to relate them all in such a short space. However, whosoever further desires to be acquainted with this topic, then let him turn to the books by the Scholars of Sunnah about this subject, such as the book:- <i>Kitâbus-Sunnah</i> by ’Abdullâh the son of Imâm Ahmad (d.290H), <i>Kitâbut-Tawhîd</i> by the great Imâm, Muhammad ibn Khuzaymah (d.311H), <i>Kitâbus-Sunnah</i> by Abûl-Qâsim al-Lâlikâ‘î at-Tabarî (d.418H), and <i>Kitâbus-Sunnah</i> by Abû Bakr Ibn Abî ’Âsim (d.287H).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Refer also to the reply given by Shaykhul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) to the people of Hamah (entitled <i>al-’Aqîdatul-Hamawiyyah</i>), as it is a great reply, full of benefit. In it he &#8211;<i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; has made clear the <i>’aqîdah</i> of <i> Ahlus-Sunnah</i>, and has recorded many of the sayings of the Scholars; as well as giving proofs from both the <i>Sharî’ah</i> and sound reasoning about the correctness of what <i> Ahlus-Sunnah</i> say, showing also the futility of those who oppose them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, his book entitled <i>al-’Aqîdatut-Tadmuriyyah</i> in which he established and explained the <i>’aqîdah</i> of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah</i> with both textual proofs and proofs from sound reasoning. In this treatise he has &#8211; for all those of understanding, intending righteousness and desiring to realise the truth &#8211; thoroughly refuted all opposition, by clarifying the truth and refuting the falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All those who oppose <i> Ahlus-Sunnah</i> in their <i>’aqîdah</i> concerning Allâh’s Names and Attributes, have indeed fallen into opposing the textual evidences and sound reasoning along with clearly contradicting all that Allâh has affirmed or negated for Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <i> Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamâ’ah</i> affirm for Allâh &#8211; <i> the Most Perfect</i> &#8211; what He has affirmed for Himself in His Noble Book, or what has been affirmed for Him by His Messenger Muhammad <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> in the authentic Sunnah. Affirming without <i>tamthîl</i> (resemblance) and freeing Allâh &#8211; <i> the Most Perfect</i> &#8211; from any resemblance to His creation, whilst also rejecting and being free from <i>ta’tîl</i>. So whosoever holds fast to the truth which Allâh sent, humbling and accepting it, whilst being sincere to Allâh in the quest for it, then it is the way of Allâh &#8211; <i> the Most Perfect</i> &#8211; that He will grant such a person harmony with the truth and show them His clear evidences, as Allâh &#8211; <i> the Most High</i> &#8211; mentions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Nay! We hurl truth against falsehood, so it destroys it; and behold, falsehood is vanquished.”</b> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allâh &#8211; <i> the Most High</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And no example or similitude do they bring, except We reveal to you the truth and the best explanation thereof.”</b> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hâfidh Ibn Kathîr (d.774H) <i>rahimahullâh</i> explained in his famous <i>tafsîr</i> &#8211; whilst commenting upon the saying of Allâh &#8211; <i> the Mighty and Majestic</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Indeed your Lord is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then He ascended (<i>istiwâ</i>) over the Throne.”</b> [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He explained this issue in a most beautiful manner, which I have quoted here in its entirety, due to its great benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Kathîr &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said:<br />
“The sayings of the people in this issue are very many. However, this is not the place to enter into a detailed discussion about it. Indeed, the path we traverse in this issue is to follow the way of the <i>Salafus-Sâlih</i> (Pious Predecessors) such as: Mâlik, al-Awzâ’î, ath-Thawrî, Layth ibn Sa’d, ash-Shâfi’î, Ahmad, Ishâq ibn Bâhâwaih, and other from the Scholars of the Muslims &#8211; both past and present. And their way is: to recite them as they are, without <i>takyîf</i>, <i>tashbîh</i>, nor <i>ta’tîl</i>. Indeed, Allâh does not resemble anything of His creation in any way:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“There is nothing like Him, He is the all-Hearing, all-Seeing.”</b> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the matter is as the Scholars &#8211; such as Nu’aym ibn Hammâd al-Khuzâ’î (d.228H), the Shaykh of al-Bukhârî &#8211; said: “Whosoever makes <i>tashbîh</i> (resemblance) of Allâh to His creation, has committed <i>kufr</i> (disbelief), and whosoever denies what Allâh has described Himself with, has also committed kufr &#8230; Indeed, all that Allâh has described Himself with, or what His Messenger has described Him with, then there is no <i>tashbîh</i> in it at all.” [19] So whosoever affirms for Allâh &#8211; <i> the Most High</i> &#8211; what is related in the clear <i>Âyât</i> and the authentic narrations &#8211; in a way which befits Allâh’s Greatness and Majesty &#8211; whilst also denying and negating from Allâh &#8211; <i> the Most High</i> &#8211; any defects and imperfection, then such a person has truly traversed the path of Guidance.” [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh (bin Bâz) &#8211; <i>hafidhahullâh</i> &#8211; also said: [21]<br />
“<i>Tahrîf</i> (distortion) means: changing the wordings of the Names and Attributes, or changing their meanings. Like the saying of the Jahmiyyah that <i>istiwâ</i> (ascending above) is <i>istawlâ</i> (conquering and having dominion over); and like the saying of some of the Innovators that <i>al-Ghadab</i> (Anger) when referring to Allâh means ‘intending to punish’ and that <i> ar-Rahmah</i> (Mercy) means ‘intending to send blessings.’ And all of this is <i>tahrîf</i>: And their saying about <i>istawâ</i> that it is <i>istawlâ</i> is <i>tahrîf</i> of the wording, and their saying that <i> ar-Rahmah</i> is intending to send blessings and <i>al-Ghadab</i> is intending to punish is <i>tahrîf</i> of the meaning. The true saying, however, is that <i>istawâ</i> means ascending and being above &#8211; as is clear in the ’Arabic language. And the Qur‘ân came to show that its meaning is ascending and being above the <i>’Arsh</i> (Throne) in a manner which befits Allâh’s Majesty and Greatness. Likewise, <i>al-Ghadab</i> and <i> ar-Rahmah</i> are two real Attributes befitting Allâh’s Majesty and Greatness &#8211; just as is the case with the rest of the Attributes reported in the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Ta’tîl</i> (divesting) means: removal of the Attributes and to deny them for Allâh the Most High. It is taken from their saying: ‘A graceful neck without adornment (<i>mu’attal</i>).’ So the Jahmiyyah and their like divest Allâh of His Attributes and are thus called the <i>Mu’atillah</i>. And this saying of theirs is totally futile, since it is not possible for there to be anything in existence without attributes &#8211; and the Qur‘ân and the Sunnah repeatedly affirm Attributes (for Allâh) in a manner befitting Allâh’s Majesty and Greatness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Takyîf</i> means: Explaining how the Attributes are. So it is not said: ‘How did He ascend?’ And ‘How is His Hand?’ And ‘How is His Face?’ Since, speaking about the Attributes of Allâh follows the same principle, and is treated the same, as speaking about the <i>Dhât</i> (Essence/Self) of Allâh. So just as He has a <i>Dhât</i> &#8211; and we do not know how it is, then likewise, He has <i>Sifât</i> (Attributes) &#8211; and we do not know how they are either, no one knows that except Him. But we believe in the reality of their meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards to <i>tamthîl</i>, then it means: <i>tashbîh</i> (making resemblance). So it is not said: Allâh has a <i>Dhât</i> (Essence) like ours, or resembling ours, etc. Thus, it is not said about the Attributes of Allâh that they are like &#8211; or resembling &#8211; our attributes. Rather, the Believer must stick to His &#8211; <i> the Most High’s</i> &#8211; saying: <b> “There is nothing like Him.”</b> And the meaning is that there is none who resembles Him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: Shaykhul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) mentioned: If it is said to you: We interpret the meaning of Anger to be ‘desiring to punish’ and Mercy to be ‘desiring to send blessings’ then say: Does this desiring resemble that of the creation, or is it a desiring befitting His Majesty and Greatness? So if he says the first &#8211; then he has done <i>tashbîh</i>! And if he says the second, then say: Then why do you not say, ‘Mercy and Anger befitting His Majesty and Greatness?’ And this will put an end to his argument.</p>

4. He is Abdur-Rahmân ibn ’Amr al-Awzâ’î &#8211; the Scholar, worshipper and <i>mujâhid</i>. Al-Hâkim said: “Al-Awzâ’î was the Imâm of the people of his time in general, and he was the Imâm of the people of Shâm in particular.” He died in Bayrût, in the year 157H.

7. Related by al-Bayhaqî in <i> al-Asmâ was-Sifât</i> (p.408). The isnâd is <i>jayyid</i>, as al-Hâfidh Ibn Hajar said in <i>Fathul-Bârî</i> (13/406).<br />
8. He is Rabî’ah ibn Abî ’Abdur-Rahmân &#8211; better known as <i>Rabî’atur-Râ’î</i> &#8211; one of the <i>Tâbi’ûn</i> of al-Madînah. Al-Khatîb said: “He was a <i>Faqîh</i>, a Scholar and a <i>Hâfidh</i> in <i> Fiqh</i> and <i>Hadîth</i>.” He died in the year 136H. Refer to <i>Târîkh Baghdâd</i> (8/420) and <i>Hilyatul-Awliyâ</i> (3/259) for his biography. Related by al-Bayhaqî in <i> al-Asmâ was-Sifât</i> (no.516) and al-Lâlikâ‘î in <i> Sharh Usûl I’tiqâd Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamâ’ah</i> (no.665). Ibn Taymiyyah said in <i>Majmû’al-Fatâwâ</i> (5/365): “It is established from Rabî’ah.” He also said in <i> al-Hamawiyyah</i> (p.80): “Al-Khallâl narrated it with an <i>isnâd</i> all of whom are <i>thiqât</i> (precise and reliable).”<br />
10. He is Abû ’Abdullâh Mâlik ibn Anas &#8211; the Imâm from the <i>Atbâ’ut-Tâbi’ûn</i> of al-Madînah and one of the Scholars of <i>Ahlus-Sunnah</i>. Imâm ash-Shâfi’î said: “When the Scholars are mentioned, then Mâlik is a dazzling star.” He died in 179H. Refer to <i>Siyâr A’lâmun-Nubalâ</i> (7/366) of adh-Dhahabî for a complete biography.<br />
11. Related by al-Bayhaqî in <i>al-Asmâ was-Sifât</i> (p.516) with the wording: “<i>Al-Istiwâ</i> is not unknown and how is unknown, to have <i>îmân</i> in it is obligatory and to question it is an innovation.” Al-Bayhaqî also relates (p.516), as does ad-Dârimî in <i> ar-Radd ’alal-Jahmiyyah</i> (p.55) &#8211; with a jayyid <i>isnâd</i>, as Ibn Hajr says in <i>Fatbul-Bârî</i> (13/406) &#8211; that Imâm Mâhk said: “The Most Merciful ascended as He Himself described, and it is not to be asked: How? Since how is unknown.”<br />
12. Related by al-Lâlakâ‘î in <i> Sharh Usûl I’tiqâd</i> (no.663). Ibn Taymiyyah said in <i> al-Fatâwâ</i> (5/365): “Its <i>isnâd</i> cannot be relied upon.” Adh-Dhahabî said in <i>al-’Uluww</i> (p.82): “This saying has been preserved from a group, such as Rabi’atur-Ra‘î, Mâlik and Abû Ja’far at-Tirmidhî. However, the narration from Umm Salamah is not authenhic &#8211; since Abû Kinânah is not reliable and Abû ’Amîr is not known.” So the Shaykh was indeed correct in not definitely ascribing this saying to the Mother of the Believers, Umm Salamah &#8211; and all praise is for Allâh.<br />
13. He is Abû ’Abdur-Rahmân ’Abdullâh ibn al-Mubârak al-Marwazî. The Imâm from the <i>Atbâ’ut-Tâbi’ûn</i>, the <i>Hâfidh</i>, the Shaykh of Islâm, example for the people of <i> zuhd</i> and a leader of the <i>mujâhidîn</i>. He died in the year 181H. Refer to <i>Târîkh Baghdâd</i> (l/152) and <i> at-Tadhkirah</i> (l/274) for his biography.<br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Testimony of Imâm at-Tirmidhî</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Speaking about those ahâdîth which mention the Attributes of Allâh, Imâm at-Tirmidhî (d.279H)- <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; said in his <i>Sunan</i> (l/128-129): “It has been said by more than one person from the People of Knowledge &#8211; about such ahâdîth &#8211; that there in no <i>tashbîh</i> (resemblence) to the Attributes of Allâh. And the Lord &#8211; <i> the Blessed, the Most High</i> &#8211; descends to the lowest heaven every night. So they say: Affirm these narrations, have <i>îmân</i> in them and do not deny them, and do not ask how. The likes of this has been related from Mâlik ibn Anas, Sufyân ath-Thawrî, Ibn ’Uyaynah and ’Abdullâh ibn al-Mubârak, who all said about these ahâdîth: “Leave them as they are, without asking how.” Such is the saying of the People of Knowledge from <i> Ahlus-Sunnah</i> <i>wal-Jamâ’ah</i>. However, the Jahmiyyah oppose these narrations and say: This is <i>tashbîh</i>!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, Allâh &#8211; <i> the Most High</i> &#8211; has mentioned in various places in His Book the Attribute of Hand, Hearing and Seeing. So the Jahmiyyah make <i> ta’tîl</i> (false interpolation) of these <i>Âyât</i> and explain it in a way other than that explained by the People of Knowledge. They say: Indeed, Allâh did not create <i>Âdam</i> with His own Hand. And they also say that the meaning of Hand is Power.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ishâq ibn Ibrâhîm ar-Râhawaiah said:<br />
“ <i>Tashbîh</i> is if it is said: Hand like my hand, or similar to my hand. Or Hearing like my hearing, or similar to my hearing. So when it is said: Hearing like my hearing, or similar to my hearing, then this is <i>tashbîh</i>. But if what is being said is what Allâh has said: Hand, Hearing, Seeing; and it is not asked how, nor is it said: like my hearing, or similar to my hearing &#8211; then this is not <i>tashbîh</i>. Allâh &#8211; <i> the Most Blessed, Most High</i> &#8211; said in His Book: “There is none like unto Him, and He is the all-Hearing, the all-Seeing.” [Sûrah ash-Shûrâ 42:11]”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:Imaam Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen<br />
Source: Sharh Lum&#8217;atul-&#8216;Itiqaad (pg. 20-27) with checking and notes from Ashraf Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Maqsood [Dar Al-Istiqamah Printing]<br />
Translator:isma&#8217;eel alarcon &#8211; al-manhaj.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before entering into the core of this book, I would first like to introduce some important principles related to Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The First Principle:</strong> What is obligatory from the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah regarding Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, it is obligatory (concerning Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes) to leave their proofs and implications upon their literal meanings, without changing them. This is because Allaah revealed the Qur&#8217;aan in a plain Arabic language and the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) used to speak with the Arabic language. Therefore, it is obligatory to leave the implications of the words of Allaah and the words of the Messenger of Allaah (<em>Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam</em>) as they are, in that language. Also, changing it from its literal meaning is speaking about Allaah without knowledge and this is forbidden, due to the statement of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Say: &#8216;The things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are the great evil sins, whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allaah for which He has given no authority, and saying things about Allaah of which you have no knowledge.'&#8221;</strong> [Surat-ul-A&#8217;araaf (7): 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this principle is found in the statement of Allaah: <strong>&#8220;Nay, both His hands are widely outstretched.&#8221;</strong> [Surat-ul-Maa&#8217;idah (5): 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, what is literally apparent from this ayah is that Allaah has two actual hands. Thus, affirming that is obligatory, due to this principle. So if someone were to say that the meaning of His hands is &#8220;power&#8221;, then we must say to him that this is changing the word from its literal meaning. And saying this is not permissible, for it is speaking about Allaah without knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Second Principle:</strong> Concerning Allaah&#8217;s Names</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are several subdivisions included in this principle:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The first subdivision:</strong> All of Allaah&#8217;s Names are the best</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that they all possess the highest extent of goodness. This is since they are comprised of perfect attributes. There are no deficiencies to be found in them in any way whatsoever, for Allaah says: <strong>&#8220;To Him belong the best of Names.&#8221;</strong> [Surah TaHa (20): 5-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this is the name Ar-Rahmaan, which is one of the Names of Allaah, for it demonstrates a magnificent attribute &#8211; which is (His) vast mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that Ad-Dahr (time) is not one of the Names of Allaah, for it does not possess a meaning that reaches the highest extent of goodness. As for the Prophet&#8217;s (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) statement: <strong>&#8220;Do not curse time, for indeed, Allaah is Ad-Dahr (time)&#8221;</strong>,[2] then its meaning is that He is the &#8220;Owner of time &#8211; the One who dispenses it&#8221;. This change occurs based on the evidence found in his (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa Sallam) statement in the second narration (of this hadeeth) in which Allaah said: &#8220;In My hand is the Command. I turn (in cycles) the night and the day.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Second Subdivision:</strong> The Names of Allaah are not confined to a fixed and definite number</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is based on the famous hadeeth: <strong>&#8220;I ask You, O Allaah, by every one of Your Names by which You have named Yourself or revealed in Your Book. Or (those which You have) taught to one of Your creatures or appropriated for Yourself in the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen) that is with You.&#8221;</strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Specifying and grasping whatever Allaah has appropriated for Himself in the knowledge of the Ghaib (Unseen) that is with Him, is impossible to attain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The way to combine between this hadeeth and the other authentic hadeeth: <strong>&#8220;Verily, to Allaah belong ninety-nine names, (by which) whosoever takes account of them (i.e. memorizes, learns and supplicates by them), will enter Paradise &#8220;</strong> [5] s that the meaning of this (latter) hadeeth is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, from among all the names of Allaah are ninety-nine names by which if someone takes account of them, he will enter Paradise .&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It does not mean that Allaah&#8217;s names are restricted to this number (of 99).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The equivalent of this would be if one were to say: &#8220;I have one hundred dollars which I have counted out for the purpose of giving in charity.&#8221; This does not negate that he has other dollars in his possession, which he has counted out for a purpose other than charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Third Subdivision:</strong> The Names of Allaah are not affirmed by the intellect &#8211; they can only be affirmed by Revelation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Names of Allaah are based upon Revelation and as such, their affirmation is dependent upon what is reported in the revealed texts concerning them. Therefore, nothing can be added to them nor subtracted. This is because the intellect is not able to itself ascertain which names Allaah is most deserving of. So it is obligatory to depend upon the revealed texts for determining that. Also, naming Allaah with that which He did not name Himself or rejecting what He did name Himself with, is a crime against Him and a perpetration of His right. Thus, abiding by the proper etiquettes with regard to that is obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Fourth Subdivision:</strong> The meaning of each of Allaah&#8217;s Names applies to 1) Allaah Himself, 2) the attribute that such a Name implies, and 3) the effect of such an attribute, if it is transitive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah&#8217;s names cannot be complete without affirming all of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of those names that are not transitive is the name Al-&#8216;Adheem (The Most Great). One&#8217;s Faith is not complete until he believes that it is a name of Allaah whose meaning applies to Him Himself, as well as the attribute that it encompasses, which is His magnificence (&#8216;adhamah). An example of a name that is transitive is Ar-Rahmaan (the Most Merciful). One&#8217;s Faith is not complete until he believes that it is a name of Allaah that applies to 1) Himself, 2) the attribute that it encompasses, which is his mercy, and 3) what results from that, which is that he grants mercy to whom He wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Third Principle: Concerning Allaah&#8217;s Attributes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also subdivisions included in this principle:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The First Subdivision:</strong> All of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes are of the highest degree of perfection and praise possible. There is no deficiency found in them in any way whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some examples of these Attributes are: (His) living, knowledge, ability, hearing, seeing, wisdom, mercy, highness and other than these. This is based on His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;And to Allaah belongs the highest description.&#8221;</strong> [Surat-un-Nahl (16): 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also because the Lord is absolutely perfect; thus His Attributes must be perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If an attribute is deficient and imperfect, then it is restricted from Him, such as death, ignorance, inability, deafness, blindness, and other than that. This is because Allaah will punish those who describe Him with deficiencies and He has freed Himself from all the defects that they attribute to Him. Also, it is not possible for the Lord (Rabb) to have a defect due to the incompatibility of deficiency with the aspect of Lordship (Rububiyyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If an attribute is perfect in one way and deficient in another way, then it is not affirmed for Allaah nor is it restricted from Him in the absolute sense. Rather, a distinction between the two cases must be made. Thus, it is affirmed for Allaah in the circumstances when it is perfect and it is not possible to affirm it for Him in the condition when it is deficient. Examples of this are planning (Makr), plotting (Kaid), deception (Khadaa&#8217;) and so on. These three attributes are perfect when they are implemented as a response to their equals (being done by an opponent), since they indicate that the One who is doing it is not incapable of encountering His enemy with his same action. And it would be deficient in any other condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is affirmed for Allaah in the first condition and not in the second. Allaah says: <strong>&#8220;They (disbelievers) were planning and Allaah too was planning (i.e. makr). And Allaah is the best of those who plan.&#8221;</strong> [Surat-ul-Anfaal (8): 30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Verily, they are but scheming a plot. And I too am scheming a plot (i.e. <em>kaid</em>).&#8221;</strong> [Surat-ut-Taariq (86): 15-16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allaah, but it is He who deceives (i.e. khadaa&#8217;) them.&#8221;</strong> [Surat-un-Nisaa (4): 142]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if for instance, it is said: &#8220;Has Allaah attributed plotting to Himself?&#8221; Then do not say yes, and do not say no. Instead say: &#8220;He is plotting against those who are deserving of that, and Allaah knows best.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Second Subdivision:</strong> The Attributes of Allaah can be divided into two categories: Those that are affirmed (Thubootiyyah) and those that are negated (Salbiyyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> Thubootiyyah:</em></strong> consists of the attributes that Allaah has affirmed for Himself, such as living, knowledge and ability. Affirming these for Allaah in a manner befitting to Him is obligatory. This is because Allaah has affirmed them for Himself and He is the most knowledgeable concerning His Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> Salbiyyah:</em></strong> consists of the attributes that Allaah has negated for Himself, such as injustice. Negating these from Allaah is obligatory because Allaah has negated them from Himself. However, it is obligatory to believe in affirming their most perfect opposites, for Allaah, since a negation is not complete until it consists of an affirmation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this is Allaah&#8217;s statement: <strong>&#8220;And your Lord treats no one with injustice.&#8221;</strong> [Surat-ul-Kahf (18): 49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is obligatory to negate injustice from Allaah, while affirming (the opposite) &#8211; which is justice &#8211; for Him, based on its most perfect perspective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Third Subdivision:</strong> The Affirmed Attributes (Thubootiyyah) can further be divided into two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> Dhaatiyyah</em> (Attributes of His Essence):</strong> They are the attributes that do not cease nor will ever cease to be descriptive of Him, such as hearing and seeing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em> Fi&#8217;aliyyah</em> (Attributes of His Actions):</strong> They are the attributes that are connected to His Will (Mashee&#8217;ah). If He wills, He will do it and if He wills, He will not do it, such as rising over the Throne and (His) coming.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that an attribute could be both Dhaatiyyah and Fi&#8217;aliyyah, according to each of the two, such as Speech. In regards to the origin of the attribute, it is an attribute of His Essence (Dhaatiyyah) because Allaah never stopped nor will stop speaking. And in regards to the units of Speech that are put forth, it is an attribute of the action (Fi&#8217;aliyyah), since Speech is connected to His Will. He speaks as He wills, when He wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Fourth Subdivision:</strong> Each Attribute of Allaah should bring three questions to mind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first question: Is it real (as opposed to figurative) and why?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second question: Is it permissible to say how it is and why?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third question: Is it comparable to the attributes of creation and why?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to the first question: Yes, it is real, because the foundation of speech concerning this subject is based on actuality (as opposed to symbolism). This may not be abandoned, unless there is authentic evidence that restricts it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second answer: No, it is not permissible to describe how an attribute is, due to Allaah&#8217;s statement: <strong>&#8220;But they will never encompass anything of His Knowledge.&#8221;</strong> [Surah TaHa (20): 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the intellects are not able to comprehend the nature of how Allaah&#8217;s attributes are.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third answer: It cannot be compared to the creation&#8217;s attributes, due to Allaah&#8217;s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;There is nothing whatsoever like Him.&#8221;</strong> [Surat-ush-Shooraa (42): 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also Allaah is worthy of the utmost perfection, therefore it is impossible for Him to be compared to the creation, since that is something deficient and imperfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The difference between takyeef (saying how it is) and tamtheel (saying it is like such and such) is that tamtheel is to describe the manner of an attribute by restricting it to a certain example, whereas takyeef is describing the manner of an attribute without restricting it to a certain example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of <strong><em>tamtheel</em></strong> is if someone were to say the hand of Allaah is like the hand of a human being.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of <strong><em>takyeef</em></strong> is to imagine that the Hand of Allaah has a specific nature that has no comparison found in the hands of created beings. This type of imagining is not permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> The Fourth Principle:</strong> What may be used to refute those who commit ta&#8217;teel (rejection of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Mu&#8217;tilah (those who commit ta&#8217;teel) are the ones who reject anything from the Names and Attributes of Allaah and distort the texts from their literal meanings. They are also known as the ones who commit ta&#8217;weel (distorted interpretation). The fundamental principle by which we may refute them is to say that their statements:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Are in contradiction to what is literally apparent from the texts</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Are in contradiction to the understanding of the Salaf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Do not have any authentic proof (to support them)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For some attributes, there may be a fourth perspective, or more than that.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen has a great book on the subject of Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes in which he states a number of important principles regarding this topic. We have provided a checking for it and it is called <strong><em>&#8220;Al-Qawaa&#8217;id Al-Muthlaa fee Sifaatillaahi wa Asmaa&#8217;ihi Al-Husnaa&#8221;</em></strong> (Ideal Principles concerning Allaah&#8217;s Attributes and His Beautiful Names). It deserves to be studied and devoted special attention to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Saheeh Muslim: Book of Words from Good Manners (no. 2246) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah. Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr said in Al-Fath (10/565): &#8220;Ahmad has transmitted it from another path from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah with the wording: <strong>&#8216;Do not curse time, for indeed Allaah has stated: &#8216;I am Ad-Dahr (Time). The days and the nights belong to Me. I will renew them, vanquish them and bring forth kings after kings.&#8217;</strong> And its chain of narration is authentic.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A Point of Benefit:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar Ibn Al-Qayyim said in Zaad Al-Ma&#8217;aad (2/355):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Anyone that curses time is lingering between two states of which there is no doubt that he is from one of them. Either he has cursed Allaah Himself or he has ascribed a partner to him (Shirk). For indeed, if he believes that Allaah is the only one that did that and he curses whomsoever did it, then he has cursed Allaah.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of Tawheed (no. 7491) and Saheeh Muslim: Book of Words from Good Manners (no. 2246) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Hadeeth Saheeh: This is a part from the hadeeth of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood t that has been reported by Ahmad (1/394, 452), Ibn Hibbaan (no. 2372 of the Mawaarid), and Al-Haakim (1/519). Al-Haafidh Ibn Al-Qayyim authenticated it in Shifaa-ul-&#8216;Aleel (pg. 274). And he (ra) went in detail, clarifying the importance and benefits of this hadeeth in his book Al-Fawaa&#8217;id (pg. 24-29). It was also authenticated by Shaikh Ahmad Shaakir (rahimahullaah) in his notes to Al-Musnad (no. 3721), Al-Albaanee in As-Saheehah (no. 199) and Shu&#8217;aib Al-Arna&#8217;oot in his checking of Zaad Al-Ma&#8217;aad (4/198).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of Supplications (no. 6410) and Saheeh Muslim: Book of Remembrance and Supplication (no. 2677) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (radi Allaahu anhu)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">An Exclusive Translation for Sisters Upon Al-Istiqaamah</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Al-Fawzan</strong> was asked on behalf of a young girl the following question: [1]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">My young daughter constantly asks me, ‘Why can’t we see Allah in this life?’ What is the best answer to give her as she is young?</span></p>
<p>The Shaykh (May Allah preserve him) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Say to her, ‘<em>This is because you are not able to see him [in this life]. You would burn to pieces</em>.’ It is not possible for a created being to see Allah in this life. Whereas in the Hereafter Allah gives the believer the strength and ability so he is able to see Allah. Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another place <strong>Shaykh Al-Fawzan</strong> mentions: [2]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Jahmiyyah and the Mu’tazilah, all of them, reject <strong>Ar-Ru’yah</strong> (the seeing of Allah) in the Hereafter. Another group exists who say, ‘Verily Allah is seen in this life and in the Hereafter.’ This is a position that is held by some of the Sufis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third position, and this is the true and correct stance, is that Allah, the Mighty and Majestic will be seen in the Hereafter by the people of paradise as is found in the ahadeeth that have been narrated upon the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and which have reached the level of Mutawaatir (such a great number of ahadeeth it is not possible that they have all been invented). However, in this life, then verily Allah cannot be seen because the people cannot endure and survive seeing Him, the Exalted in this life. When Moosa (peace and blessings be upon him) asked to see Allah, the Exalted, in this life, Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, “My Lord, show me [Yourself] that I may look at You.” [Allāh] said, “You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see Me.” But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He rendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious. And when he awoke, he said, “Exalted are You! I have repented to You, and I am the first of the believers.” </em></span><em>[Al-A’raaf: 143]</em></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">The solid mountain became dust due to the Greatness of Allah, the Mighty and Majestic. So how can a human being withstand seeing Allah [in this life]?”</span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salaamu &#8216;ala rasulullaah<br />
Amma ba&#8217;d</p>
<p>During an &#8216;aqeedah class a few years ago, we learned that:</p>
<p>Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radiallaahu &#8216;anhummaa) said: <strong><span style="color:#993300;"><br />
I know the meaning of every ayah of the Qur`an</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Regarding Ahlul Bid&#8217;ah&#8217;s Deviant statement concerning the Names and Attributes of Allaah, &#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">I don&#8217;t know its Meaning; I leave that matter to Allaah</span>&#8220;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While teaching &#8216;Aqeedatul-Wasitiyyah from the sharh of Shaikh al-&#8216;Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah), student of knowledge Abu Uwais (rahimahullaah) relayed the following concerning Ahlul Bid&#8217;ah&#8217;s deviant statement concerning the Names and Attributes of Allaah, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know its Meaning; I leave that matter to Allaah&#8221;:</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div>
<p><strong>Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah</strong> (rahimahullaah) said: this is the most evil statement from the people of bid&#8217;ah and deviation!</p>
<p><strong>Shaikh Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen</strong> said: He [meaning Ibn Taymeeyah] has spoken the truth, rahimahullaah. If you think about it, you&#8217;ll find that this statement is:</p>
<p>1- A rejection of the Qur`an<br />
2- Declaration that the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was ignorant<br />
3- Falling into <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Filasafa (philosophy)</strong></span>.</p>
<p>[Then Shaikh al-&#8216;Uthaimeen explained:]</p>
<p><strong>1- Takdheeb al-Qur`an It is takdheeb (rejection of, belying) of the Qur`an</strong>, because Allaah said (what means):</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur`an) as an exposition of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and glad tidings for those who have submitted themselves (to Allaah as Muslims)&#8221;.</span> (An-Nahl, ayah 89) Meaning He sent down the Qur`an as an explanation and clarification in its words. Now, would it be a <strong>bayaan</strong> (explanation and clarification), if you don&#8217;t know the meaning of its words? Especially if what you&#8217;re saying is that which has come in the Qur`an, wherein the Names and Attributes of Allaah are mentioned so much.</p>
<p>If we say, &#8216;we don&#8217;t know what they mean,&#8217; then how can the Qur`an then be an explanation and clarification for everything? So this is rejection of this ayah!</p>
<p>2- <strong>Tajheel ar-Rasool (Declaring the Messenger to be ignorant)</strong>. They are saying the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) didn&#8217;t know the meaning of the Qur`an, those ayat mentioning the Names and Attributes of Allaah. So if the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) didn&#8217;t know, then everybody else is first and foremost (also doesn&#8217;t know). More astonishing than this is that they say the Messenger spoke some words regarding the Names and Attributes of Allaah, and he didn&#8217;t know what they meant. They are declaring the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) to be ignorant in the matter that he is the most knowledgeable (among the creation) &#8211; the very important matter of the Names and Attributes of his Lord. Is there a disrespect greater than this disrespect to the Messenger?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div>
<div><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>So we &#8211; Ahlus-Sunnah &#8211; make </strong></span><span style="color:#333300;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">tafweed</span></strong></span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong> only of the Kayfeeyah (the howness). The Ash&#8217;aria make tafweed of the meanings and the words.</strong></span></div>
<div>
<p>[Abu Uwais interjected and said: so you see how they think that they are running from something bad, but [they, in fact] are running to something that is worse. They claim intelligence and neutrality, but they wind up, as Ibn Taymeeyah said, saying the worst statement of Ahlul Bid&#8217;ah &#8211; rejecting the Qur`an and belittling the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam).]</p>
<p>3- <strong>And in this, they are opening the door to the zanadiqah</strong> &#8211; those who come to Islam to (study and) destroy it. The zanadiqah come in and say to those who say &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221;: &#8220;you don&#8217;t know anything, we are the ones who know.&#8221; And then they started to give tafseer of the Qur`an with other than what Allaah meant, with the (false) argument, &#8220;it is better to give these texts some meaning than act like illeterate people like you and give it no meaning.&#8221; So they started inventing meanings. And the people of tafweedh can&#8217;t reject, because they said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>They open the door to great evils (such as the zanadiqah who lie upon Allaah, and give whatever meaning they want). And you find these expressions &#8220;I don&#8217;t know&#8221; in the books of the Ash&#8217;arees, and in the material of Hassan al-Banna [the deviant founder of Ikhwanul Muslimeen] you find the evil expression &#8220;The path of the Salaf is safe, but the path of the Khalaf is more knowledgeable and wiser.&#8221;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abu Uwais</strong> relayed from <strong>Shaikh al-&#8216;Uthaimeen</strong>&#8216;s sharh of Al-Aqeedatul Waasitiyah of Ibn Taymeeyah (rahimahumullaah):</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div>
<div>
<p>Also they (Ahlul Bid&#8217;ah: Ash&#8217;arees, etc&#8230;) claim they are performing <strong>TanzeeH</strong> &#8211; not ascribing deficiency to Allaah. Some from Ahlul Bid&#8217;ah who go astray regarding the Names and Attributes had the intent of TanzeeH, but this includes the sick premise that when Allaah described Himself in His Book and in the Sunnah of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) that He did not intend TanzeeH, to remove Himself above it! [Aoodhubillaah!]</p>
<p>So they felt they had to come up (invent) meanings that would give that. That&#8217;s how they fell into wrong. They ran from something &#8211; resembling (TashbeeH) &#8211; and fell into something worse than it!</p>
<p>So we &#8211; Ahlus-Sunnah &#8211; make tafweed only of the Kayfeeyah (the howness). The Ash&#8217;aria make tafweed of the meanings and the words.</p>
<p>Allaah forbade us from kayfeeyah:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge</span>. (Ta-Ha, ayah 110)</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad): &#8220;(But) the things that my Lord has indeed forbidden are Al-Fawaahish whether committed openly or secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous oppression, joining partners (in worship) with Allaah for which He has given no authority, and<strong> <span style="text-decoration:underline;">saying things about Allaah of which you have no knowledge</span>.</strong>&#8220;</span> (Al-A&#8217;raf, ayah 33)</p>
<p>And <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>follow not (O man i.e., say not, or do not or witness not, etc.) that of which you have no knowledge</strong></span> (e.g. one&#8217;s saying: &#8220;I have seen,&#8221; while in fact he has not seen, or &#8220;I have heard,&#8221; while he has not heard). Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those you will be questioned (by Allaah). (Al-Isra`, ayah 36)</p>
<p>Kayfeeyah can be known by:</p>
<p>1- Witnessing it<br />
2- Witnessing something just like it, or similar, or equal to it<br />
3- A truthful informer who informs you about it (its howness)</p>
<p>[Shaikh al-&#8216;Uthaimeen used the example of a 1988 Datsun, 2000 model.]</p>
<p><strong>So we believe there is a how, but we don&#8217;t know (the howness, the kayfeeyah).</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dharr al-Ghifārī said that the Messenger of Allāh (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The seven heavens in comparison to the Kursī is nothing but like a ring thrown in a desert, and the excellence of the ʽArsh (Throne of Allāh) over the Kursī is like the excellence of that desert over that ring.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albānī comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The hadīth comes forth as an explanation of (Allāh’s) statement, the Most High: ‘His Kursī extends over the heavens and the earth,’[1] and it is clear with regard to the existence of the Kursī being the greatest of creations after the Throne (of Allāh), and that it is an independent, physical entity and not something abstract. Therefore, there is a refutation in (this hadīth) against the one who interprets (the Kursī) to mean ‘dominion’ and ‘extent of rule,’ as mentioned in some explanations of the Qur’ān. And it was not narrated from Ibn Abbās that (the Kursī) is ‘knowledge,’ so it is not correct to attribute it to him because it is from the narration of Jaʽfar bin Abi l-Mughīra from Saʽīd bin Jubayr from (Ibn ʽAbbās). Ibn Jarīr reported it. Ibn Mandah said: ‘Ibn Abi l-Mughīra is not strong with regard to (narrating from) Ibn Jubayr.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And know that it is not correct to describe the Kursī…as in some narrations that…four angels carry it, each angel having four faces, and their feet are upon the rock that is under the seventh earth, etc. So all of this is not correct in being attributed to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and some of (these narrations) are more severe in weakness than others.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Note: Shaykh Al-Albānī after this however, did grade the following narration as authentic:<br />
Abu Mūsā al-Ashʽarī said: “The Kursī is the place of the two Feet and it has a groaning like that of a camel saddle.”[2]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatest, most excellent &#8220;and most honorable knowledge is that of Allaah, Most High, His Names, Attributes, and Actions, the knowledge of His deen and of His Messenger (Peace be upon him) with love and magnification, being pleased with it all.&#8221; [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ranks of people with respect to this knowledge varies to a great extent. &#8220;Some people know of Allaah by virtue of His Generosity, Bounties, and Favors, others know of Him through His Forgiveness, Clemency, and Pardoning, others through His Knowledge and Wisdom, others recognize Him by His Might and Majesty, others by His Mercy, Goodness, Kindness, and Courtesy, others by His Subduing and Sovereignty, and others by the fact that He answers their supplications, and fulfills their needs, and relieves their grief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who is most comprehensive in his knowledge of Allaah, knows of Him by means of His own Words. He knows a Rabb to whom belongs the Most Majestic and Perfect Attributes. Far is He removed from having anything comparable to Him or any equal; free from all kinds of defects and imperfections; qualified with every beautiful Name and every perfect Attribute; Doer of what He intends (wills); Above everything [istawaa (ascended) upon the &#8216;arsh above the seven heavens] and with everything [He encompasses everything with His Knowledge, Ability, Authority, and so forth from the meanings of His ruboobiyyah, while He is the Most High, above everything]; the One who is Able to do everything; the One Who manages the affairs of everything. He commands and forbids. He speaks the legislative (deeniyyah ) [10] and universal (kawniyyah ) [11] words. He is Greater than everything, and He is the Most Beautiful. the Most Merciful, the All-Able, the All-Wise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#888888;">[9] Ibnul Qayyim. See Ftn.6, vol. 1, pp. 291-292.</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allah&#8217;s Name Al-Latif being repeated 129 times</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: In some of the Masjids (mosques) here in the district of Bashshar, people repeat Al-Latif (i.e. The Kindest), one of Allah&#8217;s Most Beautiful Names, every Friday after finishing the study circle before the Adhan (call to Prayer) and the two sermons of Friday Salah. They repeat this Name 129 times. I asked the Imam about this practice and he told me that they do so for Allah to save them from His Wrath. What is your view and explanation of this practice?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Recitation of Allah&#8217;s Name (Al-Latif) 129 times before the Adhan of Friday Salah has nothing to do with the guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) nor the Salaf (righteous predecessors). In fact this is one of the Bid`ah (innovation in religion) introduced to religion. It is authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: <span style="color:#008000;">He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected <span style="color:#000000;">[1]</span>.</span> i.e. Allah will not accept it from the person who does it. With regards to sitting in circles for lessons before the Adhan (call to Prayer) of the Friday Salah and the two sermons, it is forbidden according to the Hadith that is narrated by Al-Nasa&#8217;y from `Amr ibn Shu`ayb from his father from his grandfather: <span style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#008000;">That the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade sitting in study circles in mosques before the Jumu`ah (Friday) Prayer</span> [2]</span></p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the name Abdul-Razzaq is the one to be used. Also, it is not permissible to say <strong>Um (the mother of) Razzaq</strong> or <strong>Um Khallaq</strong> (The Creator), for both Names are Attributes of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). Rather, this woman should say Um Abdul-Razzaq instead and if she has an ID card, she should change it if she is able to.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the legal decision on the decorations and ornaments where the Glorious Name &#8220;Allah&#8221; and the name of the Prophet &#8220;Muhammad&#8221; are engraved? I work in business and I have dealings with some Muslim brothers in some countries. They want to know whether the Glorious Name &#8220;Allah&#8221; should be written on the right side and the name &#8220;Muhammad&#8221; on the left side or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">You will find three forms attached to this letter which I want to ask about. Is it permissible to imprint them on the excellent crystal and other ornaments? Please, advise. May Allah reward you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">A: It is not permissible to write <strong>&#8220;In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful&#8221;</strong> on ornaments and other decorative items, for the phrase &#8220;In the name of Allah, Most Gracious,Most Merciful&#8221; is an Ayah. To write it on such things exposes it to humiliation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">Also, it is not permissible to write the <strong>Glorious Name &#8220;Allah&#8221;</strong> on such things, because this may expose it to humiliation. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">Likewise, <strong>the name of the Prophet</strong> (peace be upon him) should not be imprinted on these things to protect it from degradation and prevent the overestimation prohibited by the Prophet (peace be upon him).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some calligraphers write the Exalted Name over the back of the cars which are subjected to be covered in dirt. Please, give us a Fatwa on that so that we may know the truth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for calligraphers, painters or others to write the Exalted Name of Allah or one of His beautiful Names and Attributes on the back of the car or whatsoever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the owner of the car is not permitted to do that under any pretext, such as decoration, seeking blessing, using it as a means of reminding and admonition or for any other purposes the common and ignorant people think of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an act of Bid`ah (innovation in religion) that has no origin in the Qur&#8217;an or Sunnah, and Allah does not make it an act of worship. Moreover, writing Qur&#8217;an in that way entails insult to the Names and Attributes of Allah and not keeping them above inappropriate handling. Perhaps, this leads the person to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) when he uses it as an amulet that brings about good and wards off evil merely by writing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Allah does not teach us his Names and Attributes to be written on sets, notices or cars. Had this been permissible, Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) would have guided us to it.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) revealed His Names and Attributes to inform His slaves of Him so that they affirm them as He revealed in the Qur&#8217;an or to His Messenger (peace be upon him) and believe in all perfection and majesty they convey. Muslims should also give Allah His due praise and supplicate to Him in easy and hard times by virtue of His Names and Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Muslim must believe in these Names, realize them in their creed and work and keep them in letter and spirit. A Muslim should attribute them to Allah properly without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), Ta`til (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation), Takyif (questioning Allah&#8217;s Attributes) or Tashbih (comparison), and guard their sanctity against abuse and inappropriate things. Allah (Exalted be He) says, <span style="color:#008000;">And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allâh, so call on Him by them, and leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His Names. They will be requited for what they used to do</span>. (Surah Al-A&#8217;raf 7:180)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 3: In some Masjids (mosques) here, people gather and continue repeating Allah&#8217;s Name around a piece of white cloth. What is the importance of the white cloth in Islam?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A: placing a piece of cloth in the Masjid and gathering around it to repeat the Name of Allah is a misleading act of Bid`ah (innovation in religion) undertaken by some <strong>Sufis</strong> who deviate from the course of the Messenger (peace be upon him). Therefore, it is not permissible to do or attend. This should also be prohibited and disavowed. Masjids should be protected from such acts of Bid`ah.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">68- The meaning of the Hadith &#8221; If anyone asks by Allah, you should give them&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A questioner asks: Some people embarrass us when they ask us by Allah to give, sell or even tell them anything. We often refuse their request when it is inappropriate. Is there any sin upon us for rejecting their request after they have asked us by Allaht? Please advise us about this. May Allah reward you well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If the person in need has no right to do this, there is no harm in refusing his request insha`a Allah (If Allah wills). For example, when someone asks you by Allah to give them your house, car, or money, they have no right to do this. But, if they claim their right, such as asking for their due money or demanding Zakah (obligatory charity)-provided that they deserve it- you should give them as available, for the Messenger (peace be upon him) said: If anyone asks (for something) by Allah, you should give them. Thus, it is acceptable to give a to person so long as they have the right to do so, such as a poor person who asks for Zakah, a lender who claims their money, one who needs your support against an oppressor, or in stopping an act of Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, it becomes your duty to respond and help them since they have asked for their right. The Messenger (peace be upon him) said: If anyone asks (for something) by Allah, you should give them On the other hand, if a person claims that which he has no right, or asks for something that involves an act of disobedience, there is no sin upon you if you refuse their request as such demanders should not do this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Some people commonly give their children names such as `Abdul-Nabiy (the servant of the Prophet), `Abdul-Hussayn (the servant of Al-Hussayn). What is the opinion of your Eminence on such names? Please advise us. May Allah reward you well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is impermissible to give names indicating servitude to other than Allah (Exalted be He), i.e. it is prohibited to say <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abdul-Nabiy, `Abd Aly, `Abdul-Hussayn</span> and so on. This is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect), for such names should be denoting servitude to Allah Alone like `Abdul-Rahman (The Servant of The Most Compassionate), `Abdul-Rahim (The Servant of the Most Merciful), `Abdul-Malik (The Servant of The Sovereign), `Abdul-Quddus (The Servant of The Most Holy) etc. This is the right form of servitude, which is to be declared to None but Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Hazm</strong> Abu Muhammad said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The widely-known opinion of scholars is to prohibit any name indicating servitude to other than Allah, such as <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abd `Umar, `Abd Al-Ka`bah</span> and the like with the exception of <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abdul-Muttalib</span>, as there is disagreement on that. In other words, scholars agree upon prohibiting this. Therefore, it is impermissible to give names showing servitude to other than Allah (Exalted be He) regardless of who the person is. Accordingly, it is impermissible to say: <span style="color:#ff6600;">`Abdul-Hussayn, `Abd `Umar, `Abdul-Nabiy, `Abdul-Ka`bah</span> and the like. Rather, a person should use either names signifying servitude to Allah (Exalted be He) or other names like Salih, Muhammad, Ahmad, Zayd, Khalid, Bakr and the like.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">We know that Ad-Dahr (time) is not one of the Names of Allaah</span>, for it does not possess a meaning that reaches the highest extent of goodness. As for the Prophet&#8217;s (saws) statement: &#8220;Do not curse time, for indeed, Allaah is Ad-Dahr (time)&#8221;,[2] then its meaning is that He is the &#8220;Owner of time &#8211; the One who dispenses it&#8221;. This change occurs based on the evidence found in his (saws) statement in the second narration (of this hadeeth) in which Allaah said: &#8220;In My hand is the Command. I turn (in cycles) the night and the day.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:<br />
[2] Saheeh Muslim: Book of Words from Good Manners (no. 2246) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah. Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr said in Al-Fath (10/565): &#8220;Ahmad has transmitted it from another path from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah with the wording: &#8216;Do not curse time, for indeed Allaah has stated: &#8216;I am Ad-Dahr (Time). The days and the nights belong to Me. I will renew them, vanquish them and bring forth kings after kings.&#8217; And its chain of narration is authentic.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>A Point of Benefit</strong>:<br />
The great scholar Ibn Al-Qayyim said in Zaad Al-Ma&#8217;aad (2/355): &#8220;Anyone that curses time is lingering between two states of which there is no doubt that he is from one of them. Either he has cursed Allaah Himself or he has ascribed a partner to him (Shirk). For indeed, if he believes that Allaah is the only one that did that and he curses whomsoever did it, then he has cursed Allaah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of Tawheed (no. 7491) and Saheeh Muslim: Book of Words from Good Manners (no. 2246) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: What is the ruling on abusing time (ad-Dahr)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: ad-Dahr (Time) is a subjugated form of creation from Allah’s many creations. It is not permissible to abuse it. It has been established in the Saheeh that the Messenger of Allah (peace &amp; blessings of Allah be upon him) said: {Indeed Allah says, “The son of Adam harms Me when he abuses ad-Dahr (Time), and I am ad-Dahr (Time), I turn the night and the day, by My hand I control every thing.”} Thus regarding ad-Dahr (Time) there is nothing that is in His Hand in which He created ad-Dahr in addition to creating the universe to be confined to ad-Dahr. So the meaning of Allah is ad-Dahr is that He created ad-Dahr and the entire universe is confined to ad-Dahr and Allah knows best.</p>
<p>Shaykh ‘Abdullah bin Humayd (rahimahullah)<br />
Translated by Aboo ‘Imraan al-Mekseekee-may Allah guide him</p>
<p>Arabic source: fatawa.al-islam.com/fatawa/Display.asp?FatwaID=847&amp;ParentID=707&amp;Page=3</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<span style="color:#ff0000;">Do not abuse Ad-Dahr (time), for Allah is Ad-Dahr</span>.) They said, &#8220;<span style="color:#993300;">During the time of Jahiliyyah, when an affliction, a calamity or a disaster struck them, the Arabs used to say, `Woe to Ad-Dahr (time)!&#8217; So they used to blame such incidents on Ad-Dahr, cursing Ad-Dahr in the process. Surely, it is Allah the Exalted and Most Honored Who causes these (and all) things to happen. This is why when they cursed Ad-Dahr, it was as if they were cursing Allah Himself, since truthfully, He causes all incidents to happen. Therefore, abusing Ad-Dahr was prohibited due to this consideration, for it was Allah Whom they meant by abusing Ad-Dahr, which &#8212; as we said&#8211; they accused of causing (distressful) incidents</span>.&#8221; This is the best explanation for this subject, and it is the desired meaning. Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should mention that Ibn Hazm and those of the Zahiriyyah like him made an error when they used this Hadith to include Ad-Dahr among Allah&#8217;s most beautiful Names.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the meaning of Allah&#8217;s `Arsh (Allah’s Throne)?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: According to Muslim scholars, and the Arabic language, <span style="color:#808000;">`Arsh means a throne or a throne belonging to a king.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The `Arsh of Allah is an extremely large and great Throne; it is the greatest thing created by Allah. It has four legs, and is carried by Angles. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) is above the `Arsh as He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says about Himself: <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;The Most Gracious (Allâh) rose over (Istawâ) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)&gt;&gt;</span> (Surah Taha 20:5). And: <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;Indeed, your Lord is Allâh, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawâ) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty)&gt;&gt;</span> (Surah Al-A&#8217;raf 7:54).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is a significantly large `Arsh; none knows how great the size of its magnificence is except Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Who created it (but we are told by the Prophet that it is very large). This `Arsh is like a dome stretching over the entire universe; it is the ceiling of the whole universe. It is also the ceiling of Paradise; nothing is above it except Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, `Arsh in Arabic is a very large throne, and the thrones of kings are called `Arsh. It is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an that the hoopoe told Sulayman (Solomon) that Bilqis (the Queen of Saba [or Sheba] in Yemen, who ruled during the lifetime of Prophet Sulayman): <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;and she has a great throne&gt;&gt;(Surah Al-Naml 27:23)</span>. Yet, Allah&#8217;s `Arsh is unique; there is no similarity between Allah&#8217;s `Arsh and those of His Creatures. In general, we know from Arabic that `Arsh is a generic name standing for a throne. However, none knows the essence, nature, substance, or greatness of Allah&#8217;s `Arsh except Allah Himself (Glorified and Exalted be He). Yet, authentic Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him) are our authority in this matter. If an authentic Hadith mentions something about it, we must believe it, and accept it without doubt. The Prophet (peace be upon him) does not utter any untruth. Thus, we must believe in what we are told about the `Arsh in the Qur&#8217;an and the authentic Hadiths without further questions. There is no authentic Hadith to tell us what it is made of. However, it is established that it is a very large, and great `Arsh created by Allah and carried by some Angels. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;</span><span style="color:#339966;">And the angels will be on its sides, and eight angels will, that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord above them&gt;&gt;</span> (Surah Al-Haqqah 69:17). The day meant here is the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is known from the Hadiths that four Angels carry the `Arsh now, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be eight Angels. It is reported that Umayah ibn Abu Al-Salt composed a poem, which the Prophet approved, to this effect, namely that four Angels carry the `Arsh of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) now. It reads:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">On the right side, one in the shape of a man, and the other in the shape of an ox<br />
On the left side, one in the shape of a vulture, and the other in the shape of a lion</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that now four Angels carry the `Arsh; one in the shape of a man, another in the shape of an oxen, the third in the shape of a vulture, and the fourth in the shape of a lion. These four Angels were created by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) exclusively to bear the `Arsh. Yet, it is reported on the authority of Al-`Abbas ibn `Abdul Muttalib that on the Day of Resurrection eight Angels in the shapes of ibexes will carry the `Arsh. These Angels are so giant, and extremely tall. However, this Hadith has some weakness in relation to its chain of narrators. But, another evidence for this is the Qur&#8217;anic verse mentioned above, that is <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;And the angels will be on its sides, and eight angels will, that Day, bear the Throne of your Lord above them&gt;&gt;</span>(Surah Al-Haqqah 69:17). which states that this will be on the Day of Resurrection. To sum up, they are now four angels, and on the Day of Resurrection they shall be eight. Allah (Glorified be He) is the One sought for help, and He knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’ has reviewed the translation of the Fatwa request as well as the reply published in the monthly Madinah Magazine issued from Dacca in Bengalese, fifth issue, 35th year, August 1999, corresponding to Rabi` II, 1420.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">The <strong>question</strong> submitted by a member of the Bengalese community in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia states: <span style="color:#993300;">We used to believe that Allah exists everywhere and that He is <strong>Imageless</strong>. However, here in Saudi Arabia in a cooperation bureau a Bengalese translator delivered a lecture in which he stated that Allah (may He be Exalted) does not exist everywhere and that He is described as having a Hand, an Eye, and other Attributes. He further claimed that anyone who does not believe as such is a disbeliever. My question is: What is your opinion in this regard? Please explain it in the light of the Qur’an and Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">The <strong>reply</strong> (in Madinah Magazine) from Decca was as follows: <span style="color:#993300;">Anyone who believes in such claims is either intensely ignorant, mad, or even a member of a deviant sect. Actually, Allah (may He be Exalted) is <strong>Imageless</strong> and exists everywhere and in everything and His Omnipotence encompasses all things. Moreover, Allah (may He be Exalted) has been described as such in many Ayahs as well as in many Hadith. Therefore, you should pay no attention to such nonsense so that you may not corrupt your Iman</span>. This was the end of the reply.</p>
<p><strong>Reply by Permanent Committee of Scholars :-</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This reply is groundless and opposes the Qur’an, Sunnah, Ijma’, and sound ‘Aqidah as it indicates belief in <strong>Hulul</strong> (a Sufi term meaning indwelling) which means that Allah dwells everywhere even in dirty places (Exalted be He far above any such thing). The reply also involves denying some of Allah’s Attributes wherewith He has described Himself and His Messenger (peace be upon him) has described Him, i.e. being High above His Creatures, rising over His ‘Arsh (Throne), being Distinct from His Creation, and being Incomparable in any respect to His Creatures. It also involves denying the fact that Allah is described as having a Hand, a Foot, a Leg, a Face, two Hands, two Eyes, and other Attributes related to His Self and Actions as proved by the Qur’an and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Exalted) says: (Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 255) <span style="color:#339966;"><em>And He is the Most High, the Most Great</em></span>. He (may He be Exalted) also says:(Surah Al-Mulk, 67: 16-17) <span style="color:#339966;"><em>Do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allaah), will not cause the earth to sink with you, and then it should quake? Or do you feel secure that He, Who is over the heaven (Allaah), will not send against you a violent whirlwind?</em></span>  The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Do not you trust me though I am the trustworthy person of the One in the Heavens?” Moreover, Allah (may He be Exalted) says:(Surah TaaHa, 20: 5) <span style="color:#339966;"><em>The Most Gracious (Allaah) rose over (Istawaa) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)</em></span>. The same fact is stressed in seven places in the Qur’an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, He (may He be Exalted) says:(Surah Al-Rahman, 55: 27) <span style="color:#339966;"><em>And the Face of your Lord full of Majesty and Honour will remain forever</em></span>. He (may He be Exalted) says:(Surah Al-Qasas, 28: 88) <span style="color:#339966;"><em>Everything will perish except His Face</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Addressing Iblis (Satan), Allah (may He be Exalted) says:(Surah Sad, 38: 75) <span style="color:#339966;"><em>What prevents you from prostrating yourself to one whom I have created with Both My Hands</em>.</span> He (may He be Exalted) says:(Surah Al-Ma’idah, 5: 64) <span style="color:#339966;"><em>Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the same regard, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “The people will be thrown into the Fire and it will keep on saying, &#8220;Is there any more?&#8221; until the Lord of the worlds puts His Foot over it.” According to another narration of the Hadith, he (peace be upon him) said: …His Foot over it, whereupon its different sides will come close to each other, and it will say: Enough! Enough!”</p>
<p>To the same effect, Allah (may He be Exalted) says to Musa (Moses – peace be upon him):(Surah TaaHa, 20: 39) <span style="color:#339966;"><em>In order that you may be brought up under My Eye</em></span>. Allah (may He be Exalted) says:(Surah Al-Qamar, 54: 14) <span style="color:#339966;"><em>Floating under Our Eyes</em></span>. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “Your Lord is not one-eyed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the same context, Allah (may He be Exalted) says:(Surah Al-Qalam, 68: 42) <span style="color:#339966;"><em>(Remember) the Day when the Shin shall be laid bare (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) and they shall be called to prostrate themselves (to Allaah), but they (hypocrites, and those who pray to show off or to gain good reputation) shall not be able to do so</em></span>. The Prophet (peace be upon him) interpreted the Ayah to mean that Allah (may He be Exalted) will uncover His Shin on the Day of Resurrection whereupon every believer will prostrate before Him out of reverence and there will remain those who used to prostrate before Him just for showing off and for gaining good reputation. These people will try to prostrate but they will not be able to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the same context, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “I saw my Lord (may He be Glorified and Exalted) in the best <strong><em>Soorah</em> (form)</strong>.”[1] He also said: “Allah created Adam in the <strong><em>Soorah</em>(Image)</strong> of The Most Beneficent.”[2] This is in addition to many <em>Nusus</em> (Islamic texts from the Qurýan or the Sunnah) including Allah’s Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) believe in these Attributes and confirm their indications without Tashbih (comparison) or Tamthil (likening Allah’s Attributes to those of His Creation). Allah (may He be Exalted) says:(Surah Al-Shura, 42: 11) <span style="color:#339966;"><em>There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</em></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta’ in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia after stating such facts, deems it obligatory for the editor-in-chief of the monthly Madinah Magazine issued from Dacca, Bangladesh, Shaykh Muhiy Al-Din Khan, to publish this Fatwa and demand the person who replied to the Fatwa request to retract his allegations and declare his retraction in the same magazine. In fact, it is virtuous to admit the truth, which is the goal of the believers. Admitting the truth guides the people to the truth and distracts them from falsehood. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: “If anyone calls others to follow right guidance, his reward will be equivalent to those who follow him (in righteousness) until the Day of Resurrection without their reward being diminished in any respect, and if anyone invites others to follow error, the sin will be equivalent to that of the people who follow him (in sinfulness) until the Day of Resurrection without their sins being diminished in any respect.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 3: I have not found the name &#8220;Al-Mawjud&#8221; (the existent) among Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes, but I have found the Name &#8220;Al-Wajid&#8221; (One that gives existence to others). I know linguistically, in Arabic, that a Mawjud (existent being) requires a Mujid (another derivative that also means a being that gives existence), as there has to be a being that performs every action. However it is impossible that Allah has a Mujid. I also noticed that Al-Wajid has the same meaning as Al-Khaliq (the Creator) and that Al-Mawjud has the same meaning as Al-Makhluq (the created). As there is a Mujid for every Mawjud and there is a Khaliq for every Makhluq, am I therefore permitted to describe Allah with the Attribute of Al-Mawjud?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Wujud (existence) of Allah is a well-established religious matter by necessity, and it is one of Allah&#8217;s Attributes according to the Muslim Ijma` (consensus). In fact, no rational person denies this; even the Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in worship) do not dispute this. Only a Dahri atheist (one who believes all matter is eternal and denies the Day of Resurrection) would deny it. Confirmation of the Wujud of Allah does not necessitate Him having a Mujid, because there are two kinds of Wujud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: <span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>Al-Wujud al-Dhati</strong> <span style="color:#000000;">(existence in being)</span></span>, which refers to an inherent existence in a being, rather than an acquired one from elsewhere. This type of Wujud applies to Allah (Glorified be He) and it is one of His Attributes, as His Wujud had nothing before or after it, as is indicated in the following Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse): He is the First (nothing is before Him) and the Last (nothing is after Him), the Most High (nothing is above Him) and the Most Near (nothing is nearer than Him). And He is the All-Knower of every thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: <span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>Al-Wujud al-Hadith</strong></span>, which means that a being comes into existence after being nonexistent. In this case, there must be a Mujid to bring it into existence, and that is its creator; Allah (Glorified be He). Allah (Exalted be He) says: Allâh is the Creator of all things, and He is the Wakîl (Trustee, Disposer of affairs, Guardian) over all things. To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth. Allah (Exalted be He) also says: Were they created by nothing? Or were they themselves the creators? Or did they create the heavens and the earth? Accordingly, Allah (Exalted be He) may be described as Mawjud and this term may be used in reference to Him. It may be said that Allah is Mawjud (Exists) as an Attribute, but it cannot be said that He is Al-Wajud (the Existent) as a Name.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">We find some of the verses of the Quran printed in the newspapers or writings, as well as, &#8220;In the name of Allah, the Compassionate. the Merciful&#8221;,[l] at the beginning of some papers or letters. What do we do with such verses after we are finished reading the newspaper or letter? Should we tear it up or burn it or what should be done?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;">It is a must, after one is done with the papers or pages that contain Allah&#8217;s name, to safeguard the papers, by <strong>burning</strong> them or <strong>burying</strong> them in clean soil.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;">This is to protect the Quranic verses and Allah&#8217;s names from being degraded. It is not allowed to throw them into the garbage heaps or into the street to use them as different kinds of sheets, such as table cloths. Otherwise, one is degrading the names and verses and not safekeeping them.</p>
<p><strong>Shaikh Ibn Baz</strong></p>
<p><strong>Footnote</strong> :<br />
1. Of course, the question is talking about these words being written in Arabic.&#8211;JZ (Translator)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Al-Sifat (the Attributes of Allah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 12: I read in the book of Tawdih Al-`Aqidah Al-Mufidah Fi `Ilm Al-Tawhid, that is a commentary by Shaykh Husayn Abdul-Rahim on Al-Mazidah that was written by Ahmad Al-Dardir. It is the second part of the course of the fourth year in the prepatory stage in Al-Azhar institutes. This fourth edition was verified also by Musa Ahmad, V. 4, on 1363 A.H, 1963 A.D. In this book, I read that the Attributes of Allah (Exalted be He) are twenty Attributes in the saying of a certain group as Al-Raziyah. In another saying Imam Al-Ash`ary and those who adopted his views said that the Attributes of Allah are thirteen Attributes. What is agreed upon according to this book is seven Attributes that are the Attributes of Al-Ma&#8217;any (the meanings). We would like to know what is incumbent upon us with regard to the Attributes of Allah and their number if they are seven, thirteen or twenty. If they are twenty Attributes, what is the meaning of His being Potent and Living. Are these books proper for studying the sound creed? I doubt such books, because the author of Al-Mazidah is Ash&#8217;ary. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I would like to follow the example of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community). I do not like to imitate Al-Asha`irah or others.Guide me to a book that talks about the Attributes of Allah according to the creed of Ahl-ul-Sunnah (those adhering to the Sunnah)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: `Aqidah of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is that Allah is described with the Attributes of Perfection.Moreover, Allah should be described with what He described Himself with in the Qur&#8217;an and what His Messenger (peace be upon him) described Him without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), Ta`til (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), Takyif (questioning Allah&#8217;s Attributes or Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation) according to His saying: There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Saying that they are twenty, seven or thirteen has no basis and contradicts the Qur&#8217;an, Sunnah and consensus of Muslim Ummah (nation).</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The book you have mentioned is not reliable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You can read the book called <strong>Al-&#8216;Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah</strong> by Ibn Taymiyyah with the commentary of Muhammad Khalil Al-Harras.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You can also read <strong>Al-Tadmuriyah</strong> and <strong>Al-Hamawiyah</strong> both written by Shaykh Al-Isalm Ibn Taymiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These three books have pointed out the creed of Ahl-ul-Sunnah (those adhering to the Sunnah) concerning the Names and Attributes of Allah and refuted the allegations of their opponents.</p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Tafseer Ibn Katheer of the above Verses (Darussalam Eng. publication)</strong></span></p>
<p>Allah, the Exalted, said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, the All-Knower of the unseen and the seen. He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah states that He Alone is worthy of worship, there is no Lord or God for the existence, except Him. All that is being worshipped instead of Allah are false deities. Allah is the All-Knower in the unseen and the seen, He knows all that pertains to the creations that we see, and those we cannot see. Nothing in heaven or on earth ever escapes His knowledge, no matter how great or insignificant, big or small, including ants in darkness. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.)</strong></span> was duly explained before at the very beginning of this Tafsir, so it is not necessary to repeat it here, and it asserts that Allah is the Owner of the wide encompassing mercy that entails all of His creation. He is Ar-Rahman and Ar-Rahim of this life and the Hereafter. Allah the Exalted said in other Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>And My mercy embraces all things.</strong>)(7:156),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Your Lord has written (prescribed) mercy for Himself.</strong>)(6:54), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Say: &#8220;In the bounty of Allah, and in His mercy; &#8212; therein let them rejoice.&#8221; That is better than what (the wealth) they amass.)</strong>(10:58) Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(He is Allah, beside Whom La ilaha illa Huwa, Al-Malik.)</strong></span> Al-Malik, meaning &#8220;The Owner and King of all things,&#8221; Who has full power over them without resistance or hindrance. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Al-Quddus,)</strong></span> meaning &#8220;The Pure,&#8221; according to Wahb bin Munabbih, while Mujahid and Qatadah said that Al-Quddus means &#8220;The Blessed.&#8221; Ibn Jurayj said that Al-Quddus means &#8220;He Whom the honorable angels glorify.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(As-Salam,)</strong></span> meaning &#8220;Free from any defects or shortcomings that lessen or decrease His perfect attributes and actions.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Al-Mu&#8217;min,)</strong></span> means &#8220;Who has granted safety to His servants by promising that He will never be unjust to them, &#8221; according to Ad-Dahhak who reported it from Ibn `Abbas. Qatadah said that Al-Mu&#8217;min means that &#8220;Allah affirms that His statements are true,&#8221; while Ibn Zayd said that it means, &#8220;He attested to His faithful servants&#8217; having faith in Him.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Al-Muhaymin,)</strong></span> means, according to Ibn `Abbas and others, &#8220;The Witness for His servants actions,&#8221; that is, the Ever-Watcher over them. Allah said in similar Ayat,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>And Allah is Witness over all things</strong>.)(58:6),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>and moreover Allah is Witness over what they used to do</strong>.)(10:46), and,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Is then He (Allah) Who takes charge (guards) of every person and knows all that he has earned</strong>)(13:33) Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Al-`Aziz,)</strong></span> meaning that &#8220;He is the Almighty, Dominant over all things.&#8221; Therefore, His majesty is never violated, due to His might, greatness, irresistible power and pride. Allah said;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Al-Jabbar, Al-Mutakabbir)</strong>,</span> meaning &#8220;The Only One worthy of being the Compeller and Supreme.&#8221; There is a Hadith in the Sahih Collection in which Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>Might is My Izar and pride is My Rida; if anyone disputes any one of them with Me, then I will punish him</strong>.) Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Glory be to Allah! (High is He) above all that they associate as partners with Him.)</strong></span>, then He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(He is Allah, Al-Khaliq, Al-Bari, Al-Musawwir.)</strong></span> Al-Khaliq refers to measuring and proportioning, Al-Bari refers to inventing and bringing into existence what He has created and measured. Surely, none except Allah is able to measure, bring forth and create whatever He wills to come to existence. Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(Al-Khaliq, Al-Bari, Al-Musawwir.)</strong> </span>means, if Allah wills something, He merely says to it &#8220;be&#8221; and it comes to existence in the form that He wills and the shape He chooses,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong>In whatever form He willed, He put you together.)</strong>(82:8) Allah describing Himself as being Al-Musawwir, Who brings into existence anything He wills in the shape and form He decides.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah the Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(To Him belong Al-Asma&#8217; Al-Husna (the Best Names).)</strong></span> We explained the meaning of this Ayah in the Tafsir of Surat Al-A`raf. The Two Sahihs recorded that Abu Hurayrah said that the Messenger of Allah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Allah the Exalted has ninety-nine Names, one hundred less one; whoever then preserves them, will enter Paradise. Allah is Witr (One) and He likes the Witr.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(All that is in the heavens and the earth glorify Him.)</strong></span> is similar to His other statement,</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second principle</strong>: Knowing the path which will lead to Him and that is His remembrance, being thankful to Him and His worship which is made up of complete love for Him and complete humility for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third principle</strong>: Knowing what they will receive after reaching Him from the blessings of being in the land of His Generosity (Paradise) of which the best and the most magnificent thing will be Allaah being pleased with them and His honouring them and them seeing His Face the most High, and Allaah’s Salaam upon them and Him talking to them.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim reported on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (radiallahu ‘anhu) that the Prophet sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has ninety nine names, one hundred minus one; and he who counts them all will enter Al-Jannah (the Garden Of Heaven), and Allah is &#8220;witr&#8221; (One) and loves the witr (i.e. odd numbers). [Al-Bukhaari, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasaai, Ibn Majah]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Counting” Allah&#8217;s ninety nine names means</strong>: knowing them, learning them by heart, understanding them, believing in them, good observance towards them, presentation of their boundaries in our dealings with Allah, and supplicating Allah through them. Thus, the hadeeth means that whoever committed those names to memory, contemplated their implications, respected their meanings, conducted himself in accordance with them, sanctified their Owner, such a person will surely be rewarded with the Gardens of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">There is a consensus among the scholars that Allah&#8217;s names are not confined to the number mentioned by the Prophet sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam)</span>. His sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) statement simply tells us that a Muslim who properly believes in and applies those ninety nine names will surely enter Al-Jannah. It does not negate the existence of other names for the Almighty. The Prophet sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) told us about entering Al-Jannah, not about the total number of Allah&#8217;s names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that there are other names which the Creator did not reveal to us, is the following hadeeth of the Prophet sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam): If any Muslim afflicted with distress or grief makes this supplication, his supplication will be accepted: &#8216;Oh Allah, I am Your slave, son of Your slave, son of Your maidservant. My forehead is in Your hand. Your command concerning me prevails, and Your decision concerning me is just. <strong><span style="color:#666699;">I call upon You by every one of the beautiful names by which You have described Yourself, or which You have revealed in Your Book, or have taught any one of Your creatures, or which You have chosen to keep in the knowledge of the unseen with You</span></strong>, to make the Qur&#8217;aan the delight of my heart, the light of my breast, and remove of any grief, sorrows, and afflictions&#8217;, Allah will remove one’s affliction and replace it with joy and happiness.&#8221; The Companions, then, said; &#8220;Do we have to learn these words?&#8221; The Prophet sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) replied: &#8220;Yes, any one who heard them should learn them. [Ahmed, Abu Awaana, Abu Ya’la, Al-Bazzar]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We reiterate the rule that the only names and attributes to be ascribed to Allah are those mentioned in the Qur’aan or in the authentic Sunnah; they are directly communicated to us and are not the products of opinion and interpretation. Allah is to be described only by the attributes with which He had described Himself or with which His Prophet sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) had described Him. And He is to be named only by the names with which He had named Himself or with which His Prophet sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam (sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) had named Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Reality of Ilhaad?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question 44: What is Ilhaad–concerning Allaah’s Names and Attributes?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Answer: The basic meaning of the term Ilhaad i.e. in the Arabic language, it means inclination. And from this is the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The tongue of the man they incline to is foreign, while this (the Qur’aan) is a clear Arabic tongue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Qur’aan, soorat an-Nahl (16): 103].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from it is the lahd in the grave, for it is called lahd because of its inclination towards a side of the grave. One cannot know the meaning of Ilhaad except by knowing the meaning of Istiqaamah (uprightness), since, as it is said, “Things become clear and distinct by the [meaning] of their contraries.” So, the Istiqaamah (uprightness) with regard to the subject of Allaah’s Names and Attributes is that we conform to their true and real meanings which befit Allaah, The Most Mighty and Most Majestic, without Tahreef (changing or twisting their wording and meanings), without Ta’teel (denying or divesting Allaah of His Attributes), without Takyeef (asserting how they are), and without Tamtheel (likening them to those of the creation), just as it has passed before in the foundation pertaining to this subject and which ahlus-Sunnah wal-jamaa’ah adhere to. Thus, if we know the meaning of al-Istiqaamah regarding this matter, then its is opposite is al-Ilhaad. And already the people of knowledge have mentioned several kinds of Ilahaad concerning the Names of Allaah, The Most High, which may be comprised by saying that it is deviating from the right course, with respect to that which is obligatory to believe in regarding them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, <strong>the first kind</strong> is for someone to deny some of the Names or any of the Attributes denoted by them. Like to deny the name Ar-Rahmaan as one of the Names of Allaah, just as the people of Jaahilyyah did; or to affirm the Names but deny the Attributes it comprises. Like the saying of some innovators: “Allaah, The Most High, is Ar-Raheem (The One Who Bestows Mercy) but without Rahmah (Mercy), Samee’ (all- Hearer) but without Sam’ (Hearing), al-Baseer (all-Seer) but without Basar (Seeing),” and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second Kind:</strong> He designates names to Allaah with which He did not Name Himself. The basis that this is considered Ilahaad lies in the fact that Allaah’s Names are contingent upon Revelation (tawqeefiyyah) so that it is not permitted for anyone to designate a name to Allaah with which He did not Name Himself. Since this is considered of saying things about Allaah of which one has no knowledge of, and also because it is a transgression against Allaah (Azza wa Jal) and His Right. And this is similar to what the philosophers have done, for they have designated the name “Active Cause” for “God”. And likewise with the Christians, for they have given the name “the Father” to Allaah, The Most High,–and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third Kind:</strong> He believes that these names denote attributes similar to those of the creation. Accordingly, he makes them indicative of Tamtheel. The basis that this is considered Ilahaad is that whoever believes that the Names of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) denotes likening of Allaah to His Creation, then he has made the Words of Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) infer unbelief. Because likening of Allaah to His Creation is unbelief, for it’s a denial of Allaah’s Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him, and He is The All-Hearing, The All Seeing.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat ash-Shura (42): 11], and of His Saying: <span style="color:#008000;">Do you know of any who is similar to Him?</span> [Qur’aan, soorat Maryam (19): 65].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Na’eem bin Hammad and al-Khuzaa’ee, the Shaykh of Imaam al-Bukhaaree, said: “Whoever likened Allaah to His Creation, then he has disbelieved, and whoever denied the Attributes by which Allaah qualified Himself with, then he has also disbelieved. And the Names by which Allaah Named Himself as well as the Attributes by which He qualified Himself, will not be called Tashbeeh (declaring Allaah to be like His Creation).” [65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Kind:</strong> He derives from the Names of Allaah, The Most High, names for idols. Like the derivation “al-Laat” from al-Ilaaah, “al-‘Uzzaa” from “al-‘Azeez,” and “minaat” from “al-Mannaan.” The basis that this is considered Ilahaad, is that Allaah’s Names are particular to Him. So it is not allowed to ascribe the meanings denoting these Names to any created being for the sake of offering him (her, or it) that which only Allaah deserves from worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the types of Ilhaad concerning the Names of Allaah, The One free of all imperfection, The Most High</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[65] Shaykh al-Albaanee, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said that the Isnaad of the narration from Hammad is saheeh [ath-Thahabee’s al- ’Uluw], p. 184. After reporting the above statement of Hammaad in Siyar ‘Alaam An-Nubalaa’, Imaam ath-Thahabee, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, commented, “This statement is true&#8230;”</p>

<blockquote><p>&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#0000ff;">So know that <em>Lâ ilâha ill-Allâh</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah)</span>&gt;&gt; [Muhammad: 19]</p></blockquote>
<p>There are nearly thirty <em>Ayaat</em> with these meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the mention of Allaah, regarding His ‘<em>Asmaa</em> and His <em>Sifaat</em> in the Qur’aan then there are many. There cannot be a comparison of His mentioning about His ‘<em>Asmaa</em> and <em>Sifaat</em> with any other topic, since His ‘<em>Asmaa</em> and <em>Sifaat</em> are the greatest thing mentioned in the Qur’aan and the best thing and the most exalted.</p>
<p><strong>Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah</strong> (d.728) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Qur’aan has more of a mention of the Names of Allaah and His <em>Sifaat</em> and His Actions, than the mention of food, drink and marriage in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Ayaat</em> which include the mention of the Names of Allaah and His <em>Sifaat</em> are greater in amount than the <em>Ayaat</em> of the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why the greatest <em>Ayaah</em> in the Qur’aan is the <em>Ayaat-ul-Kursi</em> which consists of the Names and <em>Sifaat</em> of Allaah.  As is established in the authentic hadeeth which is narrated by Muslim from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; that he said to Ubayy bin Ka’ab:</p>
<p>‘Do you know which <em>Ayah</em> in the Book of Allaah is the greatest?’</p>
<p>He answered: &lt;&lt; اللَّهُ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ    &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;Allaah! <em>Lâ ilâha illa Huwa</em> (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the Ever Living &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> patted him on his chest with his hand and said: ‘Knowledge congratulates you Abu al-Mundhir.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the best <em>Soorah</em> is the <em>Soorah Umm al-Qur’aan</em> (Al-Faatihah), as is established in the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed bin al-Mu’ala in Bukhari. [This wording is by Imaam Ahmad in ‘Musnad’ with an authentic chain]</p>
<p>The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p>In this <em>Soorah</em> there is a greater mention of the Names of Allaah and His <em>Sifaat</em> than the mention of the Last Day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established in the Saheeh of Bukhari from the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> from more than one narration that <em>Soorah</em> Al-Ikhlaas &lt;&lt; قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ  &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;Say: ‘He is Allaah, (the) One. &gt;&gt;  is equivalent to a third of the Qur’aan, and it is established in the Saheeh of Bukhari that the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> gave good news to the one who used to read this <em>Soorah</em> when he said: Indeed I love this <em>Soorah</em> because it contains the <em>Sifaat</em> of <em>ar-Rahman</em>; so due to that Allaah loved this person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this hadeeth explains that Allaah loves the one who loves the remembrance of the <em>Sifaat</em> of Allaah Subhaanahu wa Ta’ala, and this matter is a detailed one.’</p>
<p>[Taken from ‘<em>Fiqh</em> of <em>al-‘Asmaa</em> <em>al-Husna’</em> p.8-10]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>Copying the Divine Characteristics</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From <strong>`Abdul `Aziz Bin `Abdullah Ibn Baz</strong> to the honorable brother Shaykh: `A. S. H.; may Allah protect him! As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!). To commence: <span style="color:#ff0000;">I received your noble letter dated 23/3/1386 A.H., may Allah guide you! It included a question regarding what a Khatib (preacher) mentioned in the Friday Khutbah (sermon) on urging Muslims to acquire Allah&#8217;s Attributes and Characteristics. Is this acceptable? Was this acknowledged by any notable scholar?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This expression is improper, but it has a true meaning, which is urging people to acquire the good meanings of the Names and Attributes of Allah which befit them, not those peculiar to Allah (Glorified be He) such as the Creator, the Sustainer and the God. Such characteristics cannot be acquired by human beings, and it is impermissible for people to claim them. The same applies to similar Names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, Muslims can acquire the Attributes which Allah likes His Servants to acquire, such as being knowledgeable, powerful, merciful, patient, generous, forgiving, etc. He (Glorified be He) is Knowledgeable and He likes knowledgeable people; He is Powerful and He likes powerful people more than the weak; He is Generous and He likes the generous; He is Merciful and He likes the merciful; He is Forgiving and He likes the forgiving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, Allah&#8217;s Attributes are incomparable, greater and more perfect than those acquired by people, as there is nothing like Him (Glorified be He) in His Attributes and Actions, just as there is nothing like Him in His Entity. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">A person can only have a share of the meaning of these Attributes that befits them in a Shar`y (Islamic legal) way</span>. Accordingly, if a person becomes too generous, they are considered spendthrifts. If they become too merciful, they will hinder the execution of Hudud (pl. of Had i.e. an ordained punishment for violating Allah’s Law) and Ta`zir (discretionary punishment). If they become too forgiving, they will show forgiveness when it should not be shown.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The foregoing was stated by the prominent scholar Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah be merciful with him) in his two books entitled `Uddat Al-Sabirin and Al-Wabil Al-Sayyib. He might have also mentioned it in other books such as Al-Madarij, Zad Al-Ma`ad, and others.Following are his exact words on this regard in the two books mentioned above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Al-`Uddah p. 310, he said: &#8220;As Allah (Glorified be He) is the Thankful One in reality, the most beloved to Him among His creatures are the thankful, and the most hated to Him are those who acquire the opposite trait. This example also applies to the rest of Allah&#8217;s Most Beautiful Names. Allah thus detests the Kafir (disbelievers), the oppressor, the ignorant, the cruel, the miser, the coward, and the humiliated. He (Glorified be He) is Graceful and He loves grace; He is Knowledgeable and He loves knowledge; He is Merciful and He loves mercy; He is Bountiful and He loves Bounty; He is Concealing and He loves concealment; He is Powerful and He hates weakness, for a Mu&#8217;min (believer) of strong faith is nearer to Him than a weak one; He is Forgiving and He loves forgiveness; and He is Odd (One) and He loves odd numbers. Anything He loves is one of the meanings of His Names and Traits; and anything He detests is their opposite.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> said in (p. 543) of the Hadith Collection of Al-Wabil Al-Sayyib:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Generosity is one of the Attributes of Allah (Exalted be He); He gives and does not take; He feeds and is not fed; and He is the Most Generous One. The most beloved to Him is whoever acquires the same traits; He is Generous and He loves the generous; He is Knowledgeable and He loves the knowledgeable; He is Powerful and He loves the courageous; and He is Beautiful and He loves beauty. End of quote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that what we have mentioned is sufficient. May Allah guide us all to understand His religion and fulfill His rights. He is All-Hearer, Ever Near. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Merits of memorizing Allah&#8217;s Names</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: What is meant by the word &#8220;Ahsa'&#8221; in the Hadith that is related to the Messenger of Allah on the Names of Allah &#8220;Anyone who enumerates (Ahsa&#8217;) them will be admitted to Paradise.&#8221; ?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Ihsa&#8217; means to memorize, contemplate, understand and act according to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#993300;">Truly, Allahhas Ninety-nine Names. Anyone who enumerates them will be admitted to Paradise</span>.&#8221; and in another wording: &#8220;<span style="color:#993300;">Anyone who memorizes them by heart, will be admitted to Paradise</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means to memorize these Names by heart and understand their meaning as this entails goodness and useful knowledge. It also leads to the uprightness of the heart and the more a person will fear Allah and fulfill His Rights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Your Eminence Shaykh! Some people may count on such Hadiths and think that memorizing the Most Beautiful Names of Allah without effort is sufficient to be admitted to Paradise?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is a misunderstanding as such a Hadith urges Muslims to act according to what the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) prescribed and called for such as: &#8220;<span style="color:#993300;">Anyone who memorizes them by heart, they will be admitted to Paradise</span>.&#8221; with regard to the MostBeautiful Names of Allah, and: <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Fasting the Day of `Arafah (9th of Dhul-Hijjah) expiates the sins of two years: past one and coming one</span>.&#8221; Fasting on the Day of `Ashura’ (10th of Muharram) atones for the sins committed in the preceding year. All these Hadiths urge the Muslims to obey Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). It is one of the reasons of forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">When a Muslim pursues the means of forgiveness and does not insist on comitting major sins, this will be a reason for his forgiveness</span>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">If a Muslim does not avoid committing major sins, these will not take effect</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;The Five Obligatory Daily Prayers and from Friday Prayer to Friday Prayer, and from Ramadan to Ramadan, are expiations for what happened between them, provided the major sins were avoided.&#8221; And in another wording: &#8220;unless major sins are committed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">The Jumhur (dominant majority of scholars) holds the view that the promise of forgiveness that is stated in Hadith on the merits of such and such, such as the favor of Salah (Prayer) and how they erase one&#8217;s sins, or the favor of Wudu&#8217; (ablution), fasting on the Day of `Arafah (9th of Dhul-Hijjah), fasting on the Day of `Ashura’ (10th of Muharram) or Ihsa&#8217; the Most Beautiful Names of Allah, etc., is conditional upon avoiding major sins and uprightness</span>. These acts are reasons for having one&#8217;s sins forgiven in addition to the other reasons which Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) had legislated and avoiding major sins which prevent forgiveness.Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, And those who, when they have committed Fâhishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allâh and ask forgiveness for their sins; &#8211; and none can forgive sins but Allâh &#8211; and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know. One of the reasons for having sins not forgiven is insisting on committing sins and not repenting, there is neither might nor power except with Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To sum up</strong>: The Promise of Allah to admit anyone who memorizes the Beautiful Names of Allah to Paradise, anyone who fasts on the Day of `Ashura&#8217; to atone the sins committed in the preceding year, and fasting on the Day of `Arafah are all conditional upon abandoning major sins. This is also mentioned in a Hadith related to Tawhid (monotheism) such as: &#8220;Give the good news of entering Paradise to anyone who honestly testifies that there is no god but Allah.&#8221; This is conditional upon abandoning sins. If a person insists on doing sins, they are left to the Will of Allah; He may forgive him or He may throw them into Hell-Fire because of their sins and because they did not repent. When a person is purified of their sins, they will come out of Hell-Fire and will be admitted to Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Muslim should not rely on the Hadiths encouraging and promising good and refrain from the Hadiths and Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) of threatening. They should act according to both and beware of the things which Allah prohibited.They should remember the Hadiths and Ayahs that threaten those who transgress the limits set by Allah and disobey His Commands and at the same time they should anticipate good from Allah, hope for His Mercy and remember His Promise to forgive anyone who performs good deeds. A person should combine between Khawf (fear) and Raja&#8217; (hope). A Muslim should not despair or feel secure. This is the way of the scholars and the believers. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says about His prophets: Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear , i.e., hope and fear and used to humble themselves before Us. And Those whom they call upon [like ‘Isâ (Jesus) &#8211; son of Maryam (Mary), ‘Uzair (Ezra), angel] desire (for themselves) means of access to their Lord (Allâh), as to which of them should be the nearest; and they [‘Isâ (Jesus), ‘Uzair (Ezra), angels and others] hope for His Mercy and fear His Torment. This is the path of the believers who follow the Messengers. They believe in Allah Alone, fear Him, perform His obligatory acts, refrain from the things which He has prohibited, put their hopes in Him, and fear His Punishment.</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: A person from Chad asks: Are the actions of Allah Qadimah (eternal) or Hadithah (adaptable) or both? And if both, how is this so? May Allah reward you with the best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Basically, the actions (or Attributes describing the Actions) of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) are <strong>Qadimah</strong>;<strong><span style="color:#666699;"> He ever has always had His Attributes even before creating anything</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has been, is and will always be the Creator. At all times He is the One able to do all that He wills. He does what He wills at the time He wills. But His Actions come to pass in relation to the conditions of His Creation. To illustrate this, Allah created Adam from nothingness. Likewise, He created the Angels, heavens, the earth, and everything else. Thus, we know that Allah is the Creator at all times, but He &#8220;creates&#8221; when He wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example, Allah was pleased with the believers of the past and He will be so with those of the future; Allah was angry with the disbelievers among the people of the past and he will be so with the disbelievers that will come. Thus, the basic characteristics of Allah&#8217;s Action and Attributes are Qadimah.</p>
<p>The Attributes of Allah may be divided into two main categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first category is <strong>Sifat Dhatiyah (Allah&#8217;s Intrinsic and Essential Attributes)</strong>, such as knowledge, hearing, sight, etc. These are the Attributes which do not cease to exist nor will ever cease to be descriptive of Him [Note: There is no similarity between Allah&#8217;s Attributes and that of His Creatures]. Thus, Allah (Glorified be He) has been and will always be described as the All-Hearer, the All-Seer, the All-Knower, the All-Powerful, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second category is <strong>Sifat Fi`liyah</strong>, and these are the Attributes, which describe the actions of Allah and are connected to His Mashi&#8217;ah (Will) in relation to the variable nature of His Creation. For instance, Allah (Glorified be He) created the heavens and the earth, Adam, Paradise, and Hellfire, etc., after they were all nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The creation of all of them is subject to time, that is, it happens at an appropriate time. This does not deny the fact that Allah (Glorified be He) is the &#8216;Khaliq&#8217; (Creator of all things), the Omnipotent over all things, etc. These Attributes are originally intrinsic of Allah, but Allah does whatever He wills at the time He wills. In the Qur&#8217;an, Allah (Exalted be He) says about Himself: <span style="color:#993300;">[Verily, (O Muhammad Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam)) the Seizure (punishment) of your Lord is severe and painful. [See V.11:102]. Verily, He it is Who begins (punishment) and repeats (punishment in the Hereafter) (or originates the creation of everything, and then repeats it on the Day of Resurrection). And He is Oft-Forgiving, full of love (towards the pious who are real true believers of Islâmic Monotheism), Owner of the throne, the Glorious, (He is the) Doer of whatsoever He intends (or wills</span>)]. Also, He (Glorified be He) says about Himself: <span style="color:#993300;">Verily, Allâh does what He wills</span>. Thus, Allah (Glorified be He) does what He wills, in the past and in the future. Allah is the Creator of all things at all times; He created and He is still creating, etc. He (Glorified be He) is the All-Powerful, the All-Knower, the Ever-Living, the One Who sustains and protects all that exists, the All-Hearer, the All-Seer,&#8230;etc.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q 5: What is the difference between takyif and tamthil regarding the Names and Attributes of Allah (Exalted be He)?</span></p>
<p>Ans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <strong>Takyif</strong> (questioning Allah&#8217;s Attributes) regarding Allah&#8217;s Attributes is close to that of Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation), except that <strong>Tamthil</strong> is to believe that Allah&#8217;s Attributes are the same as those of His Creation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Takyif means believing that Allah&#8217;s Attributes are in such and such way even if they are not like one of the creatures&#8217; attributes. If someone says that the attribute of the Hand of Allah (Exalted be He), for example, is like their hand or is like the hand of so and so, in this way they have likened Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation (Tamthil). If they say that the hand is in the shape and form of such and such thing but does not liken it to any creature, in this way they have questioned the way and mode of Allah&#8217;s Attributes (Takyif).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The outcome is that all these forms are invalid and deviation of the words from their real meanings.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Merit of memorizing the Magnificent Names of Allah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Allah has ninety-nine names; anyone who memorizes them will enter Jannah (Paradise). Does this mean that anyone who memorizes the Names of Allah will enter Jannah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is one of the Hadiths that promise Jannah and speaks of virtues and good deeds. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Allah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one. Anyone who learns them will enter Jannah. According to another narration: Anyone who memorizes them will enter Jannah. (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith urges us to consider carefully, ponder over, memorize and learn the Names of Allah, so that we can benefit from their great meanings, gain Khushu` (the heart being submissively attuned to the act of worship), obey Allah and fulfill our duty towards Him(Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who memorizes the Names of Allah, fulfills their duties towards Him, and shuns the major sins will be admitted to Jannah while those who commit major sins subject themselves to Allah&#8217;s Wrath and their fate is left to His Will: He may punish them or admit them to Jannah. Memorizing and learning the Names of Allah is one means to enter Jannah if a person does not commit major sins. Attaining Jannah has certain conditions that must be fulfilled and certain obstacles that must be avoided. Committing sins is one of the obstacles which prevent one from entering Jannah with those who will enter first. A Muslim who commits sins and does not repent before death will eventually enter Jannah after being punished and purified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allah may forgive and admit them to Jannah without punishment. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The Fve (Obligatory Daily) Prayers, from one Jumu’ah (Friday Prayer) to the next and from one Ramadan to the next are expiation for (sins committed) in between, as long as major sins have been avoided. Major sins include those prohibited acts for which a warning of severe punishment is given. These include all those which incur Allah&#8217;s Wrath, and are cursed by our Prophet (peace be upon him) such as Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage), consuming Khamr (intoxicant), undutifulness to parents, involvement in Riba (usury/interest), Ghibah (backbiting), Namimah (tale-bearing), etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some major sins whose committers will be left to Allah&#8217;s Will: He may forgive and admit them to Jannah due to their belief in His Oneness and their Islam or punish them in a manner commensurate with their sins and eventually bring them out of the Fire and into Jannah after purifying them of their sins. There are various Hadiths Mutawatir (Hadiths reported by a significant number of narrators throughout the chain of narration, whose agreement upon a lie is impossible) reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that indicate that many disobedient Muslimswill enter the Fire because of their sins and will be punished in a manner commensurate with these sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards, the disobedient will be taken out of the Fire due to the Shafa`ah (intercession) of the Prophet (peace be upon him), angels, other prophets, and the children who died before they reached the age of puberty while others will be granted forgiveness due to Allah&#8217;s Mercy. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those disobedient Muslims are subject to Allah&#8217;s Will: He may forgive them and admit them to Jannah, or punish them in a manner commensurate with their sins and then take them out of the Fire as they will not stay therein forever. None will abide eternally in the Fire except the Kafir (disbeliever) and Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) who will not be forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, disobedient Muslims will not remain eternally in the Fire, according to Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) unlike the Khawarij (separatist group that believes committing a major sin amounts to disbelief) and Mu`tazilah (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that those who commit major sins are in a state between belief and disbelief) who believe that the disobedient will stay eternally in the Fire. However, Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah hold the view that the disobedient who have died as Muslims believing in the Oneness of Allah, but have not repented of their sins shall be subject to Allah&#8217;s Will. May Allah grant us all success!</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Will the one who memorize the Magnificent Names of Allah be admitted to Jannah (Paradise)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is reported in a Hadith Sahih (authentic Hadith) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Allah has ninety-nine names, one hundred less one. Anyone who learns them will enter Jannah. According to another narration: Anyone who memorizes them will enter Jannah. These ninety-nine Names were not reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in any Hadith Sahih. However, the Muslim who is guided to learning them, by heart and put into action &#8211; and they are ninety-nine Names, is promised that goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above is one of the Hadiths which speak of the virtues of memorizing the ninety-nine Names of Allah, provided that one does not die while insisting on committing major sins because they are one of the causes that deprive a person from entering Jannah and cause him to be thrown into the Fire, unless one attains Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basic principle is that unrestricted Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and Hadiths should be interpreted in light of restricted ones, because neither the Ayah nor the Hadith contradicts each other. They rather confirm one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise). Therefore, Allah indicates that avoiding major sins is a condition for expiating sins and entering Jannah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, The Five (Obligatory Daily) Prayers, from one Jumu’ah (Friday Prayer) to the next and from one Ramadan to the next are expiation for (sins committed) in between, as long as major sins have been avoided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who memorize the ninety-nine Magnificent Names of Allah but commit Zina or consume Khamr are subject to Allah&#8217;s punishment and will be thrown into the Fire unless they repent and Allah forgives them.Contrary to the belief of Khawarij and Mu`tazilah, Muslims who believe in the Oneness of Allah will not abide eternally in the Fire for committing major sins. Those sinful people will be punished in a manner commensurate with their sins and then Allah will take them out of the Fire due to His Grace and Kindness. None will abide forever in the Fire except those whom the Qur&#8217;an and the Hadith rule as Kafir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A disobedient person such as a fornicator, a thief, and those who are undutiful to their parents etc., will not abide eternally in the Fire. The disobedient, who did not repent of their sins before death, will not abide in the Fire forever. They are threatened to suffer the torment of the Fire. If Allah forgives them, He (Glorified and Exalted be He) is the Source of Generosity and Benevolence; otherwise He will punish them to a degree commensurate with their sins and will eventually take them out of the Fire after being purified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) informed us in many concurrent Hadiths that the disobedient will be taken out of the Fire and he (peace be upon him) will intercede several times for them as will the angels, the believers, and the children who died before reaching the age of puberty. This is the truth which Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah follow and which differs from the view of Khawarij and Mu`tazilah. The view of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah is supported by Allah&#8217;s statement in His Noble Book: Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states that if one commits sins, the matter is subject to His Will but He will not forgive whoever dies as a Mushrik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who dies as Mushrik will not be forgiven and will reside eternally in the Fire. A Mushrik is not considered to be one of Ahl-ul-Fatrah (people having no access to Divine Messages) or those who come under the same ruling as them, we seek refuge with Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever dies before repenting of their sins shall be subject to Allah&#8217;s Will; if He wills, He can pardon themout of His Grace, and if He wills He can punish them in a manner commensurate with their sins and then take them out of the Fire by His immense Bounty and Mercy after they have been purified. Khawarij and Mu`tazilah hold a different view, as they believe that the disobedient will remain eternally in the Fire but according to the followers of the Truth, this is false.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Your Eminence, it was reported on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: Allah has ninety-nine Names, one hundred less one. Anyone who &#8216;ahsaha&#8217; will enter Jannah. Does the word &#8216;ahsaha&#8217; mentioned in the Hadith mean memorizing or just reading them? Please advise me, may Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This Hadith was related in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the Prophet (peace be upon him). It was reported in two different wordings: first, &#8220;ahsaha&#8221; and second, anyone who memorizes them, will enter Jannah. The word &#8216;ahsaha&#8217; means to memorize by heart and to act according to them. Thus, whoever learns the Names of Allah by heart and acts accordingly will be admitted to Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if one memorizes the Names of Allah by heart, but does not act or believe in them, they will be of no avail. The word &#8216;ahsaha&#8217; means to memorize and act upon them. Therefore, it is Wajib upon whoever memorizes Allah&#8217;s Names to act accordingly. For example, a person should be &#8216;Rahim&#8217;, i.e. show mercy to others and should also believe that Allah is Al-`Aziz (the Ever-Mighty), Al-Hakim (the Most Wise), Al-Ra&#8217;uf (the Most Compassionate), Al-Rahim (the Most Beneficent), Al-Qadir (the All Powerful) Who has unlimited knowledge of all things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such a person should fear Allah and remember that He is watching them and should not persist in committing sins of which HisLord knows. They should avoid sins and all forms of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should exert all his efforts to memorize and act upon the Names of Allah, believe in Him and His Messenger, affirm the Names and the Attributes which Allah has affirmed for Himself in a manner befitting His majesty without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), Ta`til (negation of the meaning or function of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), Takyif (descriptive designation of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), or Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation) and believe that Allah is Perfect in His Essence, His Names, His Attributes and His Deeds, with no peer, equal or rival. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says in His Noble Book: Say (O Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam): &#8220;He is Allâh, (the) One. &#8220;Allâh-us-Samad  [Allâh the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither eats nor drinks)]. &#8220;He begets not, nor was He begotten. &#8220;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&#8221; .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One must believe that Allah is the Self-Sufficient, Who is similar to nothing and nothing is comparable to Him; Whom all creatures need, Who is Perfect in His Essence, Who neither begets nor was He begotten, and Whom none is co-equal or is similar to Him. Allah (Exalted be He) says: There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. And: Do you know of any who is similar to Him? And: So put not forward similitudes for Allâh (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor He resembles anything).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing equal, comparable, or that can rival Allah (Exalted be He). He is Perfect in all things; His Knowledge, His Essence, His Wisdom, His Mercy, His Honor, His Power, and in all His Names which if one memorizes and acts accordingly, will allow them admission to Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if the disobedient memorize and enumerate the Names of Allah, they will be subject to Allah&#8217;s Will; if He wills, He may forgive them, and if He wills He may punish them and eventually admit them to Jannah after they are taken out of the Fire and are purified provided that they have died as Muslims believing in the Oneness of Allah. Allah (Glorified be He) says: If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Major sins include all forms of Shirk, Kufr (disbelief), and the sins that were forbidden by Allah and their doers cursed, and warned of a severe punishment and Allah&#8217;s Wrath. The servant to Allah, male and female, must shun them for Allah (Glorified be He) says: If you avoid the great sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall expiate from you your (small) sins i.e., the minor sins and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The Five (Obligatory Daily) Prayers, from one Jumu’ah (Friday Prayer) to the next and from one Ramadan to the next are expiation for (sins committed) in between, as long as major sins have been avoided. According to another narration: &#8230;so long as major sins are not committed. Major sins include Zina, theft, undutifulness to parents, severing the ties of kinship, consuming Riba, Ghibah, Namimah, fleeing during battle, and magic, in addition to other sins which Allah forbids.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, memorizing the Magnificent Names of Allah is one means of true happiness and being admitted into Jannah provided that one acts according to them, remains steadfast in obeying Allah and His Messenger, and does not persist in committing major sins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah in regard to Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes? </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">And what is the difference between a Name and an Attribute? </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">And does affirmation of a Name necessitate affirmation of an Attribute, and (likewise) does affrimation of an Attribute necessitate affirmation of a Name?</span></p>
<p><strong>Response</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah in regard to Allaah&#8217;s Names and His Attributes is affriming that which Allaah has affirmed for himself from the Names and Attributes, without:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>tahreef</strong> (changing/distorting a Name and/or Attribute of Allaah to other than its true meaning, i.e. from Allaah to al-Laat, and al-&#8216;Azeez to al-&#8216;Uzzah);</li>
<li><strong>ta&#8217;teel</strong> (denying some or all of Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes);</li>
<li><strong>takyeef</strong> (questioning as to &#8220;how&#8221; (Allaah&#8217;s Name or Attribute is), i.e. How does Allaah descend, etc.?);</li>
<li><strong>tamtheel</strong> (to imply a similarity between Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes and that of His creation).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the difference between a Name and an Attribute is that a Name is that which Allaah has named Himself by; and an Attribute is that which Allaah has described Himself by. And between them is a clear difference.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a Name is that which is considered a Name of Allaah (Subhaanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala), (and that) which incorporates an Attribute.And affirmation of a Name necessitates affirmation of an Attribute. For example: al-Ghafoor (the Most Forgiving) is a Name, and (its affirmation) necessitates the (affirmation of the) Attribute of Maghfirah (Forgiveness);<br />
And ar-Raheem (the Most Merciful) is a Name and (its affirmation) necessitates the affirmation of ar-Rahmah (Mercy).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the affirmation of an Attribute does not necessitate the affirmation of a Name. For example: al-Kalaam (Speech) does not necessitate the affirmation of the Name al-Mutakallim (the Speaker) for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, based upon this, the Names are more wider (in scope), since every Name encompasses an Attribute, however, every Attribute does not encompass a Name.</p>
