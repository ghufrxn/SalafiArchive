<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmad an-Najmi -Rahimhullah Rahmatin Waseeyah- said about Shaykh Muhammad bin Ramzaan Al-Haajiree:</p>
<p>&#8220;He is from the heads of Ahl AlSunnah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Similarly in the report of Naif Al-Mutairi &#8211; one of the Shaykh&#8217;s students- mentioned:</p>
<p>I narrate to you a conversation of one our brothers who telephoned Sheikh Ubaid Al-Jaabiree -may Allaah protect him- seeking a fatwa about an issue. And the Sheikh (Al-Jabiree) was busy, so he asked our brother, &#8220;Where are you from?&#8221; He said, &#8220;From Al-Jubail.&#8221; So the Shaykh (Al-Jabiree) said, &#8220;With you is Muhammad Ibn Ramzan, so call him and ask him.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By al-&#8216;Allaamah Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wassaabee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Overview</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who is al-&#8216;Allaamah Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wassaabee?<br />
He is from amongst the senior (eldest) students of Imaam Muqbil Ibn Haadee al-Waadi&#8217;ee (rahimahullaah), to the extent that Shaykh Muqbil referred to Shaykh Muhammad as &#8216;my khaleefah.&#8217; His specialty is in Fiqh (Islaamic jurisprudence), and he has a centre of Islaamic studies in Hudaydah, Yemen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Lecture :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wasaabee states, &#8216;If the Muslim knows the legislated means and doors towards gaining sustenance of which Allaah has mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) has mentioned and carries these legislated means out, he will have gained what has been promised to him. Sometimes these doors are called the door towards attaining sustenance or the means of sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the doors are :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Al-Istiaqaamah (Steadfastness in the Religion) : Allaah says, &#8216;and if only they had believed in Allaah and had Istiqaamah on the right way, We would surely have bestowed upon them water (rain) in abundance.&#8217; So Istiqaamah on the Book and the Sunnah and holding onto them wholeheartedly is a door from the doors of relief from discomfort, a door from the doors of sustenance.<br />
2. Eemaan (Faith) : al-&#8216;Eemaan is a door from the doors of relief of difficulty, a door from the doors towards attaining rizq (provision). &#8216;Eemaan in Allaah and his books, and his angels, the last day, qadr (divine decree), its good and it&#8217;s bad, the Qur&#8217;aan, the Rasool (Messenger), the pure prophetic Sunnah and what is contains.<br />
3. Taqwaa (Fear and consciousness of Allaah) : &#8216;And if the people of the towns had Taqwaa and had piety, certainly We would have opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth. But they belied the Messengers so We took them with punishment for what they used to earn..&#8217; Whoever has Taqwaa of Allaah, Allaah provides for him from where he would never have expected, where his mind would never have though about. However, Taqwaa of Allaah provided these means for him and gave him ease.<br />
4. Tawakkal ilallaah (having trust in Allaah) : If you placed your trust in Allaah, a true trust in Allaah, Allaah would have provided for you like the bird who goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening full. Having trust in Allaah, not on oneself, not on the pocket, not on the job, not on the friend, not on the merchant, not on the car or the store you might own. That is just a means that you work with, however it is obligatory for your heart to be dependant on Allaah.<br />
5. Ash-Shukr (Giving thanks) : Not giving shukr decreases one&#8217;s good deeds, if you give thanks to Allaah, Allaah will increase you and Allaah does not go back on a promise. Always make your tongue used to giving thanks to Allaah, even a little. &#8216;Do work, O family of Daawood with thanks, and few of my servants are thankful.&#8217;<br />
6. Dhikr (Acts of Obedience and Remembrance) : A person who remains upon the remembrance of Allaah will have a pleasant life, whoever turns away from remembrance will have a wretched life.<br />
7. Zakaat (Charity) : It is upon the Muslim to fear Allaah with Zakaat, it is from the five pillars of Islaam. Give Zakaat from the apparent and the non-apparent, from the jewellery and possessions.<br />
8. Sadaqaat (non-obligatory charity) : &#8216;Spending on one&#8217;s parents, family and companions. The angels make du&#8217;aa for the one who spends, that Allaah replenishes them, and another makes du&#8217;aa that the one who refrains from spending that his wealth is destroyed. Allaah says &#8216;whoever does even an atoms worth he will see it and whoever spends in the path of Allaah, Allaah will replace it&#8217;.<br />
9. Du&#8217;aa (Supplication) : Allaah says, &#8216;Call on Me and I will answer you&#8217;. Allaah orders us to supplicate; supplication should be made for one&#8217;s rizq. &#8216;O Allaah give us the good in this life and the hereafter and save us from the Fire&#8217;. The Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) used to say this du&#8217;aa.<br />
10. al-Birr (The Righteous) : A door from the doors of relief, &#8216;Verily the pious people will be in the paradise and the evil doers will be in the hellfire Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (Rahimahullaah) stated that this ayah refers to the dunyaa (worldly life), the barzakh (the period between death and the day of resurrection) and the Aakhirah (hereafter) contrary to what people comprehend.<br />
11. Material Means : The means from the material means are also from the means of sustenance but self-control must be observed, knowing that dependency is upon Allaah alone. It is merely a means by which you work. We Should say &#8216;O Allaah, this is the means by which you provide for me if it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that Allaah provided we wouldn&#8217;t have used it. When Maryam (alayhis-salaam) was in her post-natal bleeding, Allaah says &#8216;And shake the trunk of the date palm before you and it will provide ripe dates for you. We are not dervishes who do nothing, we work by the means but we do not go by means which are unlegislated by Allaah. Many of those who are obsessed with their means fall to diabetes and Cancer, their minds obsessed with their work.<br />
12. Holding Fast to the Book and the Sunnah : And if only they had established the Toraah and the Injeel, they would have eaten from above them and under their feet.&#8217; If this is in regards to those who should have held on to the scriptures then it is pivotal to hold on to the book and the Sunnah. We have mentioned 11 of which are abstract and now we mention the last which is physical.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Khutbatul Haajah the Sheikh mentions our subject tonight deals with: The means of getting sustenance and the doors towards sustenance. This subject in which everyone likes it, however many of them went wrong in the way of going about it. So, the Muslim knows the legislated means and doors towards attaining sustenance of which Allaah has mentioned in the Qura&#8217;an and of the Messenger has mentioned and carried those legislated means out he would have gained what has been promised to him. And sometimes these means are called &#8216;Abwaabur Rizq&#8217; or &#8216;Abwaabul Furaj&#8217; i.e doors towards relaxation and relief or if you wish to say &#8216;Abwaabul Rizq&#8217; – doors towards obtaining sustenance or if you wish then say &#8216;Asbaabur Rizq&#8217; i.e the means of sustenance. So the first means insha-Allaah (the students of knowledge should write these down in the notebooks with the proofs which we will mention from the Qura&#8217;an and the Sunnah). The Sheikh continues with the first door of means is :<br />
1. Al-Istiaqaamah (Steadfastness on the Deen of Allaah) : Al-Istiqaamah of the Deen is a door from the doors of relief from difficulty and a door from the doors of sustenance and a means from the means of sustenance. Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says,<br />
&#8216;and if only they had believed in Allaah and had Istiqaamah on the right way, We would surely have bestowed upon them water (rain) in abundance.&#8217;<br />
So Istiqaamah on the Book and the Sunnah and holding onto them wholeheartedly without increasing in them or taking away from them, this is a door from the doors of relief from discomfort, and a door from the doors of sustenance and a means from its means. On the contrary it is from the greatest means of Rizq in the Dunya and the Aakhirah. And if you knew the following means you would have known how much the people had gone away from them these days except whom Allaah has had mercy on. They want Rizq but they went wrong in the ways of attaining it and the doors towards it and its means except who Allaah has had mercy on them and they are very few. Even to the point where it might come to the thought of a person that if he wants rizq all he has to do is engross himself in pursuing the dunya and leave off the &#8216;Asbaab-al-Shar&#8217;eeah&#8217; – (that is the means designated by the Shariah). So he doesn&#8217;t find except adverse hardship and you ofcourse know what rain has of benefits for the Ummah. The Sheikh mentions the ayah in Surahtul Anbiah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We made all things living from water.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When rain comes, i.e the rain that has the mercy of Allaah with it, all of the good in turn comes – the earth vegetates fruits and various herbs and waters in rivers become plentiful and the cattle and the riding beasts benefit and the good of humans and animals become abundant and agriculture becomes successful and ghee and honey becomes abundant, and sheep, cattle becomes abundant and the market prices become lower. And even the heat it gets lowered a great deal from the people. The Sheikh mentions the ayah again :<br />
&#8216;and if only they had Istiqaamah on the right path, We would have given them water (rain) from the sky in abundance.&#8217;<br />
And Istiqaamah as you know as Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;That is verily those who say, &#8220;Our Lord is Allaah, then they have Istiqaamah, the angels descend upon them saying, &#8216;have no fear and do not be sad and have good tidings of Jannah (Paradise) that you have been promised. We are your protecting friends in the Dunya and in the Aakhirah. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whomsoever has Allaah as his wali or his protecting friend and has the angels as his awliyaah, his protecting friends, will Allaah leave that person to be by himself without any protection? Whoever thinks that Allaah will let go to waste his awliyaah, the ones that are close to Him, that hold firm to the Book and the Sunnah – then he has thought negatively about Allaah. So, the first door from the doors of rizq is Istiqaamah upon the Deen. And visualize the time that the people were Mustaqeemeen – when they had Istiqaamah upon the Book and the Sunnah.<br />
Ibn Qayyim (rahimahullah) he mentioned in his book &#8216;Zaad al-Maad&#8217; that he found a grain of wheat the size of a date stone. The Sheikh reiterates : a grain of wheat the size of a date stone. And a cucumber the length of it being such and such … This is barakah from Allaah. So then Istiqaamah would probably lead to having a tomato that would need two people to hold it, a water melon which needs 5 or 6 people to hold it – i.e if there is present holding to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah, no bid&#8217;ah, no khurafaath (superstitions &amp; folklore), no sheer foolishness, no magic, no taking of intoxicants, no ribaa and no zinaa, no &#8216;liwaath&#8217; &#8212; no sodomy and no lying and no fujoor – witness evil doing and no &#8216;shahaadatuz zoor&#8217; &#8212; bearing witness to falsehood, and no wicked oath and not putting off of the prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With Istiqaamah there will be present an abundance of good by the permission of Allaah. Our forefathers mentioned to us (May Allaah forgive us and them and all the Muslims) that they used to sell a young sheep for a Riyal. So, they eat its meat and sell its skin for a Riyal. So he slaughters it, he eats it with his family, his neighbours and whoever comes and at the end of it he sells the skin for a Riyal. He didn&#8217;t lose anything. So Isthiqaamah its affair is great in this Dunya and Aakhirah, in your Deen and dunya and in your Barzaakh, in your Aakhirah if you held on to the Kitaab and the Sunnah.<br />
And the second means is Eemaan and Taqwa : i.e the second and third. Now we have three means, Eemaan and Taqwa. As Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says :<br />
&#8221;And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwaa or piety, certainly We would have opened for them blessings from the heavens and the earth. But they belied or denied the Messengers so We took them with punishment for what they used to earn. Did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment by night while they were asleep? Or did the people of the towns then feel secure against the coming of Our punishment in the forenoon while they were playing? Did they then feel secure against the plan of Allaah? None feels secure from the plan of Allaah except the people who are losers.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first three means he returns he says with the ayah : walaw anna ahlal Qura ..&#8217; and &#8216;Qura&#8217; here encompasses al-Qura wal Mudah. i.e the word Qura means villages and he says this ayah encompasses both villages and cities. And Makkah is the Ummul Qura as you know. This is not specific to villages but on the contrary villages, cities and all. He repeats the ayah :<br />
&#8216;If only the people of the cities had believed and had taqwa, We would have opened for them the blessings from the heavens and the earth.&#8217;<br />
Henceforth al-&#8216;Eemaan is a door from the doors of relief from difficulty, and a door from the doors towards attaining rizq (provision) and a means from the means Rizq. &#8216;Eemaan in Allaah and His Books, and His angels, the Last Day and in Qadr (Divine decree), its good and its bad, the belief or Eemaan in the Qur&#8217;aan and in what the Qur&#8217;aan contains, Eemaan in the Rasool (Messenger) and what he came with from Allaah, Eemaan in the pure prophetic Sunnah and what it contains.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If they believed and had piety, We would have opened up for them the blessings from the heavens and the earth.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as He said (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) :<br />
&#8216;And whoever has Taqwaa of Allaah, Allaah makes for him a way out and provides for him from where he would not expect.&#8217;<br />
The Sheikh reiterates that &#8216;He would have provided for him from where he never would have expected – from where his mind would never have thought about it. And hence not expecting that he would find this prepared blessing, the blessed sustenance from this source. However, taqwa of Allaah prepared for him these different ways and made ease for him the means.&#8217;<br />
The Sheikh reiterates: &#8216;He would make for him a way out and provide for him from where he would not expect.&#8217;<br />
We want rizq. However we lost gaining it by its legislated ways except whom Allaah has had mercy on. Rizq by lying and playing and zig zagging, stealing and deceit, evil plotting : &#8216;O people&#8217; the Sheikh implores : Is this the way to get rizq? You are right now spreading up the establishment, you are right now speeding up the establishment of punishment on yourself and torment if you disobey Allaah. Therefore why not hold onto the deen and have glad tidings of good and have glad tidings of relief from hardship?<br />
So right now we have three doors : Al-Istiqaamah, al-Eemaan and Taqwa.<br />
The fourth door is : Tawakkal alallaah (having trust in Allaah) : The Prophet said, (as recorded in Tirmidhi &amp; Ahmad) &#8216;If you placed your trust in Allaah, a true trusting in Allaah, Allaah would provide for you just like he provides for the birds. It goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening full.&#8217;<br />
At-tawakkal alallaah – &#8216;having trust in alAllaah, not on oneself, not on the pocket, not on the bag, not on the job or employment, not on the friend, not on the merchant, not on the farm, not on the car or the store you might own. That is just a means that you work. It is nothing more than a means. However it is obligatory for your heart to be dependant on Allaah and to trust in Allaah.<br />
He alahis-salaatu wassalaam, you have heard him say : If you put your trust in Allaah, a true trusting in Allaah, He would have sustained or provided for you as He provides for the birds. That is the rizq or the sustenance of the bird is easy. i.e the sustenance of the bird is very easy. It goes out in the morning hungry and returns in the evening satisfied with their bellies filled not with difficulty. It gets its rights with ease and then returns and birds are of many types. Take notice. Some of those birds are those that are big and don&#8217;t eat except meat. And Allaah azzawajal gives it meat. And every bird takes what Allaah has decreed for it. And no one enumerates it except Allaah and the amount that no one can enumerate except Allaah and their sustenance is due upon Allaah. i.e He will sustain it. And He mentions the ayah :<br />
&#8216;And so many a moving creature carries not its own provision. Allaah provides for it and for you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And there is no moving creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah and He knows its dwelling and its deposit i.e in the uterus or in the grave. All is in a clear Book.&#8217;<br />
He is talking about the &#8216;Lawh al Mahfudh&#8217; &#8212; the Book of Decree which is with Allaah.<br />
&#8216; We have not created the Jinn and the mankind except that they should worship Me. I do not want from them sustenance nor do I want them to feed Me. Verily Allaah is the One that provides. He is the Owner of Power and Strong.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;In the sky is your sustenance and what you are promised and by the Lord of the sky or the Heavens and the earth, verily it is the truth just like it is the truth that you can speak. Verily it is the truth that Allaah is Ar-Razzaak and your rizk is with Allaah and it is written for you and that is coming to you and there is no doubt about it.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Sheikh reiterates : Verily by the Lord of the Heavens and the earth, it is true, just like it is true that you can speak. However where is the Eemaan in the Book and the Sunnah these days? Where is the one who wholeheartedly believes in the word of Allaah and the words of the Rasool alaisalaathu wassalaam and who is aware and feels the power of Eemaan and the power of tawakkal alallaah? And Tawakkal alallaah does not mean that you don&#8217;t work with the means. No, you carry out the means. However, you don&#8217;t depend totally on the means. You carry out the means. However you depend upon the &#8216;Musabbibul Asbaab&#8217; – the One that makes the means and actually from above. He is Allaah. Look at the bird – it carries out the means; it went out hungry and returns satisfied. So it carried out the means. It flew and moved from tree to tree, and from place to place with comfort and received its sustenance and then it returns. So you also carry out the means in a way that is best without torment, without toil and adverse hardship and that is the way that is best. No more than a means. For example the cure for a disease – a mere means. A man is sick and they say he is tired and sick. Give him some black seed or a little honey or give him some pure milk to drink. Someone has an acidic stomach – so pure milk is good for his stomach. A small thing in a way that is good. And Allaah healed him. Do cupping for him or cauterization (healing with fire).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah said : &#8216;A cure is in three things. In drinking a little bit of honey, or in the line that a person who does cupping draws (puts marks on your skin) or in the using of the fire (cauterization).&#8217; And this is in Bukhari in the Book of Medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mere means that they used to do in the past. Someone got sick in the times of the Salaf and their medicine was very simple – maybe with 5 Riyals or 6 Riyals. Not like now where a man may have to sell his house, his property and his car and sell and sell and sell so that he can go around and get treatment, go abroad and get treatment and if he had taqwa of Allaah azzawajal he would have got cured with 5 Riyals easily. However, when they opposed look at the punishment? And they didn&#8217;t depend upon Allaah, they depended upon the pocket, upon their money, upon his pocket, upon his money, and leaned on himself and didn&#8217;t lean on Allaah and in turn Allaah entrusted them to their own selves. My slave did not trust in Me and depended on himself so Allaah entrusted him to himself. So he sells what he owns and he returns sick – the same way he went. Sometimes even more sick and he dies there. And they comes with him dead, wrapped up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has to be tawakkal alallaah along with carrying out the legislated means. The salaf there used to be from them who used to sell oil and this is present in the biographies of the narrators of Hadeeth – so and so, the son of so and so As-Zayyaath. Meaning he sells zaith – olive oil and such. He spends on himself and his immediate and extended family. So and so, the son of so and so as-Sammaam – he sells saman which is called ghee (a butter material from cattle) and he spends on himself and his family. So and so, the son of so and so al- Assaal – he sells honey. So and so, the son of so and so is al-Hannar – he sells wheat; and they depend on Allaah. Right now you&#8217;ll find in most stores and supermarkets – in some of them you will find a thousand type of products as if he wants to put the whole dunya into his pocket.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh then said something that was not clear and he continued. He made distrust and greed and toil and adverse hardship and they lost the Deen except whom Allaah had mercy on. Now we have four means from the means of sustenance.<br />
The fifth door is Ash-Shukr (Giving thanks) : &#8216;And when your Lord proclaimed that if you give thanks, I would increase you and if you deny the blessings then verily My torment is severe. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where is Ash-Shukr these day Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says. You have a 100 Riyals, you gave thanks to Allaah without saying &#8216;what is this, it is just a little bit, this is not enough&#8217;. The people they have and they have and you didn&#8217;t say this. You leave the speech of the ignorant people. Give thanks to your Lord for a quarter of a Riyal and give thanks to your Lord for the excrement of the feces. If it wasn&#8217;t for Allaah it wouldn&#8217;t come out. Yes by Allaah the excretion is a very big Ni&#8217;maah. If it didn&#8217;t come out you would have been befallen by poison and death. Don&#8217;t say I don&#8217;t have. Has Allaah given me and the people who have and have and have and then they make it hard and then you forget what Allaah gave you of blessings. Don&#8217;t you know that giving shukr is a means of increasing your rizq and not giving shukr is a means of decreasing of sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh reiterates : &#8216;If you give thanks, We will increase you.&#8217; If you give thanks to Allaah for a 100/- Allaah increases for you upon it and then it becomes 500/-. If you give thanks to Allaah for 500/- Allaah increases it for you and then it becomes a 1000/-. And the more you give thanks the more Allaah increases you. Allaah does not go back on a promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There has to be Shukr and Hamd, giving praise and Sana&#8217;a (giving praises of Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and Eemaan that it is Allaah who provided it for you. Allaah is the One Who provides and He is the One who gives life. He is the One Who gives death and He is the One who does everything (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and as for the people then they are weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O mankind it is you who stands in need of Allaah but Allaah is rich and free of all needs. If He wished He could destroy you and bring another creation and that is not at all hard upon Allaah. The people all of them are fuqaraahu ilallaah. They are poor people with regards to Allaah so don&#8217;t look at their pockets. Look to Allaah. Look to the treasures of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;For Allaah is the treasures of the heavens and the earth. However, the hypocrites do not understand this. The munaafiqun, the hypocrites they always believe and have faith in the material things and as for the unseen things, then they don&#8217;t believe. Only in material things 1+1 = 2. Something material, tangible, calculated. Faith in the unseen – this is not present with him. This is present with the believers. For this Allaah said about the Munaafiqeen : They say, &#8216;Spend not on those who are around Allah&#8217;s Messenger until they desert him. They said make it hard for them with regards to charity and donation until they leave from Muhammad and were finished from Islaam and its people.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the ones who said that : don&#8217;t spend on the Messenger – the people that are around the Messenger of Allaah until they leave from him. So Allaah said refuting them :<br />
And for Allaah are the treasures of the Heavens and the earth. However, the hypocrites they understand not. So beware of being from the Munaafiqeen that don&#8217;t understand the Book and the Sunnah and the ones that don&#8217;t believe except in material things. They don&#8217;t have eemaan in the unseen, untangible things and pursue the Deen of Allaah, and learn the Book and the Sunnah, and act upon it and spread it to the people because Allaah says : We have neglected nothing in the Book, everything is present in the Book of Allaah and in the Sunnah of the Messenger .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have now 5 ways. So shukr &#8212; always make your tongue accustomed to Shukr of Allaah, upon His blessings even if it is a little. Because it is something enormous with Allaah. First of all you are ordered to give Shukr. Then He mentions the ayah :<br />
&#8216;Do work, O family of Daawood with thanks, and few of my servants are thankful So you have to thank Allaah.&#8217;<br />
It is a saying of the Prophet : &#8216;So you have to thank Allaah. Whoever doesn&#8217;t thank Allaah doesn&#8217;t thank the people. &#8216;It is also in the hadith that whoever has helped you : say Jazakallaahu khaira. Don&#8217;t&#8217; say : what has he given me? Such and such…this is nothing. By Allaah this is a catastrophe for the one that doesn&#8217;t accustom himself to giving shukr i.e he doesn&#8217;t have except denial of the favours of Allaah and His creation. You should do the contrary, accustom yourself to giving thanks and be from the thankful people. And Allaah (azzawajal) said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And indeed it has been revealed to you as it was to those before you, if you make shirk then all your deeds will be in vain. And you will certainly be among the losers. Nay, but worship Allaah and be among the grateful. Be from the grateful. Give thanks to Him for everything.<br />
Do you not see that if Allaah did not make the sleep for you, what would you do? The rest of the people are asleep and comfortable at night and you don&#8217;t have sleep night after night after night. Is it torment or isn&#8217;t it? It is ni&#8217;maah, the blessing of sleep. How much does it equal? The ni&#8217;mah of security, how much does it equal? He mentioned the Surah :<br />
[106] Surah Quraish (The Tribe of Quraish)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1. For the Ilaf of the Quraysh.) (2. Their Ilaf caravans, in winter and in summer.) (3. So, let them worship the Lord of this House.) (4. Who has fed them against hunger, and has made them safe from fear.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />
Al-Aman – security or safety is a ni&#8217;mah. You must single Allaah in worship. He Allaah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala said : You must worship (Allaah) the Lord of this House (the Ka&#8217;bah in Makkah), the One who fed you against hunger and made you safe from fear. You must sacrifice for Allaah alon, you don&#8217;t make vows except for Allaah, and you don&#8217;t swear except by Allaah and you don&#8217;t put your trust except in Allaah and he goes on to mentioning a hadeeth about tawakkal :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Allaah put your trust if indeed you are believers. Verily Allaah loves those who trust in Allaah. Then upon Allaah let the people put their trust in. Then upon Allaah let the believers put their trust in.<br />
There must be a firm holding on to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger and their must be obedience to the Messenger if we want success and salvation in the Dunya and the Aakhirah. So Ash-Shukr is the fifth.<br />
And the sixth : Dhikr (Acts of Obedience and Remembrance) : Because Allaah says :<br />
&#8216;Whoever who turns away from the dhikr of Ar-Rahman, We would put for him a shaitaan to be a companion for him.&#8217;<br />
He says :<br />
&#8220;And whoever turns away from My remembrance then verily for him is a wretched life. And We will raise him up on the Day of Judgement blind. He will say, &#8216;O Lord why did you raise me up blind when I used to be able to see?&#8217; He will say that it is the same way that My ayath had come to you and you forgot them and this day, you will be forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, when he went away from the remembrance of Allaah and his obedience, Allaah punished him with a wretched life, hard life, tiresome. However, if he was the opposite i.e if he didn&#8217;t turn away from the remembrance of Allaah on the contrary took towards the remembrance of Allaah and took towards the obedience of Allaah, he will not in this case have wretched life but a pleasant and comfortable life of course. Henceforth pay attention. Those who turn away do not have reward and those who turn to Allaah have a reward i.e. a person who remains upon the remembrance of Allaah will have a pleasant life, whoever turns away from remembrance will have a wretched life.<br />
The Sheikh reiterates :<br />
&#8216;Whoever turns away from My remembrance then for him is a wretched life.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He turned away from the remembrance of Allaah and the thanks of Allaah and the obedience of Allaah so Allaah punished him with a wretched life. He doesn&#8217;t attain his morsel of livelihood except after a day of great hardship – after having reached the verge of death, after having had a toil of a donkey and the toil of a camel and having seen different forms of death repeatedly, he attains his morsel of livelihood or drink of water. However, if he obeyed Allaah all of his affairs would have been good, his life and livelihood would have been pleasant, comfortable, pure, blessed and henceforth zikrullaah and holding fast to the obedience of Allaah, you will tread in steadfastness and goodness and comfort with the blessing of Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala). This is the sixth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh is Zakaat (Charity) : As the Prophet said (reported by Hakim) : If they didn&#8217;t stop preventing from paying their zakaat of their monies except that the rain from the skies was prevented from them. And if it was not for the animals, rain wouldn&#8217;t have fallen upon them. It is a long hadith but this part of the hadith is the point of discussion. &#8216;That they did not prevent from paying their zakaat, of their monies, except that the water from the sky was prevented from them and if it wasn&#8217;t for the animals it would not have rained upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this hadith it is clear that if they prevent from giving their zakaat, the water from the sky would be prevented from them. And if it wasn&#8217;t for the animals it would not fall upon them at all. It does however rain on them &#8212; a mercy from Allaah due to the animals and due to the babies who are not responsible. Therefore not paying zakaat is a means of the prevention of rain from the sky. And if the rain is prevented from the sky, poverty takes place and torment and destruction over the people of the land. So fear Allaah with regards to the zakaat of the properties, the apparent and the non-apparent, (the Daahir and the Baatin) &#8212; the non-apparent meaning the gold and the silver in jewellery and these other cash commodities in their different known currencies; and the apparent meaning the cows and sheep and camels and agricultural products. These things that are seen in front of the people. So it is upon the Muslim to fear Allaah with regards to the zakaat of his properties : apparent and non-apparent properties. Because zakaat is a pillar from the five pillars of Islaam. And Allaah had made the things that should be spent on in the 8 categories mentioned in surah at-Tawbah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh said : Read the ayah. He does not mention it in full. However, I will mention it. In the ayah sadaqaath here means zakaat. They are only for the fuqaraah and the masakeen, (which is a degree higher than a fakeer) and those employed to collect the funds, and to attract the hearts of those who have been attracted to Islaam, to free the captives, to free those in debts and for Allaah&#8217;s cause and for the wayfarer. A duty imposed upon Allaah and Allaah is All-Knower, All-Wise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if the people stopped paying their zakaat, the water from the sky would be prevented from them. The correct statement from the people of knowledge that jewellery of women from gold and silver if it reaches the limits from where one pays the zakaat , then zakaat is upon it if it reaches that limit and one year has passed on that limit. Nasaab or the least amount on which the zakaat should be paid is 80g of gold and 400g from silver. So if the husband owns it, he gives the zakaat. And if the wife owns it she gives the zakaat which is obligatory every year. So, if it is less than 80g maybe 76g and she does not have cash properties then, it is not upon her to pay zakaat. However if it is 76g for instance and she has cash worth such and such grams, then she has to pay zakaat because she has from this cash what would make up for the deficiency in silver.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh says again : If people did not stop paying their zakaat, except that the rain from the sky was prevented from them and if it wasn&#8217;t for the animals rain would not have fallen upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth door of sustenance : Sadaqaat (non-obligatory charity) : Charitable donations, and nafaqaath (regular spending) – you spend on yourself, on your wife, on your children, on your father and your mother, your uncles and aunts, your righteous neighbours, on sons and daughters, relatives, widows and orphans – this type of charity, the affair of this is great with Allaah. This is a means of accumulation of provision, a door from the door of sustenance. And it has come in the saheehain from the hadith of Abu Huraira (radiallaahu anhu) that the Messenger of Allaah said : There is not a day that the slaves wake up in it .. everyday that the servant wakes up except that two angels come down and say : one of them says to the other &#8216;O Allaah give to the person that spends , give him something to replace it;&#8217; and he says to the other one : &#8216;O Allaah give to the person that holds back a type of destruction.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So try and not make a day pass from you from the days of Allaah except that you stretch your hand as much as it is your ability to do, even if it is a little.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said : &#8216;Fear Allaah even if it is with half a date.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) says: &#8216;fa mai ya&#8217;mal misqaala zarrathin kharrai yara. Wamai ya&#8217;mal misqaala zarrathin sharrai yara&#8217; &#8212; &#8216;that whoever does an atoms worth of good he will see it. And Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) also says, &#8216;whatever you spend in the way of Allaah, He will replace it and He is the best of the Providers.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is the meaning of &#8216;He will replace it?&#8217; i.e He will give you what is better than it. Don&#8217;t think that is the end and that it has gone from you. It will return to you with that which is better, insha-Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh says again : Whatever you have spent, then Allaah will replace it for you and He is the Best of Providers. And he says again that : O Allaah give the person that spends a replacement that is replaced for him with good, O Lord of the worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the hadith of Abu Huraira (radiallaahu anhu) that Msulim related that the Messenger of Allaah said : that there was people from people that were from before you a man who had a garden. And another man heard a cry from the sky, an angel from the clouds who said, &#8216;give water to the garden of so and so.&#8217; So he poured into it some water into one of the irrigation holes and then the water ran into that garden. So the person who owned the garden, he had a shovel in his hand and he was fixing the water and fixing the dirt and this man said to the man who owned the garden, &#8216;may Allaah have mercy upon you. What is your name?&#8217;<br />
He said: I am so and so, the son of so and so. Then he said: &#8216;Why do you ask?&#8217;<br />
He said: &#8221; I hears a voice from the clouds saying, &#8216;give water to the garden of so and so. May Allaah have mercy on you. What do you do with this?&#8217;<br />
So the owner of the garden says : &#8216;When I plant and then I harvest, I give one-third for me and my family and I take 1/3rd and I give it in charity. i.e I take 1/3rd and roll it back into my garden.<br />
Look at this. What is required from him is only a 10th of the farm that is if it comes from natural torrential streams and the like (without any artificial irrigation or water). And a half of the 10th if it is water with sprinklers and irrigation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So rather than give one from 10 or ½ from 10, he gave from 3. Meaning he put aside more for charity. So see how Allaah singled him out with rain especially for his garden. Rain specific for him over his neighbours. What did he do to deserve this? He gave sadaqa. Therefore Sadaqaa doesn&#8217;t decrease wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we were in a certain area giving dawah and alhamdulillaah we always go out calling the people to the Book and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and remind them of Allaah and the Last Day and righteous deeds and we saw that the mountains were green and the trees were green masha&#8217;Allaah and what a beautiful sight. And they had good agriculture. They must have had a good reason because their neighbour&#8217;s lands were dusty and barren and their land was green. We saw the reason on the way. There if you walk from a distance to a distance you could have the coolness of water i.e from place to place except that we saw a water cooler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sheikh said : Because of the water cooler, Allaah sent down rain because of this cooler. If they are generous people, then Allaah is more generous than them. He is generous and loves the generous people and if they are merciful, then Allaah is more merciful than them. Allaah is Merciful and He loves the merciful people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A sadaqa that they did, Allaah did not lose it for them. On the contrary, He gave them the reward for it in this world and the Hereafter. Therefore Sadaqa is a reason for the increase in provision and it is a door from the doors of sustenance and a door from the doors of relief &amp; distress – as-Sadaqa. And also az-Zakaat, it is a door from the doors of relief &amp; distress and all of what you have heard are doors from the doors of relief from distress –- a door of provision and a reason for provision. Even if some of the people only see the material means. As for these other legislated means then these are not in the minds of most people these days, except those on whom Allaah has mercy on. Even if they read the Qur&#8217;aan – however, without pondering, except whom Allaah has protected from that. We have eight now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ninth door is ad-Du&#8217;aa (Supplication) &#8212; Don&#8217;t forget ad-Du&#8217;aa O&#8217; Servants of Allah. Its affair is enormous. And your Lord said : &#8216;Call on me and I will answer you&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Du&#8217;aa is if you said something like :<br />
&#8216;Allahummar-ziqni&#8217; &#8212; O Allaah provide for me.<br />
Rizqan Halaalan&#8217; – a Halaal rizq.<br />
&#8216;Tayyiban&#8217; – pure<br />
&#8216;Mubarakan&#8217; &#8212; blessed<br />
&#8216;And make what you provided for us something a means of help – that would help us in your obedience.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;O Allaah it is your rizq that is pure and halaal.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;O Allaah make me be free with your halaal &#8212; from having to deal with anything that is haraam. To be free from needing anything except your bounty.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have supplicated to Allaah asking for good sustenance because he ordered you to supplicate.<br />
Allaah ordered you to supplicate and He has promised you that He will answer. And what do you think, du&#8217;aa is for something else and not for rizq? No, it is even for rizq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah mentions from the supplications from His righteous slaves : &#8216;O Allaah give us in this world the good and in the Hereafter the good and save us from Fire.&#8217; – And from the good of the Dunya is halaal sustenance that helps you in the obedience of Allaah. And the Hadith of Anas in the saheehain that he said : &#8216;Every time the Prophet used to make dua, he used to make dua with this du&#8217;aa :<br />
Rabbana Aaathina fid-Dunyaa hasana wafil Aaakhirathi hasana wa kina azaabannaar.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;O Allaah give us the good in this world and the good in the Hereafter and save us from the<br />
Hell-Fire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, du&#8217;aa its affair is great. So supplicate to your Lord to give you good sustenance and halaal provision and pure sustenance, blessed provision and beneficial sustenance and you should ask Him to satisfy you with halaal and not with haraam and to make you satisfied with His bounties and not in need of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to say in between the two sajdaas in salaah :<br />
Rabbigh firli warhamni, wajburni, ….<br />
&#8216;O Allaah forgive me and have mercy on me, make me firm, guide me, comfort me and sustain me.&#8217;<br />
Between the two sajdaas in every salaah and sometimes he would say<br />
&#8216;Rabbighfir lee, Rabbigh firlee.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;O Allaah forgive me, O Allaah forgive me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at how many hadiths with regard to seeking rizq or sustenance from Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and this is considered from the means as you have heard from the legislated means. So now we have nine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth door is al-Birr (The Righteous) – &#8216;Al-Birr al Waalidain&#8217; having piety towards the parents, its affair is great. And it is a door from the doors of relief from grief, and it is a door from the doors of rizq and it is a means from the means of rizq. Allaahu (azzawajal) says :<br />
&#8220;Innal abraara lafee na&#8217;eem. Wa innal fujjaara lafee jaheem.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;Verily the (Abraar) the pious people are going to be in Paradise and the (Fujjaar) the wicked, evil doers will be in the Hellfire.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibnul-Qayyim (Rahimahullaah) mentions in his book &#8216;Madaarijus Saadiqeen&#8217; – the people who check the course &#8212; in the first volume that the one that thinks that Naeem and Jaheem i.e the Paradise and the Fire in this ayah will only be on the Day of Judgement, then he has misconstrued the ayah. The ayah is general. So the abraar are in Naeem&#8217; in the Dunya (worldly life), and the Barzaakh (the period between death and the day of resurrection) and the Aaakhirah (Hereafter). And the Fujjaar – the wicked, evil doers are in Jaheem in the Dunya (worldly life), in the Barzaakh and in the Aakhirah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the Naeem, the pleasantry of the Dunya is good provision, halaal provision, pure sustenance, that is a help for you to do righteous deeds. In that case, then be righteous to your parents and ya subhanAllaah. This is something that is tested and proven to be true. Just by if you did good to your parents and by being righteous to them, help them and ask from them du&#8217;aa except that Allaah will provide for you good and fast sustenance as the Prophet said in Saheeh al-Jaami : &#8216;there are two subjects whose punishments are made to come fast. Al-Baghi i.e infringement upon people&#8217;s rights and &#8216;uqooq&#8217; i.e being disobedient to the parents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who infringes on the rights of the people, infringes on the rights of the people with oppression, infringes on the rights of the people by insult, infringes on their rights by striking physically, infringes on their rights with transgression and taking their money or striking their bodies or insulting their honour. This &#8216;baab&#8217; or affair &#8212; its punishment comes in this life and fast, i.e. before the Aakhirah and just like this &#8216;al-Uqooq&#8217; – disobedience to the parents. The punishment of disobedience to parents comes fast and the opposite is the same al-Birr and Adl and Insaaf. i.e justice / equity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Insha-Allaah you will take the reward now and later. This is the developed understanding of the Hadith and the ayah:<br />
&#8220;Innal abraara lafee na&#8217;eem&#8221; – Verily the pious people or the people that are the righteous are in the Paradise. So there are &#8216;Naeem&#8217; in their Dunya and their Aakhirah. And from the Naeem is self-contentment. Even if what is in his position is minute. Allaah has given him &#8216;an-Naeem&#8217; in the dunya – he feels contentment with that. He is not like the one that was victim to bankruptcy, feels that he has nothing in his pocket – bankruptcy, he has a lot of burden, always thinking, always angry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No, the power of Imaan makes him content and comfortable. Allaah is the One who created me and He has been responsible for my sustenance. You have the Hadith of Abdullah Ibn Masood in the Saheehain and it has been mentioned in the 40 Hadith of Imaam Nawawi : Allaah creates the soul in the womb in the fourth month and in the fourth month he sends an angel to write four words : what his sustenance would be, what his work would be, when he would die and whether he would be happy or miserable.<br />
When you are in the stomach of your mother in the fourth month, when the spirit is blown in, this angel is ordered in the writing of these four things and from these is sustenance, how much provision you will get so you will live in the dunya, the measuring of what Allaah has written for you and your rizq in the dunya is the measuring of what Allaah measured for you of rizq and whether you are going to be happy or miserable, what is the appointed time for death and the reason &#8211;– so you walk on a path that Allaah has written for you Azzawajal, you walk on it with your choice because Allaah did not oppress anyone. As He said: &#8216;And I surely am not an oppressor for the servants.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Imaan : the believer in Allaah and the believer in His deen and Shariah, then she should do what is from Imaan – Imaan in al-Qadr &#8212; the good of it and the bad of it. And that Allaah has decreed his sustenance and that his endeavour does not speed up anything and his slowness doesn&#8217;t delay anything in this affair and that the affair is in the hands of Allaahu ta&#8217;ala. So what He wills it is and what He didn&#8217;t, it will not come out to anything. However it is this person who reads the Book of Allaah and ponders over the Book of Allaah and always reads the Sunnah of the Messenger (alaihissalaatu wassalam) and ponders always upom the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tenth door is Material Means : The Sheikh says from those means are those material means like for instance being a farmer, a merchant or a manufacturer – any means from the material means as long as you don&#8217;t destroy yourself. You were not created for the purpose of the Dunya. Whether you were created for the purpose of Allaah (azzawajal) i.e for the purpose of worship and the most important thing is satisfaction and continence, i.e self-control with regards to passions and seeking self-sufficiency from Allaah and satisfaction in Him. And you know that some people only have a motor and Allaah made his sustenance from that –&#8211; the sustenance of his family, that one motor. And some of them a donkey, and some people from villages have only one donkey and he spends from that for his whole family. Some a camel, some an ox &#8212;- he tilts for the people and supports the family. And for some of them an electric tool, or pliers and support from this a whole family. Some of them have 3, 4, 5, items in his possessions, he sells and spends on his family. And others have miswaak and he spends on his family. And another has perfume of antimony (khul) and he spends on his family. So it is more a means that you work by. As you would say :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O Allaah this is the dua and it is upon You to answer it.&#8217;<br />
In the same way you say : &#8216;O Allaah this is the means and it is upon You to provide for me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You don&#8217;t depend upon the means. Because if you depend upon the means and only the means then you would have depended or put your trust in other than Allaah &#8212; and this is not permissible. This is a mere means. If it wasn&#8217;t for the fact that Allaah ordered us to take towards the means, we would have not taken towards it. However, it is an order of Allaah and look at Maryam (alaihissalam) while she was in her post-natal bleeding, Allaah says to her :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And shake the trunk of the date palm towards you and it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this state of pregnancy while being weak and with that He still said : &#8216;Shake the trunk of the date palm towards you.&#8217; There must be working by the means. Work by the means. We are not dervishes &#8212; people that do nothing. We are Muslims and people of daleel and people of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. We work by the means &#8212; in a safe correct means that which does not come in conflict with the deen. i.e. the means is not something unlegislated by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One person who might say, &#8216;we steal&#8217; and this is a means. The other may say, &#8216;we fornicate&#8217; and this is a means. Another sells intoxicants and says &#8216;this is a means.&#8217; These means are unlegislated, forbidden. Or asks for bribes or robs or plunders and says &#8216;this is a means&#8217; or cheats and deceives and says &#8216;this is a means.&#8217; No, there must be with regards to the means that they have to be legislated from what Allaah has made halaal, not being any disobedience in it, not having any opposition to the deen of Allaah. He mentioned the ayah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And shake the trunk of the date palm towards you and it will let fall fresh ripe dates upon you. &#8216;<br />
(Even though Allah has informed us thus).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sheikh reiterates that every time he entered the mihrab &#8212; the praying place of the private room, he found her supplied with sustenance even though Allaah told us this about her. He found with her sustenance. He (Zakariya) said : O Maryam, from where did you get this?<br />
She said : From Allaah. Verily, Allaah provides sustenance to whom He wills without limit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And at that time zakariyya invoked his Lord. If you work with the legislated, trusted means, you are trusting in Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and by Allaah your rizq will come to you, no doubt. And I have put forward for you examples and Allaah puts forward parables for the people so they can reflect. I said to you : a person spends on his family by selling &#8216;miswaak and that one spends on his family by being a seller of oil, and that one a seller of ghee and that one a seller of honey and that one is a seller of wheat. He sells wheat and that one is a &#8216;bazzaar&#8217; and he sells seeds. The books of biographies are filled with this, that of our pious predecessors. And that one is &#8216;al-Kayyaal&#8217; &#8212; he has a scale and he weighs things for people and they pay him and that one fixes shoes, nails it and ties it. Up until now all what I mentioned is present and it is a sign from the signs of Allaah and ar-Razzaaq, He is Allaah (azzawajal) and you may very well find that a person who fixes shoes is in a state of self-contentment than a big merchant and a big manager. Or a &#8216;sayy aathi&#8217; &#8212;- the one who fixes watches and sells watches. You may very well find him in a state of contentment. He has 4 watches in his possessions and he sells it, goes home and is comfortable. You may not find this self-contentment with a merchant or a big manager. Each one of them &#8212; his head is filled with problems and he doesn&#8217;t find comfort in his sleep and is not patient, and is not resting. Everything is preoccupation and stress and a lot of them become victims to diabetes, cancer and asthma. The other one is comfortable i.e the one who sells honey, wheat, watches etc. He is content with himself. He is not concerned with taxes or he is not concerned with the rent of a store or show room. And the most important thing is self-contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eleventh door to the doors of sustenance is Holding Fast to the Book and the Sunnah : Holding fast to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah is considered one of the doors from the doors of sustenance. As Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) said about the people of the Book : &#8216;that only if they had established the Toraah and the Injeel (what was revealed to them from their Lord) they would have eaten from above them and from under their feet.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is so for the one who holds onto the Tauraat and the Injeel. Then for the one who holds fast to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah this the given priority because the Book and the Sunnah is better than the heavenly books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then we have mentioned 12 doors and means from the means of rizq and from this 11 are spiritual and one was physical or material. Material means we mentioned that we should do work that is halaal, not to waste the time of salaah, he sells or buys or manufactures We have mentioned 11 of which are abstract and now we mentioned the last which is physical.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever likes that his rizq is widened for him and his life is expanded then he should join family ties. Joining the ties is increase in one&#8217;s rizq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another Hadith of Anas : There used to be 2 brothers at the time of the Messenger and one of them used to work to earn a living and the other one used to go and seek knowledge from the Prophet and he used to worship Allaah. So the one who earned a living complained about his brother to the Prophet and so the Prophet said : &#8216;May be you are giving sustenance to him. i.e may be Allaah made your sustenance plentiful because of you spending upon your brother.&#8217; So the sheikh reiterated saying: maybe you are given rizq because of him. And he said that this might enter under the category of spending on the student on knowledge. So one of the ways of joining ties of relationships is to spend. With this the Sheikh ends the remainder some of the many means of attaining sustenance and getting relief from distress. Wa sallaahu ala nabee ina Muhammad wa &#8216;ala Aaalihi wasahbihi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I finally advice myself and you with the taqwa of Allaah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and to hold fast to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of the Messenger . May Allaah give us all tawfeeq and He affirms us on His deen and makes us upon the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>May Allaah reward the sister who Transcribed from the Audio </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Student of Knowledge &amp; Books</strong><br />
<strong>طالب العلم والكتب</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Sālih bin Abdul-Azīz Āl us-Shaykh</strong><br />
<strong>الشيخ صالح بن عبد العزيز آل الشيخ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing &#8211; </span>Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small on-line booklet called: <b><i>“Taalib-ul-‘Ilm wal-Kutub”</i></b> [The Student of Knowledge and Books] which was originally a lecture delivered by Shaikh Saalih bin ‘Abdil-‘Azeez Aali Shaikh in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and transcribed by a student of knowledge then made available for free on the internet in Arabic. The source used for this translation was the one found in <a href="http://www.sahab.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.sahab.org</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, the Shaikh discusses seven etiquettes that a Muslim, and in particular a student of knowledge, should abide by with regard to books. The author has done an excellent job in explaining these general guidelines and points.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this treatise comes at a crucial time since as the English speaking Muslims in the West increase so does the printed literature that they acquire to learn the fundamentals of their Religion, not to mention those who are able to read and collect books in Arabic. Therefore, such a discussion is necessary to provide guidance and advice on how to acquire, handle, preserve and use these religious books, which are being produced at an ever-increasing rate in recent times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is hoped that this e-book in conjunction with the recently launch Classical Knowledge Series publications will provide the English readers with a solid basis on the basics and principles of knowledge in terms of seeking it, acquiring it, teaching it and propagating it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is well known that knowledge is acquired via two methods – either, <b><i>orally by way of hearing</i></b> and sitting with the people of knowledge and taking knowledge from them through listening with one’s ears or <b><i>by way of books</i></b>, and that is through researching, investigating and studying. The first way is the same method as the second way, whereas the correctness of the second method is based on the first. This is as one of the scholars said: ‘Knowledge used to be in the breasts of men then it transferred into the interior of books. However, its keys remained in the hands of men.’ This means that books possess a high level of importance to the student of knowledge. However, the only ones that can properly deal with these books and correctly understand them are those who establish themselves on the path of studying at the hands of the people of knowledge, mixing with them and comprehending what they meant by the words they recorded in these books.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the first etiquette with regard to books is that one must organize his books in a good manner. Maintaining one’s library in order is an indication of a student of knowledge’s regard for his books. However, if you visit and are granted access to a person’s library and find that his books are scattered around, in disorder and so on, this is due to ether one of two possibilities. The books are this way either because (1) the person researches his books a lot and needs to refer to them, thus causing his books to be scattered about – and even though this is something praiseworthy he should still put them back in their proper places afterward – or (2) he does not organize his books at all to begin with.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is one of the important etiquettes with regard to books – that you not turn them into storage bins such as by placing pens inside them or treating them like repositories for money and currency. So if you were to open up a book you would find all of these things inside them and notice that the book’s binding has become worn and that the book has changed and so on due to the book not being preserved properly. A book should also not be turned into a bouquet, i.e. it should not be folded in an inappropriate manner, since a book contains the words of Allaah and the words of the Messenger of Allaah. So it is not proper to treat a book in this manner.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Also from the etiquettes related to books is that one should make an effort to care for and reinforce their outer and inner parts as well as to keep them clean so that the books can be in a presentable condition that is befitting for others besides you. This is since when a student of knowledge buys a book, he must have or should we say it’s preferred for him to have two types of intentions. The first is that he should intend to benefit from it in order to free himself from ignorance. And secondly, he should intend that others benefit from the book as well – such as either his wife or his children. Afterward, the books can either remain with that person (in his family) or they can be donated after him. Or perhaps one can give them away to someone as a gift or sell them, and so on and so forth.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the time of Prophet Muhammad those who disbelieved in his message have always diligently tried to put out the light of Allaah and to this day they have not ceased in trying to destroy Islam with every means, whether it be through the media, through war, occupation of Muslim countries and much more. We also witness how many Muslims fall subject to the traps of the disbelievers even at the hands of the Muslims themselves. One of the most prominent scholars of our time by the name of Shaykh Saalih bin Fawzan addresses these issues in a Friday sermon entitled; “The Response of the Muslims during trials”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He addresses how the Muslims should counter the plots and objectives of the disbelievers during these times. Recently the kuffaar have produced movies, illustrations and evil ideas about Prophet Muhammad and the religion of Islaam. They have plotted cleverly against the Muslims in ways that are not apparent to many. Along with this they continue to spread western ideologies amongst the Muslims which shaykh Fawzan may Allaah preserve him has shed light on.</p>

<p>Shaykh Salih Fawzaan (hafidhahullaah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The meaning of jealously is the hoping in the removal of the blessing from the one who is envied. When he sees his brother blessed with what Allaah has given him, then he hopes that this blessing disappears from him for no other reason except because of his hatred and when he hated him (he therefore) envied him. Jealousy is an ancient disease, and the first to envy was Satan, (May Allaah’s curse be upon him) when he envied our father Adam for the virtues that Allah gave him. He created Adam by His hands, taught him the names of everything, made the Angels prostrate to him and let him live in His Paradise&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">الشيخ صالح بن فوزان الفوزان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Respected Shaykh, may Allah give you success: on the days following Eid, some people organize gatherings for women where the simple hand drum (al-duff) is used and there is dancing and singing. [The women] say these are the days of Eid and it is allowed to use al-duff, dance and sing without using [other] musical instruments; how correct is this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Brother, the day of Eid is one day, not a number of days. The days of Eid Al-Ad-ha and Eid Al-Fitr are a one day for each. The Days of Tashriq that follow the day of Eid Al-Ad-ha are not days of Eid, they are not called Days of Eid; these are the Days of Tashriq. These people [being asked about] want to revive drums, musical instruments and singing, they call them the Days of Eid. This is a lie about the Shariah; this behaviour is not allowed not for men and not for women.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allahs benevolence be upon you, respected Shaykh, the enquirer asks: In the tape shops there are tapes where there are recordings of al-duff being played accompanied by young women / teenage girls saying nashids. Teenage girls and women listen to these tapes on Eid with the excuse that al-duff is allowed on the Day of Eid. What is the ruling on this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ruling is that this is not allowed. This [activity] teaches young women false frivolity and singing it spoils young Muslim women and makes them become silly. Accordingly, these tapes must be destroyed, they must be destroyed. Singing on Eid was not allowed by the Prophet Allahs praise and peace be upon him except for young girls; minors who were not legally liable for their actions. [They were] young girls, not females who were legally bound by Islamic law (i.e. those who had reached puberty). Women who are grown up and legally bound by the commandments of Islam are not permitted to sing or behave frivolously.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allahs benevolence be upon you, respected Shaykh, this enquirer asks about a practice that has emerged in the mosques/places of prayer on Eid: the distribution of dates before Eid prayer, so that people can get the virtue (of practicing the Sunnah) of eating some dates [before Eid Al-Fitr prayer]. Is this action a Sunnah, or is it a novel introduction?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the practice of some young Muslims Allah guide them. This was not done amongst the Salaf; we do not know that they used to distribute dates at the Eid prayer place (musalla). What is confirmed from Allahs Messenger praise and peace of Allah be upon him is that he used to eat before leaving home [on Eid Al-Fitr], he would eat a few dates before leaving his house. So, whoever wants to practice the Sunnah should eat when he leaves his house not at the mosque or prayer place.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Respected Shaykh, what is the ruling on giving presents at Eid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no harm in this. Spending more and giving more food, drink, gifts and visiting others, all of this is desired, because it involves keeping in touch with Muslims and brings about love between them. So, there is no harm in [giving gifts].</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>a) AbdurRahmaan bin Ali bin Muhammad Ibn Jawzi (d. 598 A.H.) said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Zuhd is not just leaving wealth or giving wealth to show that you are generous and strong, nor to get people’s hearts to incline to you, on the contrary Zuhd is leaving worldly things due to having the knowledge that it is insignificant in relation to the immeasurable value of the Hereafter.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Taken from: ‘Mukhtasir Minhaj al-Qasideen’ p.324]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>b) Shamsuddeen Muhammad bin Abee Bakr Ibn Qayyim aj-Jawzeeyah (d.751 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The intent of Zuhd is not rejection of having possessions, since in fact Sulayman and Dawood –alayhim as-Salaam- were the ones who had the most Zuhd from amongst the people at their time and they had been endowed with wealth, land and women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- had definitely the most Zuhd above all mankind, and he had nine women. ‘Ali bin Abi Taalib, AbdurRahman bin ‘Awf, Zubayr and Uthmaan -Radi Allaahu anhum- were from those who had Zuhd even though they had wealth, and there were many others like them.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Taken from ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ by Ibn al-Qayyim (d. 751 A.H.) Volume 2/13-14)]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>c) Al-Hasan said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Having Zuhd of the Dunyaa is not prohibiting oneself from that which is Halaal, nor by wasting money, but it is knowing that what is in Allaah’s Hand is more trustworthy than one’s own-self and what he has in his hand (i.e. possesses).’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Taken from ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’ by Ibn al-Qayyim (d. 751 A.H.) 285]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>d) Ibn Rajab al-Hanbali (d.795) -Rahimullaah- said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abu Sulayman said: <span style="color:#008000;">‘Do not testify for anyone that he has Zuhd, since indeed Zuhd is in the heart.’</span></p>

</a></p>
<p>Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah- mentions in his explanation of the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">ادعوا ربَّكم تضرُّعًا وخُفيةً إنه لايحبُّ المعتدين…</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. <strong>[al-Aaraaf: 55]</strong></p>
<p>there are ten benefits of hiding your Dua’, and from amongst these benefits he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the greatest of blessings is turning to Allaah and worshipping Him. Every blessing has the equivalent of it being envied by an envious person, whether openly or secretly. There is no greater blessing than of turning to Allaah and worshipping Him [making Dua&#8217;], indeed the souls of the envious are attached to that blessing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing more secure for the person who is envied than hiding his blessing from the envious person. Indeed Yaqoob said to Yusuf -alayhi as-Sallam:</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">قَالَ يَا بُنَيَّ لاَ تَقْصُصْ رُؤْيَاكَ عَلَى إِخْوَتِكَ فَيَكِيدُواْ لَكَ كَيْدًا</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">&lt; &lt; O my son! Relate not your vision to your brothers, lest they arrange a plot against you &gt; &gt;</p>
<p>till the end of the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many of the people who have hearts, a connection and status with Allaah Ta’ala may perhaps have spoken about it, and informed people about it, and the envious one tried to plunder him over these blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the righteous and elderly are advised to keep their secrets with Allaah Ta’ala, and not to allow anyone to be acquainted with them.<br />
This issue of hiding the blessing is of great benefit, its people know is benefits. Therefore, if it is commanded to do so in your Dua’/supplications, then this also includes the Dua’ for requesting this, and the Dua’ of praising Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Living and turning to Allaah Ta’ala is from the great treasures which has a right to be hidden from the eyes of the envious.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[From: &#8216;Majmoo al-Fatawa&#8217; 15/18-19]</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">بسم الله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله<br />
(In the name of Allaah, peace and salutations be upon His Prophet.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) said:<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8216;None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his child, his father and all the people.&#8221;</em> </span>(Muslim: 44).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaamah Shaykh Dr. Saalih ibn Abd-Allaah ibn Fawzaan al-Fawzaan (may Allaah preserve him) highlights the significance, importance and correct way of loving the final messenger of Allaah, Muhammad, may Allaah send salutations and peace upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">IMPORTANT POINTS:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allaah, the Almighty, has to be loved more than anything and everything.</li>
<li>The prophet Muhammad, may Allaah send peace upon him and his family, has to be loved more than anything and everything, EXCEPT Allaah.</li>
<li>innovating into the perfect religion of Islaam, with the claim of love for Allaah or his messenger is a complete delusion and is misguidance</li>
</ol>

<div id="watch-description-text">
<p id="eow-description" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Sālih bin Fawzān al-Fawzān</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230;calling to the sword, meaning [calling] to fitnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the fighting that came about between the Muslims, the splitting of their unity, it only came about due to the people of desires &#8212; from Mu&#8217;tazilah and Khawārij and other than them, the people of desires. They are the ones that caused fitnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Mu&#8217;tazilah, Khawārij, Rawāfid</strong>, and other than them. The trials and tribulations did not come except from them. It was not caused except by them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who killed &#8216;<strong>Uthmān</strong>, may Allah be pleased with him? Who killed <strong>Alī Bin Abī Tālib</strong>, may Allah be pleased with him? Who ignited the fitnah between the Muslims after that other than the people of desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who incited <strong>Al-Ma&#8217;mûn</strong> and those who came after him to subject Ahl-Sunnah to trials? To the point that they pulled their (Ahl-Sunnah&#8217;s) Imām, Ahmad Bin Hanbal, may Allah have mercy on him, and they beat him and imprisoned him. [Who] other than the people of desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who imprisoned <strong>Shaykh Al-Islām Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>, to the point that he died in prison, may Allah have mercy on him. [Who] except the people of desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we must be careful from them, because in the end, their evil leads to the tearing of the unity of the Muslims and [leads] to revolting against the Muslim ruler and to the separation of the community of Muslims, so that they become sects and factions instead of being one Ummah. Na&#8217;am&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Text below: [<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/al-haaiyyah-arabic-text.pdf" target="_blank">Arabic Text Download Here</a>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Hold tightly to the rope of Allaah and the guidance,<br />
And do not be an innovator, so that you might be successful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) And practice your religion based on the Book of Allaah and the Sunan which<br />
have come from the Messenger of Allaah so you will be saved and earn reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) And say: Not a created thing is the Speech of our great King,<br />
Such was the religious position of the pious ones (before us) which they clearly expressed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) And do not be a person who takes no position on the Quran,<br />
As did the followers of Jahm, and they had been too lax (to take the right position).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) And do not say that the Quran is created, meaning: its recitation,<br />
Since the Speech of Allaah, through its recitation, is made clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) And say: Allaah will make himself visible to the creation, openly,<br />
Just as the full moon is not hard to see, and your Lord (will be seen) more clearly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(7) And He was not born, nor has He fathered anyone,<br />
Nor is there anything similar to Him, exalted be the Glorified One.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(8) A Jahmee rejects this, however, we have<br />
As a testimony to the truth of what we say – a hadeeth that clarifies it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(9) Jareer narrated it, from the words of Muhammad,<br />
So say what he said about that, and you will be successful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(10) And certainly a Jahmee will deny His Right Hand as well,<br />
While both of His Hands are giving out all kinds of bounties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(11) And say: The Ever-Compelling descends each night,<br />
Without asking how, magnificent is the One God and most worthy of praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(12) Down to the lowest heaven, granting bounties from His Grace,<br />
As the gates of the heavens are opened and spread widely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(13) He says: Is there anyone seeking forgiveness who would like to meet a Forgiver?<br />
Or anyone seeking bounties of goodness and provisions, so he could be given (what he requests)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(14) A group have reported this whose reports are not to be rejected,<br />
But sadly some have went wrong and did not believe them, marring themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(15) And say: Indeed the best of the people after Muhammad<br />
Were his two deputies of old, and then ‘Uthmaan, according to the most correct position.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(16) And the fourth of them was the best of creation after them,<br />
‘Alee, the companion of goodness, through goodness he was successful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(17) Those are the people, those who we have no doubt about,<br />
Upon the great camels of Firdows, shining brightly and roaming about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(18) Sa’eed, Sa’d, Ibn ‘Awf, Talhah,<br />
Aamir of Fihr, and Zubayr the praiseworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(19) And speak with the best terms about the Companions, all of them,<br />
And do not be one who speaks ill of them, pointing out their faults and criticizing,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(20) Since the clear Revelation has spoke of their excellence,<br />
And in (Soorah) al-Fath are verses about the Companions, praising them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(21) And regarding the pre-ordained Qadr, be convinced, since it is<br />
The pillar that combines many affairs of the Religion, and the Religion encompasses much.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(22) And do not reject, out of ignorance, (belief in) Nakeer and Munkar,<br />
Or the Pool or the Scales, surely you are being advised sincerely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(23) And say: Allaah, the Great, will remove, from of His Grace,<br />
Out of the Fire, people, burned severely, who will then be tossed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(24) Into the river in Firdows, wherein they will regain life by its water,<br />
Like a seed taken by a flood that comes and wipes things away with its abundant water.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(25) And surely, the Messenger of Allaah will intercede for the creation.<br />
And speak about the punishment of the grave, that it is the truth, made clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(26) And do not make takfeer of those who pray, even if they commit sins,<br />
Since all of them commits sins, while the Owner of the Throne forgives graciously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(27) And do not hold a belief like that of the Khawaarij, for it is<br />
A position held by only those who desire it, and it is destructive and disgraceful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(28) And do not be a Murji’, one who plays games with his religion,<br />
Surely, the Murji’ is joking about the religion (ie. not taking it seriously).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(29) And say: Eemaan (faith) consists of statements, intentions (i.e. belief of the heart)<br />
And Actions, according to the explicit statement of the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(30) And it decreases sometimes, due to disobedience, and sometimes<br />
Because of obedience it grows, and on the Scale it will outweigh (other things).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(31) And keep yourself from the opinions of people and their stances,<br />
Since the stance of the Messenger of Allaah is more befitting and comforting to the chest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(32) And do not be from those who play games with their religion,<br />
Attacking the people of hadeeth and reviling them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(33) If you keep the belief contained within this poem all your life, O my companion,<br />
You will be upon goodness, day and night.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shaykh Saalih ibn Abdul-Azeez Aal us-Shaykh<br />
</strong><strong>Shaykh Saalih bin Fawzaan al-Fawzaan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="715" height="403" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XiqNApZ2AHM?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Shaykh Saalih ibn Abdul-Azeez Aal us-Shaykh:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">So <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah</em>, this word was coined at the end of the second generation after <em>Hijri</em> by the followers of the narrations [<em>Aathaar</em>], and the opponents to the various sects that left the way of the companions [<em>Sahaabah</em>] and their students [<em>Taabi&#8217;een</em>].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And the first to use it [terminology] were some of the teachers of Al Bukharee – <em>rahimahumuAllaah</em> – and they joined the two words <strong>as-Sunnah</strong> and <strong>al-Jamaa’ah</strong> because there are those who call towards following <em>Sunnah</em> but they might not be with the <em>Jamaa’ah</em>. And there are those who call towards <em>Jamaa’ah</em> without following the <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">So the differentiation of the way of the people of <em>Hadeeth</em> and narrations [<em>Athar</em>] and the followers of the pious predecessors [<em>Salaf-us-Saalih</em>] is based upon two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><em>“Following the Sunnah and the Jamaa’ah”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And each from both of these is bound to the other.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">So following the <em>Sunnah</em> is following the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> and following the <em>Jamaa’ah</em> is following the <em>Sunnah</em>; because it has been authentically reported from the Prophet – <em>sall-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em> – the narration which is in the <em>‘Sunan’</em>, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>“And this nation will split into seventy three sects. All of them are in the hell fire except one and that is the Jamaa’ah.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And [speech unclear] sects in the hell fire – meaning – that are promised with entering into the hell fire, and the victorious is only one sect and that is the <em>Jamaa’ah</em>. And they are the followers of the <em>Sunnah</em>, exemplifying the saying of the Prophet – <em>sall-Allaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><strong>“Upon you is my Sunnah and Sunnah of the rightly guided Caliphs, those who guide to righteousness, after me. Hold on to it and bite upon it with your molars”</strong> – The Hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">(Translation source: <a href="http://www.islaam.ae" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.islaam.ae</a>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>2) Shaykh Saalih bin Fawzaan al-Fawzaan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><em>Question:</em> Is Salafiyyah a hizb (party) amongst the parties? And is ascribing to them (the Salafis) a blameworthy thing?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><em>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzaan:</em> As-Salafiyyah is the Saved Sect and they are Ahl us-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah. It is not a hizb (party) from amongst the various parties, those which are called parties today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Rather they are the Jamaa’ah, the Jamaa’ah upon the Sunnah and upon the Deen (Religion). They are Ahl us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">The Prophet – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – said, “There will not cease to be a group from my Ummah (nation) manifest and upon the truth, not being harmed by those who forsake them neither by those who oppose them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And he – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – also said, “And this Ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of them in the Hell-Fire except one.” They said, “Which one is this O Messenger of Allaah?” He replied, “They are those who are upon what I and my companions are upon today.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Hence, Salafiyyah is a group of people (the Salafis) upon the madhab of the Salaf, upon what the Messenger – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – and his companions were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">And it is not a hizb from amongst the contemporary groups present today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">Rather it is the very old Jamaa’ah, from the time of the Messenger – Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam – which inherits (this way) and continues, and which never ceases to be upon the manifest truth until the establishment of the Hour, as he (Sallallaahu alayhe wa sallam) has informed us.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">By the Shaykh Muhaddith Allaama Rabee&#8217; bin Hadi bin Umayr al-Madkhalee<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise belongs to Allaah the Lord of the Heavens and the Earth, peace and blessings be upon His Prophet, the Prophet’s family, his Companions and all those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is a translation of a lecture which the noble <em>Shaykh</em> – may Allaah reward him with goodness &#8211; delivered in the blessed city of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.   This lecture, which is available in tape form, was transcribed and adapted into a booklet[1] and published in 1426 A.H.  Due to the immense importance of the topic and the deep wisdom of the <em>Shaykh</em> we place it forward in the hands of our brothers and sisters by Allaah’s permission to promote the correct <em>Dawa’</em> on the understanding of the <em>Manhaj as-Salafiee</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to bless and protect our noble <em>Shaykh</em> and all the noble scholars of Islaam and reward them on our behalf with a great reward amongst the righteous in His uppermost Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p>In the Name of Allaah the Most Kind the Most merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed all Praise belongs to Allaah, we praise Him, we seek His aid and we seek His forgiveness.  We seek refuge in Him from the evil of ourselves and the evil of our actions. Whomsoever Allaah guides, there is none to misguide him, and whomsoever Allaah leaves astray then there is none that can guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, Alone without any partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Fear Allaah as He should be feared and dare not die except in a state of Islaam with complete submission to Allaah.</span></strong> &gt;&gt; [al-Imraan: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam) and from him He created his wife and from them both He created many men and women.  And fear Allaah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and do not cut the relations of the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allaah is Ever an All­-Watcher over you.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [an-Nisaa: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him and always speak the truth.  He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins.  And whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger he has indeed achieved a great achievement.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Ahzab: 70-71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Amma ba’d:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the best speech is the Speech of Allaah, the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; and the worst of the affairs are the innovated ones, every innovation is a <em>Bida’</em> and every <em>Bida’</em> is misguidance and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Welcome &#8211; O my brothers for the sake of Allaah and O you noble students &#8211; those students of this distinguished knowledge who have made the journey from far distant places, to drink from the knowledge of the <em>Sharia&#8217;</em> which gushes forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> at the place of descent of the revelation in the city of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.   Which is the second place of descent of the revelation after Makkah al-Mukkaramah the place from where the banners for the struggles and conquests were sent out to make the word of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala –</em> uppermost, to spread this true religion and to make this <em>Deen</em> apparent over all the religions.  As Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala –</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to make it victorious over all other religions even though the <em>Mushrikoon</em>(polytheists) hate it.</span></strong>&gt;&gt;[as-Saff:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah made this religion manifest at the hands of the noble, sincere Companions; the Companions of Muhammad   <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; who conquered hearts with knowledge, guidance and Eemaan.  They conquered fortresses and lands with the swords of truth.  So they assisted the religion of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> with everything they had of strength, with everything that they were capable of sacrificing of wealth and souls.  They put into effect the objective which Allaah had intended for this <em>Deen</em>, that it prevail and that it be manifest above all religions.  This is because this religion stands upon guidance and upon knowledge not upon desires, ignorance, foolishness and chaos &#8211; which has now become predominant in many countries!  &#8211; There are those people whose <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> is not built upon the Book of Allaah nor upon the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah, rather their <em>Dawa’</em> stands upon the following desires, except those whom Allaah  <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> has protected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Islaamic University &#8211; along with those who are responsible for it and those who founded it &#8211; came to realize the reality of the Muslims and what they live in of ignorance and their being far from the true <em>Manhaj</em> of Allaah &#8211; except for a few &#8211; in the Muslim world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this University was founded upon correct Islaamic methodologies, which spring forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of theMessenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>.  There were about four fifths of those accepted to the University from the sons of the rest of the Islaamic world and 20 in every 100 from the sons of the country of the two holy Islaamic sites so that those who come to the place of the descent of the revelation to receive pure knowledge could return to their countries to disseminate this knowledge, this goodness and this guidance which they had learnt:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Of every group of them, a party only should go forth, that they (who are left behind) may get instructions in (Islaamic) religion, and that they may warn their people when they return to them, so that they may beware (of evil).</span></strong> &gt;&gt; [at-Taubah: 122]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a great opportunity for you, so take advantage of it and come closer to the pure and clear beneficial knowledge which is derived from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, since its sources are abundant and all praise belongs to Allaah &#8211; in this city and in this university.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever wishes truth and goodness  &#8211; for himself, his family, his people and country &#8211; then it is upon him to become serious and acquire knowledge from those of the scholars who are present; those who have given their own selves to learning this truth and disseminating it, <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Correct Sources of Knowledge</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon him to learn from the sources which contain the correct beliefs and correct methodologies, to read the <em>Salafi Tafseer</em> books, which are based upon the <em>Tafseer</em> of the Book of Allaah by the Book of Allaah, by the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and by the <em>Fiqh</em> of the noble Companions those who lived through the descent of the revelation and were present at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> and lived with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew the aim of the Book and the Sunnah. They are the ones whose <em>Fiqh</em> should be held on to as they preserved the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><em>.  </em>This is why the noble Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> when he spoke about splitting up into sects and spoke about the <em>Firqaat-Un Najeeyah</em> said: &#8216;Those who are upon what I am upon and my Companions.'[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>Fiqh</em> of the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah which the noble Companions had &#8211; which they acquired from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of theMessenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, from his sayings, actions, his teachings and his directives – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> it is obligatory upon us to take it as our reference.  The Companions are the intended believers in the saying of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala -:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him and follows other than the believers&#8217; way. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell &#8211; what an evil destination. &gt;&gt; [an-Nisaa: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a severe threat to the one who contends with Allaah and His Messenger and follows a path other than that of the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So pay attention to this matter and strive to understand the way of the believers which they derived from the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of theMessenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam </em>&#8211; and from his purifying and educating them upon the Book and the wisdom <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great opportunity for you; understand from it the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah and strive earnestly to make it apparent over all religions with proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon you to seek knowledge from its original watering sources; from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>Tafseer</em>, from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, which gush forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>.  The difference between the way of the truthful believers and the way of the innovating discriminators of the true <em>Manhaj</em> of Allaah will become clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They &#8211; I swear by Allaah &#8211; are the protectors of this <em>Ummah</em> upon the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, they had the correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and <em>Manhaj</em> and they were firmly upon what Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what is understood principally, is that it is obligatory upon us to follow the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> to hold on firmly to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> and to bite onto that with our molar teeth, just as the Messenger of Allaah mentioned &#8211; when he gave an eloquent sermon whereby tears fell and the hearts trembled  &#8211; the Companions requested him to give them some advice they said ; O Messenger of Allaah it is as if this is a farewell sermon, so advise us, he said: ‘I advise you to fear Allaah&#8230;&#8230;.’  pay attention to this advice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘….to hear and obey, whoever lives from amongst you will see many differences so it is upon you to hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided <em>Khulafah</em>, bite on to it with your molar teeth, beware of newly invented matters, for every newly invented matter is a <em>Bida</em>’ and every <em>Bida’</em> is misguidance.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s note: Due to the saying of the noble Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> ‘Whoever does not thank the people does not thank Allaah.’ As narrated by Abee Sa’eed, &amp; authenticated by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah, I say that may Allaah reward with all goodness in this life and in the Hereafter the brother who facilitated us with the booklet and aided us in its translation.  And to our editor, may Allaah enter her into the highest grades of His Paradise among the Prophets, the Companions and the righteous for all her efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The headings were added for further clarity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Narrated by Tirmidhi (2641) from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr –radhiAllaahu anhu- &amp; regarded as Hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (5343).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Narrated by Abu Daawood (4607), Tirmidhi (2676) &amp; Ibn Majah (42) from the hadeeth of al-Irbaad bin Saariyah –radhiAllaahu anhu &#8211; &amp; it was authenticated by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (2549).</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 2</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Station of <em>Taqwa</em> and <em>Ihsaan</em></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sermon consists of the advice to fear Allaah, which is necessary and it is not exemplified except in the lives of the righteous, truthful scholars as in the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah. &gt;&gt;[Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> so you can reach this level and learn so that you can reach that status; because the one who knows the correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and rulings, manners and behaviour springing from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> then he is the one who fears Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> and <em>Taqwa</em> is attained with all of these matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when these matters &#8211; which we have mentioned – are acknowledged then the slave is driven to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, to having fear of Him and being aware of Him in every time, place and situation.  This is a great station which is the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;That you worship Allaah as if you see Him and if you cannot see Him then know that He sees you.'[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship) is that a person has certainty that Allaah sees him and that Allaah hears all he says and hears; the beating of his heart, the feelings of his heart and what he thinks to himself.   Allaah<em>Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala</em> knows it and hears it and He sees his movements and when he is still.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the true believer regards Allaah with true greatness and he acknowledges that Allaah <em>Subhanah</em> hears everything that he says and knows everything he discusses, or thinks to himself and that Allaah has:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Angels <em>Kirâman </em>(honourable)<em> Kâtibîn</em> writing down (your deeds). They know all that you do. &gt;&gt; [al-Infitar: 11-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these distinguished feelings are found in the soul of a believer then he has acquired the characteristic of <em>Taqwa</em> which causes him to keep away from sinning, <em>Shirk, Bida&#8217;</em> and superstitions and he acquires the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em>(perfection of worship) since he is aware of Allaah and he feels that Allaah sees him and he cannot hide anything of his affairs from Allaah not a little nor a lot, not even the like of an atom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a noble awareness and distinguished feeling which pushes one <em>-InshAllaah &#8211;</em> to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah.  This cannot be reached except for the one who knows the correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, the correct rulings of <em>Halaal</em> and <em>Haraam</em> and knows the commands and prohibitions, the promise and the warnings from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><strong><em>.  </em></strong>They are the ones who deserve the praise of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala –</em> He said; about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah.&gt;&gt; [Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Allaah will exalt in degree those of you who believe and those who have been granted knowledge. &gt;&gt; [al-Mujadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So strive to be from these types of people: i.e. that you combine knowledge and action.  That is the fruit of correct knowledge and having the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and being aware of Him.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">The Call to Allaah</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon you O brothers to acquire the pure, truthful Eemaan, beneficial knowledge and righteous actions.  Our Lord <em>–Jal Sha’anahu-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; By <em>Al-&#8216;Asr</em> (the time). Verily! Man is in loss, except those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth and recommend one another to patience&gt;&gt; [al-Asr: 1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truthful Eemaan is only built upon knowledge.  Righteous actions do not emanate except from knowledge. <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah cannot be set forth with it (i.e. knowledge) except by the people of knowledge and being patient with harm <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> &#8211; is required for the one who has learnt, teaches and calls to Allaah  <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be from those who know and believe in this knowledge, those who call to this knowledge and Eemaan and are patient with harm in the path of conveying this truth and goodness to the people.  Indeed a believing Muslim caller to Allaah will face harm the likes of which never even crossed his mind and nor had he anticipated!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A believer is not dazed by this since he is harmed in the way of Allaah and the best of Allaah’s creation were harmed in the path of <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah although they were the Prophets and the noble Messengers <em>&#8211; alayhim as-sallam &#8211;</em> and they were harmed more than us.  They were tried with severe enmity and hatred more than we are and this is the meaning of the saying of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam </em>: &#8216;The people with the severest trials are the Prophets, then the righteous people then their likes and their likes.'[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> saying: &#8216;No one was harmed for the sake of Allaah like I was harmed.'[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever holds fast to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and calls to it, will definitely be harmed &#8211; except if Allaah wills &#8211; so accustom yourself to patience:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full, without reckoning. &gt;&gt; [az-Zumar: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ordered His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> to take the great Prophets as an example and to be patient in the field of <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and striving just as the great Prophets were patient.  Allaah said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Therefore be patient as did the Messengers of strong will and be in no haste about them (disbelievers). &gt;&gt; [al-Ahqaf: 35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Narrated by Bukhari (50) &amp; Muslim (9) from the hadeeth of Abu Huraira – radhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad (1484) and it’s his wording. Also by Tirmidhi (2398) &amp; Ibn Majah (4023) from the hadeeth of Sa’ad bin Abee Waqqas – radhiAllaahu anhu &#8211; &amp; it was authenticated by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (992,994).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Narrated by Tirmidhi (2472) &amp; Ibn Majah (151) from the hadeeth of Anas –radhiAllaahu anhu &#8211; &amp; it was authenticated by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (5125).</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 3</h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">An Excellent Example</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we have in the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> and in all the Prophets of Allaah a good example.  The Messenger was commanded to take those Prophets before him as an example and to follow their guidance and we have been commanded to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and take him as an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow forhe who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much. &gt;&gt; [al-Ahzab: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This good example is complete in every matter which Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> came with<em>;</em> so, he is an example in his <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, so we believe in that which he believed in; an example in his worship, so we worship Allaah making the religion sincerely for Him, following that which the noble Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211; </em>came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is an example in great manners which perhaps many of the callers to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and many of the youth have lost, much of it having been forgotten and some of the youth have forgotten it too.  Indeed Allaah has praised His Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> with eloquent praise and He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And verily, you are on an exalted standard of character &gt;&gt; [Qalam: 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the caller to Allaah, the student of knowledge, the instructor and the guide all need to take the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> as an example in their <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and manners.  So if these matters are combined in the caller to Allaah or they are nearly complete then this <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> will be successful <em>&#8211; InshAllaah &#8211;</em> and the caller to Allaah will have presented it in the most beautiful and best form <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the caller to Allaah is deficient in the matters of his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, being deficient in having noble manners-from which is having patience, wisdom, gentleness, softness and other things which are important, which the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> of the Messengers <em>–alayhim Sallat wa Sallam-</em> requires.  Then this is an apparent deficiency in his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.  So it is upon him to ensure he manifests those matters completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps many of the people are negligent of this! And this harms the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> of Salafiyyah and harms its people.  Since if these manners are neglected and the<em>Dawa&#8217;</em> is presented to the people in a way that they dislike and is made unpleasant and detestable by having harshness, severity and recklessness &#8211; and the likes of these things &#8211; then this is an obstacle to the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and to it being accepted.  Since these matters are even disliked in the affairs of the <em>Duniya</em> let alone in the matters of the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is necessary for the student of knowledge to follow a path of righteous good manners in giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Manner of The Call</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is necessary for you &#8211; O brother &#8211; to take as an example the<em>Aathar</em> which are mentioned about the way of calling to Allaah; and that is done by studying the biography of the Messenger, studying his manners, studying his <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and studying his <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people do not care about the <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> of the Messenger nor about his<em>Manhaj</em> and they follow other methodologies and beliefs, which Shaytaan fabricates for the people of <em>Bida&#8217; </em>and misguidance whom Allaah forsakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are a few people who have been blessed enough to acquire the <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, but they are deprived of the <em>Manhaj</em>!  There are people who are blessed with the <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and the <em>Manhaj</em> but in their behaviour they end up neglecting the<em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and the <em>Manhaj</em>, the truth is with them &#8211; correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and correct<em>Manhaj</em> &#8211; but their behaviour and technique of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> destroys the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>and harms it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be careful of opposing the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> in his <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, his<em>Manhaj</em> and his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.  It is upon you to learn how he – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">used to call the people and to find out about these prophetic instructions of wisdom, patience, gentleness, pardoning and forgiveness, softness, kindness and other matters alongside these.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Comprehend these O brothers and know that these are necessary in our <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>to the people; do not take one aspect of Islaam and neglect the other aspects, or take one aspect from the ways of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and neglect the other aspects.  Since that harms the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> and it harms the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah; the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> of <em>Salafiyyah</em> in recent times &#8211; and in other times &#8211; was not spread except at the hands of people who were scholars, wise and gentle, who were the representation of the <em>Manhaj</em> of the Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> and they implemented what they were able to.  So Allaah caused them to be of benefit and the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> <em>As-Salafiyyah</em> was widespread in many lands of the <em>Duniya</em> via their manners, knowledge and wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the present time; we see that the <em>Dawa&#8217; As-Salafiyyah</em> is retreating and dwindling and that is not due to anything except the loss of their wisdom, rather the wisdom of the Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> foremost, and the loss of the likes of his gentleness, mercy, manners, kindness and softness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aeysha cursed a Jew, so the Messenger of Allaah said to her: &#8216; O &#8216;Aeysha indeed Allaah loves kindness in all matters.'[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a scholar nowadays mentions this hadeeth to the youth, directing them to the correct <em>Manhaj</em> of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah, then they say: this is watering things down (<em>Tameea’</em>)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these noble manners are mentioned and cited as a reminder the likes of wisdom, kindness, softness, gentleness and pardoning -which are the necessary requirements for giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and they are attributes which attract the people to the correct <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>&#8211; then the result of this would be that the people would enter into the religion of Allaah in droves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people, who try to change things, push the people away &#8211; in spite of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah: ‘Indeed there are those amongst you who repel.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> ‘Make things easy, and do not make things difficult, give good news and do not drive people away.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers: these people do not comprehend! Otherwise &#8211; I swear by Allaah &#8211; it obligates them to then brand the Messenger as one who waters things down<em>(Mumaya’)</em>! And that the Companions and the scholars of the <em>Ummah</em> watered things down <em>(Mumaya’een)</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim of watering down necessitates that they – those who are upon this severity and destructive harshness &#8211; which has destroyed the <em>Dawatul Salafiyyah</em>&#8211; it necessitates, that they claim that the Messenger himself who calls to kindness, wisdom and softness is also watering things down <em>(Mumaya’)</em>, and we seek forgiveness from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah; they do not want this nor do they intend the Messenger of Allaah in what they say!  But they lack understanding.  So it is upon them &#8211; from now on &#8211; to comprehend what results from these rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We, indeed &#8211; by Allaah, strive, debate, write, advise and call to Allaah <em>&#8211; Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em>with kindness and they regard us from those who water things down<em>(Mumaya’een)</em>, they do not want us to say: wisdom, softness and kindness!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed we have seen that harshness has destroyed the <em>Dawa’ As-Salafiyyah</em>, and torn its people apart, so what should we do?? I say: O brothers, when we see fires burning, do we leave them to burn more?? Or do we bring that which will extinguish these fires???</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was forced to &#8211; and this is my obligation &#8211; and I used to say this before today, but I concentrated upon this when I saw this destruction, and I saw these tribulations.  I say: it is upon you to have gentleness, it is upon you to have softness, it is upon you to have brotherhood and it is upon you to be merciful to each other.  Indeed this harshness has been directed towards the <em>Ahl -ul-Sunnah</em> themselves whereas they have left the <em>Ahl- ul- Bida&#8217;</em> and aimed at the<em>Ahl-ul Sunnah</em> with this destructive harshness and mixed it with oppression and false oppressive rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be aware be very aware, lest you follow this path which will destroy you and destroy <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> <em>As-Salafiyyah</em> and it destroys its people.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Call to Allaah <em>&#8211; Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> with everything you have, with proofs and evidences in every place, with the words &#8216;Allaah said&#8217;, and &#8216;the Messenger of Allaah said&#8217; and aided with &#8211; after Allaah – with the speech of the scholars of guidance whom, both the <em>Ahul -ul &#8211; Sunnah</em> and the people of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> accept in their leadership and their status in Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise those brothers who go to Africa or to Turkey or to India or any other place that they should go with the phrase: &#8216;Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said and so and so from the scholars whom they respect said.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if, for example you went to Africa and you said: ‘Ibn Abdul Barr said, Malik said, so-and-so said.’  Even though the number of people who have corrupt beliefs is not small in number!  So if you come to them with the Book of Allaah <em>&#8211; Ta&#8217;ala </em>&#8211; and with the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> then you should also bring the speech of the scholars so that they will listen to your speech and obey you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is wisdom, but if you come to them with just your own speech from yourself no-one will ever accept it from you. So it is necessary for you &#8211; after the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> that you connect it up with the speech of the scholars who have status in the hearts of the people and have a high station, those whom the people will not criticize nor their statements. So if you say: ‘Bukhari said’, you will find that they respect him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for example: The <em>Soofeeyah</em> everywhere respect Bukhari and they respect Muslim.  They respect these two books (Saheeh al-Bukhari and Saheeh Muslim) and they respect these two Imams.  They respect Ahmad bin Hanbal, al-Awzaa’ee and Sufyaan ath-Thawree and other than them from the preceding senior people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why there are ties between us and them where we meet up in the truth, so we enter into them from these channels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is from wisdom O brothers; you should not now, due to this, begin by saying: ‘Ibn Taymeeyah said’, even though he is an Imam; because the ignorant people do not know him and even if they knew him they are made to hate him from what they hear from their senior people, so they do not want him nor do they desire him <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should say :’Ibn Taymeeyah said’  amongst the <em>Salafiyeen</em> -those who respect him- but do not say amongst other people, for example ‘Ibn Taymeeyah said, Ibn Abdul Wahhab  said,’ because the ignorant person who is cultured amidst the people of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> runs away from this, so their shaykhs push them away.  So mention to them the names of the scholars whom they respect and hold in regard, because their leaders and their shaykhs misrepresent Ibn Taymeeyah and Ibn Abdul Wahhab and they misrepresent the scholars and leaders of the Dawa&#8217; as we previously mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not approach them from this angle, since it is not from wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, approach them from the angle of: ‘Malik said, Sufyaan ath-Thawree</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">said, al-Awzaa’ee said, Ibn &#8216;Uyainah said, Bukhari said, Muslim said, in such-and-such volume on such-and-such page.’  So the likes of these, they will accept from you.  Then if they accept this from you, they will after that respect Ibn Taymeeyah, they will know that he is on the truth and they will respect Ibn Abdul Wahab and they will know that he is on the truth etc.<em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: this is a word of admonition, to follow the path of wisdom in calling the people to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is from wisdom not to curse their <em>Jamaah</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allaah, lest they insult Allaah wrongfully without knowledge. &gt;&gt; [al-An’aam:108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Journey to Sudan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: when I went to Sudan, we stopped at Port Sudan.[1]  I was received by the youth of <em>Ansaar as-Sunnah</em> and they said to me: O shaykh we want to bring your attention to something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “Go ahead.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: “Say whatever you want, say: &#8216;Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said.&#8217; and attack with whatever you want of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> and misguidance; like supplicating to other than Allaah, slaughtering, vows and seeking help etc.  But do not mention: such-and-such sect, nor so-and-so shaykh.  Do not mention that the <em>Tijaaneeyah</em> are from the different sects, nor the <em>Batineeyah</em>, nor mention their leaders, but quote the <em>&#8216;Aqaaid</em> (beliefs); and you yourself will find that the truth will be accepted from you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “fine.”  And I followed that way and found a great acceptance from the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not think &#8211; O student of knowledge &#8211; that it is from the complete, truthful<em>Manhaj</em> that it is necessary to curse their shaykhs and to defame them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allaah, lest they insult Allaah wrongfully without knowledge. &gt;&gt; [al-An’aam:108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So don&#8217;t curse the shaykh or say: &#8216;deviant!&#8217; or something similar! Or such<strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong>and<strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong>such <em>Tariqaa</em> (<em>Soofee</em> path)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since, when they hear this they run away from you.  You will be sinful and will have pushed the people away then you will be those who cause the people to turn away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> sent Muadh and Abu Musa to Yemen he said: “Make things easy and do not make things difficult, give glad-tidings and do not push people away.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are from the ways in which there is ease and glad-tidings.  It does not cause the people to be driven away.  I swear by Allaah that I did not enter a masjid except that I saw joy on the faces of the people and I couldn&#8217;t exit the place due to the many people who came to me to shake my hand and invite me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the leaders of the <em>Soofeeyah &#8211; Shayaateen &#8211;</em> saw the danger of this way and this methodology in giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, so they gathered together and conspired and strung some statements together with which to refute me.  They announced a lecture for me in a big field.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we all gathered in this field and I spoke, then their leader got up and commented upon what I said, he began to allow seeking help from other than Allaah, to allow <em>Tawwassul </em>(Seeking closeness to Allaah with Haram means), to speak with the denial of <em>Sifaat</em>, talking and talking &#8230;&#8230;.. Supporting all types of falsehood with an evil interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he finished &#8211; he had no evidences, and he had mentioned weak and fabricated Ahadeeth and he mentioned sayings of Socrates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “O people, you have heard my speech and I say: ‘Allaah said, the Messenger said.  The well known scholars of the <em>Ummah</em> said.’  This man has mentioned fabricated Ahadeeth and did not support it with anything from the Qur&#8217;aan.  Did you hear: &#8216;Allaah said such-and-such in allowing seeking aid from other than Allaah?  And regarding the permissibility of <em>Tawwassul</em>?  Did you hear statements of the senior scholars like Malik and those like him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You did not hear that, rather you heard fabricated and weak Ahadeeth and the statements of people who you know well to believe in superstitions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this person who believed in superstitions began cursing and swearing.  And I began laughing, I did not curse him nor did I swear at him and I did not say anything more then: may Allaah bless you, may Allaah reward you, may Allaah reward you, may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we left, I swear by Allaah other than whom there is none worthy of worship except Him &#8211; the next day the people began talking in the <em>masajid</em> and the markets that the <em>Soofeeyah</em> were defeated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is an inference to a lecture that Shaykh Rabee’ gave in the city of Port Sudan in the year 1392 A.H.  This is just one of many of the evidences that Shaykh Rabee’ follows a moderate Manhaj &amp; has wisdom in giving Dawa’ to Allaah from the beginning of his life until today.  This is contrary to what some people claim that Shaykh Rabee’ follows a Manhaj of harshness. – Publisher’s Quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Narrated by Bukhari (3038) &amp; by Muslim (1733) from the hadeeth of Abu Musa al-Ashaari –radhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 5</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Guidance for the People</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So learn, O brothers, the correct methods of the <em>Sharia&#8217;</em>.  The aim is guidance for the people and the aim is conveying the truth to the hearts of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brother, it is upon you to use all that you can from the ways of the <em>Sharia&#8217;</em> in the path of <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah.  And we do not believe that the ends justify the means since this is from the characteristics of the people of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> who fell into &#8211; due to these characteristics &#8211; lying, twisting, circling around the subject and trickery.  Just as the Imam &#8216;Alee bin Harb al-Moosalee said: &#8216;Every person who follows his desire lies and he doesn&#8217;t care that he lies.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We don&#8217;t have any of these characteristics; we are the people of honesty and the people of truth.  We present the truth in a form and fashion which the people accept and it affects their hearts, may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we also went to &#8216;Kasla&#8217; in Sudan and <em>MashAllaah</em> the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> was going smoothly and well and all praise belongs to Allaah, we spoke there and praise belongs to Allaah and Allaah made our speech beneficial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we went to &#8216;al-Ghazarif&#8217; it is a small city there and we rotated between all the <em>masajd</em> in that place.  The people said: there does not remain in this city except one <em>masjid</em>, which is with the <em>Tijaaneeyah</em>, which we cannot get to!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I SAID: &#8216;WHY NOT?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;They&#8217;re prejudiced, severely prejudiced.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: &#8216;Let&#8217;s go to them and request permission, if they allow us to talk, we will convey the message and if they prevent us then we have an excuse in front of Allaah, it is not necessary that we face them with force and strength <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we went there and the imam led us in prayer.  After we finished it, I gave him Salaams and said to him, will you allow me to deliver a speech to these brothers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;go ahead.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I spoke, called to Allaah, to Tawheed, to Sunnah and to other matters of knowledge.  I criticized some of the mistakes which are present, points of misguidance until I reached to the hadeeth of &#8216;Aeysha <em>–radhiAllaahu anha-</em> which is mentioned by Bukhari and Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are three things, whoever speaks with one of them then he has told a major lie against Allaah: whoever says: that Muhammad saw his Lord; then he has told a major lie against Allaah, whoever says: that Muhammad knows what will happen tomorrow; then he has told a major lie against Allaah’: and I mentioned the proofs for that &#8211; &#8216;and he who claims that Muhammad did not convey what was revealed to him; then he has told a major lie against Allaah.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Imam stood up &#8211; he was annoyed and he said to me: ‘I swear by Allaah that indeed Muhammad saw his Lord with his own eyes!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him: <em>JazakAllaahu khair</em>.  As for ‘Aeysha &#8211; who is the most knowledgeable of the people about the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em>, she said: ‘whoever says: that Muhammad saw his Lord; then he has told a major lie against Allaah.’ If the Messenger of Allaah had seen his Lord he would have told her, but he did not tell her this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he began to make a din and press me, I said to him: ‘O my brother wait until I finish my talk, then after that ask about whatever you want.  That which I know I can answer, that which I do not know, I&#8217;ll say to you Allaah knows best.’  I left him and continued speaking, I don&#8217;t know if he remained or left.  I don’t know, I didn&#8217;t turn around towards him. Then I heard a man saying:  ‘I swear that what this man is speaking the truth!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I heard the same sentence again from somebody else and he added: &#8216;the man is saying: &#8216;Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said.&#8217; <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the <em>Adhaan</em> was called for the <em>Isha</em> prayer, so the talk ended.  The prayer was about to begin and the people began pushing me to lead them in prayer. So I said to them: &#8216;no way, I won&#8217;t lead you in prayer, the <em>Imam</em> will lead.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;we swear by Allaah you will lead the prayer, we swear by Allaah you will lead the prayer.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: &#8216;OK&#8217; and I led them in prayer.  After we finished I left with the youth of<em>Ansaar as-Sunnah </em>and I asked them: &#8216;where did the <em>Imam</em> go?&#8217; They said: &#8216;They evicted him.&#8217; I said: &#8216;who evicted him?&#8217; they said: &#8216;we swear by Allaah his congregation evicted him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. &#8211; O BROTHERS &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person comes and says that the <em>Tijaaneeyah</em> <em>al-Marganiyaah</em> are fools! They might slaughter him, not just evict him, but if you come to them with wisdom and gentleness <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> then Allaah will make them benefit by this.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Advice to the Salafiyyoon</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, use beneficial knowledge and solid proof and beneficial wisdom in your <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>. You should have all the noble and beautiful manners encouraged by the Book and the Messenger of guidance; indeed they are causes for victory and causes for success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have to believe that the Companions did not spread Islaam or enter it into the hearts except with their wisdom and their knowledge more so than with their swords.  However, whoever enters into Islaam under the sword might not be firm, but whoever enters Islaam by way of knowledge, proof and evidence then this is what makes his Eemaan firm by Allaah&#8217;s permission and His assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon you to have these good methods and also to be serious about knowledge.  You have to be serious about <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Now &#8211; O brothers &#8211; I advise you with two issues:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Brotherhood between all of <em>Ahl -ul-Sunnah</em>; So O you Salafees, disseminate the soul of love and brotherhood between yourselves.  Put into effect what the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> informed us of regarding the believers: ‘Like a building, some of its parts supporting others.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that they are: ‘Like a single body if one limb complains then the rest of the body suffers with fever and insomnia.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how you should be O brothers: distance yourselves from the causes of splitting, I swear by Allaah indeed it is a dangerous evil and a disastrous disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: distance yourselves from the causes which lead to enmity, hatred, splitting up and dissension.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Keep away from these things; because this has become predominant nowadays at the hands of people, about whom only Allaah knows their condition and intent.  It has become predominant and has torn apart the youth in this country &#8211; whether in the university or other than it &#8211; or in the other parts of the <em>Duniya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why?! Because those who are not from its people – neither in knowledge nor in understanding &#8211; entered into the arena of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that the enemies could have entered someone into the midst of the <em>Salafeeyeen</em> to tear them apart and split them up, and this issue is not unlikely, rather it can truly happen <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Strive to have brotherhood.  If any dissension has occurred between you, then both parties should make themselves forget what is past and start with a clean slate now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say to the brothers: whoever falls short it is not allowed to debase him, nor destroy the one who is deficient.  Whoever makes a mistake amongst us we do not destroy him. <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> &#8211; but we cure him with gentleness, wisdom and face him with love and friendship and all the rest of the righteous manners, along with the correct <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> until he repents.  And if there remains a weakness in him then we are not hasty with him, or otherwise, I swear by Allaah no one will remain, no one will remain!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people now who chase after the Salafis so much so that they reached the scholars and called them those who water things down <em>(Mumaya’een)</em>!! There is hardly any scholar in the arena of <em>Dawa’</em> today except that he has been falsely attacked with this claim about him!  Of course this is the way of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen and the way of <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> since, from the weapons of the <em>Ahl ul-Bid</em>a’ is that they begin by overthrowing the scholars, rather it is the Jewish Masonic way: that if you wanted to discredit an idea, then discredit their scholars or their personalities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So keep away from this rotten legacy and have respect for the scholars.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Narrated by Bukhari (481) &amp; by Muslim (2585) from the hadeeth of Abu Musa –radhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Narrated by Bukhari (6011) &amp; Muslim (2586) from the hadeeth of an-Nu’maan bin Basheer –radhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 6</h2>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">The Intent of The Opponents</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I swear by Allaah; that those who make efforts in speech against me &#8211; or attack that which we are upon – do not do so except that the intended result is to bring down the <em>Manhaj</em>; so the one who dislikes this <em>Manhaj</em> speaks about its scholars.  He who hates this <em>Manhaj</em> and wants to bring it down follows this path, so that there are no obstacles for them: they follow way of the Jews and the way of the misguided groups from the Raawafidah and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Raawafidah hate Islaam and they are not capable of speaking against Muhammad &#8211;<em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, so they speak against Abu Bakr and Umar and the scholars of the <em>Ummah</em>; they want to overthrow Islaam.  If the people of major <em>Bida&#8217;</em> speak: then they don&#8217;t speak against Ahmad and Shafi&#8217;, but they speak against Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and Ibn Taymeeyah and their likes; so that they can try to overthrow this <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And now, we have people who have grown up amongst the ranks of the<em>Salafeeyeen</em>, I was not aware that they wanted to break up the leaders from amongst the scholars!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people, what do they want? What do they want? If they intend Allaah and the Hereafter and intended to aid this <em>Manhaj</em> – they claim to love this<em>Manhaj</em> – but I swear by Allaah, if they really loved it they would have defended the scholars of this <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not feel safe about your <em>Deen</em> with these people.  Do not regard them as trustworthy. <em>BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> &#8211; be completely careful of them, hold together firmly and have brotherhood amongst yourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know that you are not without blame, nor are the scholars without blame – we sometimes make mistakes with the exception of those who fall into <em>Rafd</em> or<em>‘aatizal</em> or <em>Tajahum</em> or fall into <em>Hizbeeyah</em> from the different parties which are present; then this person is the one to be abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>Salafi</em> who has allegiance to the <em>Salafeeyeen</em> and loves the <em>Salafi</em><em>Manhaj</em> <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>&#8211; and dislikes the different groups, dislikes <em>Bida’</em> and its people – amongst other aspects from the signs of the <em>Salafi</em> <em>Manhaj</em> – but then this <em>Salafi</em> becomes weak in other points, here we are gentle with this person we do not leave him but we advise him and we rescue him and we are patient with him and we try to cure him <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it were said: whoever makes a mistake is destroyed! Then according to this statement no-one remains! This is why you see these people, when they have finished dealing with the youth; they begin by overthrowing the scholars – this is the <em>Manhaj</em> of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen when they entered into many countries.  The first thing they started with was overthrowing the scholars and at the same time they defend Sayyid Qutb, Hasan al-Banna, Mawdudi and others from amongst <em>Ahl –ul Bida’</em>.  They overthrow the scholars of the <em>Salafi Manhaj</em> and they described the scholars as being agents and spies and scholars of the rulers……and many other accusations!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is their intent!?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their intent is to overthrow the <em>Salafi</em> <em>Manhaj</em> and to establish falsehood and misguidance upon mutiny.   Those who now defame the scholars say that they themselves are the <em>Salafiyoon</em> yet, along with that, they criticize the scholars of the <em>Salafiyyah</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What do they want? Do they want to raise the banner of Islaam!? And raise the banner of the Sunnah and the <em>Manhaj</em> <em>as-Salafi</em>?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never, never!  These are indications and proofs that they are blameworthy liars, no matter what they claim for themselves.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Final Counsel</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise you O brothers and I emphasize that you leave off splitting and that you should have brotherhood and mutual cooperation upon the truth. You should spread this <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> between the students of the university and other than them in its correct and beautiful form, not in the distorted form which these people follow!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Present the <em>Dawa&#8217; as-Salafiyyah</em> as I mentioned in a beautiful form with the words; ‘Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said, the Companions said, Shafi&#8217; said, Ahmad said, Bukhari said, Muslim said’, also the scholars of Islaam whom they respect and revere, bring their attention to the speech of the scholars <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> this will aid you a great deal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, you will find some people who will be obstinate but not everyone is obstinate.  You will find most of the people accepting your <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> whether it is here in the university or when you return to your countries. Use these methods which attract the people to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em>, to the <em>Manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, to the correct beliefs and correct <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka  wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> that He gives us and you capability and success in that which He loves and is pleased with and that He makes us from the sincere callers and practising scholars and keeps us and you away from the plots of<em>Shaytaan</em>, also from the plots of the <em>Shayateen</em> from <em>Jinn</em> and mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Him <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> that He puts love between your hearts and gathers you upon the truth, that you are beneficial wherever you reside and wherever you travel and go to, and I ask Allaah to make that a reality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

Translated by afatwa.com</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">Why are all of those who call towards Tawhîd called as “Wahhâbiyyah” ever since Shaykh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhâb (rahimahullâh)? This word scares off many people from those who call towards Tawhîd.</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh al-Fawzân</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No, it doesn’t scare off at all. We are proud of the fact that the one who calls towards Tawhîd is called as “Wahhâbî” and all praise is due to Allâh. What is the one who calls towards Shirk (idolatry, polytheism) called then? What is he called? Jâhilî!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are proud of it. Let them then say “Wahhâbî”. They are thusly themselves witnessing that the call of Wahhâbiyyah is a call towards Tawhîd. The author of “al-Lanjah” (rahimahullâh) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“If the one who follows Ahmad is a Wahhâbî, then let the humans and Jinns witness that I am a Wahhâbî.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad here is the messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam);</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“If the one who follows Ahmad is a Wahhâbî, then let the humans and Jinns witness that I am a Wahhâbî.”</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>A message to the woman &#8211;  Lecture by Shaykh Sâlih al-Fawzân (Must see)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzaan (hafidahullâh) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allâh, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allâh and may the blessings and peace be upon our prophet Muhammad and all of his family and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these two blessed Friday sermons, we have heard a lot of good by our preacher (Khatîb) –may Allâh grant him success. He spoke on one of the most serious issues, namely the issue of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers! Allâh (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ) created the woman, just as the man, for a great duty in this life. Each got their (own) task. The men got their tasks and the women got their tasks. If each stick to their own task and fulfill it, the society would attain a great deal of good. If this order were to be shaken, a great deficiency would occur, just as you heard about the role of the woman in the pre-Islamic time of ignorance, as well as her role in the disbelieving countries of today and her role with the religious Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman is very important and that is why the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered that she is well taken care of. He said in his Kutbah (sermon) on ‘Arafah in connection to his farewell pilgrimage:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Treat your women well, for they are captives with you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(Ibn Mâjah 1851)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered us to take good care of the women because they play an important role in the society. It’s not only about taking good care of them and giving them their due rights… this is obligatory, what is more important is to protect them from indecencies – the woman is weak as you know – and [to protect them from] trying appearances [i.e. fitnah] and letting them do whatever they want to do. This is the most important thing the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered [in regards to women], namely that we protect them. Allâh (jalla wa ‘alâ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الرِّجَالُ قَوَّامُونَ عَلَى النِّسَاء بِمَا فَضَّلَ اللّهُ بَعْضَهُمْ عَلَى بَعْضٍ وَبِمَا أَنفَقُواْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ فَالصَّالِحَاتُ قَانِتَاتٌ حَافِظَاتٌ لِّلْغَيْبِ بِمَا حَفِظَ اللّهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Men are in charge of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. Therefore the righteous women are devoutly obedient (to Allâh and to their husbands), and guard in the husband’s absence what Allâh orders them to guard (e.g. their chastity, their husband’s property, etc.).” (The Qur’ân 4:34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What does it mean that the man is in charge of the woman? Is it only about providing (for her) and justice? It is not only about that. His responsibility is (also) about something that is more important. He should namely protect this woman so that she doesn’t lose it, frees herself and [begins to] take shyness and chastity lightly. This is the greatest responsibility of the man in regards to the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The “man” in the verse is not only referring to the husband. The man, whether it be her father, brother or some other guardian, is responsible for her and protects her. If it were to go to the length of him having to punish her, he then does it<strong><sup>1</sup>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَاللاَّتِي تَخَافُونَ نُشُوزَهُنَّ فَعِظُوهُنَّ وَاهْجُرُوهُنَّ فِي الْمَضَاجِعِ وَاضْرِبُوهُنَّ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“But those [wives] form whom you fear arrogance – [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them.” (The Qur’ân 4:34, interpretation of the meanings)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman is thus in need of being under observation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The enemies of Islam of these days concentrate on the issue of women. They know that she is the most serious matter in the society. They focus on her. They wage war against the chastity and honour and consider it to be oppression against women. If the woman sticks to chastity and honour, they say that she is deprived of liberty. The fact of the matter is that it is just at that time her freedom (liberty) is preserved (i.e. when she sticks to chastity and honour). She can feely obey Allâh, raise her children and fulfill that which Allâh has given her as a responsibility. She is as a shepherdess in the home of her husband and (is) responsible for her flock. This is her true freedom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for her freedom in nudity, indecencies in front of other people, flirtatious gait in the stores/shops and the ability to go wherever she wants to, then this is a type of slavery and not a freedom. It’s slavery to temptation and satan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O servants of Allâh! Freedom lies in obeying and worshiping Allâh. Therein lies the glory of the soul and the honour of the human and their happiness in this life and the next one. The one who acts disobediently towards Allâh and his commands, whether it is about women or anything else, is one of the degraded slaves of the devils among the humans and the Jinns. It is slavery and not freedom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have to know this! We have to preserve our women among the wives, daughters and relatives. We have to cooperate in protecting them and to refrain from listening to this propaganda [by the Kuffâr in west]. The Kuffâr (disbelievers) are trying to eradicate Islam by all possible means. The greatest ways of destruction is to destroy the woman. Because the woman is the basis of the family and the home. If she is destroyed, the home and the family is destroyed as well. The daughters will be destroyed after having copied their destroyed mothers and relatives. Thus, we have to safeguard our women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even If the Kuffâr have been successful in degrading some Islamic countries, they will never – by the will and motion of Allâh – succeed in doing the same thing with this county, which is the country of the two holy mosques in which the revelation was sent down to and in which the messenger (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was sent. Herein are men who take care of her honour, even if some deluded men and women take this issue lightly. This country has men who safeguard their honour and the honour of their female relatives. You belong to them – in sha’ Allâh – and (those) who will initiate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have to fear Allâh (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ) and live up to this great responsibility. If we do it, we’ll protect our homes, children, families and societies. She is thusly the basis. Thus, the enemy focuses on her. They are focused on the woman. They got her in a specific focus you are familiar with; in books, papers, magazines, newspapers, media, internet, and all other (possible) fields. They want this country to end up as the other countries so that the manners disappear and the honour gets lost. It will then become easy for the Kuffar (disbelievers) to eradicate Islam from its basis. The poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘The nations exist as long as their manners exist, when their manners vanish, so do they.’</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the manners disappear, then there is nothing left. The purpose of the manners is the honour, behavior, shyness and dignity. This is what the manners are (ahlâq). Another poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>‘I do not say that one should allow the women to show their faces as the men and to walk around in the shops, they have a lot of duties in their homes as the man who is the possessor of the sword and the spear.’</em><strong><sup>2</sup></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman has her line of work and the man has his. If each of them does their suitable works, the society will then be good and the welfare will be complete. But if this order were to be shaken, the society would then become deficient. That is why the prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) cursed the masculine women and the feminine men. All of this just to preserve the woman and allow her to stay in her natural nature, religion, character and honour. The glory and honour should be protected and preserved. Read the chapter “an-Nûr” (of the Qur’ân). You will find therein how greatly and notably the women are protected with covering and permission before one enters into the homes. The same goes for the Sunnah. The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) forbade the woman from travelling alone without a Mahram and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is not allowed for a woman who believes in Allâh and the Last day to travel without a Mahram.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(al-Bukhari [3006] and Muslim [1341])</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He forbade that she is alone in private with a man who’s not her Mahram and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“A man is not alone with a woman but that the Shaytân makes a third.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(at-Tirmidhi 1171)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He forbade the women from mixing with the men. That is why the women prayed with the Muslims behind the messenger of Allâh (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and behind the men in the mosque of the messenger of Allâh (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam). They were so covered that no one could recognize them. They prayed behind the men. Herein is a proof that mixing is prohibited between both of the sexes. If a woman is not allowed to mix with men in the mosque, which is a place of worship and piousness, one can then ask how she would be allowed to mix with them in offices, amusement parks, parties, and markets. This matter is very serious. We’re surrounded by the enemy now and an ideological warfare. You are well aware of the ideological warfare that is taking place now. The Kuffar (disbelievers) are waging war against the Muslim countries with weapons, ideologies and all other means. We are, as I said before, surrounded by the enemy. We have to be observant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we are with Allâh, Allâh is with us. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لَا تَخَافَا إِنَّنِي مَعَكُمَا أَسْمَعُ وَأَرَى</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He (Allâh) said: “Fear not, verily! I am with you both, hearing and seeing.” (The Qur’ân 20:46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If we are with Allâh, Allâh is then with us. And if Allâh is with us, nobody can hurt us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">لاَ تَحْزَنْ إِنَّ اللّهَ مَعَنَا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allâh is with us.” (The Qur’ân 9:40, interpretation of the meanings)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But who is Allâh with? Allâh is especially with the pious, those who do the right and the believers. We thusly have to be with Allâh (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ). The prophet (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said to Ibn ‘Abbâs [what means]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Boy! Take care of Allâh and He will take care of you. Take care of Allâh and you will find Him in front of you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(at-Tirmidhî 2516)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have to, as I said before, be with Allâh, obey Him and follow His commands and avoid His prohibitions for Him (subhânahu wa ta’âlâ) to be with us with His victory, His support and His help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allâh for forgiveness and I repent before Him. And I ask Allâh to preserve us and you with His preservation and that He looks after us and you with His victory and help. And may the blessings and peace be upon our prophet Muhammad and all of his family and companions</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">الشيخ محمد بن صالح العثيمين</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhmmad ibn Saalih al-Uthaymeen affirms that the Salafis are following the Hizb of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh explains that the Salafis who follow the truth, the way of the Salaf, without tahazzub (partisanship), are the party of Allaah in truth, and that it is obligatory for everyone to associate himself with it. The Shaykh also explains that none can be from this party of Allaah (of Salafiyyah) unless they actually follow the way of the Salaf in reality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: The Shaykh praised the refutations of Shaykh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee and his defending the manhaj of calling to Allaah. These matters are well-recorded and known. Thus, when the Shaykh is warning from tahazzub as occurs in other statements of his, even if it be in the name of &#8220;Salafiyyah&#8221;, then that applies to those deviants who followed other methodologies (like those of the Ikhwanis) whilst claiming to be &#8220;Salafis&#8221; and declaring others to be astray unless they join their group. This behaviour was manifest in the way of Abd al-Rahman Abd al-Khaliq and his so-called &#8220;Scientific Salafiyyah&#8221; movement, he reviled some of the major Scholars, and brought destructive false principles under the banner of Salafiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No matter how hard people have tried to malign the Salafis who follow the way of the Salaf in aqidah and manhaj, following the scholars in that, all their attempts to use the various statements of Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin in which he warns, correctly, from falling into tahazzub in the name of Salafiyyah, have failed. This is because the very issues around which the Salafis based their criticism and warning against the opposers, were similarly spoken of and outlined by Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin by the time he passed away (rahimahullaah) and they include matters pertaining to Sayyid Qutb, Takfir of the rulers, rebellion, multiplicity of groups (jamaa&#8217;aat), false methodologies in calling to Allaah, and calling to Tawhid, demonstrations and so on. Further, Shaykh Ibn Uthaymin praised Shaykh Rabee on many occasions and explained that the only reason the opposers attack him because he spoke of some of their figureheads.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the truth is clear and only those are blind who choose to be blind, despite the matters being as clear as daylight.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">An episode of Saudi&#8217;s Government Agency <strong>General Presidency Of the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice</strong> focuses on sorcerers/witches.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Exposed: the depths, in terms of blasphemy/depraved acts, sorcerers fall to please devils and cast spells. This is not fiction; it is from an official Saudi source.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saudi has a dedicated police team to track and persecute sorcerers. Many diseases that science can&#8217;t cure are caused by witchcraft (in the West the afflicted are often regarded as a psychiatric patients and their suffering only numbed by drugs.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately in other Muslim countries these crimes are committed in open yet authorities do little to address them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">watch it in full !! (around 40 mins)</p>

A fatwa from Ibn Taymiyah on Why we should seek Laylatul-Qadr on all of the last ten nights of Ramadan. Translated by Owais al Hashimi hafidhahullaah</p>
<p>Read the PDf @ <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4RZz-y21qm_WkhZU3BscF93THc/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4RZz-y21qm_WkhZU3BscF93THc/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>When To Seek Out Laylatul-Qadr (The Night Of Decree)</strong><br />
Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah -rahimahullaah<br />
Translated by Aboo Talhah Daawood ibn Ronald Burbank rahimahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah -rahimahullaah- was asked about LaylatulQadr, whilst imprisoned in the mountain citadel (in Cairo) in the year 706 H. So he responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“All praise is for Allaah. Laylatul-Qadr is in the last ten (nights) of the month of Ramadaan. This is what is authentic from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) , that he said: &lt;&lt;<strong>It is within the last ten of Ramadaan</strong>&gt;&gt;, and it is within the odd nights from them [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However the odd nights may be counted with reference to what has already passed by, such that it should be sought on the night of the twenty first, the night of the twenty third, the night of the twenty fifth, the night of the twenty seventh, and the night of the twenty ninth; and they may otherwise be counted with reference to what remains, just as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>On the night when nine remain, on the night when seven remain, on the night when five remain, on the night when three remain</strong>.&gt;&gt; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based upon this, if the month is of thirty days, then that will be one of the even nights. So the twenty second will be (the night) when nine remain, the twenty fourth will be when seven remain; and this is how Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudree explained it in the authentic hadeeth; and this is how the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) established it in the month. If, however, the month is of twenty nine days, then counting in accordance with what remains will then be just the same as counting in accordance with what has passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this being the case, it is befitting that the Believer seeks it out in all of the last ten, just as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>Seek it out in the last ten</strong>.&gt;&gt; [3] And it occurs more frequently in the last seven; and it occurs most frequently on the twenty seventh, just as Ubayy ibn Ka`b used to swear an oath that it was the twenty seventh night. So it was said to him: “How have you come to know that?” So he replied: “On account of the sign which Allaah&#8221;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) informed us of. He informed us that the sun rises on the morning following it being like a brass dish, having no rays.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sign which Ubayy ibn Ka`b reported from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is from the most well known signs occurring in hadeeth; and it is related regarding its signs that it is a night that is &#8220;bright, shining&#8221;; and it is calm; it is not very hot, nor very cold. It may occur that Allaah reveals it to some of the people in a dream, or whilst awake, such that he sees its light, or he sees one who says to him: &#8220;This is Laylatul-Qadr&#8221;; or he may open his heart to witnessing such things that make the affair clear to him, and Allaah -the Most High- knows best.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[&#8220;Majmoo`ul-Fataawaa&#8221;: (25/284-286).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no.2016) and Muslim (no.1167/217) as a hadeeth of Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudree -radiyallaahu `anhu; and by al-Bukhaaree (no.2017) as a hadeeth of `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration of Muslim (no.1167/217) contains the addition that the narrator Abun-Nadrah said: &#8220;I said: &#8220;O Aboo Sa`eed! You know better about the numbers than us.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Indeed, we have more right to that than you.&#8221; He said: I said: &#8220;What is the ninth, the seventh, and the fifth?&#8221;He said: “When twenty one have passed, then that follows it is the twenty second:and it is the ninth; and when twenty three have passed, then that which follows it is the seventh; and when twenty five have passed, then that which follows it is the fifth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no.2021) as a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas -radiyallaahu `anhumaa.<br />
[3] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no.2020) and Muslim (no.1169) as a hadeeth of `Aa·ishah &#8211; radiyallaahu `anhaa.<br />
[4] Reported by Muslim (no.762).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatawaa noor &#8216;ala adarb tape no321</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Questioner</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allah extend your life! This is the questioner, Abu Abdullah, he says in the first question, If a person sees what amazes him, does he say Maashaa Allah Tabaarak Allah (As Allah wills, blessed is Allah!), or Maashaa Allah Tabaarak Allah Laa Quwwata illah billah (As Allah wills, blessed is Allah, there is no strength except with Allah) and are they all correct?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praises are due to Allah, Lord of the worlds and prayer and salutation upon our prophet, Muhammad, his family, his companions and those who follow them in goodness until the Day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person sees that which amazes (pleases) him, pertaining to his wealth, then he should say <strong>Maashaa Allah Laa Quwwata illa billah</strong>, just as in the story of the companion of the two gardens, when his companion said to him: It was better for you to say, when you entered your garden: That which Allah wills there is no power except with Allah. This is if he sees something amazing (pleasing) with his wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he sees it in other than himself then he should say <strong>Barakallahu Alaihi </strong>(May Allah bless it for him) or a statement similar to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if he sees something that amazes (pleases) him from the matters of the Dunya (world) he should say: <strong>Labbaik, Innal Aish, Aishul Aakhirah</strong>, as the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam ) used to say. So he says Labbaik meaning an answer to you then he said verily the (real) life is the life of the hereafter. He makes it firm within himself at the same instance that the Dunya and whatever is within it does not remain and there is not any life in it but verily the real life is the life of the hereafter.</p>
