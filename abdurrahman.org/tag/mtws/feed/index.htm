										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Question</span>:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What are the <strong>Rawatib (Sunnah Prayers associated with Obligatory Prayers)</strong> which can be made up if the person misses them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaykh Bin Baz:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Rawatib which the Prophet, peace be upon him, used to preserve are twelve Rakats, these are the Rawatib; for the resident not the traveler. Twelve Rakats; four before Thur prayer with two tasleems, and two after Thur prayer; this is six. Two after Magrib prayer and two after Isha prayer; this is ten. And two before the morning (Fajr) prayer; this is twelve. The Prophet, peace be upon him, used to practice these consistently while present at his residence. And he, peace be upon him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><em>“<span style="color:#008000;">Whoever preserves four Rakats before Thur and four after it, Allah will make him forbidden for the Fire</span>.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the person prays four after Thur, thus adding two Rakat then this is better, but it is not Rawatib. The Rawatib is two Rakats. If he prays four after Thur prayer then this has in it virtue and a tremendous amount of good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a similar fashion before Asr prayer it is recommended for the person to pray four Rakats, but these are not Rawatib, rather they are recommended. This is based upon the statement of the Messenger of Allah, peace be upon him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“May Allah have mercy upon the person who prays four Rakats before Asr prayer”.</span><br />
</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise if he prays two Rakats before Magrib prayer and two Rakats before Isha prayer, between the Athan and the Iqamah, this is recommended; but these are not Rawatib. Rather it is recommended after the Athan to pray two Rakats, after the Athan for Maghrib and after the Athan for Isha the person prays two Rakats; two Rakats which are different than the two Rakats to greet the Masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for greeting the Masjid, if the person enters the Masjid even before the Athan then he greets the Masjid with two Rakats of prayer. And if he enters after the Athan, the Athan of Maghrib or after the Athan of Isha, then he greets the Masjid with two Rakats of prayer and this will suffice him from the two Rakats between the Athan and the Iqamah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>As for travel &#8211;</strong> then it is only prescribed to pray the Sunnah prayers of Fajr and the Witr prayer. During travel the person only prays the Witr and Tahajjud prayers during the night, and he prays the Sunnah prayers of Fajr. As for the Sunnah prayers of Thur, Maghrib, and Isha, then it is better to leave them during travel. But as it relates to the Sunnah prayers of Fajr, then the Prophet, peace be upon him, used to preserve then during travel and while he was a resident.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if the person misses the Sunnah prayer for Fajr he prays them after the Fajr prayer or after the sun has risen. As for the other Rawatib, for Thur, Maghrib, and Isha, then they are not made up after the time has passed; if the time passed they are not made up. Therefore one would not make up the Sunnah prayers for Thur after Asr, nor the Sunnah prayers for Maghrib after Isha, nor the Sunnah prayers for Isha after Fajr. These prayers are not made up. As for the Sunnah prayer for Fajr then it is made up. If he prays it after the Fajr prayer then there is no problem with this. And if he prays it after the sun has risen and reached its height then this is better.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Sunnah prayer of Duha and Tahajjud prayers at night then they are prescribed for the travel and the resident. Likewise is the Sunnah prayer after completing Wudu; after the person completes Wudu it is recommended (for him to pray) whether he is on a journey or a resident.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise if a person enters a Masjid while upon a journey he also prays two Rakats of prayer, even if he is travelling. May Allah reward you with good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore we will summarize the answer once again, if you will allow me; the Sunnah prayers which are recommended to make up.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First the summary of the answer: The twelve Rawatib which are specific to the resident are: Four Rakats before Thur with two tasleems, two Rakats after Thur with one tasleem; two Rakats after Maghrib with one tasleem; two Rakats after Isha with one tasleem, and two Rakats before the morning prayer after the rising of the Fajr. These are the Rawatib that the Prophet, peace be upon him, used to preserve.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those that are made up then it is only the Sunnah prayer for Fajr, if it is missed then it is made up after Fajr or after the rising of the sun. Likewise the Sunnah prayers that come before Thur can be made up after Thur. If the four Sunnah prayer that come before Thur are missed they are prayed after Thur, then he prays the two Rakats after Thur; thus praying six Rakats. The four that come before Thur, and the two Rawatib that come after Thur. May Allah reward you with good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Our Shaykh, may Allaah reward you and treat you well. We are in need of you commenting on this affair as there is a time drawing near for the disbelievers in our land and many of the Muslims fall into participating in it and allowing their children to do so. It is as follows:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The disbelievers have a holiday called <span class="il">Halloween</span> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">الهالوين</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">It is also called: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">عيد الرعب</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">It is known that all of the holidays of the disbelievers are impermissible for the Muslims; however, this holiday has origins in Shirk and worship of the devils. It is said that the ancient Christians used to believe that on October 31st or around this day, the devils and demons were released from Hell and would cause havoc upon the lands. The only people whom they would not harm were those who made sacrifices by placing cakes and milk on the graves of the dead for the purpose of keeping the dead at ease. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Today, the people, on this day, dress up in costumes as monsters and devils and other things, some frightening and some not frightening, to simulate the dead and the devils coming out on this night. They dress their children up in these costumes and they walk about in the neighborhoods and knock on the people&#8217;s doors and say: &#8220;Trick or treat&#8221;. The meaning is: &#8220;Either you give me a treat or I will do a trick (i.e., some type of evil to you or your home.&#8221; And the occupants of the home usually buy candy to give the children who are dressed in the costume. This is a connection to the giving of cakes and milk to the inhabitants of the grave that the ancient Christians would do. The people also decorate their homes to look like scary haunted houses in celebration of this Satanic day.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">This holiday is very big in these lands, yet I have not found, in my research, any of the scholars speaking about it. My dear Shaykh, is it possible for you to comment on this in a recorded statement on Whatsapp, which I will translate and spread before the day of October 31st to warn the Muslims from participating in this day and allowing their children to do so. May Allah reward you and beautify you with Tawheed and the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Fu’aad Al-‘Amree responds:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the praise is for Allaah; may prayers and peace be upon the Messenger of Allaah, his family and companions altogether. As to proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say, in response to that the mention of which was presented in the question: It is not permissible for the Muslim who believes in Allaah and the last day to participate with the disbelievers and polytheists in their holidays. Allaah the Exalted says regarding the descriptions of the slaves of Ar-Rahmaan:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالَّذِينَ لَا يَشْهَدُونَ الزُّورَ وَإِذَا مَرُّوا بِاللَّغْوِ مَرُّوا كِرَامًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And those who do not witness falsehood, and if they pass by some evil play or evil talk, they pass by it with dignity. (Al-Furqan 25:72)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujaahid and others have stated that: Az-Zoor الزُّورَ is the ‘Eids of the polytheists. When the Prophet, upon him be prayers and peace, came to Al-Madeenah and found them having two days in which they played he asked about them. He was informed that they were two days in which they would play during the days of Jahiliyah. He repudiated them with his statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has replaced them with that which is better than them; the day of Ad’haa and the day of Fitr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Participating in holidays of falsehood contains imitation of their people. It has been authentically narrated from the Prophet, upon him be prayers and peace, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who imitates a people is one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon he who desires safety for himself to cling to the pure legislation and to bite onto the guidance of the Prophet, upon him be prayers and peace, with the molar teeth; and to abandon all of that which Allaah the Exalted has prohibited. Shaykhul-Islaam has written, regarding this issue, a magnificent treatise which the one who seeks the truth and desires felicity should refer to, entitled: Iqtidaa’ As-Siraat Al-Mustaqeem Mukhaalifah As’haabil-Jaheem</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sent Via Whatsapp<br />
Translated by <strong>Raha ibn Donald Batts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الحمد لله، والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله صلى الله عليه وعلى آله وصحبه أجمعين، وبعد: فأقول جوابا على ماتقدم ذكره في السؤال: ﻻ يجوز لمسلم يؤمن بالله واليوم اﻵخر أن يشارك الكفار والمشركين في أعيادهم، قال تعالى في صفات عباد الرحمن (والذين ﻻ يشهدون الزور وإذا مروا باللغو مروا كراما)قال مجاهد وغيره: الزور أعياد المشركين. والنبي عليه الصﻻة والسﻻم لما قدم المدينة ووجد لهم يومين يلعبون فيهما، فسأل عنهما فأخبر بأنهما يومان كانوا يلعبون فيهما في الجاهلية. فأنكر عليهم بقوله:(قد أبدلكم الله بخير منهما يوم اﻷضحي ويوم الفطر) رواه أبو داود. والمشاركة في اﻷعياد الباطلة فيه تشبه بأهلها وقد صح عن النبي عليه الصﻻة والسﻻم قوله:(من تشبه بقوم فهو منهم) رواه أبو داود . فالواحب على من أراد النجاة لنفسه أن يلزم الشرع المطهر، وأن يعض بالنواجذ على هدي النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم، وأن يهجر كل ما حرم الله تعالى. وقد كتب شيخ اﻹسﻻم في هذا الباب رسالة عظيمة فليراجعها طالب الحق وباغي السعادة والنجاة بعنوان اقتضاء الصراط المستقيم مخالفة أصحاب الجحيم<br />
