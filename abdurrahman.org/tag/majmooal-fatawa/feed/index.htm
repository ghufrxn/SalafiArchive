<p class="has-text-align-center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Difference between Kufr and Shirk</strong></span></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A Muslim sister N. S. `A from Riyadh says: What is the difference between Kufr (disbelief) and Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)? Please, advise. May Allah reward you!</span></strong></p>



<p><strong><span style="color:#808080;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Kufr</strong> </span>is the denial and concealment of the Truth such as those who deny the obligation of Salah, Zakah, Sawm, Hajj in case of being financially and physically able, and dutifulness to one&#8217;s parents, and so on.&nbsp;It is also like those who deny the prohibition of Zina (premarital sexual intercourse and/or adultery), consuming Khamr (intoxicants), and disobeying one’s parents.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shirk</span> </strong>is to devote the acts of worship to anything beside Allah (Exalted be He) such as those who seek the help of the dead, the absent, the Jinn, idols, the stars, and so on or those who offer sacrifices or make vows to them.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">A Kafir (disbeliever) may be called a Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and vice versa. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says,</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allâh, any other ilâh (god), of whom he has no proof; then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! Al­Kâfirûn (the disbelievers in Allâh and in the Oneness of Allâh, polytheists, pagans, idolaters) will not be successful.</span></strong>&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Allah (may He be Praised) also says, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode.&#8221;</span></strong></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In Surah Fatir, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Such is Allâh, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmîr (the thin membrane over the date­stone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص) like Him Who is the All­Knower (of everything).&#8221;</span> </strong>Here, Allah (Exalted be He) names their call upon things other than Him as Shirk and in Surah Al­Mu&#8217;minun, Allah (Exalted be He) names it Kufr.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">In Surah Al­Tawbah, Allah (Glorified be He) says, <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;They (the disbelievers, the Jews and the Christians) want to extinguish Allâh’s Light (with which Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص has been sent ­ Islâmic Monotheism) with their mouths, but Allâh will not allow except that His Light should be perfected even though the Kâfirûn (disbelievers) hate (it). It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad ملسو هيلع اللها ىلص) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islâm), to make it superior over all religions even though the Mushrikûn (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) hate (it).&#8221;</strong></span> Here, Allah (Exalted be He) calls the disbelievers as Kuffar and Mushriks. This indicates that a Kafir may be called a Mushrik and vise versa. There are many Ayahs and Hadith that stress the same meaning.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, between a man and Shirk and Kufr is the negligence of prayer.</strong></span>&#8221; (Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) book of Hadith on the authority of Jabir Ibn `Abdullah, may Allah be pleased with them).He (peace be upon him) also said, &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The covenant that distinguishes between us and them (the hypocrites) is Salah. Anyone who abandons it is a Kafir.</strong></span>&#8221; (Related by Imam Ahmad, Abu Dawud, Al­Tirmidhy, Al­Nasa&#8217;y, and Ibn Majah with a Sahih chain of transmission on the authority of Buraydah ibn Al­Hasib, may Allah be pleased with him).May Allah grant us success!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Explanation of Allah’s Saying: &#8220;Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Allah (Exalted be He) says in His Noble Book (what means): <em>&#8220;Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire&#8221;</em>. What is meant by hypocrisy and hypocrites in this Ayah (Qur’anic verse)? Please clarify their meaning.</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hypocrites are those who make a false pretense of Islam, when they are professing otherwise. They claim to be Muslims, although deep down they disbelieve in Allah and belie the Messenger (peace be upon him). These are the hypocrites who are so called because they show Islam, while hiding Kufr (disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And of mankind, there are some </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(hypocrites) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">who say: &#8220;We believe in Allâh and the Last Day&#8221; while in fact they believe not. They </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(think to)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> deceive Allâh and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves, and perceive </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(it)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> not! In their hearts is a disease </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(of doubt and hypocrisy) </span><span style="color:#008000;">(namely doubt and suspicion) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and Allâh has increased their disease. A painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This theme is continued in the Ayahs following them in Surah Al­Baqarah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the hypocrites who disbelieve in Allah and belie His Messengers (peace be upon them). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, the hypocrites seek to deceive Allâh, but it is He Who deceives them. And when they stand up for As­Salât </strong>(the prayer)<strong>, they stand with laziness and to be seen of men, and they do not remember Allâh but little. </strong>(They are) <strong>swaying between this and that, belonging neither to these nor to those.</strong></span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that they vacillate between the Kafirs (disbelievers) and the Muslims; at times they support the Kafirs when they prevail and achieve victory and at other times they support the believers when they prevail and achieve victory. They are not steadfast; their Din (religion) is not constant, and their Iman (Faith) is not solid. They waver between the state of Kufr and the state of Iman, and between the Kafirs and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) has disclosed their Kufr in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And nothing prevents their contributions from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allâh and in His Messenger </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Muhammad sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, and that they came not to As­Salât </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the prayer) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">except in a lazy state, and that they offer not contributions but unwillingly. So let not their wealth nor their children amaze you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(O Muhammad</span><span style="color:#008000;">sallallaahu alaihi wasallam)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">; in reality Allâh’s Plan is to punish them with these things in the life of this world, and that their souls shall depart </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(die) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">while they are disbelievers.</span></strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the hypocrites. We ask Allah to grant us safety and protection.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>33 &#8211; Ruling on raising one&#8217;s hands and rubbing one&#8217;s face after supererogatory Prayer</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on raising one&#8217;s hand and rubbing one&#8217;s face after offering Tahiyyat-ul-Masjid (two-unit-Prayer to greet the mosque), optional Prayer and Al-Sunan Al-Rawatib (supererogatory prayer that was stressed and regularly performed by the Prophet)?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Raising one&#8217;s hands is one of the ways to have supplications answered. It is reported in a Prophetic Hadith that raising one&#8217;s hands is a way to have supplications answered. So, it is permissible for a Muslim to raise his hands after offering supererogatory prayer or at other times; however, he should not keep doing so, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) would not keep doing so all the time, but he may peace be upon him) sometimes did it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for obligatory prayer</strong>, neither the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor the Companions did it, but they would sometimes do it <strong>after supererogatory Prayer</strong> according to the religious evidence permitting raising one&#8217;s hands on supplicating to Allah when it is done from time to time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <strong>rubbing one&#8217;s face</strong> after supplicating to Allah (Exalted be He), nothing has been reported about it in authentic Prophetic Hadiths. However, some weak Hadiths allow it, so the Muslim scholars see that such weak Hadiths support one another and authenticate one another. Thus, there is nothing wrong if a Muslim rubs the face after supplicating to Allah (Exalted be He), but it is better not to do it, because no authentic Hadith reported this act, i.e. rubbing one&#8217;s face after supplicating.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Necessity of approaching Allah with Tawbah and supplication in adversity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ‘Abdul­‘Aziz ibn ‘Abdullah ibn Baz to every Muslim who reads this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah help us remember Him and take warnings and lessons from the destinies unfolding before our eyes and lead us to sincere Tawbah (repentance to Allah) from all sins and misdeeds. Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As­salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) wills with His Deep Wisdom, absolute Proof, and all­ Encompassing Knowledge to test His Servants with prosperity and adversity, poverty and affluence, blessings and calamities, to try their patience and thankfulness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Anyone who is patient at the time of adversity, thankful at the time of prosperity, humbles themselves and supplicates to Allah upon facing hardships, acknowledges their sins and shortcomings, and asks Allah for His Mercy and Forgiveness, has succeeded and will be granted the blessed end. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) revealed in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Alif­ Lâm ­Mîm.</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [These letters are one of the miracles of the Qur’ân, and none but Allâh (Alone) knows their meanings.]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: &#8220;We believe,&#8221; and will not be tested. And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allâh will certainly make </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(it)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> known </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the truth of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> those who are true, and will certainly make </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(it) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">known </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the falsehood of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> those who are liars, </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(although Allâh knows all that before putting them to test)</span><strong>. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fitnah (trial) mentioned in this Ayah (Qur’anic verse) means the test of faith that makes evident the truthful from the liar, the patient and the thankful, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We have made some of you as a trial for others: will you have patience? And your Lord is Ever All­ Seer (of everything)</span></strong>&#8220;. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) further says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good. And to Us you will be returned.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We tried them with good </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(blessings) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">and evil </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(calamities)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> in order that they might turn</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (to Allâh’s Obedience)</span>&#8220;. The good refers here to the blessings of fertility, prosperity, good health, honor, victory over enemies, and the like, while the evil here are adversities, such as diseases, domination of the enemy, earthquakes, hurricanes, storms, torrential destructive floods, and the like. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Evil </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(sins and disobedience to Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> has appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of men have earned </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by oppression and evil deeds)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, that He</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (Allâh)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(by repenting to Allâh, and begging His Pardon)</span>&#8220;. This means that Allah (may He be Praised) predestined the good and the evil and the occurrence of corruption for people to return to Al-­Haqq (the Truth), to hurry and make Tawbah from what Allah has forbidden them, and hasten to the obedience of Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kufr (disbelief) and sins are the cause of all afflictions and evil in this world and the Hereafter, while tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and Iman (belief) in Him and His Messengers, obedience to Him and His Messengers, holding fast to His Shari‘ah (Islamic law), Da‘wah (calling) people to it, and refuting those who oppose it, are the causes of all good in this world and in the Hereafter. Perseverance on these principles and enjoining and cooperating in them bring honor in this world and the Hereafter, and salvation from every evil and protection from every Fitnah (trial). Allah (may He be Praised) says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! If you help </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in the cause of)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm. And He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(may He be Praised) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">says: Verily, Allâh will help those who help His </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Cause)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. Truly, Allâh is All ­Strong, All ­Mighty</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span>. Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) enjoin Iqamat­ as­Salât [i.e. to perform the five compulsory congregational Salât (prayers) (the males in mosques)], to pay the Zakât and they enjoin Al­Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid Al­ Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islâm has forbidden) [i.e. they make the Qur’ân as the law of their country in all the spheres of life]. And with Allâh rests the end of (all) matters (of creatures). He (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieves after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh). </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwâ (piety), certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth, but they belied (the Messengers). So We took them (with punishment) for what they used to earn (polytheism and crimes).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Praised) explains in many Ayahs that the afflictions and exemplary punishments that befell the preceding nations, such as floods, devastating winds, the mighty shriek, and being swallowed up by the earth, and the like, were nothing more than the result of their Kufr and sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:<strong><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;So We punished each (of them) for his sins; of them were some on whom We sent Hâsib (a violent wind with shower of stones) [as on the people of Lût (Lot)], and of them were some who were overtaken by As­-Saihah [torment ­ awful cry. (as Thamûd or Shu‘aib’s people)], and of them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow [as Qârûn (Korah)], and of them were some whom We drowned [as the people of Nûh (Noah), or Fir‘aun (Pharaoh) and his people]. It was not Allâh Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves.&#8221; </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised and Exalted) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much.&#8221;</span></strong> (See the Qur’ân Verse 35:45).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah orders His Servants to turn to Him in sincere Tawbah (repentance to Allah) and supplicate to Him at the time of adversity, as He (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe! Turn to Allâh with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And all of you beg Allâh to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful He (may He be Praised) &#8220;</span></strong> also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, We sent (Messengers) to many nations before you (O Muhammad ىلص ملـسو هـيلع اللها). And We seized them with extreme poverty (or loss in wealth) and loss in health (with calamities) so that they might humble themselves (believe with humility). When Our Torment reached them, why then did they not humble themselves (believe with humility)? But their hearts became hardened, and Shaitân (Satan) made fair­ seeming to them that which they used to do.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this glorious Ayah, Allah urges His Slaves and awakens in them the desire that, when they face adversities, such as illness, wounds, fighting, earthquakes, winds, storms, and other tribulations, they should humble themselves to Him in need of Him and ask for His Help. This is the meaning of Allah’s Saying: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">When Our Torment reached them, why then did they not humble themselves (believe with humility)?</span></strong>&#8221; It asks why they (the preceding nations) did not turn to Allah humbly when they were inflicted with torment. Allah then tells that their hard­ heartedness and the handiwork of Satan, making evil deeds pleasing to them, prevented them from Tawbah, supplication, and beseeching forgiveness. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But their hearts became hardened, and Shaitân (Satan) made fair­ seeming to them that which they used to do.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported that the Rightly ­Guided Caliph, Amir Al ­Mu’minin (Commander of the Believers), ‘Umar ibn ‘Abdul­‘Aziz (may Allah be merciful to him), when there was an earthquake during his era, wrote to his agents in the different countries and ordered them to tell the Muslims to make Tawbah to Allah, humble themselves to Him, and seek His Forgiveness from their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All you Muslims know the different types of Fitan (trials) and calamities that prevail in our time, among which is the that the Kafirs have power over the Muslims in Afghanistan, the Philippines, India, Palestine, Lebanon, Ethiopia, and other countries. There have also been earthquakes in Yemen and many countries; devastating floods, and violent hurricanes that have destroyed homes, trees, ships, and other properties; avalanches that have brought about incalculable harm; and famines and droughts in a multitude of countries. All this and much more are the different types of punishment that Allah afflicts upon His Servants due to their Kufr and misdeeds, deviation from His Obedience, zeal for this world and its transient pleasures, and turning away from the Hereafter and failing to prepare for it; except those to whom Allah has shown His Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that all such adversities obligate Allah’s Servants to hasten to make sincere Tawbah to Him (may He be Praised) from all that He prohibited them from, to return to His Obedience, to rule according to the Shari‘ah (Islamic law), to cooperate in righteousness and piety, and advise one another to adhere to the truth and have patience. The moment the Servants repent to their Lord, humble themselves to Him, and hasten to do what pleases Him: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Help you one another in Al­Birr and At­Taqwâ (virtue, righteousness and piety)</span></strong> and enjoin one another to do good and forbid one another from evil, Allah will set their affairs aright and ward off the evil of their enemies, grant them authority in the land, give them victory over their enemies, bestow upon them His Blessings, and protect them from His Punishment. Allah, the Truest Speaker, says: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">and (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them)&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors. And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order, and invoke Him with fear and hope. Surely, Allâh’s Mercy is (ever) near unto the good­ doers&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(commanding you)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">: &#8220;Seek the forgiveness of your Lord, and turn to Him in repentance, that He may grant you good enjoyment, for a term appointed, and bestow His abounding Grace to every owner of grace (i.e. the one who helps and serves the needy and deserving, physically and with his wealth, and even with good words). But if you turn away, then I fear for you the torment of a Great Day </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(i.e. the Day of Resurrection)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practice their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided)&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) further says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al­Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al­Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden); they perform As­Salât (Iqâmat­as­Salât), and give the Zakât, and obey Allâh and His Messenger. Allâh will have His Mercy on them. Surely Allâh is All­ Mighty, All­ Wise&#8221;</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) clarifies in these Ayahs that His Mercy, Benevolence, Protection, and all His other Blessings are granted in full and shall continue to be given in the Hereafter to those who fear Him, believe in Him, obey His Messengers, hold fast to His Shar‘iah (Islamic Law), and make Tawbah to Him from their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But for those who shun His Obedience, are too proud to fulfill the Rights owed to Him, and persist in their Kufr and disobedience, Allah (may He be Praised) threatens them with different punishments in this life and the Hereafter, and shall expedite the share of punishment which He has allotted for them (in this world. ed.), as His wisdom dictates, for them to be an example and warning to others. Allah (may He be Praised) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">So, when they forgot (the warning) with which they had been reminded, We opened for them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them (in punishment), and lo! They were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows. So the root of the people who did wrong was cut off. And all the praises and thanks are to Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinn, and all that exists).&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Muslims! Call yourselves to account for your deeds, make Tawbah to your Lord, and seek His Forgiveness. Hasten to obedience and be on your guard against disobedience, and cooperate in righteousness and piety. Do good; indeed, Allah loves the doers of good. Be just; indeed, Allah loves those who act justly. Make provision of righteous acts before death befalls you. Show mercy to the weak, help the poor, increase your Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah), ask for His Forgiveness, enjoin that which is good and forbid that which is evil that you may receive mercy. Take admonition from what happened to the preceding nations due to their sins and misdeeds. Indeed, Allah accepts the Tawbah of the penitent, shows mercy to the doers of good, and grants a blessed end to the pious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Praised) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for Al-­Muttaqûn (the pious) And He (Exalted be He) says: Truly, Allâh is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him), and those who are Muhsinûn (good­doers)</span></strong>. (See the footenote of V.9:120).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah with His Most Beautiful Names and Most High Attributes to show mercy to the Muslims, grant them understanding of the Din (religion), give them victory over His and their enemies among the Kafirs and hypocrites, afflicting them with His Wrath that never will be turned back from the wrongdoers. He is the Guardian and the One Who is Capable of doing so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions, and those who follow them in righteousness until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As­salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q3: What is the ruling on amulets consisting of the Qur’an and other things? </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullah):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Amulets that consist of other than the Qur’an such as bones, talismans, cowrie shells, wolf’s hair and the like are all evil and Haram (prohibited) by the Nas (Islamic text from the Qur’an or the Sunnah)</strong></span>. It is not permissible to hang them on anybody or anything, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “Anyone who wears an amulet, may Allah not fulfill it (i.e., their purpose) for them, and whoever wears a cowrie shell, may Allah not give them peace.” And in another narration, he (peace be upon him) said, “Anyone who wears an amulet has committed Shirk (associated others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if amulets consist of the Qur’an or well­known good supplications, this is a controversial matter among the scholars. Some say that such amulets are permissible. This opinion was reported from a group of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) who likened it to recitation (of some Qur’anic Ayahs and supplications) over sick people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others say that it is not permissible. This opinion is supported by ‘Abdullah ibn Mas‘ud and Hudhaifah (may Allah be pleased with them both). A group of the Salaf and the righteous successors said it is not permissible to tie amulets even if they are from the Qur’an in accordance with the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>principle of Sadd­ul­Dhara’i (blocking the means leading to sins)</strong> </span>and to forestall acts of Shirk and to act upon the general meaning of the Hadiths. This is because the Hadiths that prohibit amulets are general and make no exception. Muslims should abide by the general ruling. Therefore, it is basically not permissible to use any kind of amulets in order not to permit people to use some other types of amulets, thus leading to confusing matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to prohibit all types of amulets and this is the soundest opinion for the obvious evidence supporting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If we permit the use of amulets made from the Qur’an and good supplications, it will open the door for people to wear any form of amulets they like</strong></span>. Then, if they are reproved for what they do, they will say that they are amulets consisting of the Qur’an or good supplications. Consequently, the door will be opened, the hole will expand and all types of amulets (whether from the Qur’an or anything else) will be worn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is another reason for their prohibition, which is the fact that people may enter the bathroom and other unclean places while wearing them</strong></span>. It is well­known that the Words of Allah (the Qur’an) are too sacred to be in such places and it is not appropriate to take them into bathrooms.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Fatwa No. 8377</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I would like to raise an issue that caused a dispute between some people. It is the writing of the word &#8220;Allah&#8221; and the word &#8220;Muhammad&#8221; in an interlacing shape on top of the door of one of the Masjids (mosques) in Adlab. Some of them said that it is not permissible to write these names in such a shape. The proof they mentioned to support their viewpoint was that in this way, Muhammad&#8217;s status (peace be upon him), would be the same as Allah&#8217;s which is not reasonable. Others said that writing them in such a way is permissible as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) places His name beside the name of His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him). I would like you to guide me to what is right. Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans. by Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;, KSA:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shari&#8217;ah (Islamic law) texts join between testifying that no one is worthy of worship except Allah and testifying that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah in certain places, such as in Adhan (call to Prayer), Iqamah (call to start the Prayer), in the Hadith: Islam is based on five pillars: (Testifying that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah&#8230;) and other places. These texts point out what Mukallafun (legally competent persons) should believe in with regard to Allah and the Messenger, such as saying that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But mixing the two words in writing was not mentioned in the Book of Allah or the Sunnah </strong>(whatever is reported from the Prophet, peace be upon him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Moreover, mixing both words in writing contains great danger as this is similar to the false creed of the Christians with regard to the trinity. They believe that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are one God.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It also contains an element of the false creed of pantheism, and leads to elevating the Prophet </strong>(peace be upon him)<strong> and worshipping him along with Allah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is prohibited to write the Name of Allah and the name of His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) by mixing the letters of the two words together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is also <strong>prohibited to write the words (Allah &#8211; Muhammad) next to each other</strong> on the top of the door of the Masjids or any other place because doing so may contain some delusion and misguidance with regard to the prohibitions mentioned above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q 7: I have a relative who frequently swears by Allah whether he is truthful or not. What is the religious ruling on such an act?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (<em>rahimahullaah)</em>:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should be advised and told to abstain from swearing frequently, even if he is truthful, for Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much)</strong></span>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Three persons whom Allah shall neither speak to on the Day of Resurrection, nor look at, nor purify, and they shall have a painful torment: a white-haired adulterer, an arrogant poor person, and a man who made Allah as his merchandise: he does not buy except by swearing (by Allah) and he does not sell except by swearing.”</strong></span> &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Arabs used to be praised for taking oaths rarely. A poet said about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Whoever does not swear so much, can keep his oath</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>If he takes an oath he will fulfills it</strong></span></p>
<p>Aliyah in Arabic means oath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is prescribed for a Mu’min (believer) to swear rarely even if they are truthful</strong>. Swearing frequently may lead them to tell lies. It is well known that telling lies is Haram (prohibited); but it is much more prohibited when it is combined with swearing oaths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nevertheless, if there is a demanding situation or a probable benefit calling a Muslim to swear untruthfully, it will be permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been authentically reported from the Hadith of Umm Kulthum bint Uqbah ibn Abu Mu&#8217;it (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Not a liar the one who tries to reconcile between people and so narrates something good or says something good</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Kulthum bint‘ Uqbah (may Allah be pleased with her) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I have never heard him (the Prophet, peace be upon him) permit anything of what people call ‘lying’, except in three cases: war, reconciliation between people, and man’s talk to his wife and woman’s talk to her husband.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Related by Muslim in the Sahih [Authentic Hadith Book])</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a Muslim, in an attempt to reconcile between people, says, &#8220;I swear by Allah that your companions desire reconciliation with you, they like to be on good terms with you and want such and such&#8221;, then he goes to the other party and tells them the same words, intending good and hoping to achieve reconciliation, this is permissible according to the above-mentioned Hadith. The same is when a Muslim sees that a person wants to kill another one unjustly or wants to commit an unjust act against him. So, he says: &#8220;By Allah, he is my brother&#8221; in order to save him from such an oppressor who wants to kill him or beat him without any right, and he is sure that by saying: &#8220;this is my brother&#8221; the oppressor will leave the other person out of respect for him. In such a case, a Muslim should do this for the sake of saving his brother from oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The basic ruling concerning false oaths is that they are forbidden and prohibited, unless they are meant for a serious benefit graver than lying, such as the three examples mentioned in the previous Hadith.</p>
