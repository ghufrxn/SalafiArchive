										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الرَّحَْٰمنِ الرَّحِيمِ<br />
الحمد لله والصلاة والسلام على رسول الله وعلى آله وصحبه ومن ولاه، وبعد،</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beneficial points conveyed by brother Nabil Chogle [student of knowledge – recommended by Shaykh al-‘Anjaree (hafidhahullah)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Kuwaiti Mashaykh the brother , Nabil Chogle, studied under are Shaykh al-‘Anjaree, Shaykh Tariq as-Suba’ee and Shaykh Ahmad as-Suba’ee (hafidhahumullah). Both Shaykh ‘Anjaree and Shaykh Ahmad as-Suba’ee have a recommendation from Shaykh Rabe’e and Shaykh ‘Ubayd al-Jabiree (hafidhahumullah). Shaykh ‘Anjaree (hafidhahullah) said Shaykh Rabe’e (hafidhahullah) praised Shaykh Taariq as-Suba’ee (hafidhahullah) saying he is “Hakeem Hakeem” (Wise Wise – Twice) i.e. he is really good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Below are some of the brief points that the brother had conveyed</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Shaykh al-‘Anjaree (hafidhahullah) constantly advised to be on the Furqaan (That which distinguishes truth from falsehood).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The Shaykh also warned about the dangers of falling into Bid&#8217;ah (Innovation in the religion).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. While teaching one of the books, Shaykh Ahmad as-Suba’ee (hafidhahullah) said that the correct explanation of the statement of prophet Muhammad (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) about Khutbat al-Haaja (The Sermon for Necessities) [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">مِنْ شُرُورِ أمنْفُسِنما مومِنْ م سيِّئماتِ أمعْ م مالِنما<br />
<strong>Min Shuroori an-Fusina wa-Min Sayeaati A’amaalinaa</strong><br />
[&#8220;We seek refuge in Allah] from the evils of ourselves and from the evils of our actions&#8221; ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">is that we don’t just seek refuge from the evils which our hands have brought forth rather we also seek refuge for the sins into which we fell and which were then followed by others. In Islaam you are rewarded for the good deeds you do and also for those people who follow you in good. Similarly you are punished for the sins that you do and for the misguidance of others who follow you in such sins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The evils of some innovations can be seen hundreds of years later. One of them is the counting of the beads which was not legislated during the time of the Prophet (sallallahu ‘alayhi wasalam). Another example is the seeking of refuge in Allah while yawning (Uttering “aa’odhu billahi min ash-shaytaanir-rajeem” while yawning). One more such innovation is the mentioning of “sadaqallahul adheem” after reciting the Quraan. All these are innovated affairs. The people who initiated these acts would have never thought how widespread these could get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Based on the above it’s extremely important to know if a particular thing that you do is from Sunnah or not. You don’t know who is following you!</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. One should constantly sit with ‘Ulemaa (scholars) and be in touch with them. Shaykh Taariq (hafidhahullah) said he finished Buloogh al-Maraam three times from cover to cover with Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Azeez ibn Baaz (rahimahullah). Shaykh Tariq (hafidhahullah) also said that in one single sitting with Shaykh ‘Abdul ‘Azeez ibn Baaz (rahimahullah) they used to study five different books.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Shaykh Rabe’e advised to submit to the text (Quraan and the Sunnah). First of the ones to make Qiyaas (applying one’s own intelligence) was Iblees. His argument of him being made by fire made him think he was superior. This is one of the reasons of going astray.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Warning of staying away from affairs of fighting and spilling blood. The rebels say loosing 20,000 lives or so is a small price for the oppression suffered. Verily for a Salafi every life is expensive. The whole affair of making Khurooj is not meant for the general public.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Make a lot of supplications. Verily one of the reasons of winning the war in Jihad is the supplication of those who didn’t join.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. When Salman al-‘Awdah planned a visit to Kuwait, Shaykh al-‘Anjaree wrote a front page article in the newspaper clearing the affairs of Salman al-‘Awdah. The Kuwaiti government al-Hamdullilah went ahead and cancelled his visit. Some 50 odd scholars then thanked the government for its intervention.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. The Shaykh also paid for a half page advert in one of the leading daily newspaper writing about “Guidance to Muslims upon Walee al-Amr”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. It is from Salafiyah to be from those who do charity discreetly. Also it’s better to go and help out the needy directly than to buy charity coupons. One should feel the charity. Seeing first hand the sufferings of the people increases one in Eemaan. He also mentioned names of Mashaykh from Kuwait regularly visiting refugee camps in Syria and Turkey to help our brothers who are being tested by Allah. May Allah ease their affairs. Verily He has power over all things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Also he mentioned a Hadeeth about charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Hurayrah (radhiallahu ‘anhu): The Prophet (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) commanded to give Sadaqah (charity). A man said, “Apostle of Allah, I have a Dinaar (currency of gold)”. He (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “Spend it on yourself”. He (the man) again said, “I have another”. He (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “Spend it on your children”. He (the man) again said, “I have another”. He (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “Spend it on your wife”. He (the man) again said, “I have another”. He (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said, “Spend it on your servant”. He (the man) finally said, “I have another”. He (sallallahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) replied, “You know best (what to do with it)”. [Sunan Abee Dawud, Book of Charity] [2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. One valuable advice which he mentioned from Shaykh al-’Anjaree (hafidhahullah) was the only way to succeed is to be a hard worker. Just because you are smart does not mean that you will succeed. Indeed success is from Allah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. Manage time efficiently. If a task can be completed in 4 hours do not spend 13 days on it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. Verily there is Barakah (blessing) in the mornings so do not spend it sleeping at home. (referring to the time post Salaat al-Fajr).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. Keep a balance between Deen (religion) and Dunyah (worldly life) and let one of them strengthen the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. It’s not from the Salaf to just work 8 hours a day or 6 days a week. In fact they used to work all week around. The evidence is that the Khutbat al-Jumu&#8217;ah (Friday sermon) used to be short so that people could get back to their affairs at the earliest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. Strive as much as you can. Do not wait. Aid the Dawah as much as you can and in any manner. Those capable of financial aid should help with money, those capable of printing flyers should do so, and those who can translate should do so.<br />
20. Be in constant touch of the Mashaykh and those whom they refer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
