										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Source</strong>: ad-Dawal ila-Allah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a very good reason why Ramadaan, out of all the months in the Islaamic calendar was chosen by Allaah to be the month of Fasting. That reason? It was in this month, on the Night of Decree (Laylatul-Qadr), that the Qur&#8217;aan was revealed to mankind.[1] Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The month of Ramadaan in which was revealed the Qur&#8217;aan, a guidance for mankind and clear proofs for the guidance and the Furqaan (criterion) [between right and wrong]. So whoever of you sights [the crescent on the first night of] the month [of Ramadaan], he must fast that month.”</strong></span> [Soorah al-Baqarah (2):185]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah honoured this month by revealing the Qur&#8217;aan in it and it is because of this that He obligated fasting in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also the month in which Jibreel (alayhi as-salaam) would come to meet the Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) every night in order to repeat the recitation of the Qur’aan with him. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the relationship between Ramadaan and the Qur’aan is very close, which is why Muslims worldwide turn to the Qur&#8217;aan with a heightened sense of vigour during this month.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Recitation Of The Qur’aan</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The main purpose of the Qur&#8217;aan is to be a source of guidance for mankind, leading those who cling to it from darkness into light, from misery to happiness and raising them from lowliness to a lofty station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, another important feature of the Qur&#8217;aan is that its recitation is in itself a form of &#8216;ibadah&#8217; (worship). In fact the Qur&#8217;aan is defined as being the (uncreated) word of Allaah, sent down to Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) the recitation of which is a form of worship” [3] a unique definition that can be applied to no other book, writing or statement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the very beginning of the Prophet’s Messenger-ship, great emphasis was placed on the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan. The literal meaning of the word Qur&#8217;aan itself is &#8216;<strong>Reading</strong>&#8216; or &#8216;<strong>Recitation</strong>&#8216;. The first Ayah (verse) to be revealed on that momentous occasion where Jibreel (&#8216;alayhis salaam) came to Prophet Muhammad (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) whilst he was alone in the cave Hira was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Iqraa (Recite/Read), in the name of your lord who created you&#8230;”</strong></span> [Soorah al-Alaq (9): 1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) himself strongly urged his companions to recite as much of the Qur&#8217;aan as possible. He said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“whoever reads a single letter from Allah&#8217;s Book will receive a blessing (for each letter) and each blessing is worth ten times its value.”</strong></span> [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the virtues and blessings of reciting the Book of Allaah are many. And by way of encouragement to all of us to spend time reciting and reflecting upon the Qur&#8217;aan, some of these virtues are listed below.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>1. It Will Come As An Intercessor On The Day Of Resurrection.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Recite the Qur&#8217;aan, for verily on the Day of Resurrection it will act as an intercessor for those who recite it”</span> </strong>[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day when neither our family nor our wealth will be of any benefit to us, this Qur&#8217;aan will beseech Allaah on behalf of those who recite it frequently. Allaah will give it a speech and Allaah is able to do all things &#8211; and it will say to Allaah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I prevented him from sleep at night, so accept my intercession for him”</strong></span> [6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And its intercession will be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>2. Tranquility Descends.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al Baraa reported that a man was reciting Sooratul-Kahf and there was a horse tied with two ropes at his side, when a cloud overshadowed him. As it began to come nearer and nearer his horse began to take fright from it. He went and mentioned that to the Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) in the morning, who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“It was tranquility [as-Sakeenah] which came down at the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan.”</strong></span> [7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows us that the tranquility and the calmness which results from the recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan is not something abstract, but something very real which permeated the whole atmosphere so that even the animals can imbibe it. This &#8216;<strong>Sakeenah</strong>&#8216; (tranquility) which descends upon the reciter is accompanied by Angels who assemble to listen to the Qur&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companion Usaid ibn Hudair (Radiya ‘Llahu &#8216;anhu) mentioned to the Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) that once when he was reciting the Qur&#8217;aan at night while his horse was tied beside him. The horse suddenly became uneasy and started jumping. When he stopped reciting, the horse became quiet. When he resumed reciting, the horse became uneasy again. After repeating this a few times, he stopped reciting and looked up. He was amazed to see right above him something that looked like a big cloud of bright lamps rising up in the sky. The next morning, he told the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) about this, and the Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) explained to him that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Those were Angels who came to listen to your reading. Had you kept on reciting until morning, they would have remained visible for the people to see them!”</strong> </span>[8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>3. It Will Be A Shade On The Day Of Resurrection.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Recite the two bright ones, Soorah al-Baqarah and Soorah Aal-e lmraan, for on the day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds, or two shades or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them”</strong> </span>[9]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are well aware that on a hot summer’s day when we are out in a scorching sun, the thing we appreciate most is a tree or some sort of canopy, beneath which we can shade ourselves. Imagine how much more we will be pinning for a shade on the Day of Resurrection when&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“the people will be submerged in perspiration according to their deeds, some up to half of their knees, some up to the waist and some would have a bridle of perspiration up to their mouths”</strong></span> [10].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge in Allah from the terrors of this awful Day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are just some of the blessings awaiting those who recite the Qur&#8217;aan as it should be recited, bringing with them a receptive heart. [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, these blessings and rewards are only multiplied for those who struggle in their recitation, for the Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8221;One who is skilled in it, ‘the Qur&#8217;aan’ is associated with the noble upright, recording Angels, and he who falters when he recites the Qur&#8217;aan and finds it difficult, he will have a double reward.”</strong> </span>[12]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course it goes without saying, that although great emphasis and encouragement has been made to recite the Qur&#8217;aan, this is not the goal in itself. Recitation of the Book of Allaah is just a means through which we can absorb its message and act on whatever that messages entails. However, reciting with the meaning is superior to merely reading as the Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) explained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The example of a believer who recites the Qur&#8217;aan and acts on it, is like an orange which tastes nice and smells nice. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the example of the believer who does not recite the Qur&#8217;aan but acts on it is like a date that tastes sweet but has no smell. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the example of the hypocrite who recites the Qur&#8217;aan is like sweet Basil which smells good but tastes bitter. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And the example of a hypocrite who does not recite the Qur&#8217;aan is like a Coelacanth which tastes bitter and has a bad smell”</strong></span>. [13]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Companion Of Life:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this month of Ramadaan, let us use it to habituate ourselves into spending a daily period with the Qur&#8217;aan &#8211; reciting, memorizing and acting upon it. Because we should know that no people are better and more worthy of our envy than the companions of the Qur&#8217;aan,[14] which is why the most striking and outstanding character of every pious person of knowledge is their love and attachment towards the Qur&#8217;aan. There is no man or woman who is considered to be righteous, except he or she is known to possess this noble quality. So when Aa’ishah was asked to describe the best of all mankind, the Prophet (sallalahu alaihe wa-sallam) she could find no more a suitable description other than to say that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“His character was the Qur&#8217;aan”.</span></strong> [15]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And among the inheritors of the Prophet (i.e. the scholars) We have the example of lmaam Maalik, whose sister was asked:<strong> “What did Maalik occupy himself with in his House?”</strong> She replied,<strong> “The Mushaf (i.e the Qur&#8217;aan), reciting.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear readers, no person can afford to remain ignorant or neglectful of the Qur&#8217;aan. Reading it regularly, sincerely not ritualistically, to derive guidance from it and adopt the company of those who make mention of it in their gatherings. Make the Qur&#8217;aan your constant companion, not just for Ramadaan, but for life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Editors Note: There were two distinct revelations of the Qur’aan. The first is the one being alluded to here where Allaah caused the whole Qur’aan to descend at one time from the <strong>Protected Tablet (al-Lawh al-Mahfooth)</strong> on which it was written to a station in the lowest heaven referred to as <strong>“Bayt al-‘Izzah” (The House of Honour or Power)</strong>. This occurred in Lailatul-Qadr. The second is the continuous segmented revelation to the Prophet (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) via Jibreel (‘Alayh is-Salam) up until just before his (Sallallahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) death.</p>

The Prophet (Salla ’Llahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Do not wish for the likes of anyone except two: a man upon whom Allaah bestowed knowledge of the Book [the Qur’aan], who stands up [in salaah (prayer)] and recites it during the hours of the night, and a man upon whom Allaah bestowed wealth, and he spends it in charity during the hours of the night and the hours of the day.”</span> </strong>[Recorded by al-Bukhaaree in Kitaab Fadaa’il Al-Qur’aan (Book on the Virtues of the Qur’aan) no. 5025; also recorded by Muslim in Kitaab Salat Al-Musaafireen (Book on the Prayer of the Travellers) 815/266]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source: Ad-Dawah ilaLlaah Magazine Vol 1 , Issue 1</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <b>Tawbah</b> (Repentance) in Arabic literally means &#8216;to return&#8217;. In an Islamic context, it refers to the act of leaving what Allaah has prohibited and returning to what He has commanded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of repentance is one which concerns all people who believe in God, and is vital one for the Muslims to understand because our salvation in the hereafter is dependent on our repentance to Allaah, as is shown by Allaah&#8217;s order:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;AND TURN YOU ALL TOGETHER IN REPENTANCE TO ALLAAH O BELIEVERS, THAT YOU MAY BE SUCCESSFUL&#8221; [An-Noor (24):31]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Soorah al-Baqarah, Allaah tells us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;SURELY ALLAAH LOVES THOSE WHO TURN UNTO HIM IN REPENTANCE AND LOVES THOSE WHO PURIFY THEMSELVES.&#8221; [2:222]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows how pleasing our repenting is to Allaah. Also, the Prophet, Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam gave us an example of just how pleasing to Allaah our repenting is an authentic hadeeth in which he, (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah is more delighted with the repentance of His servant than one of you would be, who suddenly finds his camel laden with supplies after losing it in a barren land&#8221; (1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Try to imagine your joy if you were to suddenly retrieve everything you ever possessed after losing all hope of recovering what you had lost. Then think that Allaah&#8217;s delight is even greater than this when His slave repents to Him. So much so, that if man stopped repenting to Allaah, He would replace us with another creation that would turn to Him for forgiveness. The Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you did not commit sins, Allaah would sweep you out of existence and replace you by another people who would commit sins, ask for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and He would forgive them.&#8221; (2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The problem with many of us today, is that we don&#8217;t fear Allaah, which means that we don&#8217;t think twice about disobeying Him and therefore falling into sin, which we give no real tought to. So perhaps we should think about the statement which Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (3) radi Allaahu &#8216;anhu, made: &#8220;A believer sees his sins as if he were sitting under a mountain which he is affraid may fall on him, whereas the wicked person considers his sins as flies passing over his nose and he just drives them away like this (and he moved his hand over his nose in illustration).&#8221; (4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NEVER DESPAIR</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone might say, &#8216;I want to repent but my sins are too many.&#8217; But Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;SAY: O MY SLAVES WHO HAVE TRANSGRESSED AGAINST THEMSELVES! DESPAIR NOT FOR THE MERCY OF ALLAAH, VERILY ALLAAH FORGIVES ALL SINS. TRULY HE IS OFT FORGIVING, MOST MERCIFUL.&#8221; [Az-Zumar (39):53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we should never lose hope or stop asking for Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness. Its importance is shown to us in a hadeeth in which the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O people! Turn to Allaah in repentance and seek His forgiveness, for surely I make repentance a hundred times every day.&#8221; (5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Repentance is such a great act of worship that doing it can totally erase our sins altoghether, as the Prophet, Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;One who repents from sin is like one without sin.&#8221; (6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>ONLY ALLAAH CAN FORGIVE SINS</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Forgiveness for our sins is not something that comes automatically, it is something that must be sought sincerely and with consciousness. Also we should remember that it is only through Allaah&#8217;s Mercy that anyone will ever enter Paradise. The Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) advised: &#8220;Do good deeds properly, sincerely and moderately, and rejoice, for no one&#8217;s good deeds will put him in Paradise.&#8221; The Companions asked, &#8220;Not even you O Messenger of Allaah?&#8221; He replied. &#8220;Not even me unless Allaah bestows His pardon and mercy on me.&#8221; (7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore in Islaam, salvation rests on faith (which includes), good actions and hope in Allaah&#8217;s mercy, all combined in truly unique manner which is not found in any other religion or system.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, it is only Allaah who can forgive our sins and He is not in need of any intercessor. The proof for this is in a du&#8217;aa (supplication) which the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam) taught his closest Companion Abu Bakr(8):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Allaah, truly I have wronged myself and none can forgive sins except you.&#8221; (9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore it is a complete waste of time asking forgiveness from the people such as &#8220;saints&#8221;, pious people or even the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam). Allaah say in reply to people who do such things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;VERILY, THOSE YOU CALL UPON BESIDES ALLAAH, ARE ONLY SLAVES LIKE YOURSELVES.&#8221; [a;-A&#8217;raaf (7):194]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important that we never despair of Allaah&#8217;s Mercy &#8211; no sin is too great to repent for&#8230; or too little for that matter. As one of the salaf (Pious predecessors) said: &#8220;Do not look at the insignifance of your sins, but consider the greatness of The One you are disobeying.&#8221; (10)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">She was the first wife of the Prophet and the first heart to be affected and to accept his call to Islâm. She was Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid. When she reached adolescence, she came to be known as Taahira (righteous, virtuous) due to her noble and sublime character. (Al-Isaabah of Ibn Hajr (8/60))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She was married but soon both her father and husband died, leaving her in charge of the trade. Khadeejah became a business woman in her own right, know and respected throughout the Qur&#8217;aysh (The noblest tribe in Makkah; they were the keepers of the Ka&#8217;bah and the tribe that Khadeejah &amp; the Prophet came from) for her noble character, wealth and good manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She heard the Prophet&#8217;s fair dealings and how he was acclaimed to be al-Ameen (the trustworthy) amongst the people, and so she asked if he could accompany her merchandise to its various destinations &#8211; he agreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the age of twenty-five, the Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam accepted the proposal of Khadeejah, his distant cousin, who was fifteen years his senior. They had six children: two sons, Qaasim and &#8216;Abdullaah, both of whom died in infancy, and four daughters, Zaynab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthoom, and Faatimah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fifteen years later, what do we find Khadeejah saying when the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam came to her with his heart trembling after receiving the first Revelation? He informed her of the happening and said to her &#8220;O Khadeejah what has happened to me? I fear for myself?&#8221; She replied: &#8220;It can&#8217;t be. Be happy. I swear by Allâh that he will never humiliate you. By Allaah, you join ties of relationship, you speak the truth, you bear people&#8217;s burdens, you help the destitute, you entertain guests and you help the vicissitudes which affect the people.&#8221; (Reported by &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah &amp; collected by Muslim (eng. Trans vol.1 pp.96-8 no.301). Imaam an-Nawaawee, who wrote the commentary on Saheeh Muslim said that the scholars have explained Khadeejah&#8217;s statement by saying that she knew that Allâh would never allow one who had been given such a generous character and noble manners by Him, to be affected by madness, since good manners is itself such a blessing from Allaah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at her conviction in what the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said. Pause for a moment and note her weighty words. She didn&#8217;t doubt him, nor show the slightest hesitation towards the words he uttered. In fact she was his greatest source of comfort, the first to provide security for him and be sincere to him. He attested to the messengership of her husband and was the first to believe in him, and who could have known him better? After all, she had been married to him for fifteen years. She was convinced that it could only be one of such eloquent character who could be worthy of revelation from Allâh and thus hers was the first heart to be moved, and to accept Islâm.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, her loyalty and assistance didn&#8217;t culminize there. By accepting and supporting his call to the worship of Allâh alone, Khadeejah, a woman highly esteemed among the Qur&#8217;aysh, was now denouncing their way of life, and the Qur&#8217;aysh were a proud and affluent people; and Makkah was at the heart of trading and the home of the idols &#8211; much revered by the Qur&#8217;aysh. They were not going to stand back and allow a man to now come and preach a way of life alien to theirs, rejecting their beliefs and everything they stood for. And remember when Islâm was first cultivated, the Muslims were small in number, and, in such a trying period, Khadeejah remained alongside the Messenger of Allâh in support whenever the Qur&#8217;aysh disclaimed him or contracted hostility towards him. She assisted him in preaching the words of Allâh and hence witnessed the division between the people of faith (eemaan) and those of disbelief (kufr).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This continued until her death on the eleventh of Ramadaan in the tenth year of the Prophethood &#8211; at the age of sixty-four. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam would think of Khadeejah often. Open up any book written on the life of the Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, and you will not fail to find Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid mentioned and evidences pertaining to her excellence. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam said: <em> &#8220;Sufficient for you, from the women of the worlds are, Maryam bint Ibraaheem [the mother of Eesaa], Khadeejah bint Khuwaylid, Faatimah bint Muhammad [sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam] and &#8216;Aasiyah, the wife of Fir&#8217;awn [Pharoah].&#8221; </em>(Saheeh &#8211; Reported by Anas in Ahmad, at-Tirmidhee &amp; others. Declared authentic by al-Albaanee in his Tarteeb Saheeh ul-Jaami&#8217; (no.18).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further proof of the Prophet&#8217;s inherent love for Khadeejah can be seen in &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah&#8217;s statement: &#8220;I was not so jealous of any of the Prophet&#8217;s wives as I was of Khadeejah. I never saw her, but he frequently mentioned her and he would often kill a sheep, cut it in pieces and send them round among Khadeejah&#8217;s friends. I often said to him: &#8216;It seems as if Khadeejah was the only woman in the world!&#8217; And he replied: &#8216;<em> She was indeed a fine woman and I had children from her.&#8221;</em> (Collected by al-Bukhaaree (eng. Trans. Vol.5 p.104 no.166) &amp; Muslim (eng. Trans. Vol.4 p.1297 no.5972))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we have the perfect role models, and it is only through reading about them, that we can truly love them and love to be like them, and understand why they are happy occupants of al-Jannah. And Jibreel, &#8216;alayhis-Salaam, came with the good news from Allaah, saying to the Messenger, sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, <em> &#8220;When she [Khadeejah] comes, give her a greeting from her Lord and me, and give her the good news that in Jannah she will have a house of brilliant pearls, in which there will be no clamor or toil.&#8221; </em>(Reported by Abu Hurayrah &amp; collected by al-Bukhaaree (vol.5 pp.104-5 no.168) &amp; Muslim (vol.4 p.1297 no.5967))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allâh be pleased with her and grant us all ability to be like her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aameen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;ad-Da&#8217;wah ilallaah&#8217; (The Call to Allaah), The magazine featuring Women&#8217;s Issues. (UK) Vol-1 Issue-5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asmaa was a woman of great nobility, wisdom and patience. She was among the early converts to Makkah and being the daughter of the great Companion Abu Bakr, she was brought up in an atmosphere of purity and devotion and shared close ties with the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam was about to secretly leave Makkah for his emigration to Madeenah with his close friend Abu Bakr, it was Asmaa who prepared the provisions for the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam and her father. She said: &#8220;I prepared the provision bag for the Prophet in the house of Abu Bakr when he wanted to emigrate to Madeenah. We did not find anything with which to tie his bag or waterskin. I said to Abu Bakr: &#8220;By Allaah, I cannot find anything to tie with except my belt.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Tear it in two and tie the waterskin with one and the bag with the other.&#8221;&#8221; So that is what she did and since then she became know as &#8216;Dhaatun-Nitaaqayn&#8217; [She of the two belts]. (Collected in Sahaah al-Bukhaaree (eng. Trans. Vol.4 p.141 no.222))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asmaa was married to Zubayr Ibn al-Awwaam, the cousin of the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. He was a very poor man, nevertheless Abu Bakr knew him to be a man of great piety, so despite the huge difference between their financial status, Abu Bakr married his daughter to him. In the initial stages of her marriage, Asmaa has to face a lot of hardship due to the extreme poverty they suffered. Suddenly, this daughter of a rich merchant found herself tending to the animals, kneading, grinding, fetching water and carrying huge loads on her head. She said about her situation: &#8220;When az-Zubayr married me, he had neither land, nor wealth, nor slave, nor anything else like it, except a camel to get water and his horse. I used to graze his horse, provide fodder for it, look after it and ground dates for his camel. Besides this, I grazed the camel, made arrangements for providing it with water and patching up his leather bucket and kneading the flour. I was not very good at baking the bread, so my female neighbors used to bake bread for me and they were sincere women. And I used to carry on my head, the date-stones from the land of az-Zubayr which the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam had endowed him and it was a distance of two miles from Madeenah. One day, as o was carrying the date-stones upon my head, I happened to meet Allaah&#8217;s Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, along with a group of his Companions. He called me and told the camel to sit down so that he could make me ride behind him. <strong>I felt shy to go with men and I remembered az-Zubayr and his Gheerah (Gheerah is the sense of pride that a man has which causes him to dislike his wives, daughters or sisters from being seen or heard by strangers. It is this gheerah which makes a man protective about his women) and he was a man having the most gheerah</strong>. The Messenger sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam understood my shyness and left. I came to az-Zubayr and said: &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah met me as I was carrying date-stones upon my head and there was with him a group of his Companions. He told the camel to kneel so that I could mount it but I felt shy from him and I remembered your gheerah.&#8221; Upon this az-Zubayr said: &#8220;By Allaah, the thought of you carrying date-stones upon your head is more severe a burden to me than you riding with him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I led this life of hardship until Abu Bakr sent me a female servant who took upon herself the responsibility of looking after the horse and I felt as if she had emancipated me.&#8221; (Reported in Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (eng. Trans. Vol.7 p.111 no.151))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at the sense of dignity and modesty of Asmaa. See how she felt shy in front of men? See how careful she was about refraining from what displeased her husband? She knew that az-Zubayr had a lot of gheerah, so she didn&#8217;t want to upset him by accepting the Prophet&#8217;s offer of assistance, even though that meant bringing hardship upon herself. And what did az-Zubayr say when he heard of what had happened that day?…&#8217;By Allaah, the thought of you carrying date-stones is more severe a burden on me than you riding with him!&#8221; so even though az-Zubayr had a lot of gheerah, he did not wish for that to cause inconvenience to his wife. Isn&#8217;t this what the marital relationship should be like? One of mutual concern, corporation and compassion? Asmaa could easily have said: &#8220;I am the daughter of the noble Abu Bakr and so I shouldn&#8217;t be doing these jobs!&#8221; but she didn&#8217;t. she was patient and respectful towards her husband throughout her difficult period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that once when she complained to her father about her hardships, he advised her, &#8220;My daughter be patient. When a woman has a righteous husband and he dies and she does not remarry after him, they will be reunited in the Garden.&#8221;(Reported in at-Tabaqaat of Ibn Sa&#8217;d)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And az-Zubayr was indeed a righteous man, as the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam himself testified when he counted him among the Promised ten of Paradise. (See Musnad Ahmad, Abu Dawood and others. Authenticated in Saheehul-Jaami&#8217; (no.50)) He also said of him: <i> &#8220;az-Zubayr is the son of my paternal aunt and my disciple from my Ummah.&#8221; </i>(Saheeh &#8211; Narrated by Jaabir &amp; collected in Musnad Ahmad. Authenticated by al-Albaanee in his as-Saheehah (1877))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to her being the wife of such a righteous man, Asmaa was also the mother of &#8216;Urwah Ibn az-Zubayr, who became one of the scholars of Madeenah. His teachers included his parents as well as him maternal aunt, the Mother of the Believers, &#8216;Aaishah radhi&#8217;allaahu anha; from whom he learnt a great deal. &#8216;Umar Ibn Abdul Azeez said about him: &#8220;I do not find anyone more knowledgeable than &#8216;Urwah Ibn az-Zubayr, and for whatever I know he knows something which I do not.&#8221; (Reported by adh-Dhahabee in Siyaar A&#8217;laamin-Nubalaa&#8217;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His son Hishaam reports that his father&#8217;s leg had to be amputated at the knee and was adviced to drink a narcotic, but he refused saying, &#8220;I did not think that anyone would drink something which would take away his intellect to the point that he did not know his Lord.&#8221; So they took off his leg with a saw and he did not say anything but &#8220;Ouch, ouch.&#8221; And in the same journey his son Muhammad was kicked to death by a mule and &#8216;Urwah was not heard to say anything about it but: <b>&#8220;We have suffered much fatigue in this, our journey.&#8221; </b>[Soorah Kahf 18:62]. O Allaah, I had seven sons and You took one and left me with six, and I had four limbs and You took one and left me with three &#8211; so if You have tested me then You have saved me, and if You have taken &#8211; You have left (more) behind.&#8221; (Ibn &#8216;Asaakir (11/287))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Her other son was of the Khaleefahs of the Muslims, &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn az-Zubayr, who was the leader of the Muslims during one of the most turbulent periods in Islaamic history. He was killed in Makkah at the hands of al-Hajjaaj on the 17th of Jumadaa al-Ulaa in 73H. a few days after the death of her sin, Asmaa bint Abu Bakr &#8211; &#8216;She of the two Belts&#8217; &#8211; also died &#8211; radi&#8217;allaahu anhaa.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From ad-Dawal ila-Allah magazine</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has favored us with countless blessings, the greatest of them being Islam itself. Within the religion of Islaam there are many favors; one is the month of Ramadan, which is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. However, many of us overlook this bounty and are thus left with an incomplete depiction of Ramadan, often viewing it as a month to get oneself into shape!! Or rigidly describing it as a training program teaching self-restraint. Most importantly Ramadan is an act of <em>Ebadah</em> (worship), the fulfillment of Allah&#8217;s commandments and one of the great mercies of Allah to His believers for both this world and the next.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">lbn al-Qayyim [1] wrote in his famous book &#8216;Zaadul-Ma&#8217;aad 2/8587 :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">&#8216;From the Mercy of the Mighty and Most Merciful is that He prescribed for them fasting which will cut off the excesses of eating and drinking and empties the hearts of its desires which divert it on its journey to Allah -the Most High. He prescribed it in due proportion as will be appropriate and will benefit the servant with regard to this world and to the Hereafter; and it will not harm him, nor damage what is beneficial for him.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The Virtues of Ramadaan </b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>a) The Hellfire is locked and the gates of Paradise are opened</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet Muhammad (<em>sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“When Ramadaan comes the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of the Fire are locked and the devils are chained&#8230;”</strong></span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allah Who out of His infinite Mercy locks the gates of Hell, chains and shackles the devils and opens up the gates of Paradise in this month for His servants, making it easier for them to devote this special time to His worship. It makes it harder for the evil jinn to corrupt the people as they usually do, because <em>Insha&#8217; Allah</em> the Muslims will be occupied with fasting, engaged in reading the Qur&#8217;aan, busy with extra prayers and in doing other righteous actions which help clean and purify their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>b) Sins are Forgiven.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam</em>) explained to his Ummah that Ramadaan has such a high station that even if a Muslim&#8217;s sins were as much as the foam upon the sea, they would be forgiven through fasting in this month.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<em>sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<span style="color:#808000;">He who fasts in Ramadaan due to eemaan and hoping for reward from Allah then his previous sins are forgiven.”</span></b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, in this month people are freed from the Hellfire every day and night, due to Allah&#8217;s extreme Mercy. The Prophet (<em>sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam</em>) told us in this regard that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There are in the month of Ramadaan in every day and night, those whom Allah grants freedom from the Fire, and there is for every Muslim a supplication which he can make and it will be granted.”</strong> </span>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This supplication, which is never rejected occurs at the time of breaking the fast. (See Sunan ibn Maajah, 1/557)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>c) Lailatul-Qadr</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another virtue of this blessed month is that in it falls the night that is better than a thousand months, in which descends the angels and the Rooh, [5] and in which if one is standing in prayer out of faith and seeking reward, then his previous sins are forgiven. This is the Night of Decree &#8211; Lailatul-Qadr [6].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>The Virtues of Fasting:</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasting itself is an action which has many virtues and rewards, Allah &#8211; the one free from all imperfections &#8211; revealed in His Book <strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">..and fast, it is better for you if you did but know.</span>”</strong> [Soorah al- Baqarah (2) : 184]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To try and help us understand just how valuable it is, the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam</em>) informed us that it is a shield against the Hellfire, a protection against desires, a cause to enter Paradise and a gate from the gates of Paradise has been particularized for it, as well as other merits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>A) A shield.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<em>sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;<span style="color:#808000;">Fasting is a shield with which a servant protects himself from the fire.</span>” </b>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasting weakens and cuts off desires and since it is desires which lead to the fire, it can be seen how fasting acts as a protection against them, as a barrier, a shield, between the fasting person and the fire. It safeguards one from indulging in foul speech, quarrels and fights. It also develops the habit of self-control and restraint.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is for this reason that the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam</em>), ordered the men who are unable to marry, to practice the act of fasting. Fasting will cut off the sensual desire by diminishing the vigor of the body, calming and constraining it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“<span style="color:#808000;">O youths, whosoever amongst you is able to marry then let him do so, since it restrains the eyes and protects the private parts, and he who is unable, then let him fast because it is a shield for him.</span>” </b>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>b) A Cause for Entering Paradise.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since fasting distances one from the fire, it brings one closer to Paradise. The Messenger (<em>sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam</em>) was asked by his Companion Abo Umaamah (<em>radhi allahu anhu</em>): “O Messenger of Allah tell me an action by which I may enter Paradise.” He (<em>sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam</em>) said: “<strong><span style="color:#808000;">Take to fasting, there is nothing like it.</span></strong>” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>c) An Immense Reward</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every action of the son of Adam is given manifold rewards, each good deed receiving ten times its like, up to seven hundred times. Allah the Most High has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Except for fasting, for it is for Me and I will recompense it, he leaves of his desires and his food for Me. For the fasting person there are two times of joy; a time of joy when he breaks his fast and a time of joy when he meets his Lord, the smell coming from the mouth of a fasting person is better with Allah than the smell of Musk..”</b> </span>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The main virtue of fasting, as with any action, is that it is done purely for the sake of Allah. The difference with fasting is that it is an act completely hidden from others so it is done merely for the pleasure of Allah (unlike for example: Prayer, Hajj etc.) and so Allah rewards His servant for it specially.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>d) An Intercession</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another great virtue of fasting is that it will act as an intercessor with Allah on the Day of Judgement &#8211; a day when we will be in need of intercession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<em>sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Fasting and the Qur&#8217;aan intercede for a servant on the Day of Resurrection. Fasting will say: “O my Lord I prevented him from food and desires so accept my intercession for him” and the Qur&#8217;aan will say: “I prevented him from sleep at night, so accept my intercession for him” So their intercessions will be accepted.”</b></span> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>e) An Expiation for Various Sins</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; has also made fasting an expiation for certain sins. This means if someone commits one of these sins then he can atone for it by fasting a fixed number of days. Fasting is an expiation for:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>(i) </b>Shaving the head while in a state of ihraam [i.e. while one is performing the rites of Hajj or Umrah.] due to some illness][Soorah al-Baqarah (2) :196]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>(ii)</b> One who is unable to carry out the obligatory sacrifice during Hajj &#8211; [Soorah al-Baqarah (2) : 196]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>(iii)</b> Accidentally killing one of the people with whom you have a treaty &#8211; [Soorah an-Nisaa (4) : 92]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>(iv) </b>Hunting game while in a state of ihraam &#8211; [Soorah al-Maaidah (5) :95]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>(v)</b> Violating an oath &#8211; [Soorah al-Maaidah (5) :893]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>(vi)</b> Dhihaar [This is the saying of husband to his wife: “You are to me like the back of my mother (i.e. awful to me) ] &#8211; [Soorah al-Mujaadilah (58) : 3 &#8211; 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>f) <em>Ar-Rayaan</em> is for the Fasting People</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, Allah &#8211; the One free from all imperfections &#8211; has particularized a gate from the gates of Paradise for those who fast. The Prophet (<em>sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Indeed, there is a gate of Paradise called <em>ar-Rayaan</em>. On the Day of Resurrection those who fast will enter through it; no one enters it except for them, end when they have entered, it is closed so that no one (else) enters it.” </b></span>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The status of fasting and its place in Islaam should now be clear to us, by Allah&#8217;s permission, and also the great rewards awaiting the one who fasts seeking the pleasure of Allah. The rewards can, however increase or decrease depending upon how close it is upon the way of the Messenger of Allah (<em>sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam</em>). Therefore we must know the characteristics of his (<em>sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam</em>) fast, together with its obligatory duties, its manners and the relevant supplications and then put that into practice.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“ May Allah &#8211; the Most High grant us the ability to do that which allow us to capture the fruits of this month and make us amongst those who enter His Paradise through the gate of <em>Ar-Rayaan</em>.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From ad-Dawal ila-Allah Magazine</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ramdaan is a time when all Muslims, all over the world, see much more of one another, whether in the masjids whilst attending the taraweeh prayers or in each other’s homes at the time of Iftaar. Invitations are eagerly accepted, which is a good thing, for among the rights of a Muslim upon the other is that when he is invited he responds [1] and that is in obedience with the Messenger&#8217;s instruction:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“When any of you is invited to a dinner, he should accept the invitation…” </b>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most of us are aware of the distinguished position a guest has in Islam, the right he has upon us of being entertained, as the Prophet mentioned in many Ahadeeth such as the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“He who gives food for a fasting person to break his fast, he will receive the same reward as him except that nothing will be reduced form the fasting person’s rewards.”</b> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we’d like to draw your attention towards is how many times do we spare a thought for our host, the one who goes to the effort of preparing and providing food for his fellow Muslim? We can all relate to the joy and pleasure we feel when we break our fasts together, feeling in our hearts appreciation for the effort our host has gone to, feeling honoured that he/she took so much trouble for us. Yet many of us are unaware and unsure of how we, as guest, can &#8216;express&#8217; our gratitude. Should we take a box of chocolate, or flowers, or perhaps make an impromptu speech after the meal to say how delicious the meal was?! Alhamdulillah! these are all good things, i.e. complementing and giving gifts to each other, but there is something we as guests can do which is highly recommended in the Sunnah of the Prophet (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) and that is to supplicate for our hosts, after finishing the food, with any of the following.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. Akala ta&#8217;aamaakul abraaru, wasallatalaykumul mallaa ikaatu, wa aftara &#8216;indalkumus saa&#8217;imoon.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“May righteous eat along with you, the angels seek forgiveness ask Allah to send His Grace and Honor for you, and those who fast, break their fast along with you.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. Allahumma at&#8217;im man at&#8217;amanee wasqi man saqaane.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O Allah feed the one who fed me, and give the one who gave me drink.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3. Allahumma-maghfirlahum warhamhum wa baarik feemaa razaqtahum.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O Allah forgive them, and have mercy upon them and place them in what you have provided them.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should learn these supplications so that when we are invited to a meal and can express appreciation by supplication for our host with du&#8217;aas taught to us by our Prophet (sallallahu alahi wa-sallam) then never again should we feel stuck for word.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From ad-Dawah illaah Magazine</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the most beautiful things about the concept of worship in Islaam is the truly unique way in which it incorporates the feeling of love, fear and hope within the hearts of the worshippers of Allah. Understanding how to combine these three qualities into the worship (ibaadah) of Allah is one of the most essential things that every Muslim must grasp, not least because every sect which has drifted from the Straight Path has strayed in the aspect of worship. The deviation of the other religions in this regard is clear for all to see: “God is love! Jesus is love!” say the Christians, denying the fact that Allah should be feared too. As for the Jews, their hearts were filled only with hope; hope that the Fire will never touch them, since they were the “Promised People”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Islaam however, no worship is complete without the presence of all three qualities: love of Allah, hope in His Mercy and fear of His Punishment. Contemplate the opening Soorah of the Qur&#8217;aan &#8211; Soorah al-Faatihah &#8211; and you will see this for yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aayah 1: “All praise [and thanks] is for Allah, Rabb of all the worlds.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this opening aayah (verse) of the Qur&#8217;aan, we have LOVE of Allah and every time we recite this aayah we are testifying to our love for Allah. How is that you ask?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is because in the aayah, we are acknowledging that Allah is our Rabb and the Rabb of all the worlds. Rabb is usually translated as ‘the Lord’, but this translation does not do justification to this name of Allah and all the meanings this name carries. In reality, Rabb means that Allah is the Creator of everything; He sustains and nourishes everything; He gives life and Death; anything good that we have is from Him; everything is dependant on Him and nothing can happen unless He wills it. Furthermore, for the Muslims He &#8211; the Rabb &#8211; in the One who has guided us to the Truth and given us good morals and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus when we testify that Allah is our Rabb, then we are acknowledging that He is the One who has given us so many blessings &#8211; so many that if we try to enumerate His blessings, we would be unable to do so. So how could we not but LOVE Him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After all, we all love those who show kindness towards us or present us with gifts. And therefore the Messenger of Allah (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) encouraged the exchange of gifts between Muslims because it helps to strengthen ties and develop love for one another. He (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) said, “Give gifts to one another, you will come to love one another.”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So imagine the LOVE we should have for our Rabb who has given us everything: nice families, shelter, security, food, health and above all the Guidance of Islaam and the Sunnah. We should be overwhelming in our love for Him. That is why we praise Him and thank Him and say, “All praise (and thanks) is for Allah, Rabbil-‘aalameen.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aayah 2: The Rahmaan (Merciful) and the Raheem (Mercy-Giving).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the first aayah of Soorah al-Faatihah, Allah mentioned He was the Rabb. In this aayah two more of His beautiful names are mentioned: ar-Rahmaan and ar-Raheem. Ar-Rahmaan means that He is the Most Merciful. Ar-Raheem means that He is the Giver of Mercy, in other words His actions are full of Mercy and He shows Mercy to His creation.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we mention these two names of Allah, then we have HOPE. Since He is the One who is full of Mercy, and we hope He will forgive our mistakes and shortcomings. We should never loose hope, because Allah says in the Qur&#8217;aan, “O My slaves, who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah, Verily Allah forgives all sins (except sins). Truly He is Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful” [39: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The need to have FEAR in our worship is shown by the next aayah of Soorah al-Faatihah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aayah 3: “King/Master of the Day of Judgement.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we recite this aayah, we remind ourselves of the Day of Judgement &#8211; that awful Day, when all of humanity shall stand before Allah … naked, uncircumcised and barefooted. People will appear drunk though they are not. On that Day, every person will stand before Allah and account for his sins, knowing that not even the smallest action which he did is hidden from Allah: “So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom shall see it.” [Soorah 99 : 7-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when we recite this third aayah of Soorah al-Faatihah, we remind ourselves of this Judgement and accountability and that should bring about in us a sense of fear &#8211; that maybe our evil actions will be too great and we will be responsible for them &#8211; May Allah protect us from such a fate. Then the next verse goes on to say: “You alone we worship.” i.e. we single out Allah for our worship. And how do we worship Him? With LOVE, HOPE and FEAR. And in order to achieve these qualities, we need Allah’s assistance, so we say then, “We seek Your Aid.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Striking the Balance</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After understanding the need to have love, hope and fear in our worship, the next question that naturally arises is that, in what proportion should these qualities be present in our worship? Again we turn to the Qur&#8217;aan for the answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Call upon Him with Fear and Hope.” [ Soorah (7): 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Their sides forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in Fear and Hope.” [(32): 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So both fear and hope should be present in our hearts in equal proportions. Anas reported that the Prophet (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) entered upon a young boy who was dying. The Prophet (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) asked, “How are you?” The boy replied, “O Messenger of Allah, I am in between hoping in Allah and fearing for my sins.” The Prophet (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) said, “The like of these two qualities do not unite in the heart of a servant except that Allah gives him what he hopes for and protects him from what he feared.”[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore whenever we do a good action, we should hope that it has been accepted by Allah, but at the same time we should also have fear that maybe it isn’t enough or that the good deed has not been worthy of acceptance. Likewise when we sin, we should have hope that Allah will accept our repentance and forgive us, but we should also fear that we may be accountable for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This balance should be reflected in our Dawah (which of course is also worship). So when we invite others to the Truth, we should not give them the impression that ‘they have nothing to worry about’, nor do we suggest that ‘they are doomed forever’. Rather we couple warnings with encouragement. We inform them of the horrors of the Fire and tell them about the bliss of Paradise. Just as we find Allah telling us in the Qur&#8217;aan: “Verily your Lord is Quick in Punishment and verily He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Giver of Mercy.” [(7): 167]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the scholars of Islaam say, “He who worships Allah with hope only is a murji’ee. He who worships Him in fear only is a Harooree [Khaarijee]. And He who worships Allah in love only is a Zindeeq [eg. the Soofis, the Christians, etc]. But he who worships Allah in fear, love and hope is a Muwahhid Mu’min [a believer upon Tawheed].”[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Murji’a were a sect that emerged within the first century of Islaam. The people of this sect (i.e. the murji’ees) believe that sins do not affect faith i.e. no matter what sins a person commits, his eeman (faith) is complete and perfect. They worship Allah only with hope because they believe that as long as one believed and testified to Islaam, they would enter Paradise regardless of their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, all too often nowadays we find a similar attitude amongst many Muslims today, which is why we find that so often we try to advice someone to turn to the Deen and abandon sin, they just point to their hearts and say, “Allah knows what is in my heart”, or “Allah forgives”, or something else like that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Khawaarij, they worshipped Allah in fear only because they held that anyone who commits major sins was a disbeliever and would therefore dwell in Hellfire forever. This of course is gross extremism and straying from the correct path. The Prophet (salla-allahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: “There were two men of Banoo Israa’eel who strove equally. One of then committed sins and the other strove hard in worship. And the one who strove in worship cto see the other in sin and kept saying to him: “Desist.” So one day he found him committing a sin and so said to him: “Desist” So he replied, “Leave me by my Lord, have you been sent as a watcher over me?”. He said, “By Allah, Allah will not forgive you, nor will Allah admit you to Paradise”. Then their souls were taken and they came together before the Lord of the Worlds. So Allah said to the one who strove in worship: “Did you have Knowledge of Me, or did you have any power in what is in my Hands?” And He said to the sinner: “Go and enter Paradise through My Mercy.” And He said to the other: “Take him to the fire.” Aboo Hurairah t said: “By Him in whose Hand is my soul! He spoke a word which destroyed this world and the hereafter for him.”[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore we should never say of anyone that he or she is a ‘lost cause’ or ‘doomed’ or the like for this is a great sin. However, we fear for those who commit major sins because they have been threatened with punishment in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Hadeeth. However it is up to Allah whether He chooses to punish them or whether He will forgive them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Zindeeqs &#8211; or the heretics &#8211; are groups, such as many of the Soofis who have become like the Christians and reduced the religion to just ‘love’ and so all their talk and their mystical practices are centred around developing more ‘love’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is thus clear how imbalances in any of the three qualities of worship can lead to major deviation and straying to the True Guidance. It is therefore important for every Muslim to combine all three of them in his heart properly. As was mentioned before, the fear and hope should be in equal proportions[6], but as for love then that should be uppermost. As Fudayl ibn-‘Iyaad &#8211; rahimahullah &#8211; (d.187H) said, “The love is better than the fear. The fear checks us from sinning, and the love makes us do what is prescribed with an open heart.”[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us what we hope for and protect us from what we fear. And may the Blessings of Allah be upon our Prophet Muhammed, upon his family, his Companions and upon all those who follow Guidance until the Last Day.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] This was the opinion of most of the Salaf. Al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyyaad said that, when one is healthy and well, then fear should predominate, but when terminally ill then hpoe should predominate &#8211; so that one should strive to do good when well and not despair of Allah’s Mercy when terminally ill. [Al-Takhweef minan-Naar]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Reported in Al-Takhweef minan-Naar of Ibn Rajab. Note that some scholars hold that the fear is better than love, and Allah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The following is taken from the Book <strong>&#8216;Words of Advice Regarding Da&#8217;wah&#8217;</strong> from Shaykh &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Azeez ibn &#8216;Abdullaah ibn Baaz, compiled by Ziyaad ibn Muhammad as-Sa&#8217;doon</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;The youth in any nation are the backbone which form the element of movement and vitality in society. They have the energy to bring about effective results&#8230;Usually a nation is never revived except due to the awareness and continuous enthusiasm of the youth. However, <strong>over-enthusiasm of the youth must be guided through the wisdom of the old</strong>. The youth must contemplate and look into the experiences of the old, they shouldn&#8217;t leave one for the other, but rather must preserve both of these qualities&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;<strong>The leaders and the scholars</strong> should exert efforts to enlighten and direct the population of Muslims and combat the efforts of the enemies of Islaam, by retaliating with their own efforts&#8230;The Muslim Ummah is an Ummah that has been entrusted with this religion and has the responsibility of conveying it. If we are careful to arm our boys and girls in Islamic societies, with knowledge, understanding and comprehension of Islamic Jurisprudence and accustom them to apply these things from a small age, then we will not fear, by the permission of Allaah, the Most High, as long as they continue holding onto the deen of Allaah, glorifying it, following its laws, and fighting that which contradicts it. And indeed their enemies will fear them&#8230;There are many verses in the Qur&#8217;aan which convey this message. The most important factor for us in fighting against the efforts of our enemies is <strong>raising and preparing a generation that knows the reality of Islaam</strong>. This can be achieved through guidance, taking care of the house and family, the method of educating them, the media and improvement of the society&#8230;In addition to this is the role of steering and guiding which needs to be taken by the Muslim leadership, persevering in beneficial work and continually reminding the people that which will benefit them and make the belief within them grow and flourish&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have read and heard in the news much about our Muslim brothers in communities where the majority of the population is non-Muslim. They are under authorities which impose restrictions on them, in practicing their religion and establishing their rites of worship, in order to distance them from their religion through compulsion and in other ways. We ask Allaah to firmly establish these Muslim minorities, and indeed all the Muslims upon Islaam and keep them safe from the plots of the enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that they are in a seriously vulnerable situation. Because of this situation, these <strong>Islamic minorities need all the help, co-operation and assistance</strong>, from the political sphere and this is specially from the Islamic governments from the Arab world as well as others that have special concern for Islaam. They have relations with these nations through sending delegates, dispatching messages and urging their embassies to act, or any other similar methods that will help their brothers in these regions. This will raise the morale of the minorities and make the (oppressing) nations realize that these minorities have brothers from the same faith, who are concerned about their situation and who follow their news. If Allaah, the Most High wills, the injustice and oppression will then be lifted from the Muslims when these oppressing nations and others begin to realize that behind the minority of Muslims is a nation which feels their pain and is interested in their affairs. As a result they will give into their requests and will raise their hand from oppressing them, especially when the majority of these nations need Islamic countries for their economic and other affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the minority of Muslims everywhere are in urgent need of moral support and material help and resources to build mosques and schools that will help them in their Islamic work&#8230;So therefore it is obligatory upon every Muslim to help in accordance to his ability&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally I advise my Muslim brothers and sisters in Islaam, to have taqwa (fear) of Allaah in all matters and to be firmly established on His deen. They should fear Him wherever they are and be heedful of Him. They should take account of themselves, and be careful not to leave what Allaah has made obligatory upon them, nor to commit a sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise them to <strong>co-operate upon Birr and Taqwa</strong> and to be sincere to each other and advise each other with truth and patience wherever they are. I also advise them to gain a deep and good understanding of the deen and attend circles of knowledge and question the scholars&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to make those in charge of the Muslims and their leaders, upright and honest and to guide everyone to the straight path. I ask Him to make their leaders and their aides successful, and all their people to rule by the Islamic laws and rulings. And to be ruled by them, to be firmly established upon them, and to advise each other upon them, and to beware of and forbid that which contradicts them&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah, the Most High, and peace and blessings upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family and his Companions.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The following is taken from &#8216;Al-Ibaanah&#8217; magazine (Vol 1, No.2, pp.7-8), being a translation of Ad-Da&#8217;wah Ilallaah wa Akhlaaqud-Du&#8217;aat (pp.37-43) by Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz:</span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon the da&#8217;ee (caller) to have <strong>ikhlaas</strong> (sincerity and purity of intentions and actions) for Allaah &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic &#8211; <strong>neither desiring to show-off, nor desiring reputation, nor desiring the praises and the accolades of the people</strong>. Rather, the da&#8217;ee should only call to Allaah, seeking the Face of Allaah&#8230;and this is the most important etiquette and the greatest quality&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;call the people to Allaah upon <strong>&#8216;ilm (knowledge)</strong>, and not ignorance&#8230;so beware of calling to Allaah based upon ignorance, and beware of speaking without due knowledge. Indeed, ignorance destroys, it does not build; and it causes corruption, not reformation and correction&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the akhlaaq that it is necessary to have &#8211; O da&#8217;ee &#8211; is to be <strong>mild and forbearing</strong> in your da&#8217;wah, and being gentle and patient in it, as were all the Messengers &#8216;alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam. <strong>Beware of being hasty, harsh</strong> and strict in your da&#8217;wah, rather be patient, mild and gentle&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not turn the people away from the Deen due to your harshness, ignorance, or other such behavior. On the contrary, be mild, forbearing and patient; and be soft and pleasant in speech, so your words may have an effect upon the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect upon the one you are addressing the call to. Then the people will better appreciate your call and invitation. So undue strictness causes people to become distant, not close; and it causes separation, not unity. Therefore, it is a must to be gentle, as the Messenger &#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed gentleness does not enter into anything except it beautifies it, nor is it removed from anything except that it disfigures it</span>.&#8221; [Muslim 12/212].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he &#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam also said:</p>
<p> &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Whosoever is prevented from gentleness, is actually prevented from all good and excellence</span>.&#8221; [Muslim 16/145].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the necessary &#8211; or rather obligatory &#8211; etiquettes and qualities that a da&#8217;ee must possess is <strong>acting in accordance to what he is calling to</strong>, and being a righteous example of what is being called to. He should not call to do something and then not do it himself, nor call to leave something, whilst engaging in it himself. This is the condition of the losers &#8211; we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge in this!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;the daa&#8217;ee should have an <strong>excellent character and praiseworthy conduct</strong>, <strong>being patient</strong> and inviting to patience. The daa&#8217;ee should be <strong>sincere in his da&#8217;wah</strong> and strive in spreading goodness to the people and keeping them away from falsehood. At the same time the daa&#8217;ee should <strong>supplicate for the guidance of others</strong>, saying: &#8220;O Allaah! Guide him, and grant him the ability to accept the truth.&#8221; So from the excellent manners of the da&#8217;ee is supplicating, guiding and being patient with the harms that come with this da&#8217;wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet &#8216;alayhis-salaatu was-salaam was informed that the tribe of Daws had become disobedient he said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O Allaah! Guide Daws and bring them.&#8221;</span> [Bukhaaree 6/105]. So the daa&#8217;ee should&#8230;not despair, nor feel hopeless, nor say anything except good. He should not be harsh and strict, nor should he say a word which may cause aversion to the truth. However, if anyone commits aggression and oppression, then a different treatment is to be afforded to such people&#8230;if possible such a person should be imprisoned, or something similar to that &#8211; depending upon the nature of his opposition to the da&#8217;wah. However, as long as he causes no harm, then it is upon you to be patient and self-evaluating and to debate with him in ways that are best. If any personal harm was caused by such a person, then such harm should be borne with patience &#8211; as did the Messengers and those who followed them in goodness and righteousness, patiently bear such harms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to grant us all the well-being and the ability to convey this da&#8217;wah in a wise manner, that He corrects our hearts and our actions, and that He grants to us the understanding of the Deen and firmness upon it &#8211; making us of those who are guided and guiding others, righteous and teaching others righteousness. Indeed He is the Most Majestic, the Supreme, the Most Generous.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Source: Ad-Dawah ilalLaah Magazine</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the most beautiful this about the concept of worship in Islaam is the truly unique way in which it incorporates the feelings of love, fear and hope within the hearts of the worshippers of Allah. Understanding how to combine these three qualities into the worship (&#8216;ibaadah) of Allah is one of the most essential things that every Muslim must grasp, ,not least because every sect which has drifted from the Straight Path has strayed in this aspect of worship. The deviation of the other Religions in this regards is clear for all to see: &#8220;God is Love! Jesus is Love!&#8221; say the Christians, denying the fact that God should be feared too. As for the Jews, then their hearts are filled only with hope &#8211; hope in the belief that the Fire will not touch them since they are the &#8220;Promised People&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Islaam however, no worship is complete without the presence of all three qualities: LOVE of Allah, Hope in His Mercy and FEAR of His Punishment. Contemplate the opening Soorah of the Qur&#8217;aan &#8211; Sooratul Faatihah &#8211; and you will see for yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Aaayah 1: &#8220;All Praise [and Thanks] are for Allah, Rabb of all the worlds.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this opening aayah (verse) of the Qur&#8217;aan, we have LOVE of Allah and every time we recite this aayah we are testifying to our love for Allah. How is that you ask? IT is because in this aayah, we are acknowledging that Allah is our Rabb and the Rabb of all the worlds. Rabb is usually translated as &#8216;the Lord&#8217;, but this translation does not do justification to this name of Allah and all the meanings that this name carries. In reality Rabb means that Allah is the Creator of everything; He sustains and nourishes everything; He gives life and death; anything good which we have is from Him; everything is dependent on Him and nothing can happen unless He wills it. Furthermore, for the Muslim He &#8211; the Rabb &#8211; is the One who has guided us to the Truth and given us good morals and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thuis when we testify that Allah is out Rabb, then we are acknowledging that He is the One who has given us so many blessings &#8211; so many that is we tried to enumerate His blessings upon us, we could not count them. So how could we not love Him? After all, we know that when someone gives us even a small gift or shows even a small act of kindness towards us, then we develop so much love for them on account of that &#8211; so imagine then the love we should[1] have for our Rabb who has given us everything: nice families, shelter, security, food, health, and above all, Guidance to Islaam and the Sunnah. We should be overwhelming in our love for Him and thank Him and say: &#8220;All Praises [and Thanks] are for Allah, Rabbil-&#8216;aalameen.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aayah 2: &#8220;The Rahman [Merciful] and the Raheem [Mercy-Giving].&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the first aayah of Sooratul-Faatihah, Allah mentioned that He was ar-Rabb. In the next aayah two more of His beautiful names are mentioned: ar-Rahmaan and ar-Raheem. Ar-Rahman means that He is the Most Merciful, that is, His Nature or His Essence is Merciful. Ar-Raheem means that He is the Giver of Mercy, in other words, His actions are full of Mercy and He shows Mercy to His creation.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we mention these two names of Allah, then we have HOPE. Since He has described Himself as so full of Mercy then we have hope that He will forgive out sins, and no matter how numerous out sins may be, we should never lose this hope, because Allah has told us: &#8220;O My slaves who have transgressed against themselves! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah verily Allah forgives all sins [except shirk]. Truly He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Mercy-Giving.&#8221; [az-Zumar (39):53].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The need to have FEAR in our worship is shown by the next aayah of Sooratul-Faatihah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aayah 3: &#8220;King/Master of the Day of Judegment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we recite this aayah we are reminding ourselves of the Day of Judgement &#8211; that awful Day, when we shall all stand before Allah, naked, uncircumcised and barefooted. Some will be sweating so much that it will go seventy arm-length into the earth. People will appear drunk though they are no. On this Day, every person will stand before Allah and account for his sins, knowing that not even the smallest action which he did is hidden from Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom shall see it.&#8221; [az-Zalzalah (99):7-8].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when we recite this third aayah of Sooratul-Faatihah, we remind ourselves of this Judgement and accountability and that should bring about in us a sense of fear &#8211; that maybe out evil actions will be too great and we will be responsible for it &#8211; may Allah protect us from such a fate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the next verse goes on to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;You alone we worship.&#8221; i.e. we single out Allah for our worship. And how do we worship Him? With LOVE, HOPE and FEAR. And in order to achieve these qualities, we need Allah&#8217;s assistance, so we say then: &#8220;We seek Your Aid.&#8221; [1:4].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>STRIKING THE BALANCE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After understanding the need to have love, fear and hope in our worship, the question that now arises is: in what proportions should these qualities be present in our worship? Again we turn to the Qur&#8217;aan for our answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Call upon Him with Fear and Hope.&#8221; [al-A&#8217;raff(7):56].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Their sides forsake their beds, to invokde their Lord in Fear and Hope.&#8221; [as-Sajdah(32):16].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So both fear and hope should be present inour hearts in equal proportions. Anas &#8211; radiAllaahu &#8216;anhu &#8211; reported that the Prophet, sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam entered upon a young boy who was dying. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam asked: &#8220;How are you?&#8221; The boy replied: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, I am in-between hoping in Allah and fearing for my sins.&#8221; The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;The like of these two qualities do not unite in the heart of a servant except that Allah gives him what he hopes for and protects him from what he feared.&#8221;[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, whenever we do a good action, we should have hope that it has been accepted by Allah, but at the same time we should also have fear that maybe it isn&#8217;t enough or that the good deed has not been worthy of acceptance. Likewise when we sin, we should have hope that Allah will accept out Repentance and forgive us, but we should also fear that we may be accountable for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This balance should also be reflected in out da&#8217;wah (which of course is also worship). So when we invite others to the Truth, we should not give them the impression that they have &#8220;nothing to worry about&#8221;; nor do we suggest that they are doomed forever. Rather, we couple warnings with encouragement. We inform them of the horrors of the Fire as well as telling them about the bliss of Paradise. Just as we find Allah telling us in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily your Lord is Quick in Punishment and verily He is Oft-Forgiving, the Giver of Mercy.&#8221; [al-A&#8217;raaf(7):167].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our Righteous Predecessors used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;He who worships Allah with hope only is a Murji&#8217;ee. He who worships Him in fear only is a Harooree [Khaarijee]. And he who worships Allah in love only is a Zindeeq [e.g. Soofees, Christians]. But he who worships Allah in fear, love and hope is a Muwahhid Mu&#8217;min [a believer upon Tawheed.&#8221;</em> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Murji&#8217;ah were a sect that emerged within the first century of Islaam. The people of this sect (known as murji&#8217;ees) believe that sins do not affect faith, i.e. no matter what sins a person commits, his eemaan (faith) is complete and perfect. They worship Allah only with hope because they belive that as along as one believed and testified to Islaam, they would enter Paradise regardless of their actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, all too often nowadays we find a somewhat similar attitude amongst the Muslims today, which is why we find that so often when we try to advise someone to turn to the Deen and abandon sin, they just point to their hearts and say, &#8220;Allah knows what&#8217;s in my heart&#8221;, or that &#8220;Allah forgives&#8221; or something similar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Khawaarij, they worshipped Allah in fear only because they held that anyone who committed major sins was a disbeliever and would therefore dwell in Hellfire forever. This, of course, is gross extremism and a straying from the correct Path. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;There were two men from Banoo Israa&#8217;eel who strove equally. One of them committed sins and the other strove hard in worship. And the one who strove in worship continued to see the other sin and kept saying to him: &#8216;Desist&#8217;. So one day, he found him committing a sin and so said to him: &#8216;Desist&#8217;. So he replied: &#8220;Leave me to my Lord; have you been sent as a watcher over me?&#8221; He said: &#8220;By Allah, Allah will nor forgive you, nor will Allah admit you to Paradise.&#8221; Then their sould were taken and they came together before the Lord of the Worlds. So He said to the one who strove in worship: &#8220;Did you have knowledge of Me, or did you have any power over what was in my Hands?&#8221; And He said to the sinner: &#8220;Go and enter Paradise through My Mercy.&#8221; And He said to the other: &#8220;Take him to the Fire.&#8221; Aboo Hurairah said: &#8220;By Him is Whose Hand is my soul! He spoke a word which destroyed this world and the Hereafter for him.&#8221;[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore we should never say of anyone that he or she is a &#8216;lost cause&#8217; or &#8216;doomed&#8217; or the like since this is a great sin. However, we fear for those who commit major sins because they have been threatened with punsihment in the Qur&#8217;aan. It is up to Allah whether He chooses to punish them or whether He will forgive them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Zanaadiqah &#8211; or the heretics &#8211; are groups, such as many of the Soofees who have become like the Christians and reduced the religion to just &#8216;love&#8217; and so all their talk and all their mystical practices are centred around developing more &#8216;love&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is thus clear how imbalances in any of the three qualities of worship can lead to major deviation and straying from the True Guidance, Therefore it is important for every Muslim to inculcate all three things in his heart properly. As was mentioned before, the fear and hope should be in equal proportions[6] but as for love, then that should be uppermost, As Fudayl ibn Iyyaad (d.187H) said: &#8220;The love is better than fear. The fear checks us from sinning, and the love makes us to do what is prescribed with an open heart.&#8221;[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah Subhaanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala grant us what we hope for and protect us from what we fear. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 This is why the Prophet, sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam encouraged us to give gifts to one another. He said: &#8220;Give gifts to one another, you will come to love one another.&#8221; [Hasan &#8211; Collected in al-Bukhaaree&#8217;s al-Adabul-Mufrad &amp; declared hasan by al-Albaanee in al-Irwaa(1601).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 As explained by Ibnul-Qayyim (d.751H) in Badaa&#8217;i-ul-Faawaa&#8217;id &amp; others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 Hasan &#8211; Collected by at-Tirmidhee &amp; Ibn Maajah. Authenticated by al-Albaanee in Ahkaamul-Janaa&#8217;iz (no. 2).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 Quoted by ibn Rajab in at-Takhweef minan-Naar as the saying of one of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 Saheeh &#8211; Reported by Aboo Hurairah &amp; collected in Aboo Daawood (eng. trans. vol.3 p.1365 no.4883). Authenticatd by al-Albaanee in Saheehul-Jaami (4455).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 This was the opinion of most of the Salaf. Al-Fudayl ibn &#8216;Iyyaad said that when one is healthy and well, then fear should predominate, but when terminally ill then hope should predominate &#8211; so that one should strive to do good when well and not despair of Allah&#8217;s Mercy when terminally ill. [At-Takhweef minan-Naar].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 Reported in at-Takhweef minan-Naar of Ibn Rajab. Note that some scholars hold that fear is better than love. Allah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Source: Taken from &#8220;Ad-Dawah illallaah Magazine&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is true to say that although much information has reached us about Fasting and Ramadaan &#8211; authentic or otherwise, we know very little about the etiquettes of &#8216;Eid: what we are recommended to do in this day and what is obligatory for us to do. Below is a brief list of some of the prescribed practices of &#8216;Eid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SUNAN AL-&#8216;EID</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It is established from the Companion Ibn &#8216;Umar, that he used to bath on the morning of &#8216;Eid. The tabi&#8217;ee, Sa&#8217;eed ibn al Musayyib said: &#8220;The sunnah of the fitr is three: walking to the Prayer ground, eating before going out and taking a bath.&#8221; [Saheeh &#8211; Al Firyaabee &amp; al-Irwaa (2/104)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is known that the companion Ibn &#8216;Umar would also dressed in his best clothes for the two &#8216;Eids as reported by Ibn Hajr in his Fathul-Baaree (2/439).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. It is compulsory on all adult sane Muslims to pray the &#8216;Eid prayer. The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam and his Companions never ceased doing it and he sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam commanded everyone including women, children and the elderly to attend. Even menstruating women should go to the place of congregation so that they may partake in the blessings .[Bukharee and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. It is Sunnah to eat dates before we leave for Al-&#8216;Eid prayer to show openly that we are not fasting on this day. The Prophet, sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, used not to leave for Al-Eid [al- Fitr] prayer except after eating some dates. [Reported by Anas bin Maalik &amp; collected in Saheeh al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. vol.2 p.40 no.73) &amp; Ahmad.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. It is Sunnah to say takbeer loudly when leaving our homes to go to &#8216;Eid prayer and repeat these till the prayer starts. [Silsilatal- Ahaadeeth-Saheehah (no 171).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. It is preferable to pray the &#8216;Eid prayer on open ground and not at the masjid if possible. [Bukharee and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Neither Adhaan nor Iqaamah are said for &#8216;Eid prayer. [Reported by Ibn &#8216;Abbaas and Jaabir ibn &#8216;Abdullah &amp; collected in Saheeh al- Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. vol.2 p.40)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. It is Sunnah to say the extra takbeers i.e. say &#8216;Allaahu Akbar&#8217; seven times in the first rak&#8217;ah and five times in the second. [Aboo Daawood, Ahmad &amp; others.] It is preferable to only raise the hands to the shoulders after the first takbeer and then fold them upon the chest. However, it is authentically reported from Ibn &#8216;Umar radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu that he would raise his hands with every takbeer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. It is Sunnah to take different routes to and from the prayer ground, preferably walking if possible. Jaabir reported that the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam used to come back from the &#8216;Eid prayer on a path other than the one used in going to it. [Bukharee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>WHAT TO SAY ON THE DAY OF &#8216;Eid</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam would say takbeer loudly when travelling to go to the &#8216;Eid prayer. Ahadeeth have not reached us telling us exactly what he used to say, but Ibn Abee Shayhah narrated that Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, radhiAllaahu &#8216;anhu used to say the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar, Laa eelaahaa ilallaah<br />
Allaahu Akbar, Allaahu Akbar, wa lillaahil-hamd</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is Great, Allaah is Great, there is none worthy of worship except He.<br />
Allaah is Great, Allaah is Great, and to Him belongs all Praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam, who never spoke of his own desire, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Three supplications are answered: the supplication of the fasting person, the supplication of the one who is oppressed and the supplication of the traveller&#8221; . [Saheeh &#8211; Reported by al-&#8216;Uqailee in ad -Du&#8217;afaa.].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, in this month of Ramadaan, there is for you a supplication which will be answered. So seize this opportunity and call profusely upon Allaah during this month, and in particular at the time of breaking the fast (iftar), since the Prophet sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam said: &#8220;Indeed there is for the fasting person when he breaks his fast, a supplication which is not rejected.&#8221; [Reported in Ibn Maajah &amp; others. Declared saheeh by al-Boosairee.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And be sure in your heart that your du&#8217;aa will be answered and know that Allaah does not respond to a heedless and inattentive heart. Call upon Him with supplications for anything good and hopefully you will attain the good of this life and the Hereafter.</p>
