<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>AL-HASAN IBN ABIL HASAN AL-BASREE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)<br />
Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“al-Hasan ibn Abil-Hasan Yasaar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imaam, Shaikhul-Islaam, Aboo Sa`eed al-Basree. It is said that he used to be a <em>mawlaa</em> (slave) belonging to Zayd ibn Thaabit, and it is said: a slave belonging to Jameel ibn Qutbah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mother was Khayrah, the slave-girl of Umm Salamah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He grew up in al-Madeenah; and memorized the Qur·aan in the Khilaafah of `Uthmaan, and heard him give the Khutbah many times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day of the killing of `Uthmaan he was fourteen years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he grew older and was constant upon Jihaad, and constant upon knowledge and action. He was one of the courageous folk who were mentioned for that…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the rule of Mu`aawiyah he was a scribe for the governor of Khuraasaan &#8211; ar-Rabee` ibn Ziyaad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He narrated from `Uthmaan, `Imraan ibn Husayn, al-Mugheerah ibn Shu`bah, `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Samurah, Samurah ibn Jundub, Jundub al- Bajalee, Ibn `Abbaas, Ibn `Umar, Aboo Bakrah, `Amr ibn Taghlib, Jaabir, and many others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him include: Qataadah, Ayyoob (as- Sakhtiyaanee), Ibn `Awn, Yoonus (ibn `Ubayd), Khaalid al-Hadhdhaa·, Hishaam ibn Hassaan, Humayd at-Taweel, Jareer ibn Haazim, Shaybaan an- Nahawee, Yazeed ibn Ibraaheem at-Tusturee, Mubaarak ibn Fadaalah, ar- Rabee` ibn Sabeeh, Abaan ibn Yazeed al-`Attars, Qurrah ibn Khaalid, and many others besides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Sa`d said: “<strong>He was a comprehensive scholar, lofty, reliable a proof, trustworthy, a worshipper, one who performed frequent acts of worship and sacrifice. He was abundant in knowledge; spoke eloquently, and was handsome</strong>”…, until he said: “He is not a proof in those narrations which he narrated in ‘<em>mursal</em>’ form, and he was a ‘<em>mudallis</em>’. So when he says ‘From..’ with regard to those he did not meet, then he is not taken as proof.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He sometimes performed ‘<em>tadlees</em>’ from those he had met, omitting the intermediary between himself and them, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However he was a great memorizer, a great scholar; from the oceans of knowledge; a jurist concerning the soul; of tremendous status; having no equal. His reminders were beautiful. His admonitions were eloquent and penetrating. He was a chief in the various types of good; and I have written a biography for him in a single volume which I have entitled <em>‘az-Zukhruful- Qasriyy</em>’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He died in the year 110 H at the age of 88 &#8211;<em>rahimahullaahu ta`aalaa</em>.” [‘Tadhkiratul-Huffaaz’: (1/71-72)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father Yasaar was a slave taken captive in Maysaan [North of Basrah, in Southern Iraaq]. He settled in al-Madeenah, and was set free, and married.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Hasan was born two years before the end of the Khilaafah of `Umar and he grew up in Waadee al-Quraa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">adh-Dhahabee said: “<strong>He was the noblest of the people of his time, in knowledge and action</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu`tamir ibn Sulaymaan said: My father used to say: “<strong>al-Hasan is the Shaikh of the people of Basrah</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He learned the recitation of the Qur·aan from Hittaan ibn `Abdillaah ar- Raqaashee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">adh-Dhahabee said: “<strong>He was a man who was of perfect build. His form was fine, and he was handsome; and he was described as being one of those who were courageous.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Burdah said: “I did not see anyone who more closely resembled the Companions of Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) than him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humayd ibn Hilaal said: Aboo Qataadah said to us: “Adhere to this Shaikh, for I have not seen anyone closer in opinion to `Umar than him &#8211; meaning al-Hasan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jurthoomah said: “I saw al-Hasan dyeing his beard yellow every Jumu`ah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said: “I never compared the knowledge of al-Hasan to that of anyone from the scholars except that I found him having superiority over him; except that if anything was problematic for him he would write to Sa`eed ibn al-Musayyib, asking him about it; and I never sat with a jurist except that I saw the superiority of al-Hasan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humayd and Yoonus said: “We did not see anyone more perfect in behavior than al-Hasan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yoonus ibn `Ubayd said: “I have not seen anyone whose speech more closely matches his actions than al-Hasan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ar-Rabee` ibn Anas said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I used to go to al-Hasan for ten years, or as Allaah wished, and there was not a single day except that I would hear from him something which I had not heard before</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hawshab narrated from al-Hasan that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O son of Aadam! By Allaah! If you recite the Qur·aan and then truly believe in it, then your grief in this world will be lengthened, your fear in this world will become severe, and your weeping in this world will be plentiful.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Siyar A`laamin-Nubalaa·’ (4/563-588)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zaa·idah ibn Qudaamah: from Hishaam ibn Hassaan: al-Hasan said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When a man used to seek knowledge, then (its effect) would soon be seen upon what he looked at, upon his humility and submission, upon his tongue, upon his ties of kinship, and upon his avoidance of the unnecessary things of the world (<em>zuhd</em>)</strong></span>.” He said: “And al-Hasan used to say: “<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Do not sit with the people of the innovated sects (<em>Ahwaa</em>·); do not debate with them; and do not listen to anything from them</span>.</strong>”</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>MUJAAHID IBN JABR</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Mujaahid ibn Jabr, the Imaam. Abul-Hajjaaj al-Makhzoomee &#8211; their mawlaa (freed-slave), al- Makkee, the reciter, the Mufassir, al-Haafiz. The slave belonging to as-Saa·ib ibn Abis-Saa·ib al-Makhzoomee. He learned from Sa`d, `Aa·ishah, Aboo Hurairah, Umm Haani·, `Abdullaah ibn `Umar, and Ibn `Abbaas and he closely accompanied him for some time, and he learnt the reading of the Qur·aan from him and Tafseer and Fiqh. He was one of the stores of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him included `Ikrimah, Taawoos, and `Ataa· &#8211; and they were his contemporaries; and `Amr ibn Deenar, Abuz-Zubayr, alHakam ibn `Utaybah, Ibn Abee Najeeh, Mansoor ibn al-Mu`tamir, Sulaymaan ibn A`mash, Ayyoob as-Sakhtiyaanee, Ibn `Awn, `Umar ibn Dharr, Ma`roof ibn Mushkaan, Qataadah ibn Di`aamah, al-Fadl ibn Maymoon, Ibraaheem ibn Muhaajir, Humayd al-A`raj, Bukayr ibn alAkhnas, al-Hasan al-Fuqaymee, Khusayf, Sulaymaan al-Ahwal, Sayf ibn Sulaymaan, `Abdul-Kareem al-Jazaree, Aboo Haseen, al-`Awwaam ibn Hawshab, Fitr ibn Khaleefah, an-Nadr ibn `Arabee, and many others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A group learned the recitation from him, including <strong>Ibn Katheer</strong> ad-Daaree, Aboo `Amr ibn al-`Alaa·, and Ibn Muhaysin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujaahid said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I read the entire Qur·aan to Ibn `Abbaas three times, stopping at each Aayah and asking what it was sent down concerning and how it was.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The most knowledgeable one remaining with regard to tafseer is Mujaahid.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Juraij said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“To have learned from Mujaahid would have been more beloved to me than my family and my wealth.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khusayf said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The most knowledgeable of them concerning tafseer is Mujaahid.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Take Tafseer from four: Mujaahid, Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, `Ikrimah, and ad-Dahhaak.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">adh-Dhahabee said: It is said that he settled in Koofah at the end of his life, and he used to frequently travel and move about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-A`mash said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“When I used to see Mujaahid I would think little of him; he would be wearing worn-out clothing, as if he were a mule-driver who had lost his donkey and was concerned about it; but when he spoke, pearls [[of wisdom]] came out from his mouth.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…A number of people said: he died in the year 103 H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Waaqidee narrated from Ibn Jurayj that he said: “He reached the age of eighty three.”…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ya`laa ibn `Ubayd: from al-A`mash: from Mujaahid that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I do not know which of the two favours is greater: that He guided me to Islaam, or that He saved me from these innovated sects.”</strong></span> [adh-Dhahabee said: Such as those of the Raafidah, the Qadariyyah, and the Jahmiyyah.”]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa ibn Sulaym said: `Abdul-Wahhaab ibn Mujaahid narrated to us, saying: I was with my father when his son Ya`qoob came and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘O my father, we have companions who claim that Eemaan of the inhabitants of the heavens and the inhabitants of the earth is one (and the same.) So he said: “O my son, those people are not my companions. Allaah does not make a person who is drowned in sins just like a person who has no sin.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Nu`aym said: Mujaahid died whilst prostrating in the year 102 H…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hibbaan said: “He died in Makkah in the year 102 or 103 H in prostration having been born in the year 21 H in the Khilaafah of `Umar.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan ath-Thawree said: “<strong><span style="color:#000000;">If tafseer comes to you from Mujaahid then that is enough for you</span></strong>.” Therefore his tafseer was relied upon by ash-Shaafi`ee, al-Bukhaaree and others from the people of knowledge, and likewise by Imaam Ahmad and others who complied works of tafseer: they repeatedly bring chains of narration from Mujaahid; more often than from anyone besides him.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>`ABDULLAAH IBN `AMR &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhumaa</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)<br />
Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah ibn `Amr ibn al-`Aas ibn Waa·il ibn Haashim ibn Sa`eed ibn Sa`d ibn Sahm ibn `Amr ibn Husays ibn Ka`b ibn Lu·ayy ibn Ghaalib, the Imaam, the great scholar, the worshipper. The Companion of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and the son of his Companion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Muhammad and it is said: Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan, and it is said: Aboo Naseer; al-Qurashee, as-Sahmee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mother was Raa·itah bint al-Hajjaaj ibn Munabbih as-Sahmiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father was no older than him except by eleven years or thereabouts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has reached us that he accepted Islaam before his father; and it is said that his name was ‘<em><strong>al-`Aas</strong></em>’ [the disobedient one], so when he accepted Islaam the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) changed it to `<strong>Abdullaah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He possessed many merits and virtues, and had a high position with regard to knowledge and action. He carried a great deal of knowledge from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was one of those who performed the <em>Hijrah</em> along with his father prior to the conquest of Makkah. His father was only eleven years older than him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) used to prefer him over his father, and in the time of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) he was a person who fasted a great deal, stood in (Night) Prayer a great deal, and recited the Qur·aan a great deal, and who sought a great deal of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wrote down a lot of knowledge from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and Aboo Hurairah acknowledged the great amount of knowledge he possessed, and said: “<strong>Because he used to write things down from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and I had not used to write</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ahaadeeth he narrates from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) reach seven hundred in number. al-Bukhaaree and Muslim were united in reporting seven of his ahaadeeth, al-Bukhaaree was alone in reporting eight, and Muslim twenty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He wrote down a great deal of narrations with the permission of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdullaah also narrated from Aboo Bakr, `Umar, Mu`aadh, Suraaqah ibn Maalik, and his father `Amr, and `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, Abud-Dardaa· and a group; also from the people of the Book, and he closely examined their books and gave attention to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a person of excellence and was earnest in his affairs, and he criticized his father for taking part in affairs in the time of tribulation; however he feared falling into the sin of disobedience if he abandoned his father, so he was therefore present at the battle of Siffeen, but he did not unsheathe a sword.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He acquired a number of the books of the People of the Book and closely examined them, and found some amazing things in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father left him a vast amount of property, and he possessed slaves and servants. He also had a garden in Taa·if called <em>al-Waht</em> that was worth a thousand thousand (1,000,000) dirhams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Egypt took a great deal of knowledge from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He passed away in Egypt in the year 65 H, during the nights of the siege of the capital &#8211;<em>al-Fustaat</em>&#8211; so when he died they were not able to take his funeral out because of the war between Marwaan ibn al-Hakam and the army of Ibn az-Zubayr. So he was buried in his home &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him included Ibn al-Musayyib, `Ikrimah, Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Hubulee, `Urwah, Wahb, Ibn Abee Mulaykah, and Aboo `Amr Shu`ayb ibn Muhammad his grandson.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him were: his son Muhammad &#8211; even though there is dispute about this, and narrations of Muhammad from him are reported in Aboo Daawood, at-Tirmidhee and an-Nasaa·ee; and his freed-slave Aboo Qaaboos, and his grandson Shu`ayb ibn Muhammad &#8211; who reported a great deal from him; and he served him and kept his company constantly, and he was brought up in his apartment because Shu`ayb’s father Muhammad died in the life time of his father `Abdullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His students were many and included: his freed-slave Ismaa`eel, and his freed-slave Saalim, and Anas ibn Maalik, Aboo Umaamah ibn Sahl, and Jubayr ibn Nufayr; and Sa`eed ibn al-Musayyib, `Urwah, Aboo Salamah ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan, Zirr ibn Hubaysh, Humayd ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, Khaythamah ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Ju`fee, Taawoos, ash-Sha`bee, `Ikrimah, `Ataa·, Mujaahid, al-Hasan al-Basree, `Abdullaah ibn Buraydah, Ibn Abee Mulaykah, `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Jubayr, `Ataa· ibn Yasaar, `Uqbah ibn Muslim, `Amr ibn Deenaar, Masrooq ibn al-Ajda`, Aboo Burdah ibn Abee Moosaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said: “He was a stout man.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hammaad ibn Salamah narrated: from `Alee ibn Zayd [[ibn Jud`aan]]: from al-`Uryaan ibn al-Haytham who said: “I came in a deputation along with my father to Yazeed. So a very tall man came. He was reddish and had a large belly. So he sat down. I said: ‘Who is this?’ So it was said: `Abdullaah ibn `Amr.”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa ibn Ayyoob narrated: from Aboo Qabeel: from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr that he said: “<strong>We used to write down what Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said in his presence.</strong>”..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[…Yoosuf ibn Maahak: from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr who said: I used to write down everything which I heard from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), wanting to memorize it. So the Quraish forbade me and said: ‘Do you write everything when Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is a man, and speaks when angry and when pleased!’ So I stopped writing, and then mentioned it to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), so he indicated with his finger to his mouth and said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Write, for by the One in Whose Hand is my soul, nothing comes out of it except what is true.</strong> &gt;&gt; (Saheeh: as-Saheehah: no. 1532)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established from `Amr ibn Deenaar: from Wahb ibn Munabbih: from his brother Hammaam that he heard Aboo Hurairah say: “<strong>No Companion of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) had more ahaadeeth than me, except for `Abdullaah ibn `Amr, because he used to write and I do not write</strong>.”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qutaybah narrated: al-Layth narrated to us, along with someone else: from `Ayyaash ibn `Abbaas: from Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Hubulee: I heard `Abdullaah ibn `Amr say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“That I should be the tenth of ten poor people on the Day of Resurrection is more beloved to me than that I should be the tenth of ten wealthy people; for those with most will be the ones with the least on the Day of Resurrection, except for those who do like this and like this: meaning: they give in charity to the right and to the left.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[al-Bukhaaree narrated in his ‘Saheeh’ (no. 5052): Moosaa narrated to us: Aboo `Awaanah narrated to us: from Mugheerah: from Mujaahid: from `Abdullaah ibn `Amr who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“My father got me married to a woman of a noble family, so he often used to ask my wife about me. So she said: ‘What a fine man he is, for a man who does not come to my bed, nor has he approached me since he married me.’ So when that continued for a long time he mentioned it to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Let me meet him</strong>. &gt;&gt; So I met him afterwards and he said: &lt;&lt; <strong>How do you observe fasting?</strong> &gt;&gt; So I replied: “I fast every day.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>How long does it take you to complete reading the Qur·aan?</strong> &gt;&gt; I said: “I do so every night.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Fast for three days every month and recite the Qur&#8217;aan once every month</strong>. &gt;&gt; I said: “I have strength to do more than that.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Then fast the most excellent fast: the fast of Daawood: Fasting one day and refraining from fasting the next day; and finish the recitation of the whole Qur·aan once in seven nights.</strong> &gt;&gt; Would that I had accepted the concession of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), as I have become a weak old man.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he used to recite one seventh of the Qur&#8217;aan to some of his family during the day to make sure that he remembered it for the night; and whenever he wanted to gain some strength he would abstain from fasting for some days, count them and fast them later on for he disliked leaving something which he used to do during the time of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I [i.e. adh-Dhahabee] say: He inherited a very great deal of Egyptian gold from his father, so he was one of the kings amongst the Companions. …`Abdullaah accepted Islaam, and migrated after the seventh year and took part in some of the battles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo `Ubayd said: “He was in command of the right flank of the army of Mu`aawiyah on the day of Siffeen.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khaleefah ibn Khayyaat mentions him as one of Mu`aawiyah’s governors of Koofah. He said: Then he removed him from that position and replaced him with al-Mugheerah ibn Shu`bah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There occurs in the ‘<em>Musnad</em>’ of Ahmad: Yazeed narrated to us: al- `Awwaam related to us: Aswad ibn Mas`ood narrated to me: from Hanzalah ibn Khuwaylid al-`Anbaree who said: “I was in the presence of Mu`aawiyah when two men came to him disputing with regard to the head of `Ammaar &#8211; <em>radiyallaahu `anhu</em>, so each one of them was saying: ‘I killed him.’ So `Abdullaah ibn `Amr said: “Each one of you should be pleased that it was his companion who killed him, and not himself, for I heard Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) say: &lt;&lt; <strong>The transgressing party will kill him</strong>. &gt;&gt; So Mu`aawiyah said: “O `Amr! Will you not spare us this crazy person of yours? Then why are you with us?!” He [i.e. `Abdullaah ibn `Amr] said: “My father made a complaint to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), so he said to me: &lt;&lt; <strong>Obey your father as long as he lives.</strong> &gt;&gt; So therefore I am with you, but I will not fight.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[‘Saheeh’: ‘as-Saheehul-Musnad’ of Shaikh Muqbil]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Naafi` ibn `Umar related: from Ibn Abee Mulaykah who said: `Abdullaah ibn `Amr &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhumaa</em>&#8211; said: <em>“What have I to do with Siffeen! What have I to do with fighting against the Muslims! I wish that I had died twenty years &#8211; or he said: ten years-before it. Yet even so, by Allaah, I did not strike a sword, nor fire any arrow”;</em> and it is mentioned that he held the flag.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Husayn al-Mu`allim related: from Ibn Buraydah: from Sulaymaan ibn ar- Rabee’ al-`Adawee: that he performed Hajj in the time of Mu`aawiyah amongst a group of the reciters: so it was told to us that `Abdullaah [ibn `Amr] is to be found in the lower part of Makkah. So we went towards him and found a very great party of people and baggage, with three hundred camels: one hundred for riding and two hundred for carrying, whereas we used to be told that he was one of the most humble of people. So we said: ‘What is all this?’ They said: ‘It is for his brothers; he conveys them, and whoever stays as a guest with him upon them.’ So we were surprised. So they said: He is a wealthy man, and they told us where to find him in the Masjidul-Haraam. So we went to him and found that he was a short man with mucus upon his eye-lids, and he was wearing a simple cloak and waistwrapper and a turban, and he let his shoes hang at his left side.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…Yahyaa ibn Bukayr said: “<strong>`Abdullaah ibn `Amr died in Egypt, and was buried in his small house, in the year 65 H.</strong>” This saying about the year of his death was also stated by Khaleefah, Aboo `Ubayd, al-Waaqidee, al- Fallaas and others.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)<br />
Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Sufyaan ibn Sa`eed ibn Masrooq, the Imaam, Shaikhul-Islaam, The chief of the memorizers, Aboo `Abdillaah, ath-Thawree: from Thawr of the tribe of Mudar, not Thawr of Hamadaan; al-Koofee, the Jurist (Faqeeh).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He narrated from his father, and from: Zubayd ibn al-Haarith, Habeeb ibn Abee Thaabit, al-Aswad ibn Qays, Ziyaad ibn `Ilaaqah, Muhaarib ibn Dithaar, and their level.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him included: Ibn al-Mubaarak, Yahyaa alQattaan, Ibn Wahb, Wakee`, al-Firyaabee, Qabeesah, Aboo Nu`aym, Muhammad ibn Katheer, Ahmad ibn Yoonus al-Yarboo`ee, and very many others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shu`bah, Yahyaa ibn Ma`een, and a group said: <strong>Sufyaan is the Chief of the Believers in Hadeeth</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Mubaarak said: <strong>&#8220;I wrote (narrations) from one thousand one hundred Shaikhs, and there was not amongst them anyone more excellent than Sufyaan.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shu`bah used to say: “<strong>Sufyaan is a better memorizer than me.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Warqaa· said: “<strong>ath-Thawree did not see the like of himself</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad said: “<strong>No one takes precedence over him in my heart</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Qattaan said: “<strong>I have never seen a better memorizer then him: if you asked him about a question or about a hadeeth which he did not possess, it would trouble him greatly</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdur-Razzaaq said: Sufyaan said: “<strong>I never stored anything in my heart and then found it letting me down</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Awzaa`ee said: “<strong>No one whom the Ummah is united upon in their being pleased with him and holding him to be correct remains except for Sufyaan</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Mubaarak said: “<strong>I do not know anyone upon the face of the earth who is more knowledgeable than Sufyaan</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wakee` said: “<strong>Sufyaan was an ocean</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Qattaan said: “<strong>Sufyaan is above Maalik in everything</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Usaamah said: “Whoever informs you that he has seen the like of Sufyaan, then do not believe him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Dhi·b said: “I have not seen in Iraaq anyone who resembles your Thawree.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ath-Thawree said: “<strong>I would love that I am saved regarding knowledge: so that it is neither for nor against me; and there is no action which I fear more for myself than it &#8211; meaning Hadeeth</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa ibn Yamaan said: I heard Sufyaan say: “<strong>The scholar is the doctor of the Religion and dirhams are the disease for the Religion. So if the doctor catches the disease, then when will he be able to treat others?!”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Khuraybee said: “I heard ath-Thawree say: <strong>“Seeking Hadeeth (itself) is not a preparation for death, rather it is an ailment which a man prescribes himself with.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (i.e. adh-Dhahabee) say: ‘He has spoken the truth, by Allaah. Seeking Hadeeth is something other than Hadeeth itself. So seeking Hadeeth is a term commonly used to cover a number of affairs which are additional to actually acquiring Hadeeth itself, and many of them are just steps towards knowledge; and most of these are affairs which the narrator of hadeeth becomes engrossed with, such as: acquiring fine manuscripts; seeking shorter chains; increasing the number of one’s Shaikhs; being overjoyed at titles and praise; and hoping for a long life so that he can narrate more; and loving to be alone in narrating something; and many affairs which are closely allied to personal goals, and not to actions for the Lord. So if your seeking the Prophetic Hadeeth is surrounded by these calamities, then when will you escape from them towards acting purely and sincerely for Allaah. Then if the knowledge of narrations can be tainted, then what do you think about the knowledge of logic, controversial debating, philosophy of the earlier peoples; which strip away Eemaan and produce doubts and throw a person into confusion. These were not, by Allaah, from the knowledge of the Companions, nor the Taabi`een, nor from the knowledge of alAwzaa`ee, ath-Thawree, Maalik, Aboo Haneefah, Ibn Abee Dhi·b, or Shu`bah; nor, by Allaah, were they known by Ibn al-Mubaarak; nor by Aboo Yoosuf who said: “Whoever seeks the Religion through rhetorical theology (al-kalaam) will become an evil heretic”; nor by Wakee`, Ibn Mahdee, Ibn Wahb, ash-Shaafi`ee, `Affaan, Aboo `Ubayd, Ibn al-Madeenee, Ahmad Aboo Thawr, al-Muzanee, al-Bukhaaree, al-Athram, Muslim, anNasaa·ee, Ibn Khuzaymah, Ibn Suraij, Ibn al-Mundhir, and their like. Rather their knowledge was the Qur·aan, the Hadeeth, Fiqh, Grammar, and the like. Yes Sufyaan also said, in what al-Firyaabee heard from him: “There is no action more excellent than seeking the Hadeeth, as long as the intention is correct regarding it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: And I heard him say: “If we wanted to narrate Hadeeth to you exactly as we heard it, then we would not narrate a single hadeeth to you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Firyaabee said: I heard Sufyaan say: “I entered upon al-Mahdee and I said: “It reached me that Ibn `Umar spent twelve deenars upon his Hajj, and you are involved in what you are involved in.” So he became angry and said: ‘Do you want me to be as you are?!’ So I said: ‘If you are not as I am, then at least reduce from what you are doing. “Damurah said: I heard Maalik say: “Iraaq used to wage war upon us with dirhams and garments, and then it waged war upon us with Sufyaan ath-Thawree.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: The virtues of this Imaam occur in a volume complied by Ibn alJawzee; and I have abridged it and brought a good quantity of that in my ‘Taareekh’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saalih Jazarah said: “Sufyaan was a greater memorizer and had more hadeeth than Maalik. However Maalik carefully selected the narrators; and Sufyaan was a greater memorizer then Shu`bah. His ahaadeeth amounted to thirty thousand, whereas the ahaadeeth of Shu`bah were about ten thousand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Sufyaan was born in the year 97 H. He began seeking Hadeeth whilst he was a youth, since his father was one of the scholars of Koofah. He (Sufyaan) died in Basrah, in hiding from al-Mahdee, since he was one who spoke out with the truth and strongly criticized. He died in Sha`baan in the year 161 H -radiyallaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentic from Ma`daan: from ath-Thawree, regarding His Saying -He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sooratul-Hadeed (57): 4]<br />
[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He is with you</strong></span>]], so he said: “His knowledge,” and this is what is reported from a group of the people of Tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Laalikaa·ee in ‘as-Sunnah’: al-Mukhallis related to us: Abul-Fadl Shu`ayb ibn Muhammad related to us: `Alee ibn Harb ibn Bassaam related to us: I heard Shu`ayb ibn Harb say: I said to Sufyaan ath-Thawree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">‘Tell me a saying about the Sunnah, through which Allaah will benefit me, and when I stand in front of Him and He asks me about it I can say: ‘O my Lord! Sufyaan told this to me.’ So that I will be saved and you will be taken.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: “Write: In the name of Allaah, the Extremely Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. The Qur·aan is the Speech of Allaah. It is not created. It came from Him, and it will return to Him. Whoever says other than this then he is an Disbeliever; and <em>Eemaan</em> is statement and action and intention, it increases and decreases; and to give precedence to the two Shaikhs [i.e. Aboo Bakr and `Umar]…” until he said: “O Shu`ayb, what you have written will not benefit you until you hold wiping over the leather socks, and until you hold reciting ‘<em>Bismillaahir-Rahmaanir-Raheem</em>’ quietly (in the Prayer) to be better than reciting it loudly; and until you have <em>Eemaan</em> in Pre-Decree (al-Qadr); and until you hold praying behind every righteous or sinful (<em>imaam</em>); and that the Jihaad continues until the Day of Resurrection; and having patience under the flag of the ruler, whether he is tyrannical or just.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">So I said: ‘O Aboo `Abdillaah, is that every Prayer?’ He said: “No, rather the <em>Jumu`ah</em> Prayer, and the two `Eid Prayers: pray them behind whoever you reach. As for the rest of that, then you have a choice, so do not pray except behind one whom you trust in, and you know that he is from the people of the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">If you stand before Allaah and He asks you about this, then say: “O my Lord, Sufyaan ibn Sa`eed related it to me; and then leave me to my Lord &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is established from Sufyaan, and the Shaikh of al-Mukhallis is reliable -may Allaah have mercy upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[‘Tadhkiratul-Huffaaz’ (1/203-207)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[For the full narration, and a longer biography of Sufyaan refer to the book ‘Mountains of Knowledge.’]]</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“`Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas ibn `Abdul-Muttalib -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- the Imaam, the ocean of knowledge, the great scholar (<em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>abr</em>) of the Ummah, and the Imaam of Tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-`Abbaas, al-Haashimee, the son of the paternal uncle of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and the father of the khulafaa· [i.e. the later `Abbaasid caliphs.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in the mountain pass of Banoo Haashim, three years before the Hijrah. He accompanied the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) for about thirty months, and Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) died when he was thirteen years old. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) supplicated for him that Allaah should grant him knowledge and understanding of the Religion, and should teach him explanation of the Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khaalid al-Hadhdhaa· said: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stroked my head and supplicated for wisdom for me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Aboo `Aasim: Shabeeb ibn Bishr related to us: `Ikrimah related to us: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) went to relieve himself, then he moved away and found a covered pot (of water), so he said: &lt;&lt; Who brought this? &gt;&gt; So `Abdullaah (ibn `Abbaas) said: “It was I”, so he said: &lt;&lt; O Allaah teach him explanation of the Qur·aan. &gt;&gt;</span></strong> [Saheeh: ‘Sharhut-Tahaawiyyah’ (no. 180), ‘as-Saheehah’ (no. 2589)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-A`mash: from `Abud-Duhaa: from Masrooq who said: Ibn Mas`ood said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“What a fine explainer of the Qur·aan is Ibn `Abbaas! If he had reached our age, then none of us would have attained a tenth of his knowledge.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-A`mash: from Aboo Waa·il:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “`Alee placed Ibn `Abbaas in charge of the Hajj, so he gave a khutbah that day which was such that if it had been heard by the Turks and the Romans they would have accepted Islaam. Then he recited Sooratun-Noor to them and began explaining it.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He narrated a good number of narrations from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and from `Umar. `Alee, Mu`aadh, his father al-`Abbaas, `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Awf, Aboo Sufyaan Sakhr ibn Harb, Aboo Dharr, Ubayy ibn Ka`b, Zayd ibn Thaabit, and a large number of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He recited Qur·aan with Ubayy (ibn Ka`b) and Zayd (ibn Thaabit). Mujaahid, Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, and a group took the recitation from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him are: his son `Alee, the son of his brother `Abdullaah ibn Ma`bad, and his freed slaves: `Ikrimah, Miqsam, and Aboo Ma`bad Naafidh; and Anas ibn Maalik, Abut-Tufayl, Aboo Umaamah ibn Sahl, and his brother Katheer ibn `Abbaas; and `Urwah ibn az-Zubayr, `Ubaydullaah ibn `Umar, Taawoos, Abush-Sha`thaa· Jaabir, `Alee ibn al- Husayn, Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, Mujaahid ibn Jabr, al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad, Aboo Saalih as-Sammaan, Aboo Rajaa· al-`Utaaridee, Abul-`Aaliyah, `Ubayd ibn `Umayr and his son `Abdullaah `Ataa· ibn Yasaar, Ibraaheem ibn `Abdullaah ibn Ma`bad, and Arbadah at-Tameemee &#8211; the companion of the ‘Tafseer’, and Aboo Saalih Baadhaam, Taleeq ibn Qays al-Hanafee, `Ataa· ibn Abee Rabaah, ash-Sha`bee, al-Hasan, Ibn Seereen, Muhammad ibn Ka`b al-Qurazee, Shahr ibn Hawshab, Ibn Mulaykah, `Amr ibn Deenaar, `Ubaydullaah ibn Abee Yazeed, Aboo Jamrah Nasr ibn `Imraan ad-Duba`ee ad-Dahhaak ibn Muzaahim, Abuz-Zubayr al-Makkee, Bakr ibn `Abdullaah al-Muzanee, Habeeb ibn Abee Thaabit, Sa`eed ibn Abil-Hasan, Ismaa`eel as-Suddee, and many others besides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And ‘at-Tahdheeb’ mentions <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>a hundred and ninety seven people who narrated from him</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-Madaa·inee: from Nu`aym ibn Hafs: that Aboo Bakr said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Ibn `Abbaas came to us in Basrah, and there was not anyone the like of him amongst the `Arabs in his body, his knowledge, his explanation , his handsomeness and his completeness.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-`Abdur-Razzaaq: from Ma`mar who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The greater part of the knowledge of Ibn `Abbaas was taken from three men: `Umar, `Alee and Ubayy ibn Ka`b &#8211;<em>radiyallaahu `anhum</em>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Aboo Bakr ibn `Ayyaash: from Muhammad ibn `Amr: from Aboo Salamah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I used to hear that a man would have a hadeeth, so I would go to him and sit until he came out. So then I would ask him; and if I had wished I could have got him to come out to me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Zaa·idah: `Abdur-Rahmaan ibn `Abdullaah ibn al-Asbahaanee related to us: that `Abdullaah ibn Shaddaad, will you not be amazed? A boy came to me after I had laid down to take the noon siesta, and said: ‘There is a man at the door requesting permission to enter.’ So I said: “He must have come for some need, so grant him permission to enter.” He said: So he entered and said: ‘Will you not inform me about that man.’ So I said: “Which man?” So he said: ‘`Alee ibn Abee Taalib: when will he be returned to life?’ So I said: “Subhaan Allaah! (I declare Allaah free of all imperfections!) When everybody in the graves is resurrected.” So he said: ‘I do not see except that you are saying the same as those stupid people.’ So I said: “Get him out or I will beat him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ma`mar: from Qataadah: from Mutarrif who said: “I heard Ibn `Abbaas say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Revising knowledge for an hour is better than spending the whole night awake (in Prayer).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His mother was Ummul-Fadl Lubaabah bint al-Haarith ibn Huzn ibn Bujayr al-Hilaaliyyah, descended from Hilaal ibn `Aamir.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a group of children; the eldest being al `Abbaas -after whom he took his kunyah; and `Alee -the father of the khulafaa· and he was the youngest of them, and al-Fadl, and Muhammad, and `Ubaydullaah, and Lubaabah and Asmaa·.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was a person who was pleasant-looking and handsome, tall in stature, imposing, complete intellect, quick in understanding, a man complete in his characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His children al-Fadl, Muhammad and `Ubaydullaah died without offspring; whereas Lubaabah produced children and descendants from her husband `Alee ibn `Abdullaah ibn Ja`far ibn Abee Taalib; and his other daughter Asmaa·, who was married to her paternal cousin `Abdullaah ibn `Ubaydullaah ibn al-`Abbaas, gave birth to Hasan and Husayn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbaas went with his parents to the place of Hijrah [al-Madeenah] in the year of the Conquest, having accepted Islaam before that. So it is established from him that he said: <strong>“I and my mother were from the weak ones (who were excused from migrating): I was a child and my mother from the women.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khaalid al-Hadhdhaa·: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) wiped my head and supplicated for wisdom for me</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[al- Bukhaaree’s narration (no. 75) is: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Once the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) embraced me and said: &lt;&lt; O Allaah bestow upon him knowledge of the Book</strong></span> &gt;&gt;.]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shihaab narrated: from `Ubaydullaah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I came riding an ass, and I was close to puberty, and Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was leading the people in Prayer in Minaa.”</strong></span> [[al-Bukhaaree: no. 492]…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Sa`eed ibn Yoonus said: Ibn `Abbaas went on military expedition to Africa with Ibn Abee Sarh; and fifteen of the people of Egypt narrated from him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo `Abdillaah ibn Mandah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“His mother was Ummul-Fadl, the sister of Ummul-Mu·mineen Maymoonah, and he was born two years before the Hijrah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was light-skinned and tall; his complexion was tinged with yellow. He was stout and he was handsome, fair of face, and he had hair up to the ears. He dyed with henna, and the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) supplicated for wisdom for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: He was the maternal cousin of Khaalid ibn al-Waleed al- Makhzoomee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa`eed ibn Saalim narrated: Ibn Jurayj narrated to us, saying: we were sitting with `Ataa· in al-Masjidul-Haraam and were speaking about Ibn `Abbaas. So `Ataa· said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I never see the moon on the fourteenth night [[i.e. when full and bright]] except that it reminds me of the face of Ibn `Abbaas.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem ibn al-Hakam ibn Abaan narrated: from his father: from `Ikrimah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When Ibn `Abbaas passed along a path-way the women in the walled gardens would say: ‘Is it musk that has gone by, or was it Ibn `Abbaas?’.”…</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hammaad ibn Salamah and others narrate: from `Abdullaah ibn `Uthmaan ibn Khuthaym: from Sa`eed ibn Jubayr: from `Abdullaah [Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I spent the night in the house of my maternal aunt Maymoonah and I placed some water for the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to take a bath, so he said: &lt;&lt; Who has placed this? &gt;&gt; So they said: ‘`Abdullaah’, so he said: &lt;&lt; O Allaah grant him knowledge of explanation, and grant him understanding of the Religion. &gt;&gt;</strong></span> [[Saheeh: Ahmad, at-Tabaraanee…]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Zur`ah ad-Dimashqee reports in his ‘Taareekh’ from Ibn `Umar that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“He [i.e. Ibn `Abbaas] is the most knowledgeable of the people regarding that which Allaah sent down to Muhammad.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Nu`aym reports in ‘<em>al-Hilyah</em>’ from Shaqeeq who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Ibn `Abbaas delivered a khutbah to us whilst he was in charge of the Hajj. So he started reciting Sooratul-Baqarah. So he would recite and then explain. So I began saying to myself: I have never seen or heard the speech of a man the like of it; if the Persians and the Romans were to hear it they would enter into Islaam. ….</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saalih ibn Rustum al-Khazzaaz narrated: from Ibn Abee Mulaykah: I accompanied Ibn `Abbaas from Makkah to al-Madeenah. So when he camped at a place he would spend half of the night standing in Prayer. So Ayyoob asked him: ‘How had his recitation used to be?’ He said: He recited:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَجَاءَتْ سَكْرَةُ الْمَوْتِ بِالْحَقِّ ۖ ذَٰلِكَ مَا كُنتَ مِنْهُ تَحِيدُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">And the stupor of death will come in truth: this is what you sought to flee from</span>]]. [Soorah Qaaf (50): 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he would recite it slowly and carefully, and be sobbing a great deal.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jurayj narrated: from Ibn Abee Mulaykah: that Ibn `Abbaas said: “The people have passed away and the apes remain.” It was said: ‘What are the ‘apes’?’ So he replied: “Those who resemble the people but are not people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taawoos narrated: from his father: from Ibn `Abbaas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Mu`aawiyah said to me: ‘Are you upon the way of `Alee?!’ So I replied: ‘No, nor upon the way of `Uthmaan. I am upon the way of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Taawoos who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I did not see anyone greater in the respect they showed to Allaah’s prohibitions than Ibn `Abbaas [and whenever I remember him I wished I would weep].</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jareer ibn Haazim narrated: from Ya`laa ibn Hakeem: from `Ikrimah: from Ibn `Abbaas who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">“When Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) passed away, I said to a man from the Ansaar: “Come let us ask questions of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) because they are many at this time.” So he said: ‘How surprising of you, O Ibn `Abbaas! Do you think that the people will come to need you, when there are amongst the people the Companions of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) those whom you see?!’ So he left that ,and I began asking. So whenever I heard that a man had a hadeeth I would go to him whilst he was taking the noon siesta. So I would place my cloak as a pillow at his door, and the wind would blow dust over me. Then the man would come out and see me and say: “O cousin of Allaah’s Messenger! Why didn’t you send a message so that I should come to you?’ So I would say: “It is more fitting that I should come to you and ask you.” So the man [of the Ansaar] remained until he found the people gathering around me, so he said ‘This youth was more intelligent than me.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdul-Malik ibn Abee Sulaymaan narrated from Sa`eed ibn Jubayr who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">“Some men of the Muhaajiroon felt that they had a grievance with `Umar because of the fact that he brought Ibn `Abbaas close to him [in gatherings] and did not do so with them; and he used to question him. So `Umar said: “Today I will show you something that will cause you to recognize his excellence.” So he asked them about this Soorah:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا جَاءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ وَالْفَتْحُ</span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">[When comes the Help of Allah (to you, O Muhammad (Peace be upon him) against your enemies) and the conquest (of Makkah)] </span><span style="color:#000080;">[Sooratun-Nasr (110)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">So some of them said: ‘It is a command from Allaah for His Prophet that when he saw them entering into Allaah’s Religion in crowds he was to praise Him and seek His forgiveness.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;">So `Umar said: ‘O Ibn `Abbaas! Speak!’ So he said: “He informed him when he was going to die. Meaning: It will be a sign for the approach of your death, so praise your Lord and seek His forgiveness.” [[So `Umar said: I do not know about it except what you have said.]]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yazeed ibn Ibraaheem narrated: from Sulaymaan al-Ahwal: from Taawoos: from Ibn `Abbaas that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Concerning a single matter I would ask thirty of the Companions of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Its chain of narration is ‘Saheeh’…]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Ikrimah: I heard Mu`aawiyah say to me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Your master [i.e. Ibn `Abbaas], by Allaah, is the most knowledgeable one of those who have died and those who are alive.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is related from `Aa·ishah that she said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The most knowledgeable person about the Hajj who remains is Ibn `Abbaas.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: And he used to hold Hajj Tamattu` as being what is essential.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">..Ibn Jurayj narrated: from Taawoos who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I did not see anyone with more piety than Ibn `Umar, nor anyone more knowledgeable than Ibn `Abbaas.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujaahid said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I never saw anyone the like of Ibn `Abbaas; and he was, at the time he died, the great scholar of this Ummaah.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-A`mash narrated: from Mujaahid who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Ibn `Abbaas used to be called ‘the ocean’ (<em>al-Bahr</em>) because of his extensive knowledge.”…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Masrooq narrated, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When I would see Ibn `Abbaas I would say: ‘He is the most handsome of the people’, and when he uttered something I would say: ‘He is the most eloquent of the people’, and when he talked I would say: ‘He is the most knowledgeable of the people.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Qaasim ibn Muhammad said: “I never saw anything futile in the gathering of Ibn `Abbaas.”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo `Awaanah narrated: from Abul-Juwayriyah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘I saw the Izaar of Ibn `Abbaas half way down his shins, or above that and he had a roman cloak upon him and he was praying.’…</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hazm said in his book ‘al-Ihkaam’: Aboo Bakr Muhammad ibn Moosaa ibn Ya`qoob ibn al-Ma·moon, one of the imaams of Islaam, gathered together the verdicts of Ibn `Abbaas in twenty volumes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The debate of Ibn `Abbaas -radiyallaahu `anhumaa- with the Khawaarijee</strong></span> which resulted in the majority of them returning from their innovation to the truth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AT-TABARAANEE reported in ‘<em>al-Mu`jamul Kabeer</em>’ (no. 10598): “Ishaaq ibn Ibraaheem ad-Dabaree narrated to us: from `Abdur-Razzaaq. Further Isnaad: And `Alee ibn `Abdil-`Azeez narrated to us: Aboo Hudhayfah Moosaa ibn Mas`ood narrated to us: both of them from `Ikrimah ibn `Ammaar that Aboo Zameel al-Hanafee narrated to us: that `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas narrated to us, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“When the (<em>Khawaarij</em>) separated themselves off in Haarooraa and gathered themselves together in some abode. So I said to `Alee: “O Ameerul Mu·mineen pray the Prayer in its earliest time so that I can then go and speak to those people.” So he said: ‘I fear for you from them.’ So I dressed in the best clothes I could and wore this Yemeni cloak. So I went to them and entered upon them whilst they were resting at the time of the start of the afternoon heat. So I entered upon a people who were such that I have never seen a people who strove harder in worship than them. Their hands were like the knees of camels, and their faces were scarred with the traces of prostration. So when I entered they said: ‘Welcome, O Ibn `Abbaas, what has brought you here?’ So he said: “I came to narrate to you from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم): the Revelation came down and they know best about its explanation.” So some of them said: ‘Don’t speak with him’ and others said: ‘Rather we will speak with him.’ He said: I said: “Tell me the criticism you have of the son of the uncle of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), his son in law, and the first of those who believed in him; and the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) are along with him.” They said: ‘We criticize him for three things.’ I said: “What are they?” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">They said: ‘The first of them is that he caused men to pass judgement in Allaah’s Religion, whereas Allaah said:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنِ الْحُكْمُ إِلَّا لِلَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">Judgement is only for Allaah</span>]].’ [Soorah Yoosuf (12): 40]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: “And what else?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"> So they said: ‘He fought but did not take any females captured as slaves girls, nor did he seize war-booty. So if the enemy were Disbelievers, then their property was lawful for us; and if they were Believers, then it was forbidden for us to shed their blood.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: I said: “And what else?” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">They said: ‘He erased his title ‘Ameerul-Mu·mineen’ (chief of the Believers), so if he is not the chief of the Believers, then he must be the chief of the Disbelievers.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: I said: “What do you think if I recite to you from the decisive Book of Allaah, and I narrate to you from the Sunnah of your Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) that which you cannot deny, will you turn back?” They said: ‘Yes’. He said: So I said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">“As for your saying that he caused men to judge in Allaah’s Religion, then He says:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَا تَقْتُلُوا الصَّيْدَ وَأَنتُمْ حُرُمٌ ۚ وَمَن قَتَلَهُ مِنكُم مُّتَعَمِّدًا فَجَزَاءٌ مِّثْلُ مَا قَتَلَ مِنَ النَّعَمِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">up to His Saying:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> يَحْكُمُ بِهِ ذَوَا عَدْلٍ مِّنكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe, do not kill game whilst in a state of ihraam; and whoever of you does that intentionally, then the penalty is a sacrifice equal to the animal killed, as adjudged by two just men among you</span>.]] [Sooratul-Maa·idah (5): Aayah 95]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">And said, with regard to a woman and her husband:</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنْ خِفْتُمْ شِقَاقَ بَيْنِهِمَا فَابْعَثُوا حَكَمًا مِّنْ أَهْلِهِ وَحَكَمًا مِّنْ أَهْلِهَا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">If you fear a breach between the husband and wife then send an arbitrator from his family and an arbitrator from her family</span>]] [Sooratun-Nisaa· (4): 35]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">I adjure you by Allaah; does the judgement of men for the sparing of their blood and their persons and rectification of relations between them have more right, or their judgement with regard to a rabbit whose price is a quarter of a dirham?” They said: ‘O Allaah: For sparing their blood and rectifying between them.’ He said: “Have you abandoned this criticism?” They said: ‘O Allaah, yes.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Then as for your saying that they fought but did not take captured females as slave-girls and did not take war-booty: then would you take your mother as a slave-girl and make lawful from her that which you make lawful regarding other then her, for in that case you would be Disbelievers; and if you claim that she [i.e. `Aa·ishah-<em>radiyallaahu `anhaa</em>] is not your mother, then you are Disbelievers and have left Islaam because Allaah -the Mighty and Majestic-says:</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">النَّبِيُّ أَوْلَىٰ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ مِنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ ۖ وَأَزْوَاجُهُ أُمَّهَاتُهُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet has more right upon the Believers than their own selves, and his wives are as their mothers</span>]] [Sooratul-Ahzaab (33): 6]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">so you are between two deviations and may choose whichever of them you please. Do you abandon this argument?” They said: ‘O Allaah, yes.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">He said: “As for your saying that he erased his title of ‘Ameerul- Mu·mineen’, then Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) called, on the day of Hudaybiyyah to write an agreement between him and them. So he said: &lt;&lt; Write: This is the judgement agreed to by Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah. &gt;&gt; So they said: ‘By Allaah, if we knew you to be Allaah’s Messenger we would not prevent you from the House, nor would we have fought against you. But rather write: Muhammad the son of `Abdullaah.’ So he said: &lt;&lt; By Allaah I am the Messenger of Allaah even if you reject me. Write, O `Alee: Muhammad the son of `Abdullaah. &gt;&gt; So Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was more excellent than `Alee. So do you abandon this criticism?” They said: ‘O Allaah, yes.’ </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">So twenty thousand of them returned and four thousand remained and were killed.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Hasan: ‘as-Saheehul-Musnad min Fadaa·ilis-Sahaabah’ of Mustafaa al- `Adawee (pp. 427-428)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn `Abbaas died in Taa·if in the year 68 H, and Muhammad ibn al- Hanafiyyah [the son of `Alee ibn Abee Taalib and Khawlah bint al- Hanafiyyah] lead the funeral prayer over him, and said: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Today the wise scholar (rabbaanee) of this Ummah has died</strong></span>.” -radiyallaahu `anhumaa.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ABOO HURAIRAH -radiyallaahu `anhu</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">(Abridged from ‘Siyar A`laamin Nubalaa·’ of Imaam adh-Dhahabee)<br />
Translated by Abu Talha Dawud Burbank <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Aboo Hurairah ad-Dawsee, al-Yamaanee, the great memorizer, the jurist, the Companion of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم): <strong>`Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Sakhr</strong> in the most well-known saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His name in the times of ignorance was <strong>`Abd-Shams</strong>. He said: “My father gave me the ‘kunyah’ of Aboo Hurairah (‘Father of the kitten’) because I used to tend some sheep and I found some wild kittens. So when he saw them and heard them he said: ‘You are the father of the cat,’ and my name was `Abd-Shams.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">at-Tabaraanee said: His mother -radiyallaahu `anhaa- was Maymoonah bint Sabeeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurairah performed hijrah and arrived at the time of the conquest of Khaybar in the seventh year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He memorized a huge amount of knowledge from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), no one else acquired as much as him. He also took from Aboo Bakr, `Umar, Ubayy ibn Ka`b and Ka`b.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who narrated from him included al-Agharr Aboo Muslim, Sa`eed ibn al-Musayyib, Basheer ibn Naheek, Hafs ibn `Aasim, Humayd ibn `AbdirRahmaan az-Zuhree, Humayd ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Himyaree, Aboo Saalih as-Sammaan, Khallaas ibn `Amr, Saalim Abul-Ghayth, Sa`eed alMaqburee -and his father Aboo Sa`eed, Sa`eed ibn Marjaanah, Salmaan alAgharr, Aboo Haazim Salaman al-Ashja`ee, Aboo Yoonus Sulaym ibn Jubayr, Sulaymaan ibn Yasaar, Shahr ibn Hawshab, Saalih mawlaa atTaw·amah, Damdam ibn Jaus, Taawoos, ash-Sha`bee, Aboo Idrees alKhawlaanee, Aboo `Uthmaan an-Nahdee, `Abdur-Rahmaan al-A`raj, Iraak ibn Khaalid, `Ikrimah, `Urwah, `Ataa·, Mujaahid, Ibn Seereen, Muhammad ibn Ziyaad al-Jumahee, Muhammad ibn Ka`b, Moosaa ibn Wardaan, Nu`aym al-Mujmir, Naafi` mawlaa Ibn `Umar, Hammaam ibn Munabbih, and a very great number of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was one of the treasure-houses of knowledge, and one of the major imaams in verdicts, along with his great dignity and excellence, his worship and his humility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhaaree said: &#8220;<strong>Eight hundred people narrated from him</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said: He was yellowish-brown, broad-shouldered, having his central incisor teeth widely spaced, he had two locks of hair and he used to dye with red dye. He was a poor man from the people of ‘as-Suffah’, he experienced hunger and need.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) his condition improved and his wealth increased, and he was a person who worshipped and remembered Allaah a great deal. He came to be the governor of al-Madeenah and deputed for Marwaan in his leadership, and he used to pass through the market of al-Madeenah with a bundle of firewood, saying: “Make room on the path for the chief”, and he used to joke -radiyallaahu `anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Qaasim ibn Nahhaas: I heard Aboo Bakr ibn Abee Daawood say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “I saw Aboo Hurairah in a dream, whilst I was in Sijjistaan and was compiling his ahaadeeth, and he had a thick beard, was brown, and was wearing coarse clothes. So I said to him: “I love you”. So he replied: “I am the first student of ahaadeeth in the world.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ismaa`eel ibn Abee Khaalid: from Qays: from Aboo Hurairah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“When I migrated to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) I said along the way: ‘Oh what a long wearing night; yet it brought about rescue from the land of Unbelief’.” He said: “And a slave belonging to me ran away. So when I came and gave the pledge of allegiance the slave appeared, so the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: &lt;&lt; This is your slave, O Hurairah. &gt;&gt; So I said: “He is free for the Face of Allaah”, so I set him free.”</span></strong> [al-Bukhaaree: (no. 2531)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ayyoob: from Muhammad: that Aboo Hurairah used to say to his daughter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Do not wear gold, because I fear for you the blazing flame.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Saalim ibn Hayyaan: from his father: from Aboo Hurairah that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I grew up as an orphan, and performed <em>Hijrah</em> as a poor man, and I used to be a hired worker for the daughter of Ghazwaan and my wages were food for my stomach and a turn upon the riding beast. So I would drive the camels along when they rode, and I would collect firewood when they stopped somewhere. So All praise is for Allaah Who gave strength and authority to the Religion and Who made Aboo Hurairah an <em>Imaam</em>.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-az-Zuhree: from Saalim: that he heard Aboo Hurairah say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“A people in the state of <em>ihraam</em> asked me about people not in the state of <em>ihraam</em> giving them as a gift some game that had been hunted, so I told them to eat it. Then I met `Umar and informed him of this, so he said: ‘If you had given them a different verdict I would have punished you’.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Qays ibn Abee Haazim: from Aboo Hurairah who said: “I came on the day of Khaybar after they had finished fighting.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ibn Seereen said: Aboo Hurairah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I would sometimes faint between the grave and the <em>minbar</em> because of severe hunger to the extent that the people would say: ‘He is possessed’, so a man would sit upon my chest. So I would raise up my head and say: “It is not what you think, it is just hunger.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ahmad narrated in his ‘Musnad’ from Aboo Katheer as-Suhaymee from Aboo Hurairah who said: Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>O Allaah make this slave of yours -meaning Aboo Hurairah- and his mother beloved to your believing servants, and make them beloved to the two of them</strong>.</span> &gt;&gt; [Muslim: (2491)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ibn Abee Dhi·b: from al-Maqburee: from Aboo Hurairah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“ I preserved two sack-fulls of knowledge from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). So as for one of them, then I distributed it amongst the people; and as for the other one, then if I had opened it, then my throat would have been cut off.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[alBukhaaree: (no. 120): Ibn Hajr said in ‘Fathul-Baaree’: The scholars understand the sack of knowledge which he did not spread to be the ahaadeeth which gave the names of the evil rulers, and their conditions, and their times; and Aboo Hurairah used to allude to some of that but not state it plainly, out of fear of them for himself.]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-al-A`mash: from Aboo Saalih as-Sammaan who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Aboo Hurairah was one of the greatest memorizers amongst the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-ash-Shaafi`ee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Aboo Hurairah was the greatest memorizer who narrated hadeeth in his time.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kahmas narrated from `Abdullaah ibn Shaqeeq who said: Aboo Hurairah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “I do not know anyone from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who memorized more of his ahaadeeth than me.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Aboo Daawood at-Tayaalisee: `Imraan al-Qattaan related to us: from Bakr ibn `Abdillaah: from Aboo Raafi`: from Aboo Hurairah that he met Ka`b and began narrating to him and asking him. So Ka`b said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I have not seen anyone who has not read the <em>Tawraat</em> having better knowledge of what is contained in it than Aboo Hurairah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Hushaym: from Ya`laa ibn `Ataa·: from al-Waleed ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan: from Ibn `Umar that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “O Aboo Hurairah: You were the one amongst us who most closely accompanied Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and the most knowledgeable of us of his ahaadeeth.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Hammaad ibn Zayd: from `Abbaas al-Jurayree: I heard Aboo `Uthmaan anNahdee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I took Aboo Hurairah as a guest for seven days; so he, his wife and his servant followed each other, dividing the night into three. One would pray and then awaken the next who would pray, and would then awaken the third.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">-Ibraaheem ibn Yoosuf related to us: Ibn Rawaahah related to us: as-Silafee related to us: Ibn al-Busree related to us: as-Sukkaree related to us: asSaffaar related to us: ar-Ramaadee related to us: `Abdur-Razzaaq related to us: Ma`mar related to us: from Muhammad ibn Ziyaad who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Mu`aawiyah used to appoint Aboo Hurairah to be the governor of alMadeenah, but if he became angry with him he would send Marwaan to replace him, but it would not be long before he would re-appoint Aboo Hurairah and remove Marwaan. So he said to a black slave: “Stand at the door and do not prevent anyone from entering except Marwaan. So the servant did so. Then later when it became the turn of Marwaan he entered and said: “We were prevented (from entry)!” So he replied: ‘‘The one having the most right that I should not deny him is you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Khuthaym ibn `Iraak narrated from his father: from Aboo Hurairah that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) had gone off to Khaybar when I came as a muhaajir to al-Madeenah. So I prayed the Dawn Prayer behind Sibaa` ibn `Urfutah whom he had left in charge and in the first rak`ah he recited Soorah Maryam, and in the other one [Sooratul-Mutaffifeen] So I said: “Woe to my father! How rare it is to find a man in the land of the Azd except that he has two measures: a measure for himself and another one to short-change the people with.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humayd ibn `Abdir-Rahmaan al-Himyaree said: “He accompanied (the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) for four years.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He suffered hunger and poverty, and adhered to the mosque. When he migrated he had a slave of his along with him but he fled and got away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hishaam: from Muhammad [i.e. Ibn Seereen] who said: we were in the presence of Aboo Hurairah [and he was wearing two linen garments dyed with red clay], and he blew his nose and wiped it upon his upper garment and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“All praise is for Allaah who has provided Aboo Hurairah with linen to blow his nose on! For I have seen a time when I would faint between the house of `Aa·ishah and the minbar because of severe hunger. So then a man would pass by and sit upon my chest </span></strong><span style="color:#000000;">[thinking that I had become possessed]</span><strong><span style="color:#000000;">. So I would raise up my head and say: “It is not what you think, it is just hunger.”</span></strong>[[al-Bukhaaree: no. 7324]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I [i.e. adh-Dhahabee] say: Those who saw him would think that he was possessed, and so sit on him to recite ‘ruqyah’ upon him, or the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…from `Aamir: from Aboo Hurairah that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “I was in as-Suffah </strong>[[a shaded place at the rear of the mosque of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) where the poor and those with no accommodation would stay]]<strong> so Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) sent some `Ajwah dates to us, so we would take two dates together because of our hunger; and when one of us wanted to take two dates at a time he would say to his companion: I am taking two dates at a time, so do likewise.”</strong></span>[[‘as-Saheehah’: 2323]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mujaahid narrated: that Aboo Hurairah used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"> “By Allaah, besides Whom none has the right to be worshipped, I used to lay down on the ground resting upon my liver because of hunger, and I used to tie a stone upon my belly because of hunger. One day I sat by the way where the people would come out, and Aboo Bakr passed by. So I asked him about an Aayah from the Book of Allaah, and I only asked him so that he would satisfy my hunger, but then he carried on and did not do so. Then `Umar passed by me and so I asked him about an Aayah from the Book of Allaah, and I only asked him so that he would satisfy my hunger, but then he carried on and did not do so. Then Abul-Qaasim (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) passed by me and smiled when he saw me and recognized what was in my heart and on my face. He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I replied: “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Follow me</strong> &gt;&gt;. So he proceeded and I followed him, and he entered his house. So I requested permission to enter and was admitted. So he entered and found some milk in a bowl. So he said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Where is this milk from?</strong> &gt;&gt; So they said: ‘It was presented as a gift by such and such man, or such and such woman.’ He said: &lt;&lt;<strong> O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I said: “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah!” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>go to the people of ‘Suffah’ and call them to me</strong> &gt;&gt; and the people of ‘Suffah’ were the guests of Islaam: they did not have families, wealth or any person to support them. So whenever some charity came to him he would send it to them, and he would not take anything from it himself; and whenever something was sent to him as a gift he would send something to them and take some of it himself, and cause them to share in it. So his order upset me and I said (to myself): ‘How will this small quantity of milk be enough for the people of ‘as-Suffah’?!’ I felt I was more entitled to drink from that milk in order to strengthen myself by it. But if they came, then he would command me to give it to them; and then what would remain of that milk for me?!’ However I could not but obey Allaah and obey His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). So I went to them and invited them and they came. So they sought permission to enter and he admitted them. So they took their seats in the house. He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I said “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah!” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Take it and give it to them</strong>. &gt;&gt; So I took it and started by giving it to one man who drank until he was full, and then he returned it to me. Then I gave it to the next man who drank until he was full and then returned it to me, until I came to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and all of the people had drank until they were full. So he took the bowl and placed it upon his hand, then he looked at me and smiled, and said: &lt;&lt; <strong>O Aboo Hirr!</strong> &gt;&gt; I said: “At your service, O Messenger of Allaah!” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>There remain I and you</strong>. &gt;&gt; I said: “You have spoken the truth, O Messenger of Allaah.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Sit down and drink.</strong> &gt;&gt; So I sat down and drank. He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Drink!</strong> &gt;&gt; So I drank, and he kept on saying: “Drink!” until I said: “No, by the One Who sent you with the truth, I have no more room for it.” He said: &lt;&lt; <strong>Hand it to me</strong>. &gt;&gt; So I gave him the bowl, and he praised Allaah and mentioned Allaah’s Name upon it and drank the remainder.”</span> [al-Bukhaaree: (no. 6452)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…Aboo Katheer as-Suhaymee and his name was Yazeed ibn `AbdirRahmaan narrated: that Aboo Hurairah narrated to me, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“By Allaah, Allaah has not created a true Believer who hears of me except that he loves me.” I said: ‘How do you know that?’ He said: “My mother was a Mushrik woman, and I used to call her to Islaam but she would not accept it from me. So I called her one day but she said something disagreeable to me about Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). So I went to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and I was weeping. So I informed him and asked him to supplicate for her, so he said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#808000;">O Allaah guide the mother of Aboo Hurairah</span>.</span> &gt;&gt; So then I went out running to give her the good news. So I arrived and the door was closed and I heard the splashing of water, and she heard the sound of my footsteps. So she said: ‘Wait as you are!’ Then she opened the door, and she had put her gown on, and had been too hasty to put on her khimaar. So she said: ‘I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His Slave and His Messenger.’ He said: “So I went back to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) weeping with joy just as I had wept from sorrow, and I informed him, and I said: “Make supplication to Allaah that he should cause me and my mother to be beloved to His believing servants. So he said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;">O Allaah make this slave of Yours and his mother beloved to Your believing servants, and cause them to be loved by these two</span>. &gt;&gt;” &#8211;</strong></span>“Its chain of narration is ‘hasan’.” [[Reported by Ahmad (2/319-320), and Muslim (no. 2491)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shihaab: from Sa`eed [Ibn al-Musayyib] and Aboo Salamah: that Aboo Hurairah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “You people say that ‘Aboo Hurairah narrates too many ahaadeeth from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)! And you say that why is it not the case that the <em>Muhaajiroon</em> and the <em>Ansaar</em> do not narrate like him!’ But my brothers from the <em>Muhaajiroon</em> were busy in the markets, and my brothers from the <em>Ansaar</em> were busy working upon their property. But I was a poor man from the poor people of ‘<em>as-Suffah</em>’. I used to adhere to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and be content with what filled my stomach. So I would be present when they were absent, and remember when they would forget; and Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said to us one day: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;">No one will spread out his garment till I have finished what I am saying, and then gather his garment upon himself except that he will preserve whatever I say</span>. &gt;&gt; So I spread out a striped cloak which I had upon me until he finished what he was saying, and then gathered it upon my chest. So I did not forget anything from that narration.”</span></strong> [[al-Bukhaaree (no. 2047) and Muslim (no. 2492)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">az-Zuhree, also: from al-A`raj: from Aboo Hurairah who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “You claim that I narrate excessively from Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)! Whereas the truth is known by Allaah. I was a poor man who accompanied Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and contented myself with whatever filled my stomach. So he narrated to us one day and said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#808000;">Whoever will spread out his garment, will never forget anything which he heard from me.</span> &gt;&gt; So I did so, and by the One Who sent him with the truth I have never forgotten anything which I heard from him.”</span></strong> [[al-Bukhaaree (nos. 118 &amp; 2350); Muslim (no. 2492)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…al-Maqburee: from Aboo Hurairah who said: I said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O Messenger of Allaah who will be the most fortunate of people to attain your intercession?” He said: &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#808000;"> I thought that none would ask me about this before you, because I have seen your eagerness upon learning hadeeth: The most fortunate of the people to attain my intercession on the day of resurrection will be whoever says: ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah’, sincerely from his heart</span>. &gt;&gt;</strong></span> [[al-Bukhaaree (no. 99)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ash-Shaafi`ee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Aboo Hurairah was the best memorizer of those who narrated hadeeth in his time</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…from Hammaam [ibn Munabbih] who said: I heard Aboo Hurairah say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no one from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who has more hadeeth than me, except for `Abdullaah ibn `Amr because he used to write, whereas I did not write.”</strong></span> [[al-Bukhaaree (no. 113)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Abdul-Waahid ibn Ziyaad and others: `Aasim ibn Kulayb narrated to us: My father narrated to us that he heard Aboo Hurairah, and he used to begin narrating hadeeth by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: &lt;&lt; Who ever lies upon me deliberately, then let him take his place in the Fire. &gt;&gt;”</strong></span> [[Ahmad: (2/413)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…from Ibn `Umar that he said to Aboo Hurairah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Aboo Hurairah! You were the one from us who most closely adhered to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and the one from us who best memorized his ahaadeeth</strong></span>.” [[‘Saheeh Sunanit-Tirmidhee (no. 3836)]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aboo Hurairah passed away in the year 58 H, and this was stated by a group; and others said: 59 H; and it was said: 57 H -radiyallaahu `anhu- at the age of 78.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Rebelling with the Sword and Performing <em>Takfeer</em>Due to Major Sins<br />
Taken from ‘Al-Kabair’ The Major Sins<br />
By Imaam ad-Dhahabi<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p><strong>The Major Sin – Forty-Nine</strong></p>
<p>Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;<strong>… but transgress not the limits. Truly, Allaah does not like the transgressors.</strong> &gt;&gt; [al-Baqarah: 190]</p>
<p>Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; <strong>And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in clear misguidance.</strong> &gt;&gt; [Ahzaab: 36]</p>
<p><strong>316-</strong> The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: “Whoever says to his Muslim brother, O <em>Kafir</em> (disbeliever)!’ Then verily it returns to one of them.”[1]</p>
<p>There are many narrations which describe the Khawarij, and the people differed in performing <em>Takfeer</em> (taking people out of the fold of Islaam) upon them, since the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said about them:  “they will go out from (leave) their religion as an arrow goes out of the game. So, where-ever you find them, kill them.“[2]</p>
<p><strong>318 &#8211;</strong> The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said about them: “They are the most evil of those killed under the sky, and the best person killed is the one who is killed by them.”[3]</p>
<p>So the Khawarij are the people of <em>Bida’</em>, they make it <em>Halaal</em> to take the blood of people, and they perform <em>Takfeer</em>. They performed<em>Takfeer</em> upon ‘Uthmaan and ‘Alee and of a group from the pre-eminent Companions- may Allaah be pleased with all of them.</p>
<p><strong>319</strong>&#8211; Ishaaq al-Azzraq, on the authority of al-‘Amash, on the authority of Ibn Abu ‘Awfaa <em>&#8211; radiAllaah anhu-</em> who said:</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> say: The Khawaarij are the dogs of the Hell-fire.[4]</p>
<p><strong>320-</strong> Hashraj bin Nubaatata, said Sa’eed bin Jumhaan narrated to me that he said: I entered upon Ibn Abu ‘Awfaa and he was blind, and he said: who are you?</p>
<p>I said: Sa’eed bin Jumhaan.</p>
<p>He said: What happened to your father?</p>
<p>I said: The al-Azzariqa (who are a sect from the Khawarij) killed him.</p>
<p>He said: May Allaah kill the al-Azzariqa! Then he said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; SallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> narrated to us that they are the dogs of the hell fire.</p>
<p>I asked: only the al-Azzariqa?</p>
<p>He said: All the Khawarij.[5]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Al-Kabair’ The Major Sins<br />
By Imaam ad-Dhahabi<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Major sin – Twenty-Five</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The One Who Commits Suicide which is from the Greatest of Sins</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’aala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And do not kill yourselves, indeed Allaah is Most Merciful to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire, and that is easy for Allaah. If you avoid the major sins which you are forbidden to do, We shall remit from you your (small) sins, and admit you to a Noble Entrance (i.e. Paradise). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’aala says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And those who invoke not any other ilâh (god) along with Allaah, nor kill such life as Allaah has forbidden……&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">191 – Narrated by Jundub ibn Abdullaah <em>radiAllaah anhu</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said, “Amongst the nations before you was a man who had a wound, and growing impatient (with its pain), he took a knife and cut his hand with it and the blood did not stop until he died. Allaah said, ‘My Slave hurried to bring death upon himself so I have forbidden him (to enter) Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon by Bukhari &amp; Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">192 – Narrated Abu Huraira <em>radiAllaah anhu</em> who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever kills himself with an iron weapon, will be carrying that weapon in his hand and stabbing his abdomen with it in the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever. and whoever drinks poison and kills himself with it, he will be carrying his poison in his hand and drinking it in the (Hell) Fire wherein he will abide eternally forever; “</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon by Bukhari &amp; Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">193 – In an authentic hadeeth: A person was wounded, he hurried death and killed himself with the tip of his sword, the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: “He is from the people of the fire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">194 – It is narrated on the authority of Yahya bin Abee Katheer, on the authority of Abee Qilaaba, on the authority of Thabit bin al-Dahhak:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>  said : “Cursing a believer is like killing him, and whoever accuses a believer of <em>Kufr</em> then he is like his killer, and he who killed himself with something in this world then Allaah will punish him with that (very thing) on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Authentic hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>
