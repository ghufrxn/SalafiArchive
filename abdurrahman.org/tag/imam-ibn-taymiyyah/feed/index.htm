										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Introduction to Tafseer – Ibn Taymiyyah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)<br />
Taken from Tafseer Soorat-in-Naba’<br />
Compiled and translated by Abu Talhah (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His aid, and we ask for His forgiveness. We seek Allaah’s refuge from the evils of our selves and from the evil consequences of our deeds. Whomever Allaah guides then none can misguide him, and whomever He misguides then none can guide him. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, having no partner; and I testify that Muhammad is his Slave and His Messenger.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ حَقَّ تُقَاتِهِ وَلَا تَمُوتُنَّ إِلَّا وَأَنتُم مُّسْلِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Meaning: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe in Allaah and His Messenger! Fear and be dutiful to Allaah, by obeying Him and avoiding disobedience to Him, as He deserves to be feared </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Obey Him and do not disobey Him; give thanks to Him and do not show ingratitude; remember Him and do not forget Him)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">; and do not die except as Muslims: obediently submitting to Him, and worshipping Him alone</span></strong>.] [Soorah Aali `Imraan (3): 102]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اتَّقُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُم مِّن نَّفْسٍ وَاحِدَةٍ وَخَلَقَ مِنْهَا زَوْجَهَا وَبَثَّ مِنْهُمَا رِجَالًا كَثِيرًا وَنِسَاءً ۚ وَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ الَّذِي تَسَاءَلُونَ بِهِ وَالْأَرْحَامَ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلَيْكُمْ رَقِيبًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Mankind! Fear and be dutiful to your Lord, Who alone created you from a single person</strong> (Aadam)<strong>, and from him He created his mate, and from these two He produced many men and women; and fear and be dutiful to Allaah through Whom you ask each other for your rights, and beware of cutting ties of kinship. Allaah is ever a Watcher over you</strong></span>.]] [Sooratun-Nisaa· (4): 1]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اتَّقُوا اللَّهَ وَقُولُوا قَوْلًا سَدِيدًا &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">يُصْلِحْ لَكُمْ أَعْمَالَكُمْ وَيَغْفِرْ لَكُمْ ذُنُوبَكُمْ ۗ وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ فَازَ فَوْزًا عَظِيمًا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe in Allaah and His Messenger! Fear and be dutiful to Allaah and speak with truth and justice, and He will rectify your deeds for you and forgive your sins; and whoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger has attained tremendous success</strong></span>.]] [Sooratul-Ahzaab (33): 70-71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>To proceed:</strong></span> Then the truest speech is the Book of Allaah -the Most High, and the best way is the way of Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم); and the worst of affairs are those things which are new introductions (into the Religion) and every new introduction is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance, and all misguidance will be in the Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Ummah (the Islamic nation) has a great and pressing need to understand the Qur·aan, which is the strong Rope of Allaah, and the wise Reminder; one who follows it will not be led astray by desires, and it will not become confused upon the tongues. It does not become dull through repetition, its wonders never cease, and the scholars can never have enough of it. Whoever speaks in accordance with it will speak the truth, whoever acts in accordance with it will be rewarded; whoever judges by it has judged justly, and whoever calls to it then he invites to the straight path. Whichever tyrant abandons it then Allaah will break him, and whoever seeks guidance in other than it then Allaah will misguide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِمَّا يَأْتِيَنَّكُم مِّنِّي هُدًى فَمَنِ اتَّبَعَ هُدَايَ فَلَا يَضِلُّ وَلَا يَشْقَىٰ &#8211; وَمَنْ أَعْرَضَ عَن ذِكْرِي فَإِنَّ لَهُ مَعِيشَةً ضَنكًا وَنَحْشُرُهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أَعْمَىٰ &#8211; قَالَ رَبِّ لِمَ حَشَرْتَنِي أَعْمَىٰ وَقَدْ كُنتُ بَصِيرًا &#8211; قَالَ كَذَٰلِكَ أَتَتْكَ آيَاتُنَا فَنَسِيتَهَا ۖ وَكَذَٰلِكَ الْيَوْمَ تُنسَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Then if guidance comes to you from Me, then whoever follows My Guidance shall not go astray and he shall not be wretched; but whoever turns away from My Reminder then he shall have a bleak and constricted life, and on the Day of Resurrection We shall raise him up blind. He will say: ‘O my Lord! Why have you raised me up blind when I used to have sight in the world?’ He will say: ‘Thus it is: Our signs came to you and you turned away from and abandoned them, and so this Day you shall be abandoned</strong></span>.]] [Soorah TaaHaa (20): 123-126]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> قَدْ جَاءَكُمْ رَسُولُنَا يُبَيِّنُ لَكُمْ كَثِيرًا مِّمَّا كُنتُمْ تُخْفُونَ مِنَ الْكِتَابِ وَيَعْفُو عَن كَثِيرٍ ۚ قَدْ جَاءَكُم مِّنَ اللَّهِ نُورٌ وَكِتَابٌ مُّبِينٌ &#8211;  يَهْدِي بِهِ اللَّهُ مَنِ اتَّبَعَ رِضْوَانَهُ سُبُلَ السَّلَامِ وَيُخْرِجُهُم مِّنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ بِإِذْنِهِ وَيَهْدِيهِمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There has come to you Our Messenger Muhammad </strong>(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)<strong>, explaining to you much of that which you used to hide from the Scripture, and overlooking much. There has come to you from Allaah a light and a clear Book. By it Allaah guides those who seek His Pleasure to the path which leads to safety and salvation; and He brings them out of darkness into the light, by His Permission, and He guides to the Straight Path</strong></span>.]] [Sooratul-Maa·idah (5): 15-16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الر ۚ كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ لِتُخْرِجَ النَّاسَ مِنَ الظُّلُمَاتِ إِلَى النُّورِ بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِمْ إِلَىٰ صِرَاطِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ &#8211; اللَّهِ الَّذِي لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Alif Laam Raa. This is a book which We have sent down to you, in order that you might lead mankind out of darkness into light, by the permission of their Lord, to the path of the All-Mighty, the One worthy of all praise: Allaah, to Whom belongs everything that is in the heavens and in the earth</strong></span>.]] [Soorah Ibraaheem (14): 1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ رُوحًا مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا ۚ مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِي مَا الْكِتَابُ وَلَا الْإِيمَانُ وَلَٰكِن جَعَلْنَاهُ نُورًا نَّهْدِي بِهِ مَن نَّشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا ۚ وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهْدِي إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطِ اللَّهِ الَّذِي لَهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ ۗ أَلَا إِلَى اللَّهِ تَصِيرُ الْأُمُورُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And likewise We have revealed this Qur·aan to you, as a mercy, by Our Command. You did not know what the Book is, nor what is Faith. But We have made it a light by which We guide whomever We wish from Our servants. And you certainly guide Our servants towards the Straight Path: the Path of Allaah, to Whom belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is in the earth. Certainly all affairs shall return to Allaah for judgement</strong></span>.]] [Sooratush-Shooraa (42): 52-53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230; It is binding that a person should know that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) explained the meaning of the Qur·aan to his Companions, just as he made clear to them its Words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His Saying -He the Most High:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ </span></h3>
<p>[Sooratun-Nahl (16): 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We sent down this Qur·aan to you, O Muhammad </strong>(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)<strong>, as a reminder to them, so that you should then explain clearly to the people what has been sent down to them</strong></span>][1] includes both this and that [i.e. the Words and the meaning.]]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Aboo `Abdir-Rahmaan as-Sulamee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Those who taught us the recitation of the Qur·aan, such as `Uthmaan ibn `Affaan, `Abdullah ibn Mas`ood, and others, when they had learned ten Aayahs from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), would not go beyond them until they had learned what they contained from knowledge and action. They said: So we learned the Qur·aan, and knowledge, and action, together.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore they used to remain for a period of time learning a Soorah, and Anas said: “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>When a man had learned </strong>[Soorah] <strong>al-Baqarah and </strong>[Soorah] <strong>Aali `Imraan he attained stature in our eyes</strong></span>” [3], and Ibn `Umar took some years to learn al-Baqarah, it is said that it was eight years; Maalik mentioned it. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that was because Allaah -the Most High- has said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">كِتَابٌ أَنزَلْنَاهُ إِلَيْكَ مُبَارَكٌ لِّيَدَّبَّرُوا آيَاتِهِ </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This Qur·aan is a Book which We have sent down to you, full of blessings, so that they may reflect upon its Aayahs</strong></span>.]] { [Soorah Saad (38): 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَلَا يَتَدَبَّرُونَ الْقُرْآنَ ۚ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Will they not carefully reflect upon the Qur·aan?</strong></span>]]<br />
[Sooratun-Nisaa· (4): 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَلَمْ يَدَّبَّرُوا الْقَوْلَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Have they not reflected upon the Qur·aan?</strong></span>]]<br />
[Sooratul-Mu·minoon (23): 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And carefully reflecting upon speech is not possible without understanding its meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَاهُ قُرْآنًا عَرَبِيًّا لَّعَلَّكُمْ تَعْقِلُونَ</span></h3>
<p>[Soorah Yoosuf (12): 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">We have sent it down as an Arabic Qur·aan, in order that you may comprehend its meaning]]</span></strong>, and comprehending speech includes understanding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also known that what is intended from all speech is that its meaning be understood, not just its wording, so the Qur·aan has more right to that; and also the normal behaviour of the people prevents them from reading a book in any field of knowledge, be it medicine or mathematics, and then not seeking necessary explanation of it. So how about the Speech of Allaah, which is their essential safeguard, and through which they are to attain salvation and bliss, and by means of which their Religion and their worldly lives are correctly established?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why disagreement amongst the Companions with regard to the tafseer of the Qur·aan was extremely rare; and even though it occurred more amongst the Taabi`een (the Successors of the Companions) than it did amongst the Companions, then still it was little in comparison to what occurred with those who came after them. So the more excellent a time was, then the greater the unity, the harmony, the knowledge, and the clarity of understanding was in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the Taabi`een there were those who learned the whole tafseer from the Companions, just as Mujaahid said: “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>I went through the whole mus-haf with Ibn `Abbaas, stopping him at every Aayah and asking him about it</strong></span>.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore ath-Thawree said: “<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>If tafseer comes to you from Mujaahid, then it will suffice you</strong></span>.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore his tafseer was relied upon by ash-Shaafi`ee, al-Bukhaaree, and others from the people of knowledge; and likewise Imaam Ahmad, and others who wrote works of tafseer, would repeatedly quote chains of narration from Mujaahid, more so than from others besides him. So what is intended is that the Taabi`een took the tafseer from the Companions, just as they took knowledge of the Sunnah from them&#8230;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Tafseer, then the people who were most knowledgeable about it were the people of Makkah, since they were the students of Ibn `Abbaas, such as: <strong>Mujaahid</strong>, `<strong>Ataa· ibn Abee Rabaah</strong>, `<strong>Ikrimah</strong>-the freed slave of Ibn `Abbaas, and others from the students of Ibn `Abbaas, such as: <strong>Taawoos</strong>, <strong>AbushSha`thaa</strong>·, <strong>Sa`eed ibn Jubayr</strong>, and their like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the people of al-Koofah, from the students of Ibn Mas`ood, and they had distinction in some of that over others; and the scholars of tafseer from the people of al-Madeenah, such as Zayd ibn Aslam &#8211; whom Maalik took tafseer from, and likewise his [i.e. Zayd’s] son `Abdur-Rahmaan took it from him (also), and `Abdullaah ibn Wahb took it from `AbdurRahmaan&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in summary, whoever turns away from the positions of the Companions and the Taabi`een, and their tafseer, in favour of something contrary to that, then he is in error in doing that, indeed he is an innovator; unless if he is performing legitimate ijtihaad, in which case his error is forgiven&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if someone were to say: ‘<strong>What is the best approach with regard to Tafseer?</strong>’ Then the answer is that the most correct approach is to explain the Qur·aan with the Qur·aan. So what has been left unspecified at one place will be explained at another place, and what is mentioned briefly at one point will be detailed elsewhere&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you become unable to do that, then take hold of the Sunnah, for the Sunnah explains and clarifies the Qur·aan&#8230;, and when we do not find the tafseer in the Qur·aan, nor in the Sunnah, then we refer back for that to the sayings of the Companions, for they knew best about it because of what they actually witnessed relating to the Qur·aan, and because of the circumstances particular to them, and because of their complete understanding, their correct knowledge, and their righteous deeds&#8230; And if you do not find the tafseer in the Qur·aan, nor in the Sunnah, nor do you find it from the Companions, then many of the imaams refer back in that case to the statements of the Taabi`een, such as Mujaahid ibn Jabr&#8230; and such as Sa`eed ibn Jubayr, `Ikrimah-the freed slave of Ibn `Abbaas, `Ataa· ibn Abee Rabaah, al-Hasan al-Basree, Masrooq ibn al-Ajda`, Sa`eed ibn alMusayyib, Abul-`Aaliyah, ar-Rabee` ibn Anas, Qataadah, ad-Dahhaak ibn Muzaahim, and others from the Taabi`een, and those who succeeded them, and those who came after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So their sayings are mentioned with regard to an Aayah, and the wordings which they used may differ, and so one who has no knowledge may think that they are disagreements, when this is not actually the case. So some of them may refer to something by mentioning that which it necessitates, or by mentioning that which corresponds to it, and some of them may state the actual thing itself; and all of these actually have the same meaning, and this occurs in many places, so let the discerning person be alert to this; and Allaah is the One Who guides.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] as-Suyootee quoted in his ‘<em>Miftaahul-Jannah fil-I`tisaam bis-Sunnah</em>’ (p. 58): “Ibn Mas`ood said, as reported by Ibn Abee Haatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is nothing except that it has been made clear to us in the Qur·aan, however our understanding falls short of reaching it, so therefore He -the Most High- said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ وَالزُّبُرِ ۗ وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ وَلَعَلَّهُمْ يَتَفَكَّرُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[[Meaning: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So that you, O Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), should then explain clearly to the people what has been sent down to them</strong></span>]].’ { [Sooratun-Nahl (16): 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] as-Suyootee quoted in his ‘<em>Miftaahul-Jannah fil-I`tisaam bis-Sunnah</em>’ (2/437): “at-Tabaree reported it in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/60), and as-Samarqandee in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/71) and Ibn Sa`d in ‘at-Tabaqaat’ (6/172), and Ibn Abee Shaybah in ‘al-Musannaf’:..6/117, and its chain of narration contains `Ataa· ibn as-Saa·ib:Sadooq (truthful), whose memory deteriorated; however the narrator from him is Hammaad ibn Zayd, as occurs in ‘as-Siyar’ (4/269), and his narrations from him are good&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Reported by Imaam Ahmad (3/120). Shu`ayb al-Arnawoot said in his checking of the ‘Musnad’ (no. 12236): “Its chain of narration is ‘saheeh’ to the standard of the two Shaikhs.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Imaam Maalik stated in his ‘Muwatta·’ (1/205) that it had reached him (balaaghan) that `Abdullaah ibn `Umar had remained for eight years learning Sooratul-Baqarah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Fawwaaz Ahmad Zumarlee said in his checking of as-Suyootee’s ‘<em>al-Itqaan</em>’ (2/473): “It was reported in ‘al-Hilyah’ (3/280)..; and it was reported by at-Tabaree in his ‘Tafseer’(1/65), and Aboo Nu`aym in ‘al-Hilyah’ (3/279-280); and its chain of narration contains Muhammad ibn Ishaaq who narrated it with both of them with `an`anah (without stating that he had heard it directly from the narrator before him); however it has another chain of narration which supports it, since it was also reported by al-Qaasim ibn Sallaam in ‘Fadaa·ilul-Qur·aan’ (p. 216), and by Ahmad in ‘al-Fadaa·il’ (no. 1866), and its chain of narration contains Ibn Abee Najeeh, who reported a great amount from Mujaahid; but he would narrate from him things that he had not heard directly from him. Refer to ‘Tabaqaatul-Mudalliseen’ (p. 9).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Reported by at-Tabaree in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/65).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800080;">Taken from ‘Muqaddimah fee Usoolit-Tafseer’ (pp. 43-47, 71-72, 91, 93-94, 96, 100-101) of Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah; and it occurs in ‘Majmoo`ul-Fataawaa’ (13/329-375).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;">This is a treatise that is found in ‘Fataawaa’ of Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah. The book discusses: the diseases of the hearts and their cures; the diseases of envy, and the diseases of desire and envy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Know O beloved reader that it is most important to spend one&#8217;s time and energy in treating the heart, and hastening to correct and purify it from sickness and all sins. This is due to the heart occupying a great and lofty position in Islaam, for it is the place to which the Lord looks and the storehouse for tawheed, faith, and sincerity. Actions are distinguished, one from the other, with respect to their excellence in the Sight of Allah in accordance with the condition of the heart, not by their number or form, but rather due to the strength of the caller, his or her truthfulness, his or her sincerity and the extent to which he or she prefers Allah over himself or herself &#8230;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh ibn Hajr al-Asqalaanee, may Allah have mercy upon him and provide us with his knowledge, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;The heart has been singled out for this because it is the leader of the body, and through the purification of the leader the subjects become purified, and with his corruption they become corrupted. So if you, O servant of Allah, with to cure your heart then it is upon you to be truthful with regards to seeking refuge with Allah and putting your trust in Him, to pray a great deal of superogatory prayers, to perform the actions of obedience to Allah frequently, to pray the night prayer while the people are sleeping, and to treat your heart by making it continuously stick to the remembrances and by befriending only the righteous &#8230; and to frequently recite the Qur&#8217;an. And Allah will indeed allow all of this to be preserved by him.&#8221;</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allāh have mercy on him, described a <strong>29 day schedule</strong> for completing recitation of the Qur&#8217;ān closer to the way the Companions did that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;&#8230;Division by complete surahs takes precedence over division by parts [based on letter count].&#8221; (412)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the great advantages of division by complete surahs, he mentioned (414):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· Reciting speech whose parts are connected, one part with another;<br />
· Beginning [one&#8217;s daily recitation] with that which Allāh began a surah with;<br />
· Finishing with that which He finished with;<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Neither Wealthy, Nor Knowledge of the Unseen, Nor an Angel<br />
By Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah-</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Translated By Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قُلْ لَا أَقُولُ لَكُمْ عِنْدِي خَزَائِنُ اللَّهِ وَلَا أَعْلَمُ الْغَيْبَ وَلَا أَقُولُ لَكُمْ إِنِّي مَلَكٌ إِنْ أَتَّبِعُ إِلَّا مَا يُوحَى إِلَيَّ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say (O Muhammad): “I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration.”</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [Soorah Ana’am : 50]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) -Rahimullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the Messenger –sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam– was ordered to free himself from claiming these three things with Allaah’s statement &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say : ‘I don’t tell you that with me are the treasures of Allaah, nor (that) I know the unseen; nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me by inspiration.’</span></strong> &gt;&gt; This is also what Nuh -alayhi as-Salam- said and he was the first of the main Messengers, the first Messenger&nbsp;[1] whom Allaah Ta’ala sent to the people of the earth. Here, too now, is the seal of the Messengers and the seal of the main Messengers and they have both freed themselves from this claim. This is because people sometimes seek knowledge of the unseen from the Messenger–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, as in the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَيَقُولُونَ مَتَى هَذَا الْوَعْدُ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">They say: “When will this promise (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) come to pass? if you are telling the truth.”</span> </strong>&gt;&gt; [Mulk:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>يَسْأَلُونَكَ عَنِ السَّاعَةِ أَيَّانَ مُرْسَاهَا قُلْ إِنَّمَا عِلْمُهَا عِنْدَ رَبِّي</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>They ask you about the Hour (Day of Resurrection): “When will be its appointed time?” Say: “The knowledge thereof is with my Lord (Alone)</strong></span>. &gt;&gt; [al-Aa’raaf: 187]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also they sometimes seek this knowledge to be persuaded of the truth, as in the saying of Allaah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَقَالُوا لَنْ نُؤْمِنَ لَكَ حَتَّى تَفْجُرَ لَنَا مِنَ الْأَرْضِ يَنْبُوعًا () أَوْ تَكُونَ لَكَ جَنَّةٌ مِنْ نَخِيلٍ وَعِنَبٍ فَتُفَجِّرَ الْأَنْهَارَ خِلَالَهَا تَفْجِيرًا () أَوْ تُسْقِطَ السَّمَاءَ كَمَا زَعَمْتَ عَلَيْنَا كِسَفًا أَوْ تَأْتِيَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْمَلَائِكَةِ قَبِيلًا () أَوْ يَكُونَ لَكَ بَيْتٌ مِنْ زُخْرُفٍ أَوْ تَرْقَى فِي السَّمَاءِ وَلَنْ نُؤْمِنَ لِرُقِيِّكَ حَتَّى تُنَزِّلَ عَلَيْنَا كِتَابًا نَقْرَؤُهُ قُلْ سُبْحَانَ رَبِّي هَلْ كُنْتُ إِلَّا بَشَرًا رَسُولًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">And they say: “We shall not believe in you, until you cause a spring to gush forth from the earth for us; “Or you have a garden of date-palms and grapes, and cause rivers to gush forth in their midst abundantly; “Or you cause the heaven to fall upon us in pieces, as you have pretended, or you bring Allaah and the angels before (us) face to face; “Or you have a house of adornable materials (like silver and pure gold, etc.), or you ascend up into the sky, and even then we will put no faith in your ascension until you bring down for us a Book that we would read.” Say : “Glorified (and Exalted) be my Lord (Allaah) above all that evil they (polytheists) associate with Him! Am I anything but a man, sent as a Messenger?”</span></strong>&gt;&gt; [al-Israa: 90-93]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes, they would regard the human need a Messenger had as shameful, as in the saying of Allaah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>وَقَالُوا مَالِ هَذَا الرَّسُولِ يَأْكُلُ الطَّعَامَ وَيَمْشِي فِي الْأَسْوَاقِ لَوْلَا أُنْزِلَ إِلَيْهِ مَلَكٌ فَيَكُونَ مَعَهُ نَذِيرًا () أَوْ يُلْقَى إِلَيْهِ كَنْزٌ أَوْ تَكُونُ لَهُ جَنَّةٌ يَأْكُلُ مِنْهَا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And they say: “Why does this Messenger eat food, and walk about in the markets (like ourselves). Why is not an angel sent down to him to be a warner with him? “Or (why) has not a treasure been granted to him, or why has he not a garden whereof he may eat?”</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Furqan : 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allaah ordered the Messenger to inform them that he neither knew the unseen, nor did he possess the treasures of Allaah, nor was he an Angel who was not in need of eating or wealth. Rather, he was a follower of what was revealed to him, following that which was revealed to him is the Deen, which is obedience to Allaah and he was commanded to worship Him with knowledge and actions, both inward and outward. A person attains from those three things, according to the amount Allaah Ta’ala gives him. He learns from him what He has taught him and has ability according to what Allaah gives him the capability to do, and he suffices himself with that which Allaah enriched him with in matters which would otherwise oppose general practices or the practice of the majority of the people.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Majmoo 11/312-313]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] T.N. Adam -alayhi as-Salam was the first Prophet &amp; Nuh -alayhi as-Salam – was the first Messenger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BALANCED APPROACH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah – <i>rahimahullaah</i> – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“When dealing with the people of sin, one must not exceed the limits prescribed by the <i>Sharee’ah</i> – neither in hating, censuring, preventing, abandoning or chastising them. Rather, the one who does so should be told: Worry about your own self. No harm will come to you from those who are misled, if you are truly guided, as Allaah – the Mort High – said: <b>“And do not let your hatred of others swerve you away from doing justice. But be just! That is closer to taqwaa (piety).”</b> [Soorah al-Maa’idah 5:8]. And Allaah said: <b>“And fight in the way of Allaah those who fight you, but do not transgress the limits.”</b> [Soorah al-Baqarah 2:190]. Indeed, many of those who command and forbid overstep the limits set by Allaah, either through <i>jahl</i> (ignorance) or <i>dhulm</i> (injustice). Thus, this issue (of justice) must be firmly maintained, whether it is in regards to censuring the unbelievers, the hypocrites, the sinners or the disobedient ones.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He further said: “The one commanding the good or forbidding the evil should do so in the way prescribed by the <i>Sharee’ah</i>; with knowledge, gentleness and patience, and with good intentions, and by following a balanced approach. All of this enters into Allaah’s saying: <b>“O you who believe! Beware of your own selves. No harm will come to you from those who are misled, if you are truly guided.”</b> [Soorah al-Maa’idah 5:105) … There is in this <i>Aayah</i> (Verse) another meaning as well, which is that a person must turn towards that which will be of benefit to him, both in knowledge and action, and he must avoid what does not concern him – as the conveyer of the <i>Sharee’ah</i> (i.e. the Prophet <i>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:<i> “From the perfection of a person’s Islaam is to leave alone that which doer not concern him.” </i>[4] This especially applies to a person delving into that which doer not concern him regarding someone’s religious or worldly affairs. Thus, such a person may speak out of envy or desire for position; or act either with deliberate oppression, or foolish scorn and sarcasm. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>How often does Shaytaan make such an act appear to be an art of commanding the good or prohibiting the evil, or jihaad in the path of Allaah, whereas it is actually an act of injustice and transgression!”</strong></span> [5]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">Allaah (subhanaha wa ta&#8217;aala) said: </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext" style="color:#008000;"><span class="bodytext"><b>&#8220;Those who were given the Scriptures did not differ except out of mutual jealousy and hatred (bagyan) after knowledge had come to them.&#8221; </b></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">Informing that their differing arose after the coming of knowledge that made clear to them as to what they should steer clear of &#8211; for indeed Allaah does not let a people become misguided after He guided them except after telling them what they should steer clear of. And informing that they differed only due to the reason of <strong>mutual jealousy and hatred</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Bagy</strong></span> means to exceed the proper bounds as was indicated by Ibn Umar (in his commentary to the verse): &#8216;arrogance and jealousy&#8217; &#8211; this arising due to differing ijtihaads that were not based upon knowledge. What is not meant by al-Bagy is the permissible difference that arises between the scholars for al-Bagy is either the neglect or omission of the truth, or exceeding the proper bounds. <strong><span style="color:#808000;">Exceeding the proper bounds either by leaving an obligatory action or by performing a forbidden action and it is known that splitting and disunity is the outcome of this</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this lies in what He said about the People of the Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And from those who call themselves Christians, We took their covenant but they abandoned (or forgot) a portion of the Message that was sent to them. So we planted enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection</span>.&#8221;</b> (5:14)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So He informed us that in their forgetting/abandoning a portion of the Message &#8211; meaning leaving a portion of that which they were commanded with &#8211; lay the reason for their enmity and hatred.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is occurring amongst the adherents of our religion and it can be found amongst the various parties that differ with regards to their principles and many subsidiary matters &#8211; found amongst the scholars and the worshippers &#8211; to the point that one finds a resemblance to the two nations about whom one says about the other: <b>&#8216;They are upon nothing.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is like what we find amongst the legal jurists who stick to the outward actions of the religion, and those that take to the path of tasawwuf  who stick to the inward actions of the religion for each one of these negates the path of the other and claims that they are not from the People of the Religion, or they oppose the other in a way of opposing of those who do not consider the other to be part of the religion. There occurs between them enmity and hatred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because Allaah has ordered that the heart be purified just as He has ordered that the body be purified. Both these aspects of purification are from the religion that Allaah has commanded and made obligatory. Allaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Allaah does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you and to complete His Favour on you that you may be thankful.&#8221;</b></span> (5:6 &#8211; the verse pertaining to wudu)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;In it (the mosque) are men who love to purify themselves and Allah loves those who purify themselves.&#8221;</b></span> (9:108)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah Loves those who turn to Him in repentance and He loves those who purify themselves.&#8221;</b> </span>(2:222)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Take charity from their wealth in order to purify and sanctify them.&#8221;</b></span> (9:103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;They are the ones whose hearts Allaah does not wish to purify.&#8221;</b></span> (5:41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Indeed the polytheists are impure and filthy&#8221;</b> </span>(9:28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we find that the concern of many of the legal jurists and the worshipper is only the purification of the body, and he goes beyond the requirement of the sharee&#8217;ah with respect to his concern and action. And he leaves what he has been commanded and recommended with respect to the purification of the heart, and he does not understand purification except in this bodily aspect. And we find that the concern of many of the sufis is the purification of the heart only, to the extent that he will go beyond the requirement of the Sharee&#8217;ah with respect to his concern and action. And he leaves what he has been commanded and recommended with respect to the purification of the body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first group go to the extreme of wasting water and considering to be impure that which is not impure, and staying away from that which has not been legislated to stay away from, this despite their hearts containing different shades of jealousy, arrogance and hatred towards their brothers. In this there is a clear resemblance to the Jews.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other group goes to the extreme of negligence, they go to great extents to safeguard the heart to the point that they consider ignorance of that which is obligatory to know &#8211; such as the evil from which it is obligatory to steer clear of &#8211; from those things that safeguard the heart (from actually desiring that evil). In this they do not differentiate between safeguarding the heart from desiring evil, and safeguarding the heart through its knowing the evil and its knowing that with which it has been commanded. Then alongside this negligence and ignorance they do not preserve themselves from the impure things and therefore establish the obligatory purification in the way of the Christians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So enmity has occurred between these two groups due to their leaving a portion of what they have been commanded with, and due to their <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>bagy</strong> </span>&#8211; which is to exceed the correct bounds, either by ignoring or omitting the truth, or by enmity and oppression. Bagy sometimes occurs amongst some people, or sometimes with regards to the rights of Allaah &#8211; both of these are implied. This is why He said: <b>&#8220;out of mutual jealousy and hatred&#8221;</b> for each group was displaying bagy to the other by not acknowledging the others right and not refraining from showing enmity to the other. Allaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Nor were the People of the Book divided until the clear proof came to them.&#8221;</b></span> (98:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Mankind was one nation and Allaah sent Messengers as bringers of glad-tidings and warners. And He revealed with them the Book in truth so that they may judge amongst mankind in that which they differed. And only those to whom it was given differed concerning it after clear proofs came to them through hatred, one to another.&#8221;</b></span> (2:213)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Indeed those who divide their religion into sects, you have no concern in them in the least.&#8221;</b></span> (6:159)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;(Always) turning in repentance to Him, and be afraid an dutiful to Him: and establish the prayers and do not be of the polytheists &#8211; of those who split up their religion and became sects, each sect rejoicing in that which is with it.&#8221;</b></span> (30:31-32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because each party of the polytheists used to worship whatsoever god their desires dictated as Allaah said: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;What you call the polytheists to is hard upon them.&#8221;</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;O Messengers! Eat of the goodly things and do righteous deeds. Indeed I am Well-Acquainted with what you do. And Verily! This, your religion, is one religion and I am your Lord, so keep your duty to Me. But they have broken their religion into sects, each group rejoicing in what it has.&#8221;</b></span> (23:51-52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it becomes clear <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the way of unity is by means of gathering all of the religion, and acting upon it in its entirety &#8211;</strong></span> that is worshipping Allaah Alone without any partners as He ordered, inwardly and outwardly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The way to disunity is by leaving a portion of that which the servant has been commanded with, and by al-bagy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The result of unity is:</strong> the Mercy and Pleasure of Allaah, His sending salaah upon the servants, and happiness in this world and in the hereafter, and white faces (on the Day of Judgement).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The result of disunity is:</strong> the Punishment of Allaah, His Curse, and black faces, and the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) declaring himself free of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the proofs that consensus is a definitive proof, for when they unite then they are all obeying Allaah in this and have Mercy showered on them. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And there cannot be obedience to Allaah and His Mercy by way of an action that He has not commanded, in either belief, saying or action</strong></span>. For if there were to be a saying or action upon which they agreed that had not been commanded by Allaah, then this would not be obedience to Allaah and neither would it be a means of His Mercy. Abu Bakr al-Azeez depended upon this proof in the beginning of his &#8216;at-Tanbeeh.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaikh-ul-lslaam Ibn Taimiyyah said in his book AI-&#8216;Aqeedat-ul-Waasitiyyah:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Among the Principles of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah is maintaining pure hearts and tongues towards the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), as Allaah has described them in His saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;And those who come after them say: &#8216;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Faith. And put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord, You are indeed full of kindness, most Merciful.&#8217;</span> [Surah Al-Hashr: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (from their principles is) obedience to the Prophet with regard to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Do not revile my Companions! For by the One whose Hand my soul is in, if one of you were to give away the size of mount Uhud in gold for charity, it would not equal a mudd of one of them nor even half of it.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They accept what is stated in the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah and the Consensus concerning their (the Companion&#8217;s) virtues and high status. And they give preference to those who spent their wealth and fought (in the Way of Allaah) before the Victory, which refers to the Treaty of al-Hudaibiyah, over those who gave their wealth and fought after it. They give precedence to the Muhaajireen over the Ansaar. And they believe that Allaah said to the people who fought in (the Battle of) Badr &#8211; who numbered over three hundred people: <strong>&#8216;Do whatever you wish, for I have already forgiven you.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they believe that no one who pledged their allegiance to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) under the tree will enter the Hellfire, as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) informed us. In fact, Allaah was pleased with them and they were pleased with Him. And they were more than one thousand four hundred people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They designate to Paradise whoever the Messenger of Allaah testified will be in Paradise, such as the Ten (Companions), Thaabit bin Qays bin Shammas and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They confirm what has been reported in tawaatur form on the Commander of the Believers, &#8216;Alee Ibn Abee Taalib and others that: The best of this ummah after its Prophet are Abu Bakr; then &#8216;Umar. Then they place &#8216;Uthmaan third and &#8216;Alee fourth, may Allaah be pleased with all of them. This is as is indicated in the athaar (reports from the Sahaabah) and as was unanimously agreed upon that &#8216;Uthmaan had precedence (over &#8216;Alee) for being pledged allegiance to (for the Khilaafah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of this, after unanimously agreeing to the precedence of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, some of Ahl-us-Sunnah have disagreed with regard to &#8216;Uthmaan and &#8216;Alee as to which of them is better. So a group of them gave precedence to &#8216;Uthmaan and then remained silent, and placed &#8216;Alee as the fourth. And another group gave precedence to &#8216;Alee. And yet another group remained neutral. But the affair of Al-us-Sunnah settled upon giving precedence to &#8216;Uthmaan and then &#8216;Alee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regardless, this issue of &#8216;Uthmaan and &#8216;Alee is not from the principles by which the one who disagrees concerning it becomes misguided (and deviant), according to the majority of the (scholars of) Ahl-us-Sunnah. Rather, the issue in which the one who opposes becomes misguided is the issue of the Khilaafah &#8211; and it is that they (must) believe that the Khaleefah after Allaah&#8217;s Messenger was Abu Bakr, then &#8216;Umar, then &#8216;Uthmaan, then &#8216;Alee. And whoever attacks the Khilaafah of any one of them, then he is more astray than the donkey of his people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then he mentioned that they have love and affection for the Members of the Household of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and that they preserve the Will (final requests) of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger concerning them. And that they have affection for the Wives of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, the Mothers of the Believers and believe that they will be his wives in the Hereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They absolve themselves from the way of the Rawaafid &#8211; those who hate the Companions and revile them &#8211; and from the way of the Nawaasib &#8211; those who abuse the Members of the (Prophet&#8217;s) Household &#8211; through speech or action. And they refrain from (delving into) the disputes that occurred between the Companions. And they say: These narrations that have been reported concerning their faults have in them some that are false, some that have had things added to them, some that have had parts omitted from them, and some that have been changed from their original state. As for those narrations that are authentic (concerning their faults), then they (the Companions) are excused (and forgiven) &#8211; either they made Ijtihaad and were correct or they made Ijtihaad and were wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, they do not believe that each of the Companions is infallible and free from committing major or minor sins. Rather, they are capable of committing sins in general, however, they possess from precedence and virtues that which necessitates that they be forgiven for whatever (sins) they commit &#8211; if they did commit any. This is even to the point that they will be forgiven for evil deeds the likes of which those who come after them will not be forgiven for. This is because they possess good deeds that wipe out the evil deeds, the likes of which will not be for those after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established from the saying of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that they are the best of generations and that if one of them were to give a mudd (of gold) in charity it would be better than if someone who came after them were to give the whole of Mount Uhud in gold. And if it was the case that one of them committed a sin, then either he repented from it or he performed some good deed that wiped it out. Or he will be forgiven for it due to the virtue of his precedence or because of the intercession of Muhammad H, of which the Companions have the most right among people of receiving. Or perhaps he was tested by some affliction in this world, by which it was expiated from him. So if this is with respect to the sins that were actualized (by them), then what about the matters in which they did Ijtihaad? If they were correct they will have two rewards and if they were incorrect they will have just one reward and their error will be forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the amount of (bad) deeds committed by some of them, that is forsaken yet forgiven, is tiny in comparison to their virtues and good qualities, such as their belief in Allaah and His Messenger, their Jihaad for His Cause, their performance of Hijrah, their support (of the Religion), as well as their beneficial knowledge and good deeds. And whoever studies the history of the &#8216;people&#8217; (i.e. the Sahaabah) with knowledge and insight, and studies the merits that Allaah bestowed unto them, he will come to know with full certainty that they are the best of creation after the prophets. There was not nor will there be anyone like them. They are the safwah (chosen elite) from all the generations of this nation (of Muslims), which is itself the best and most honorable of all nations with Allaah.&#8221;</p>

Answering Those Who Altered The Religion Of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explanation of the classic book of Ibn Taymiyyah <em>rahimahullaah. This book is one of the most important Islamic books which gives right answers about Christianity.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Jawab As-Sahih Li-man Baddala Dina Al-Masih</em> (Answering Those Who Altered the Religion of Jesus Christ) is a comprehensive study in which the author not only refutes the Christians&#8217; allegations about Islam but also raises the contradictions of some Christian beliefs and even refutes their creedal principles. The book gains its originality from the fact that it is one of the strongest compilations ever laid down on its topic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Through this Shaikhul-Islam Ibn Taimiyah responds to a letter from Cyprus from &#8216;Paul, The Monk; the Bishop of Sayda&#8217;, The letter was entitles &#8216;The Logically proven statement that expresses the right conviction and sound opinion&#8217;. The letter is comprised of all the excuses and pleas that Christian scholars and pious Christians use to defend their religion, in the past as well as in recent times, which are based on many rational and logical arguments. Upon that, Ibn Taimiyah stood up to confront and expose the falseness and corruption of such allegations, thereby, clarifying right from wrong in order that those with sound judgment can make use of it. He also aimed at outlining and clarifying the Books, Justice and Wisdom with which Allah sent His Messengers.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER ONE:</strong></span></p>
<p>Their claim that Muhammad (peace be upon him) was not sent to them but to the Arabs of the Pre-Islamic era. It will also contain their claim that the verses of the Qur’an support this very idea as does logical contemplation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section One: The First Claim Of The Christians</strong>
<ol>
<li>The Claim of the Christians that Muhammad was not sent to them but he was only sent to the Arabs of the Pre-Islamic era.</li>
<li>Their plea that the Book with which Muhammad was sent is not written in their language.</li>
<li>Their saying, &#8220;We do not need to follow this Messenger because we were sent other Messengers before him.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians</strong>
<ol>
<li>&#8211; Proofs that the Messenger Of Allah was sent to all Mankind</li>
<li>&#8211; Some Qur&#8217;anic verses that prove the prophethood Of Muhammad</li>
<li>&#8211; Refuting the Claim that the Qur&#8217;anic verses Contradict Each Other</li>
<li>&#8211; Glad tidings about the Coming of Prophets</li>
<li>&#8211; The Qur&#8217;an was Revealed in Arabic</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER TWO:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim that Muhammad (peace be upon him) praised their religion (in the Qur’an) to the extent that their religion and practices should motivate them to adhere more to it.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section One: The First Claim Of The Christians</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christian Claim: Muhammad praised their religion, which they practice, in the Qur&#8217;an from the following aspects: (1). Glorifying Christ and his mother. (2). Glorifying the Bible. (3). Praising Synagogues. (4). Glorifying the Disciples, as they are messengers from Allah. (5). All that makes us hold fast to our religion and not follow any other man except Jesus Christ.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians</strong>
<ol>
<li>&#8211; Divine and Human Entities United</li>
<li>&#8211; The Holy Spirit</li>
<li>&#8211; Invented Monasticism</li>
<li>&#8211; Misplaced Inference</li>
<li>&#8211; Remembering Allah in Monasteries, Synagogues and Mosques</li>
<li>&#8211; Praising Jesus Christ and His Followers</li>
<li>&#8211; Reasons Why the Christians Deviated</li>
<li>&#8211; The Book of Enlightenment</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER THREE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim that the prophethood of the early Prophets and their Books, like the Torah, Psalms and the Gospel assert the truth of their beliefs, namely: the Hypostases, trinity, unification and so on. Thus, they should adhere to them, as it is not acceptable for them to desert their beliefs as long as they are not abrogated by a text or annulled by rational deduction.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section One: The Third Claim Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians
<ol>
<li>Distortion of the Torah and The Gospel</li>
<li>Invalidity Of the Comparison of their Books to the Qur&#8217;an</li>
<li>Who Speaks Seventy-Two Languages</li>
<li>Changes made in Torah and Gospel</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Section Three: The Claim Of The Christians Regarding The Prophets Books Supporting Them And Attributing Injustice To The Jews</li>
<li>Section Four: Refuting The Christians Claim</li>
<li>Sections Five: The Christians Claim That The Qur&#8217;an Regards All Religions On An Equal Footing</li>
<li>Section Six: Reputing The Christians Claim</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER FOUR:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It includes their claim that the Trinity is proven according to logic and according to the revealed laws (i.e. the Prophetic traditions and their revealed Books) and that it agrees with the laws of Divinely revealed Books and Prophetic traditions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section One: The Claim Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians
<ol>
<li>Invalidity of the Three Entities Being One God</li>
<li>Baptizing in the Name of the Father and the Son</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER FIVE:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim that they are monotheists, justifying their words that imply polytheism, such as the hypostases, through claiming that they resemble the words in the Book of the Muslims which imply personification and incarnation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section One: The Claim Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians
<ol>
<li>The Christians Claim that the Attributes Serve as Names</li>
<li>Their Claim Regarding Incarnation and Immanentism</li>
<li>Their Claim Regarding God&#8217;s Appearance in Jesus</li>
<li>The Difference Between Similarity and being Identical</li>
<li>Christians Claim regarding the Three Hypostases</li>
<li>The Invalidity of their Claim that they are Monotheists</li>
<li>Among Their Scholars: Al-Hasan bin Ayyub</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHAPTER SIX:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim that ‘Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him) was sent after Musa (Moses, peace be upon him) with a perfect religion (i.e. Christianity) and thus, there is no need for another religion (i.e. Islam) which aims at the same purposes and goals which have already been achieved. Thus, any religion after that of &#8216;Isa is invalid and therefore not acceptable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Section One: The Claim Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Two: The Refuting The Claims Of The Christians</li>
<li>Section Three: The Prophets Prophesied The Advent Of Muhammad</li>
<li>The Scriptures&#8217; Witness For Muhammad (peace be upon him)
<ul>
<li>Sixteen Prophecies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Translated &amp; Compiled by Abbas Abu Yahya </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And if giving advice is obligatory for general and specific religious interests: like regarding narrators of hadeeth who make mistakes and lie then like Yahya bin Sa’eed said: I asked Malik, Thawri, al-Laith bin Sa’ad – I think it was him – and al-Awza’ee about a man who is accused in hadeeth or he does not memorize hadeeth? They said: ‘Make clear his condition.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the people said to Ahmad bin Hanbal: ‘I find it difficult to say about a person that he has such and such problem, and so and so is like such and such.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad said: ‘If you remain silent and I remain silent when will an ignorant person know the authentic from the unauthentic?!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the leaders of <em>Bida’</em> from the people who have statements that oppose the Book and the Sunnah, or worship which opposes the Book and the Sunnah, it is obligatory to clarify their condition and warn the <em>Ummah</em> against  them and this is in agreement with the Muslims.  So much so that it was said to Ahmad bin Hanbal: Is a person who fasts, prays and makes <em>Itikaf</em> more beloved to you or speaking against the people of <em>Bida’</em>?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘If he fasts, prays and makes <em>Itikaf</em> then that is for himself, and if he speaks against the people of <em>Bida’</em> then that is for the Muslims and that is better.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that this benefit is general for all the Muslims for their religion and it is in the same class as <em>Jihad</em> in the path of Allaah. Since purifying the path of Allaah and His<em>Deen</em>, His <em>Minahij</em> (methodologies), His <em>Sharia’</em> and repelling the injustice of these people and their hostility upon this is  a general responsibility, which is something that is in agreement among the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it was not the case that Allaah made people in order to repel the harm of these people, the <em>Deen</em> would have become corrupted. The corruption of the <em>Deen</em> would be greater than the corruption caused by being conquered by the enemy at war. Since if these people take over they do not corrupt the hearts and what is in the heart is from the <em>Deen</em>, but they do it slowly, as for the People of <em>Bida’</em> then they corrupt the hearts from the onset.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from  ‘Majmoo fatawa’ 28/231-232]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A Summary of the Explanation of the Hadeeth of ‘The Leading Supplication for Seeking Forgiveness’. </span><span style="color:#993300;">by Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Shaddad bin Aws <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the major supplication for forgiveness is</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ رَبِّي لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ خَلَقْتَنِي وَأَنَا عَبْدُكَ وَأَنَا عَلَى عَهْدِكَ وَوَعْدِكَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا صَنَعْتُ أَبُوءُ لَكَ بِذَنْبِي وَأَبُوءُ لَكَ بِنِعْمَتِكَ عَلَيَّ فَاغْفِرْ لِي فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah You are my Lord, there is none worthy of worship in truth except You, You created me and I am Your slave and I abide by Your covenant and promise as best as I can, I seek refuge in You from the evil that I have committed, I profess to you my sins and I acknowledge Your favour upon me, so forgive me verily no one forgives sins except You.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahumma anta rabbee, la ilaha illa anta, Khalaqtanee, wa ana abduka, wa ana ala ahdika wa wa’dika mastata’tu, a’outhu bika min sharri ma sanatu, aboo’u laka bi thambee wa aboo’u laka bini’matika alayya, faghfirlee fa’innahu la yaghfiru ath-thunooba ‘illa ‘anta</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever says this with certainty when the morning arrives and dies during that day before evening, then he is from the people of Paradise and whoever says it with certainty in the evening, and dies before the morning, then he is from the people of Paradise.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhari, an-Nisa’ee &amp; Tirmidhi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said about the preceding hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Regarding the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> about the Leading Supplication forSeeking Forgiveness is that when the slave of Allaah says: ‘<strong><em>O Allaah You are my Lord, there is none worthy of worship in truth except You</em></strong>’ this hadeeth comprises well-known, magnificent matters and therefore it is rightfully the Leading Supplication for Seeking Forgiveness since it commences with the slave of Allaah acknowledging <em>al-Ruboobiyah</em>(The Lordship) of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the slave of Allaah follows that up with Tawheed <em>al-Uloohiyah</em> (Allaah’s sole right to be Worshipped) by saying: ‘<strong><em>there is none worthy of worship in truth except You</em></strong>.’ So here he acknowledges that it is Allaah who created him and brought him into existence when he was nothing and so Allaah is rightfully The One who takes charge of complete beneficence to His slave with forgiveness for his sins, just as He <em>– Subhanahu wa Ta’ala –</em> began with beneficence to him by creating him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave of Allaah then says: ‘<strong><em>I am Your slave</em></strong>’ by which he acknowledges that servitude of worship is only for Allaah, since Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em> created the son of Adam for Himself and for His worship as is mentioned in some <em>Athaar</em> (narrations).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if a slave of Allaah leaves that for which Allaah created him, which is obedience to Allaah, knowing Him, loving Him, turning repentantly to Him and relying upon Him, then he has fled from his Master.When the slave of Allaah repents to Allaah and returns to Him, then he has repented to that which Allaah loves from the slave and so Allaah is pleased with this return. This is why the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> mentioned regarding Allaah Ta’ala that: ‘Allaah is greater in happiness with the repentance of His slave than that of a slave finding his lost ride, which had his food and his drink on it, in a perilous land after he had given up hope of recovering it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>– Subhanahu –</em> is The One who is capable of returning his ride and Allaah was The One who returned it to him. This is the height of excellence and beneficence, worthy of he who is in this circumstance, and there is nothing more beloved to the slave than Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave of Allaah then says: ‘<strong><em>and I abide </em>by<em>Your covenant and promise as best as I can’</em></strong>.So Allaah <em>– Subhanahu wa Ta’ala –</em> made a contract with His slaves wherein He set out commands and prohibitions. Allaah promised them that if they fulfilled His contract, He would reward them with the highest of rewards. So the slave of Allaah continues moving between fulfilling his contract to Allaah and attesting to Allaah’s promise, meaning: I fulfil Your contract, attesting to Your promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This meaning was mentioned by the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> in his saying: ‘Whoever fasts Ramadan with Eemaan and (<em>al-Ihtisaab</em>) hoping for a reward, then he is forgiven for his previous sins.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Eemaan here is the action which is: the contract Allaah contracted with His worshippers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Ihtisaab</em> (hoping for a reward) is: hoping for Allaah’s reward by doing this action -which is not fitting except when attesting to His promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saying: ‘Eemaan and<em>Al-Ihtisaab</em> (hoping for a reward)’ then the slave of Allaah is driven to do this, due to his Eemaan.Allaah legislated and obligated it, was pleased with and commanded it. <em>Al-Ihtisaab</em> (hoping) is the reward with Allaah which means the slave of Allaah does this action sincerely for Allaah, hoping for His reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his saying: ‘<strong><em>as best as I can</em></strong>’, then this means: I fulfil this according to my ability and that which Allaah has made rightful upon me, not according to that which befits You O Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this statement there is a proof which establishes that the slave of Allaah has strength and capability and that he is not compelled by destiny, rather he himself has the capability which is his being entrusted with commands and prohibitions, reward and punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from this statement is a refutation of the Qadareeyah al-Mujbirah (a sect who believe that destiny means that actions are due to compulsion); who say that the slave of Allaah has neithercapability nor potential by himself and that he has no decision over actions whatsoever, but rather that Allaah will punish due to Allaah’s own action and not due to the action of Allaah’s slave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This part of the supplication is also a refutation ofthe al-Majooseeyah (fire worshippers) and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the slave of Allaah says: ‘<strong><em>I seek refuge in You from the evil that I have committed</em></strong>’ so the slave of Allaah seeks refuge, protection and fortification with Allaah, fleeing to Him from that which one seeks refuge from, just like the refugee who secures himself from the enemy in a fortresswhich will save him from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is affirmation of the actions of the slave of Allaah and his seeking his own livelihood and also that evil is attributed to his own actions and not to his Lord in his saying: ‘<strong><em>I seek refuge in You from the evil that I have committed</em></strong>’ so evil, in itself,is indeed from the slave of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for our Lord (Allaah) then He has Beautiful Names, all His Attributes are attributes of perfection and all His Actions are Wise and for a just purpose.What supports this is the saying of the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>: ‘evil is not attributed to You’ as is mentioned in the hadeeth narrated by Muslim in the supplication for beginning the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave of Allaah then says: ‘<strong><em>I acknowledge Your favour upon me</em></strong>’ which means I acknowledge this matter; i.e. I affirm this – that I acknowledge You with Your blessings upon me. You are The One deserving of this because You are The One who is praised and I seek forgiveness from You for my sins.This is why some of the righteous people said: ‘It is a must that every breath the slave of Allaah takes is one of two types; one breath where he praises his Lord and, in the next one, one where he seeks forgiveness from his sins.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the slave of Allaah testifies to these two matters then his <em>Uboodiyah</em> (servitude to Allaah) becomes correct, he is raised in degrees of goodness and Eemaan, his own self is diminished and he humbles himself for his Lord. This is the perfection of <em>Uboodiyah</em> by which he becomes free of being amazed by himself, of pride and of beautifying actions in order to show off.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is The One who gives success and He is The One Who Guides. All praise be to Allaah Alone and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our leader Muhammad, his Family and his Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them all. Allaah is sufficient for us and He is The Best to protect.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken From: ‘al-Majmoo’ al-‘Aleeyah min Kutub wa Rasail wa Fatawa Shakyh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah’ 1/54-59</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">By Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-<br />
</em>Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In what language will the people be spoken to on the Day of Resurrection? Will Allaah Ta’ala speak to the people in Arabic? Is it true that the language of the people of Hell-fire will be Persian and the language of the people of Paradise will be Arabic?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘All praise belongs to Allaah the Lord of all the worlds, it is not known in what language the people will be spoken to on that day, nor in which language they will hear the address of the Lord <em>–Jala wa Ula’-</em>because Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> did not inform us of anything about this, nor did His Messenger<em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not authentic that Persian is the language of the people of the Hell-fire <strong><em>or</em></strong> that Arabic is the language of the people who will be in eternal blessing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not know of a dispute between the Companions <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum</em><em>&#8211;</em>, rather all of them refrained from this, because speaking about these types of things is from futile speech . . . However, there occurred a dispute between the people who came later so some of them said that: the people will converse in Arabic. Others said: ‘No, the people of Hell-fire will reply in Persian and it is their language in Hell-fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others said: ‘They will converse with Syriac<em> (</em>an Eastern Aramaic language) because it is the language of Adam and from it all other languages branched off.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others said: ‘No, the people of Paradise will speak Arabic.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no basis any of these opinions by those who hold them, neither intellectual nor transmitted, rather it is a claim devoid of evidence and Allaah <em>– Subhana wa Ta’ala –</em> is most Knowledgeable and most Just.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 4/300-301</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Hadeeth taken from ‘Saheeh al-Kalima at-Tayyib’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">By <strong>Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah</strong><br />
And Checked by<strong> Shaykh Muhammad Nasir-rudeen al-Albani</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Compiled by Hajaj bin Abdullaah al-Areeni<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise belongs to Allaah, Lord of all the worlds. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, upon his family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then to proceed, indeed Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> sent Muhammad <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> with the most eloquent of speech, Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And he does not speak from his own desire, indeed it is revelation sent down to him</span></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whatever the Messenger gave you then take it, and whatever he prohibits you from then keep away from it</span></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever obeys the Messenger then he has obeyed Allaah</span></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has blessed this <em>Ummah</em> with the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and from the greatest of these blessings of guidance, is the ease of worship, coupled with the great reward for fulfilling that worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> mentioned, in many hadith, actions and sayings, which, if performed grant us great and well-known results. This is to encourage good actions and sayings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This collection of hadeeth, contain some of the valuable pearls of sayings, from the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. They yield immense rewards, in return of easy &amp; effortless actions, for those whom Allaah has made them easy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have chosen these hadeeth from the book <em>S<strong>aheeh al-kalima at-Tayyib </strong></em>by the Shaykh Muhammad Nasir-rudeen al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah</em>. This book consists of authentic hadeeth from the book of Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> called <strong><em>al-kalima at-Tayib</em></strong>. All of the hadeeth mentioned in this pamphlet have been graded authentic from the research of Shaykh al-Albaani <em>-Rahimullaah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This pamphlet has only been only limited to the texts of the hadeeth, since not more than the text is required. I have named this collection <strong><em>Hawiz ala jawaiz</em></strong> (Gaining Rewards). Because these chosen hadeeth, which yield great rewards or great known results which the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> informed us of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It would be of great benefit, if someone by Allaah’s permission could carry out research similar to this. Delving into the books of hadeeth to bring forth knowledge guidance &amp; good works to the people.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Hadeeth</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever says: –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَه،ُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْد،ُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, to Him belongs the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things.’ –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One hundred times in one day, then it is equivalent to him freeing ten slaves, a hundred good deeds are written for him, a hundred bad deeds are erased, it is a protection for him against shaytaan during that day until the evening, and no one comes with a better deed than him except for the man who does more actions than him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever says: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Far is Allaah from imperfection and all praise is for Him’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi wa bihamdihi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One hundred times in one day, then his mistakes / sins are cancelled out, even if they are like the foam on the ocean.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two words which are gentle on the tongue, heavy on the scales, and beloved to ar-Rahmaan: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ ، سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Far is Allaah from imperfection and praise is for Him, Far is Allaah The Sublime from imperfection</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi wa bihamdihi, Subhana allaahil atheem</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed that I say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ ، وَالْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ، وَلَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ ، وَاللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Far is Allaah from imperfection, and all praise be to Allaah, and there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest,’</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; is more beloved to me than what the sun rose upon.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is one of you so weak that he cannot acquire a thousand good deeds everyday? So a questioner from amongst those sitting there asked him: How can anyone of us gain a thousand rewards?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8211; Far is Allaah from imperfection –</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A hundred times, so a thousand good deeds are written for him or a thousand sins are cancelled for him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shall I not inform you of a statement, which is a treasure from the treasures of Paradise? I said: Yes O Messenger of Allaah, may my father and mother be sacrificed for you! He said: say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">There is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">La hawla wa la quwwata illa billaa</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoso ever, reaches the morning &amp; reaches the evening and he says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">-‘Allaah is far from imperfection and all praise is for Him’ –</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Subhana allaahi wa bihamdihi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One hundred times, then no one brings anything better than him on the day of judgment, than what he has brought. Except the one who says what he has said, or has said more than him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – On the authority of Mua’ad bin Abdillaah ibn Khubayb on the authority of his father who said we went out on a very dark and rainy night searching for the Messenger of Allaah so that he could pray for us, then I found him and he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said : Recite. So I did not say anything, then he said: Recite. So I did not say anything, and he said: Recite, so I said: what should I recite? He said: recite:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">“قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ”</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">‘Say that Allaah is the One.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the last two Soorahs (<em>al-muawaathatayan</em>) in the evening and the morning, three times for it will suffice you for everything.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the major supplication for forgiveness is to say</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ رَبِّي لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ خَلَقْتَنِي وَأَنَا عَبْدُكَ وَأَنَا عَلَى عَهْدِكَ وَوَعْدِكَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُ أَعُوذُ بِكَ مِنْ شَرِّ مَا صَنَعْتُ أَبُوءُ لَكَ بِذَنْبِي وَأَبُوءُ لَكَ بِنِعْمَتِكَ عَلَيَّ فَاغْفِرْ لِي فَإِنَّهُ لَا يَغْفِرُ الذُّنُوبَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">O Allaah You are my Lord, there is none worthy of worship in truth except You, You created me and I am Your slave and I abide to Your covenant and promise as best as I can, I seek refuge in You from the evil that I have committed, I profess to you my sins and I acknowledge Your favour upon me, so forgive me verily no one forgives sins except you.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Allaahumma anta rabbee, la ilaha illa anta, Khalaqtanee, wa ana abduka, wa ana ala ahdika wa wa’dika mastata’tu, a’outhu bika min sharri ma sanatu, aboo’u laka bini’matika alayya, wa aboo’u bee thambee, faghfirlee fa’innahu la yaghfiru ath-thunooba ‘illa ‘anta</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the worshipper says this when the morning arrives, truly believing in it and he dies, enters Paradise, and if he says this when the evening arrives truly believing in it enters Paradise.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is not one from amongst the worshippers, that if he says, in the morning of everyday and the evening of every night: <em>&#8211;</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ الَّذِي لَا يَضُرُّ مَعَ اسْمِهِ شَيْءٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي السَّمَاءِ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">In the name of Allaah with whose name nothing is harmed what so ever, on this earth nor in the heavens whatsoever, and He is the All Hearing and All Knowing</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Bismil-lahil-lathee la yadhurru ma’a ‘issmihi shay’un fil ‘ardhi wa la fissama’i wa huwa ‘as-samee’ul –‘aleem</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Three times nothing harms him what so ever.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 – On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em>, the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> had placed Abu Huraira to look after the charity, some one came to him to take from the charity – and this person came night after night, so on the third night Abu Huraira said to him: I will take you to the Messenger of Allaah. So he said Why don’t you leave me and I will teach you some words that Allaah will benefit you by – and Abu Huraira was of those who were very attentive regarding good deeds – so the person said to him: When you go to bed, read Ayaat ul-Kursi:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">(الله لا إلهَ إلا هُوَ الحيُ القَيُومَ )</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Allaah, none has the right to be worshipped except Him The Ever living, The One Who sustains and protects all that exists&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[verse 255 from Soorah Baqarah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Until the end of the <em>Ayaah</em>, then this will continue to be a protection for you from Allaah, and Shaytan will not be able to come near you until the morning arrives. The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: He spoke the truth even though he is a liar, [that was Shaytan].</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">12 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who ever recites the last two <em>Ayaat </em>from <em>Soorah al-Baqarah</em> at night, then those two verses will be sufficient for him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">13 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shall I not show you what will be better for you than a servant? When you lie down on your bed, say SubhanAllaah 33 times, say al-hamdulillaah 33 times and say Allaahu akbar 34 times.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">14 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who ever wakes up at night, and says: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَه،ُ لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْد،ُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ،الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ،وَ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ ، وَلَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ ، وَاللَّهُ أَكْبَرُ ،وَ لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ العليِ الْعَظِيمِ.</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, He has the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things, praise is for Him, and Far is Allaah from imperfection, and There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, and Allaah is the Greatest, there is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah the Most High the ‘Atheem.’ (Supreme)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer Subhana allaahi, wal hamdu lillaahi, wa la illaah ila Allaah, wa Allaahu akbar</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La hawla wa la quwwata illa billaa</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he says : <strong>اللهمَ اغْفِرْلي</strong> <em>O Allaah forgive me </em>(Allaahumma aghfirlee), or he supplicates and his supplication is answered, and if he makes <em>Wudu</em> and prays then his prayer is accepted.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">15- The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who ever goes to bed with purification….there is not an hour of the night that he asks Allaah for something of good from this world and the hereafter, except that Allaah grants him that which he asked for.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">16 – Abu Salma said that he heard Abu Qatada say that he heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A good dream is from Allaah <em>–Tabaraka wa Ta’ala</em>&#8211; and a bad dream is from Shaytaan, so if anyone sees something in his dream which he dislikes, then he should spit on his left side 3 times when he awakens, and he should seek refuge with Allaah from its evil, then it will not harm him if Allaah so wills.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">17 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A good dream is from Allaah, so if any one of you sees something in his dream that he likes, then he should not relate it to anyone except the one whom he loves, and if he sees that which he dislikes, then he should not relate it to anyone, rather he should spit on his left side 3 times, and he should seek refuge with Allaah from the evil of the accursed shaytaan, and the evil of what he saw, then it will not harm him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">18- The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord <em>–Tabarak wa Ta’ala-</em> descends every night to the lowest heavens, when there remains the last third part of the night, and He says who is there that supplicates to me so that I may answer his supplication, who is there that asks of me so that I may grant him what he asks for, who is there that seeks my forgiveness so that I may forgive him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">19 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, there is an hour from the night, which if a Muslim asks Allaah in that time from the good of the affairs of this world and the hereafter, then Allaah gives him of it, and that is in every night.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">20 – On the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever says, as he leaves from his house:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِسْمِ اللَّهِ ، تَوَكَّلْتُ عَلَى اللَّهِ ،ولَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللَّهِ تعالى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">In the name of Allaah, I have placed my trust in Allaah, and there is no capability nor is there any power except with Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Bismillaahi tawwakaltu alalaahi wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billahi taa’la</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then it is said to him: indeed you have been saved, and you have been protected, and you have been guided, and shaytaan has been kept away from him, so another shaytaan says: how can you affect a man who has indeed been guided and saved and been protected.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">21 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man enters his home, and he remembers Allaah when he enters and when he eats his food, the shaytaan says: there is no place for you to spend the night nor is there any dinner. And if he does not remember Allaah when he enters his house then the shaytaan says: you have found a place to spend the night and if he does not remember Allaah while he is eating his food then he says you have found food to eat.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">22 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O my son if you enter your home then say <em>Salaam</em> it will be a blessing for you and your family.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">23 – When the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> would enter the <em>Masjid</em> he would say:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَعُوذُ بِاللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ وَبِوَجْهِهِ الْكَرِيمِ وَسُلْطَانِهِ الْقَدِيمِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8211; I seek refuge with Allaah The Supreme and with His Noble Face, and His eternal authority from the accursed shaytaan –</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">A’outhu bil-lahil ‘atheem, wa bi-wajhihil-kareem, wa bi-sultanihil-qadeem min ‘ash-shayanir-rajeemi</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: if he says this supplication then the shaytaan says: this person has been protected from me for the rest of the day.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">24 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the people knew what was there (in benefit for them) in the call to prayer and praying in the front row, and they could not get to it except by drawing lots, then they would draw lots.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">25- The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is none from the <em>Jinn</em>, mankind and anything else that hears the reach of the <em>Muaddthin’s</em> (the caller to prayer) voice except that they will testify for him on the day of Resurrection.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">26 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you hear the <em>Muaddthin</em>, then repeat what he says, then send prayers upon me, since indeed the one who sends prayers upon me once, Allaah sends ten prayers upon him. Then ask Allaah for me to be an intercessor since it is a high station in Paradise, which is not befitting except for a servant from the servants of Allaah and I hope that I am the one, so whoever asks intercession for me then intercession will take place for him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">27 -The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who ever says, when he hears the call to prayer:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ رَبَّ هَذِهِ الدَّعْوَةِ التَّامَّةِ وَالصَّلَاةِ الْقَائِمَةِ آتِ مُحَمَّدًا الْوَسِيلَةَ وَالْفَضِيلَةَ وَابْعَثْهُ مَقَامًا مَحْمُودًا الَّذِي وَعَدْتَهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; O Allaah Lord of this perfect call to prayer and Owner of this prayer to be performed, bestow upon Muhammad a station in Paradise and a rank above the rest of creation and give him the honorable station which you have promised him –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahumma rabba hathihi ‘addawatittamati, was-salatil qa’imati, ‘ati Muhammadan ál-waseelata wal faaheelata, wab’ath-hu maqqaman mahmoodan ‘allathee wa’adtahu</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then my intercession occurs for him on the day of Judgment.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">28- A man said O Messenger of Allaah indeed the callers to the prayer are more favored than we are. So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: repeat what they say, and when you finish ask, and you will be given.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">29 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A supplication that is made between the Adhaan and the Iqama is not rejected.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">31 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two things which are not rejected, or rarely rejected: A supplication made at the time of the call to prayer, and at the time when the battle becomes severe.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">31 -The Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shall I not teach you something, which the people who proceeded you attained, and those who come after you will proceed you with, and there will be no-one better than you except the one who does what you do? They said of course O Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. So he said: say: – far is Allaah from imperfection, Allaah is the Greatest and Praise is to Allaah – SubanAllaah and Allaahu akbar and Alhamdulillaah at the end of every prayer 33 times each.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">32 -The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever says SubhanAllaah at the end of every prayer 33 times, says al-hamdulillaah 33 times, and says Allaahu akbar 33 times, then this adds up to 99, and if he says –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ِ لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, He has the Dominion and for Him is all praise, and He is capable of all things’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To complete a hundred, then his mistakes/sins are forgiven even if they were equivalent to the foam on the sea.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">34 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two characteristics or two qualities that if a Muslim slave of Allaah is continuous upon, will enter Paradise, they are simple but those who do them are few. To say SubhanAllaah at the end of every prayer ten times, says alhamdulillah ten times and says Allaahu akbar ten times, which is equivalent to 150 times on the tongue and 1500 on the scales. And he says Allaahu Akbar 34 times when he goes to bed and he says alhamdulillah 33 times and says SubhanAllaah 33 times, and that is equivalent to 100 on the tongue and 1000 on the scales.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">34 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> used to teach us <em>al-Istikharah</em> (a prayer said for aid in making a decision) for all matters, just like he used to teach us a chapter from the Qur’aan, he would say: If any of you intends to undertake a matter then he should pray two <em>Rakah</em> other than an obligatory prayer then he should say</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَسْتَخِيرُكَ بِعِلْمِكَ وَأَسْتَقْدِرُكَ بِقُدْرَتِكَ وَأَسْأَلُكَ مِنْ فَضْلِكَ الْعَظِيمِ ، فَإِنَّكَ تَقْدِرُ وَلَا أَقْدِرُ ، وَتَعْلَمُ وَلَا أَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتَ عَلَّامُ الْغُيُوبِ ، اللَّهُمَّ إِنْ كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُ أَنَّ هَذَا الْأَمْرَ خَيْرٌ لِي فِي دِينِي وَمَعَاشِي وَعَاقِبَةِ أَمْرِي أَوْ قَالَ عَاجِلِ أَمْرِي وَآجِلِهِ فَاقْدُرْهُ لِي وَيَسِّرْهُ لِي ثُمَّ بَارِكْ لِي فِيهِ وَإِنْ كُنْتَ تَعْلَمُ أَنَّ هَذَا الْأَمْرَ شَرٌّ لِي فِي دِينِي وَمَعَاشِي وَعَاقِبَةِ أَمْرِي أَوْ قَالَ فِي عَاجِلِ أَمْرِي وَآجِلِهِ فَاصْرِفْهُ عَنِّي وَاصْرِفْنِي عَنْهُ وَاقْدُرْ لِيَ الْخَيْرَ حَيْثُ كَانَ ثُمَّ أَرْضِنِي بِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah I request of You with Your knowledge, and by Your Power I seek capability, and I ask of you of your great favour, since indeed You are the One who is able while I am not, and You know and I do not, and You are the One who knows the unseen. O Allaah if You know that this matter – here he mentions his need – is good for me in this world and for my living and for the matters of my hereafter – or he said, for my affairs now and the future – then decree it for me and make it easy for me and bless it for me. And if You know that this matter is evil for me in this world and for my life and for the matters of my hereafter – or he said, for my affairs now and the affairs of my future – then turn it away from me and turn me away from it, and decree goodness for me where ever it may be and make me pleased with it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">35 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The supplication of Yunas, when he supplicated while he was in the belly of the whale:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا أَنْتَ سُبْحَانَكَ إِنِّي كُنْتُ مِنَ الظَّالِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; There is none worthy of worship in truth except You, far are You from imperfection, indeed I am from amongst the <em>Thalimoon</em>(oppressors) –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa ‘anta, subhanaka ‘innee kuntu minath-thalimeena</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No Muslim ever supplicates with this for anything except that Allaah responds to him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">36 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah does not afflict a slave with grief nor sadness, except that if the slave says: &#8211;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي عَبْدُكَ وَابْنُ عَبْدِكَ وَابْنُ أَمَتِكَ نَاصِيَتِي بِيَدِكَ مَاضٍ فِيَّ حُكْمُكَ ، عَدْلٌ فِيَّ قَضَاؤُكَ ، أَسْأَلُكَ بِكُلِّ اسْمٍ هُوَ لَكَ سَمَّيْتَ بِهِ نَفْسَكَ أَوْ عَلَّمْتَهُ أَحَدًا مِنْ خَلْقِكَ أَوْ أَنْزَلْتَهُ فِي كِتَابِكَ أَوِ اسْتَأْثَرْتَ بِهِ فِي عِلْمِ الْغَيْبِ عِنْدَكَ أَنْ تَجْعَلَ الْقُرْآنَ رَبِيعَ قَلْبِي وَنُورَ صَدْرِي وَجِلَاءَ حُزْنِي وَذَهَابَ هَمِّي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah indeed I am Your slave, and the son of Your slave, and the son of Your female slave, my forelock is in Your Hand, Your command over me is forever executed and Your decree over me is just. I ask of You with all Your names, which belong to You, which You have named Yourself with, or which You have taught someone from Your creation or revealed it in Your Book or that which You have taken unto Your self with the knowledge of the unseen with You, that You make the Qur’aan the life of my heart and light of my breast and keep away from me my sadness, and that my grief goes away –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahumma ‘innee ‘abduka, wabnu ‘abdika, wabnu amatika, nasiyatee biyadika, madhin fiyya hukmuka, adlun fiyya qadha’uka, asaluka bikulli ismin huwa laka, sammayta bihi nafsaka, aw anzaltahu fee kitabika, ‘aw allamthu ahadan min khaliqika, aw ista’tharta bihi fee ilmil ghaybi ‘indaka, án taj’alal-qurana rabee’a qalbee, wa noora sadree, wa jala’a huznee, wa thahaba hammee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah takes away his grief and sadness and replaces it with happiness.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">37 – Uthman ibn al-Aas came to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said: O Messenger of Allaah indeed the shaytaan comes between me and my prayer, and my recitation becomes confusing? The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said: This is a shaytaan called <em>khunsabun</em>, so if you sense his presence then seek refuge in Allaah from him and spit on your left hand side three times. Uthman said: I did that and Allaah kept him away from me.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">39 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no one from among Allaah’s servants, who is afflicted with an affliction except that he says: –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"> إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ  اللَّهُمَّ أْجُرْنِي فِي مُصِيبَتِي وَأَخْلِفْ لِي خَيْرًا مِنْهَا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, we belong to Allaah and indeed to Him is our return – O Allaah recompense me for my affliction and replace it with something better than that</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Inna lil-lahi wa inna ‘ilayhi raji’oona, ‘allahumma’jurnee fee museebatee, wa ákhliflee khayran minha</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Except that Allaah compensates him in what he has been afflicted with, and gives him that which is better than the previous thing.</p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah Who has saved me from what He has trialed you with and chosen me above much of the creation –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Alhamdu lil-lahi allathee afanee mimma ibtalaka bihi, wa fadh-dhalanee ala katheerin mimman khalaqa tafdheelan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then that trial will not afflict him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">51 – The Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever enters the market place and says –</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ وَهُوَ حَيٌّ لَا يَمُوتُ بِيَدِهِ الْخَيْرُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah Alone, He has no partners, He has the Dominion and for Him is all praise, He gives life and He takes life and He is the Ever living and does not die, in His Hand is goodness and He is capable of all things.’ –</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">La ilaha ‘illa Allaahu wahdahu la shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu yuhyee wa youmeet wa huwa hayun la yamoot biyadihi alkhair wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then Allaah writes a thousand thousand good deeds for him, and erases a thousand thousand bad deeds for him, and He raises him up a thousand thousand grades.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">BECOMING accustomed talking to one another in a language other than Arabic ‎ so much so that it becomes a habit in the land, with one‎s family, with one‎s friends, in the marketplace, when addressing government representatives or authority figures or when speaking to the people of knowledge ‎ is undoubtedly Makrooh (disliked). <strong>Arabic is a symbol of Islam and the language of the Qur‎&#8217;an</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When early Muslims went to live in Syria and Egypt, where people spoke Byzantine Greek, and in Iraq and Khurasaan, where people spoke Persian, and North Africa (Al-Maghrib) where people spoke Berber, they taught the people of those countries to speak Arabic. Arabic then became the prevalent language in those lands. All people, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, spoke Arabic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also the case in Khurasaan in the past. Later, they became lax with regard to language and got used to speaking Persian until it became prevalent and Arabic was forgotten by most of them. This is without doubt disliked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is best to be accustomed in speaking Arabic. Young people will learn it in their homes and schools, and the symbol of Islam and its people will prevail. This will make it easier to understand the Qur‎an and Sunnah, and the words of the Salaf (pious predecessors &#8211; Sahabah, Tabi‎een etc).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Language has a clear and strong effect on one‎s thinking, behavior and religious commitment. It also helps one to resemble with the early generations of this Ummah, the Companions and the Tabi‎een. Being like them improves one‎s thinking, religious commitment and behavior.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, the Arabic language itself is part of Islam, and knowing Arabic is an obligatory duty. If it is a duty to understand the Qur‎an and Sunnah ‎ and they cannot be understood without knowing Arabic ‎ then the means needed to fulfill the duty also becomes obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) wrote to Abu Moosa Al-Ash‎aree (May Allah be pleased with him), ‎Learn the Sunnah and learn Arabic. Learn the Qur‎an in Arabic for it is Arabic.‎</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar (May Allah be pleased with him) also said, ‎Learn Arabic for it is part of your religion, and learn how the estate of the deceased should be divided (Faraa‎id) for these are part of your religion.‎</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This command of Umar, to learn Arabic and the Shariah combines the things that are needed, as religion involves understanding words and actions. Understanding Arabic is the way to understand the words of Islam, and understanding the Sunnah is the way to understand the actions of Islam‎‎.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Iqtidaa‎us-Siraatil-Mustaqeem</strong> (2/207). <strong>Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> (d. 728H) is one of the great and exceptional scholars known in Islamic history.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Istiqaamah Magazine, Issue No.6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>THE BASIS OF RIGHT GUIDANCE</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahallaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Religion of the Muslims is built upon following the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of His Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon. So these are the three infallible <i>usool</i> (fundamentals). So whatever the Ummah differs in, then it is referred back to Allaah and His Messenger. Thus, it is not for anyone to set-up a person for the Ummah, and to call to his way, and form <i>walaa</i> (love, loyalty and allegiance) and <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and hatred) based upon that, except for the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. Nor is any speech set-up for them based upon which they form <i>walaa</i> and <i>&#8216;adaa</i>, except for the speech of Allaah, and that of His Messenger, and that which the Ummah has agreed upon. Rather, this is the practice of the people of Innovation, who set-up a person, or a saying, with which they cause splits in the Ummah; forming <i>walaa</i> or<i> &#8216;adaa</i> based upon that saying or ascription.&#8221;1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; also said:<br />
&#8220;It is not for anyone to ascribe himself to a particular Shaykh and to have <i>walaa</i> with those who follow him, or to have <i>&#8216;adaa</i> based upon that. Rather, he should have <i>walaa</i> for everyone who is from the people of <i>eemaan</i> (i.e. is a Muslim) and is known to have <i>taqwaa</i> (piety and obedience to Allaah in that which He has ordered and prohibited), from the Shaykhs, or from others. No one should be particularised with an increase in <i>walaa</i> except if he sees from him greater <i>eemaan</i> and <i>taqwaa</i>. So precedence and excellence is given to whomsoever Allaah and His Messenger have given them to. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said: <b>&#8220;O mankind! Indeed We created you from a man and a woman, and made you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another. Indeed the most noblest of you with Allaah are those that have the most <i>taqwaa</i> (piety).&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Hujuraat 49:13].&#8221;2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>SECTARIANISM AND MISPLACED LOYALTIES</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslaam Ibn Taymiyyah said:<br />
&#8220;Indeed the people of the truth and the Sunnah do not follow anyone (unconditionally) other than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>; who does not speak from his desires, rather it is nothing less than Revelation sent down to him. So it is obligatory to affirm all that he informs, and to obey all that he commands. This status is not given to anyone else from this Ummah. Rather, every person&#8217;s saying can be taken or left, except that of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. So whoever sets up an individual other than Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>, such that the one who loves and agrees with him is reckoned to be from <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>, and the one that differs with him is reckoned to be from the people of innovations and sectarianism &#8211; as happens with those groups who follow certain Imaams of <i>kalaam</i> (theology and rhetorical speech) &#8211; then the person doing so is from the people of innovation, deviation and sectarianism.&#8221;3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; further said:<br />
&#8220;Indeed many &#8211; from the people who say such sayings &#8211; follow their desires in this, in order to elevate their egos, or to gain leadership; or whatever is connected to it. Their intention is not to make the word of Allaah uppermost, nor is it to make the Religion purely for Allaah. Indeed, they have hatred for those who oppose them &#8211; even if it is a <i>mujtahid</i> (a Scholar striving his utmost to arrive at the truth) who is excused, and whom Allaah is not angry with. Likewise, they are pleased with those who agree with them &#8211; even if it is an ignorant person with evil intentions, who neither has any knowledge, nor good intent. This leads them to praise those whom Allaah and His Messenger have not praised, and to censure those whom Allaah and His Messenger have not censured. It also causes them to have <i>walaa</i> (love and allegiance) and <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and hatred) based upon their own self-desires, not upon the Religion of Allaah and His Messenger &#8230; So whosoever does this will only bring about <i>fitan</i> (trials and discord) between the people.&#8221;4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>PRESERVING THE LOVE AND UNITY</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz &#8211; <i>hafidhahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Religion of Allaah orders to judge (with justice) in all matters, and not to have <i>walaa</i> (love, loyalty and allegiance) with your brother merely because he agrees with you, or to have <i>&#8216;adaa</i> (enmity and being distant) from him merely because he disagrees with you on a certain opinion or issue. This is not from justice at all! The Companions &#8211; <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhum</i> &#8211; differed in various issues, yet this did not affect the happiness and sincerity between them, nor their <i>walaa</i> and love for each other &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all. So the Believer acts upon the <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> (Prescribed and Divine Islaamic Law) of Allaah, follows the truth, gives priority to the evidences before anyone &#8211; yet in doing so, he does not oppress his brother, nor negate doing justice to him when he differs regarding any issue of <i>ijtihaad</i> in which the evidences are not so apparent. Likewise is the case for those issues in which differences occur due to a different interpretation of the text. So, in such instances he is excused, and it is upon you to sincerely advice him, and to love only the good for him, and not to split-up, nor to have enmity and hatred between you and your brother &#8211; and there is no might, nor any power, except with Allaah. &#8220;5</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Author:Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (rahimahullaah)<br />
Source:Majmoo&#8217; al-Fataawaa (vol. 32, pg. 289 – 290, 292)<br />
Produced by: al-manhaj.com[Begin Quote from Page 289]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) was asked about al-Khul‘:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Is Khul‘ considered divorce and is it counted as one of the three divorce pronouncements? Is it (Khul‘) still considered valid without intending divorce and saying the word Talaaq (or its equal)?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This issue has been an issue of great dispute between the Salaf (predecessors) and the Khalaf (contemporaries). The famous opinion in the Madh-hab of Al-Imaam Ahmad and his companions is that it (khul‘) is a permanent separation and complete dissolution of the marriage that is not to be incorporated as being from the three Talaaq pronouncements. Therefore if the man was to perform Khul‘ ten times (to the same woman, remarrying her after each Khul‘) then this is allowed for him as long as he remarries her with a new wedding contract (and its requisites – Dowry, etc.) even if she has not wed another man other than him (between each consecutive remarriage).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also one of the reported statements of Ash-Shafi‘ee. This has also been chosen and sponsored by a large majority of the Sahaabah. Another group of Sahaabah sponsored it but did not choose it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the position of the Jumhoor (overwhelming Majority) of the Fuqahaa of Hadeeth – Ishaaq bin Rahawiyah, Abu Thawr, Dawoud, Ibnul Mundhir, and Ibn Khuzaymah. It is also authentically established as a statement of Ibn ‘Abbaas (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) and his companions – Tawoos and ‘Ikrimah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second opinion (claims) that it (khul‘) is to be counted as one of the three divorce pronouncements. It is (also) reported as the statement from many amongst the Salaf. It is the opinion of Abu Haneefah, Maalik and one of the opinions of Ash-Shafi‘ee. Some claim it was his most recent verdict. It is also reported as one of the statements of Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They report narrations from ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan, ‘Alee and Ibn Mas‘ood (to support their position).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But we find that Imaam Ahmad and numerous others from the Imaams of Knowledge of Hadeeth (Scholars of Hadeeth) – Ibnul Mundhir, Ibn Khuzaymah, al-Bayhaqee and others – have declared (with evidence) that the narrations attributed to them (‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan, ‘Alee and Ibn Mas‘ood) are da‘eef (Weak and unsubstantiated).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The only authenticated narration is that which is reported from Ibn ‘Abbaas (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) that Kkul‘ is Fas-kh or dissolution and not Talaaq.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shafi‘ee himself stated we do not know the condition of the reporter of the narration of ‘Uthmaan – whether he is Thiqah (trusted) or other than Thiqah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore we establish that they (the holders of the second opinion) did not authenticate the narrations attributed to the Sahaabah. On the other hand they admitted that they did not know the authenticity of the narrations. Further, we know that no one from the scholars authenticated those narrations attributed to the Sahaabah stating that Khul‘ was to be counted (and dealt with) as an irrevocable Talaaq that is counted as one of the three pronouncements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, we report the Saheeh narration that ‘Uthmaan ordered a woman in the state of Khul‘ to wait only one menstrual cycle (before remarrying) to have Istibraa’ (prove that she is not pregnant from the previous husband). He stated to her: <strong>“You do not have ‘Iddah or waiting period (other than Istibraa’).”</strong> This proves that he deemed khul‘ a complete separation that was not divorce, since (the regulations of) Talaaq for the woman who has been entered upon (cohabited with her partner) that she must wait three Quroo’ (menstrual cycles) as is explicitly stated in the Qur’aan and the consensus of the Muslims (scholars). This of course is dissimilar to the state of Khul‘. In the authentic Sunnah and Athaar (narrations) of the Sahaabah, we see that the waiting period is Istibraa’. That is the opinion of Ishaaq, Ibnul Mundhir and others. It is also one of the two reported statements of Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbaas also permitted the return of a woman who had been divorced twice and was separated finally with a khul‘ to return to her husband without marrying another man before returning to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraheem bin Sa‘d bin Abee Waqaas asked Ibn ‘Abbaas about this issue when he was appointed by Az-Zubair as the custodian of Yemen . He said to Ibn ‘Abbaas (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) that the majority of Talaaq in Yemen was that of Fidaa’ – woman ransoming herself or Khul‘. Ibn ‘Abbaas (<em>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</em>) responded: <strong>“To pay to dissolve the marriage is not Talaaq. People have erred in labeling it.”</strong> Ibn ‘Abbaas then recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> “The divorce is twice, after that, either you retain her on reasonable terms or release her with kindness. And it is not lawful for you (men) to take back (from your wives) any of your Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) which you have given them, except when both parties fear that they would be unable to keep the limits ordained by Allaah (i.e. to deal with each other on a fair basis). Then if you fear that they would not be able to keep the limits ordained by Allaah, then there is no sin on either of them if she gives back (the Mahr or a part of it) for her Khul&#8217; (divorce). These are the limits ordained by Allaah, so do not transgress them. And whoever transgresses the limits ordained by Allaah, then such are the wrongdoers. And if he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband.”</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 229-230]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Abbaas then said: “Allaah mentions after (sanctioning) al-Fidyah or Khul‘ after two pronouncements of divorce that if <strong>“he has divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she has married another husband.”</strong> This incorporates al-Fidyah specifically and other than it in general. If Fidyah (Khul‘) were counted as Talaaq then the count would have been four.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also the famous statement reported from Ahmad and from the companions of Ibn ‘Abbaas..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[End quote from page 290]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Begin Quote from Page 292]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those from amongst the Fuqahaa who followed what was (erroneously) attributed to the Sahaabah that Khul‘ is to be counted as an irrevocable Talaaq were under the impression that they were authentic narrations. They did not posses the ability (resources) to be critical of these particular Athaar and distinguish the Saheeh from the Da‘eef. Only Imaam Ahmad (at that time) and his peers from like caliber scholars possessed the resources to weed out those narrations. Therefore those who reported the statements of the Sahaabah who differed with Ibn ‘Abbaas and his companions from the Sahaabah did not know that there was nothing authentically reported to dispute his authentically reported narrations.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Istiqaamah Magazine , Issue No.2 ,1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>DEFENDING THE RELIGION</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</strong> (d.241H)- <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;All praise is for Allaah who, in every age and intervals between the Prophets, raises up a group from the People of Knowledge, who call the misguided to guidance, patiently bearing ill treatment and harm. With the Book of Allaah they give life to the dead, and by Allaah&#8217;s Light they give sight to the blind. How many a person killed by Iblees (the Devil) have they revived. How many people astray and wandering have they guided. How beautiful their effect has been upon the people, and how vile people have been towards them. They expel from the Book of Allaah the alterations of those going beyond bounds, the false claims of the liars and the false interpretations of the ignorant ones &#8211; those who uphold die banner of innovation and let loose the trials and discords; who differ about the Book, oppose the Book, and agree upon opposing the Book. They speak about Allaah and His Book without knowledge, argue about what is ambiguous in the Book, and deceive the ignorant masses with such ambiguities. We seek refuge in Allaah from the trials of the misguided ones.&#8221; 1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> (d.728H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When some people asked Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal that they felt uneasy about criticizing people, he replied: <span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;If I were to remain silent, how would the ignorant masses know the truth from falsehood?&#8221;</span> Those who introduce heretical writings which oppose the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and those who innovate in matters of worship, then it is obligatory that they be exposed and that the Muslims be warned against them &#8211; by unanimous agreement of the Muslims Scholars. In fact, when Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal was asked about a person who fasted, preyed and secluded himself in the mosque for worship; if he was dearer to him than a person who spoke out against <i>ahlul-bid&#8217;ah</i> (the innovators), he replied: &#8220;<span style="color:#ff0000;">When he fasts and prays and secludes himself, then he does so for the benefit of his own self. However, when he speaks out against the innovators, he does so for the benefit of the Muslims in general, and this is more virtuous</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that openly opposing the innovators is of general benefit to the Muslims and is considered one of the types of <i>jihaad</i> in the path of Allaah. Since purifying the religion of Allaah and defending it from their attacks is a collective obligation &#8211; as is agreed upon by the Scholars. For Allaah did not raise up some people to oppose the innovators, then the religion would suffer harm, corruption and deviation. Indeed, this type of corruption is even greater then the corruption resulting from the disbelievers conquering the Muslims. Since when the disbelievers conquer the Muslims, they do not corrupt their hearts, nor their religion, except after some time. Whereas the innovators corrupt the hearts from the very beginning.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>UNITING THE RANKS UPON THE TRUTH</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz</strong> &#8211; hafidhahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is no doubt that it is obligatory upon the Muslims to unify their ranks and to unite their word upon the truth and to co-operate in goodness and piety against the enemies of Islaam &#8211; as Allaah, the Most Perfect, ordered them with in His saying: <b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not become divided.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:102]. And likewise, Allaah has warned the Muslims against splitting up, as occurs in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And do not be like those who differed and split-up after the clear evidences came to them.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:105]. However, the order to unify the Muslims and unite their word upon the truth and to hold fast to the rope of Allaah, does not necessitate that they should not censure wrong beliefs and practices &#8211; whether from the Soofees or other than them. Rather, what the order to hold fast to the rope of Allaah necessitates is: to order the good, forbid the evil and also to clarify the truth &#8211; with the clear <i>Sharee&#8217;ah</i> proofs &#8211; to whomsoever is misguided or has a mistaken opinion, until they unite upon the truth and turn away from that which opposes it. All of this is included in His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: &#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, and do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221; [Sooratul-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2]. And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Let there arise from amongst you a group of people calling to all that is good, enjoining the good and forbidding the evil, they are the ones who shall be successful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal&#8217;-lmraan 3:110]. And when the people of truth withhold from clarifying the mistakes of those who have erred or are mistaken, then they will not have achieved that which Allaah ordered them with, as regards calling to goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil. So the person in error will remain upon his error, and the one acting in opposition to the truth will remain upon his opposition. And this is contrary to what Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; prescribed, with regards sincere advice, co-operation upon goodness, ordering the good and forbidding the evil &#8211; and Allaah alone is the One who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin Baaz</strong> was asked about the correctness of the saying: &#8220;We should unite upon that which we agree, and excuse each other in that which we disagree.&#8221; The Shaykh commented:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Yes! It is obligatory to co-operate in that which we agree, by aiding the truth, calling to it and warning against that which Allaah and His Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> have prohibited. Its for excusing each other for that in which we differ &#8211; then this is not to be taken in an absolute sense, but rather in a general one. Thus, if the difference involves a particular issue of ijtihaad wherein the proofs are deep and detailed &#8211; then it is obligatory not to reproach or censure one another. However, if it opposes a clear text of the Book and the Sunnah, then it is obligatory to correct the one who has opposed the clear texts, but with wisdom, beautiful admonition and debating in the best possible manner, acting upon Allaah -the Most High&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;And help you one another in righteousness and piety, but do not help one another in sin and transgression.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:2] And His &#8211; the Most Perfect&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;The Believers &#8211; man and woman &#8211; are protectors to each other, they order the good and forbid the evil &#8230; &#8220;</b> [Soorah at-Towbah 9:71]. And His &#8211; the Mighty and Majestic&#8217;s &#8211; saying: <b>&#8220;Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful admonition, and argue with them in ways that are better.</b>&#8221; [Soorah an-Nahl 16:125]. And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever sees an evil, then let him change it with his hand. If he is unable to do this, then with his tongue, and if he is unable to do this, then with his heart. And that is the weakest of eemaan (faith).&#8221;</i> And he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;Whosoever directs a person to do good, will have a reward similar to the one who does that good.&#8221;</i> 5 And the <i>aayaat</i> (verses) and <i>ahaadeeth</i> with this meaning are plenty.&#8221; 6</p>

[©1998 Al-Hidaayah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This introduction is intended to briefly describe envy as a disease of the heart, preceding the text below it by Ibn Taymiyyah.</p>
<ol>
<li>Envy is one of the major sins which is bound to destroy good deeds as fast as the fire burns the wood and dry grass to ashes. “Jealousy eats away at good deeds, just as fire eats away at firewood.” [Sunan Ibn Majah]</li>
<li>Envy was described as a sickness by the Prophet, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam.</li>
<li>Envy is hating that good happens to others.</li>
<li>Envy is displeasure with Allah&#8217;s decree and His granting blessings upon others.</li>
<li>&#8220;Faith and envy do not go together in the heart of a servant.&#8221; [Ibn Hibban, saheeh]</li>
<li>&#8220;The people will be fine as long as they do not envy one another.&#8221; [At-Tabarani with trustworthy narrators]</li>
<li>Envy is a characteristic the Jews displayed towards the Prophet, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam, causing them to inflict him harm.</li>
<li>Envy leads to hatred.</li>
<li>The Prophet, sallallahu `alahi w sallam, described envy as a shearer of the religion.</li>
<li>Muslims are commanded in Soorah al-Falaq to seek refuge from the evil of the envier when he envies.</li>
<li>Envy is worse than miserliness; this is because the miser only stops himself from having good but the envier dislikes the favours of Allah bestowed upon His servants.</li>
<li>No one attains true belief until one loves for one’s brother what one loves for oneself.</li>
<li>It is said that the people who have the greatest degree of restlessness are the envious. Such a person has no peace and is continuously grieved.</li>
<li>The greatest harm from envy comes to the envier, who with one’s displeasure with Allah’s decree attains a great loss to oneself.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Mubarrad recited the following lines:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eye of the envier always sees scandal,<br />
bringing out faults and hiding the good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He meets you cheerfully, with a smiling face,<br />
while his heart conceals his true feelings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The envier’s enmity comes without provocation,<br />
yet he accepts no excuses while he attacks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The following is excerpted and adapted from Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s &#8220;Diseases of the Hearts and Their Cures&#8221; [©1998 Al-Hidaayah]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Strictly speaking, envy (hasad) is hatred and disliking the good condition of the envied one. This is of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) The blameworthy type of envy is unrestricted dislike of the blessings bestowed upon the envied. This is the type of jealousy that incurs blame, so when one hates something he is then hurt and grieved by the existence of what he hates, and this becomes a sickness in his heart such that he takes pleasure in the removal of the blessings from the envied even if this does not result in any benefit to him except the single benefit of having the pain that was in his soul removed. But this pain is not removed except as a result of his continuously watching the envied so that the jealous person finds relief when the blessing is removed, but then it becomes more severe as is the case of the one who is sick, for it is possible that this blessing, or one similar to it, returns to the envied. This is why the second group said: &#8216;It is a desire to have the blessings removed,&#8217; for indeed the one who dislikes the blessings bestowed upon other than him desires them to see removed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) That he dislikes the superiority of that person over him, and he desires to be like him or better, so this is jealousy and has been called <i>ghubta</i>, and the Prophet, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam, called it <i>hasad</i> in the hadeeth reported by both al-Bukhari and Muslim from the hadeeth of ibn Mas`ood and ibn `Umar, radiyallahu `anhumaa, that he, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam, said, &#8220;There is no envy except in two cases: a person to whom Allah has granted wisdom, and he rules by this and teaches it to the people, and a person to whom Allah has granted wealth and property along with this the power to spend it in the cause of Truth.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This being the wording of Ibn Mas`ood. The wording of Ibn `Umar is, &#8220;A person to whom Allah has given the Qur&#8217;an and he recites it night and day, and a person to whom Allah has granted wealth and property from which he gives in charity night and day.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;So the Prophet, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam, forbade <i>hasad</i>, with the exception of two cases which are referred to as <i>al-ghubta</i>, meaning that a person love the condition of someone else and dislikes that this person be superior in this way (without his wishing that it be removed from that person).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it is asked: &#8216;Then why is this (<i>ghubta</i>) called envy when he loves only that Allah bestow these blessings upon him?&#8217; It is said, &#8216;The starting point of this love is his looking towards the favors Allah has bestowed upon someone else and his disliking that this person be favored over him. So if this other person were not present then he would not have desired these blessings. So because the starting point of this love is this dislike that someone else be made superior to him, then this is called envy due to the love following the dislike. As for desiring that Allah bestows favors upon him without consideration of people&#8217;s material conditions then this is not envy at all.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the generality of mankind have been tried with this second type of envy that has also been called <i>al-munaafasah</i> (competition) because two people compete in a single desired matter, both of them trying to attain the same good. The reason for their trying to attain it is that one of them dislikes that the other be blessed with this matter over him just as any one of two competitors dislikes that the other beat him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Competition is not considered blameworthy in general, rather it is considered to be praiseworthy when competing for righteousness. The Exalted said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed the pious will be in delight. On thrones, looking on. You will recognize in their faces the brightness of delight. They will be given to drink pure sealed wine. The last thereof (that wine) will be the smell of Musk, and for this let those compete who want to compete.&#8221; [Al-Mutaffifeen (83):22-26]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So one is commanded to compete for these delights and not compete for the delight of this fleeting world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;The souls do not envy the one who is in severe hardship and this is why the Prophet, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam, did not mention it even though the mujaahid, fighting in the Way of Allah, is superior to the one who is spending wealth&#8230;. Similarly, the Prophet, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam, did not mention the one who prays, fasts and performs the pilgrimage, because there is no tangible benefit attained from the people for these actions by which the person can be exalted or disgraced, as can be attained in teaching and spending.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fundamentally, envy occurs when someone else attains power and authority; otherwise the one who is performing these actions is not normally envied, even if this person be blessed with far more food, drink and wives than others, as opposed to these two blessings of power and authority, for they cause a great deal of envy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah praised the Ansaar with His saying<b>, &#8220;And they have no jealously in their breasts for that which they have been given (the muhaajiroon), and give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that.&#8221; [Al-Hashr (59):9]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the jealousy that is totally blameworthy then Allah has said with regards to the Jews, <b>&#8220;Many of the People of the Book wish that if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, out of envy from their own selves even after the truth has become clear to them.&#8221; [Al-Baqarah (2):109]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;They wish&#8217; meaning that they hope to make you aspostisise from your religion out of jealousy. So jealousy was the deciding factor behind their wish even after the Truth had been made clear to them. This because when they saw you attain what you attained of blessings &#8211; in fact they saw you attain that which they themselves had never attained &#8211; they became jealous of you. Similarly this is mentioned in another verse, <b>&#8220;Or do they envy men for what Allah has given them of His bounty? Then We have already given the family of Abraham the Book of Wisdom, and conferred upon them a great kingdom. Of them were (some) who believed in him (Muhammad) and of them were some who averted their faces from him and enough is Hell for burning (them)&#8230;&#8221; [An-Nisaa&#8217; (4): 54-55]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Say: I seek refuge with the Lord of the Daybreak. From the evil of what He has created. And from the evil of the darkening (night) as it comes with its darkness. And from the evil of the witchcrafts when they blow in the knots. And from the evil of the envier when he envies.&#8221; [Al-Falaq (113):1-5]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;So the one who is jealous, hating the favours bestowed by Allah upon someone else is an oppressor, going beyond bounds due to this. As for the one who dislikes that someone else be blessed and wishes to be blessed in the same way, then this is forbidden for him except in that which will bring him closer to Allah. So if he were to wish for something that has been given to someone else which would help bring him closer to Allah then there is no problem in this. However, his wishing for it in his heart, without looking to the condition of someone else is better and more excellent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then if this person were to act, dictated by this jealousy, he would be an oppressor going beyond bounds, deserving of punishment unless he repents&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jealousy is one of the sicknesses of the soul, and it is an illness that afflicts the generality of mankind and only a few are secure from it. This is why it is said, &#8220;The body is never free from jealousy, but debasement brings it out, and nobility hides it.&#8221; It was said to Al-Hasan Al-Basree, &#8220;Can a believer be envied?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;What has made you forget Yoosuf and his brothers, have you no father? But you should keep (this envy should it occur) blinded in your heart, for you cannot be harmed by that which you did not act upon in speech or action.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who finds that he harbours jealousy in his soul towards someone else, then it is upon him to treat it with patience and taqwaa of Allah, and dislike it being in his soul&#8230; As for the one who actually takes a stance against the envied, either with words or actions then he will be punished for this, and the one who fears Allah and is patient and does not become one of the oppressors &#8211; Allah will benefit him for his taqwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;In the hadeeth there occurs, &#8220;There are three sins from which no one can be saved: jealousy, suspicion and omens. Shall I tell you of what will remove you from this: When you envy do not hate, when you are suspicious then do not actualise your suspicions, and when you see omens then ignore them.&#8221; Reported by Ibn Abi Ad-Dunya from the hadeeth of Abu Hurayrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Sunan from the Prophet, sallallahu `alaihi wa sallam, &#8220;You have been afflicted with the illness of the nations that came before you &#8211; jealousy and hatred. They are the shearers, I do not mean the shearers of the hair, rather they are the shearers of the religion.&#8221; [At-Tirmidhi, at-Tabaranee and al-Hakim who said it was saheeh].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he called jealousy an illness just as he called miserliness an illness in his saying, &#8220;And what illness is worse than miserliness.&#8221; [Ahmad, Hakim and others, saheeh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;In the first hadeeth jealousy was mentioned along with hatred. This is because the envier, first of all dislikes the bounty bestowed by Allah upon the one who is envied, and then begins hating this person. This is because the hatred of the thing being bestowed leads to hatred of the one upon whom it is bestowed, for when the blessings of Allah are bestowed upon an individual, he would love that they go away, and they would not go away except by the one who is envied going away, therefore he hates him and loves that he not be there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jealousy necessarily leads to desire and hatred just as Allah informed us of those that came before us that they differed, <b>&#8220;After there came to them knowledge out of mutual hatred and desire.&#8221; [Aal `Imraan (3):19]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Do not envy one another, do note hate each other, do not oppose each other…” [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“By the One in Whose Hands is my soul, none of you believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.” [Al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Greed is a sickness as is miserliness, and jealousy is worse than miserliness, as occurs in the hadeeth, “Jealousy eats away at good deeds, just as fire eats away at firewood.” [Sunan Ibn Majah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because the miser only stops himself from having good but the envier dislikes the favours of Allah bestowed upon His servants.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By: Shaykul Islam Ibn Taymiyyah &#8211; <i>Majmoo&#8217; Fataawaa</i> (28/50-57)<br />
Source: Al-Istiqaamah<br />
Issue No.6 &#8211; Dhul-Qa&#8217;dah 1417H / March 1997</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. Indeed Allaah &#8211; to whom belongs all praise &#8211; has bestowed upon me immense grace, great favours and generous blessings which necessitates immense gratitude, being firm upon obedience to Him, and becoming accustomed to having beautiful patience in that which He ordered. Indeed, a servant is ordered to have <i>sabr</i> (patience) in times of ease more so than in times of hardship. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;But if we let man taste the good favours after poverty and harm has touched him, he is sure to boastfully say: Harm has departed from me. Indeed he is exultant, boastful and ungrateful to Allaah, Except those who show patience and do deeds of righteousness and obedience to Allaah, for them will be forgiveness and a great reward.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Hood 11:10-11].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you all know that Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; has blessed this affair 2 with such blessings which contain the means to aid His Religion, raise high His Word, aid His Army, and grant honour to His <i>Awliyaa</i> (pious and righteous servants). It is also the cause for strengthening <i>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> and causing humiliation to the people of innovations and sectarianism. Likewise, it is also the cause for affirming that which has been affirmed by yourselves from the <i>Sunnah</i> (regarding the truth of this matter), and a cause for increasing this by opening up the avenues of guidance, victory and proofs: such that the truth becomes known to the people, who none but Allaah can enumerate. It is also a cause for the masses to begin to accept the way of the <i>Sunnah</i> and the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>; as well as countless other favours. All of this must therefore be accompanied by immense gratitude to Allaah, as well as having patience &#8211; even ii this patience is in times of ease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you all know that from the great principles which sum up the Religion is: Uniting the hearts, unifying the word, and reconcilination between each other, as Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;So fear and obey Allaah, and reconcile the matters of differences between yourselves.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Anfaal 8:10].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And hold fast altogether to the rope of Allaah and do not split-up.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:103].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not be like those who split-up and differed after the clear proofs came to them. For those there will be a severe punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah Aal-&#8216;lmraan 3:105].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And other examples like this from the texts (of Revelation), which order us with the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> (unity upon the way of the Companions) and coming together, and prohibit splitting and differing. And the people who most exemplify this principle are <i>Ahlul-Jamaa&#8217;ah</i> (the people of the <i>Jamaa&#8217;ah</i>); just as the people who most exemplify leaving it are the people of sectarianism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that which sums up the <i>Sunnah</i> is: Obedience to the Messenger. This is why the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said:<i> &#8220;Indeed Allaah is pleased with three things: That you worship Allaah alone without associating any partner along with Him; that you holdfast all together to the Rope of Allaah and not to become split-up; and that you give sincere advice to whomsoever Allaah put in charge of your affairs.</i><i></i><i>&#8220;</i>3</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the <i>Sunan</i> collections from the <i>hadeeth</i> of Zayd ibn Thaabit and Ibn Mas&#8217;ood &#8211; who were both great <i>fuqahaa</i> (Scholars of deep understanding) &#8211; who relate that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> said: <i>&#8220;May Allaah enliven whosoever hears my words, memorises them and then conveys them to others. Many a carrier of knowledge does not understand it, and many a carrier of knowledge conveys it to one who has better understanding. There are three things which the heart of a Believer has no malice about: Sincerity for Allaah in one&#8217;s action; sincere advice to those in authority and clinging to the Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221;</i>4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his saying: <i>&#8220;has no malice&#8221;</i> means not having any contempt for them. So the heart of a Muslim does not hate these characteristics. On the contrary, it loves them and is pleased with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first thing which I shall begin with regarding this principle is what is connected to myself. So you all know &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with you all &#8211; that I do not desire any harm at all &#8211; inwardly or outwardly &#8211; for anyone from the general masses of the Muslims, let alone our colleagues and companions. Nor do I harbour any ill-feeling towards anyone of them, nor do I blame them for anything at all. Rather, to me they are deserving of nobility, love, honour and respect, over and over &#8211; each in accordance with their level. And a person cannot be except (one of three types): Someone who sincerely strives to ascertain the truth; and is correct, or one who sincerely strives to ascertain the truth; but errs, or a sinful person. As for the first, then he is rewarded and thanked. The second is rewarded for his <i>ijtihaad</i> (striving to ascertain the truth), and is forgiven and excused for his error. As for the third, then may Allaah forgive us, and him, and all the Believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we should not try to dwell upon the words of those who opposed this fundamental; by saying that so and so is deficient, or so and so did not act, or so and so was the cause of harm to the Shaykh, or was the reason why all this occurred, or so and so used to speak about the plots of so and so; and other such similar statements which contain criticism of some of our colleagues and brothers. For indeed do not allow them to harm the brothers and colleagues in this manner, and there is no might, nor any power except with Allaah.5</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the likes of this criticism actually returns to the one who said it in the first place, unless he has good deeds by which Allaah will forgive him &#8211; if He wills &#8211; and indeed Allaah does forgive that which has preceded. And you also all know about the harsh treatment that was given to some of the brothers in Damascus, and that which occurs even now in Egypt. This &#8211; in reality &#8211; is not due to a deficiency or shortcoming in the brothers, nor has it occurred because we have changed our views and hate them. Rather, such people, after receiving such harsh treatment increase in the status, love and respect that we have for them. For indeed the likes of these trials are beneficial to the Believers, because Allaah corrects and improves them due to it. Since the Believer to another Believer is like each of a pair of hands, each washes the other. However, it sometimes happens that dirt cannot be removed except with a certain amount of roughness, but that brings about cleanliness and softness, for which that roughness is praised &#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You (also) all know that much of what has occurred in this matter were lies, false accusations, false suspicions, and the following of false desires, the likes of which cannot be described. So all those lies and false accusations that were directed against me, are actually a source of goodness and blessing for me. Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Indeed those who brought forward the lie are a small group amongst you. However, do not think that it is an evil for you. rather, it is good for you. And every person amongst them will be paid the sin of what they earned. And as for the one who took on the leading role in this, his will be a severe punishment.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:11].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So through such trials, Allaah manifests the light of truth and its clear proofs, which repel the falsehood and lies. So I do not desire to take revenge upon any of those who lied against me, or oppressed me, or showed enmity and hatred towards me. For indeed I forgive every Muslim, and I love only the good for them, and I desire for every Muslim the good that I desire for myself As for those who lied and did wrong, then I have excused and forgiven them. However, whatever is connected to violating the Rights of Allaah in this affair, then they should seek <i>tawbah</i> (repentance). So if they turn to Allaah in repentance, then Allaah will turn to them in forgiveness, otherwise the Judgement of Allaah will apply to them. So if a person were to be thanked for his evil actions, then I thank all those who were the cause for this (trial) to happen to me &#8211; for it entails all the good of this world and the Hereafter. However, Allaah is thanked for His good blessings and favours by which no affair happens to a Believer, except that there is good for him in it. And the people of good intentions are thanked for their intentions, and the people of good actions are thanked for their actions. And as for those who did evil &#8211; then we ask Allaah that He turns to them in forgiveness. And you all know that this is from my nature and character.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, you all know that Abu Bakr as-Siddeeq <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i>, concerning the matter of <i>al-lfq</i> (the Lie against &#8216;Aaishah, his daughter, and wife of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>), about which Allaah revealed some Verses of the Qur&#8217;aan, so he swore that he would not give any more charity to Mistaah ibn Athaathah; because Mistaah was one of those who participated in the Lie. So Allaah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And let not those amongst you who have been blessed with grace and wealth swear not to give any help or support to their relatives, or to the poor and needy, or to those who migrated in the path of Allaah. Rather, let them pardon and be forgiving. Do you not love that Allaah should forgive you? And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</b> [Soorah an-Noor 24:22].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when this Verse was revealed, Abu Bakr <i>radiallaahu &#8216;anhu</i> said: &#8220;Rather, by Allaah! I love that Allaah should forgive me.&#8221; So he continued to give to Mistaah the aid and charity that he used to give before.6 So with forgiveness and kind treatment towards one another, and doing <i>Jihaad</i> (fighting and striving) in Allaah&#8217;s Path, then it is a must that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah will bring a people whom He will love, and they will love Him; soft, humble and gentle with the Believers, stern towards the unbelievers, fighting in the path of Allaah, and never afraid of the blame of the blamers. That is the Grace of Allaah which He bestows upon whosoever He Wills. And Allaah suffices for the needs of His creation, the All-Knower. Indeed your <i>Walee</i> (protector and guardian) is Allaah, His Messenger, and the Believers; those who offer the Prayer correctly, and give Zakaah, and who bow down in obedience to Allaah. And whosoever takes Allaah, and His Messenger, and the Believers as protectors and guardians, then it is the party of Allaah who will be victorious.&#8221;</b> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:53-55].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Was-salaamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaahi wa barakaatuhu.</i></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <i>Majmoo&#8217; Fataawaa</i> (28/50-57), slightly abridged.<br />
2. The affair being referred to is the first of Ibn Taymiyyah&#8217;s unjust imprisonment &#8211; a period of one and a half years, in the year 705H &#8211; which occurred due to some lies and false accusations against him.<br />
3. Related by Muslim (3/1340) and Ahmad (2/367).<br />
4. <b>Saheeh</b>: Related by Ahmad (4/80) and Ibn Maajah (no.230). It was authenticated by al-Albaanee in <i>as-Saheehah</i> (no.404).<br />
5. This is in reference to some of their colleagues and brothers in Damascus, who weakened during this ordeal, and did not remain firm upon the correct methodology. So Ibn Taymiyyah is prohibiting any of his students and collegues from harming them in any way, and makes an excuse for them, and explains that he bears no ill-feeling or hatred in his heart towards any of them. Rather, he makes it clear that he has respect for them, and loves them for the sake of Allaah.<br />

Produced by:al-manhaj.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Prophet’s statement: <b>“Anyone who possesses a speck of pride (kibr) in his heart will not enter Paradise”</b> – Is this hadeeth specific only to the believers or (is it specific only to the) unbelievers? If we were to say that it is specific for the Believers then (is not) our statement trivial considering (the fact that) the believers shall enter Paradise due to their Eemaan. If, on the other hand, we were to say that the hadeeth is specific for the unbelievers then what is the relevance of the statement (since it is already known that the unbelievers shall not gain admission to Paradise?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Another) authentically reported wording of (this particular version of the) hadeeth is, <b>“Anyone who possesses half a mustard seed of Pride (kibr) in his heart will not be granted admission to Paradise. And anyone who possesses half a mustard seed of Eemaan will not enter the (Eternal) Fire.”</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kibr that openly opposes and negates Eemaan results in the banishment of the one who holds it from entering al-Jannah as is found in Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“And your Lord said: &#8220;Invoke Me, I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn (yastakbiroon – Have kibr) My worship, they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!&#8221;</b> [Surah Ghaafir: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Kibr of Iblees (the Devil), Pharaoh and all the others who possessed the Kibr, which invalidated Eemaan. This is also the Kibr that the Jews possess and those whom Allaah has described to us by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Is it that whenever there came to you a Messenger with what you yourselves desired not, you grew arrogant? Some, you disbelieved and some, you killed.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Kibr, in its entirety, openly opposes the essentials of al-Eemaan. As such he who has an atom’s weight of Kibr in his heart will not act upon that which Allaah has prescribed, nor will he abstain from that which Allaah has prohibited. Instead his Kibr shall result in his disavowal and rejection of the truth and instill in him contempt of others. This, precisely, is the explanatory definition of al-Kibr provide by the Prophet as is found in the complete version of the initial Hadeeth [<b>“The one who possesses an atom’s weight of Kibr in his heart shall not be granted admission to Paradise.”</b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) was asked: “[But] O Messenger of Allaah! A man likes to have fine clothing and footwear. Is this included in Kibr?” He responded, “No. Allaah is Beauty and loves Beauty. Kibr is the rejection of truth (<i>Batrul-Haqq</i>) and condescension of others (<i>waa ghaamtun-naas</i>).” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement “<i>Batarul-Haqq</i>” denotes distain and rejection of the Truth, while “<i>ghaamtun-naas</i>” implies contempt and condescension of others from amongst mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the one who possesses half a mustard seed of it (Kibr) rejects the Truth that he was ordered to accept and act upon. At the same time, the Kibr instills in him a sense of condescension that inculcates in the individual an oppressive demeanor producing transgression over the rights of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who neglects his obligations (due to his rejection of them) and is oppressive to others from amongst the creation is not to be amongst the people of Jannah (while in this state), or deserving of it. On the contrary, such an individual is to be counted amongst the people who are threatened with punishment!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) statement: <b> “Anyone who possesses a speck of Kibr in his heart will not be granted admission to Paradise”</b> implies that the individual is not from the people of Jannah and is not deserving of it. But if he repents, or he possesses <i>Hasaanaat</i> (righteous deeds) that expiate his sins, or Allaah has given him <i>Ibtillaah</i> (trials and tests) in the form of calamities that have expunged his sins, or similar things; then for that individual the recompense of Kibr – which originally was a barrier for him to enter Jannah – is eliminated and he gains admission (to it). Similarly Allaah, due to Divine Grace, may forgive the individual (the sin of) Kibr. [3] None shall gain admission (to Paradise) while possessing an atom’s weight of Kibr. As a result, those (scholars) discussing this Hadeeth, and other Hadeeth that have a similar theme, have stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Unconditional admission (to Paradise) – that is not in conjunction with punishment (for the sin of Kibr) – is what is being negated in this Hadeeth; not the admission to Jannah that is granted to those who have entered the Fire (to be purified and cleansed) and then are allowed admission to Paradise thereafter. (On the other hand) if a hadeeth explicitly declares that a particular person is in Jannah or that a particular person is from the People of Jannah, it would then be understood that he would enter the Jannah and not enter the fire (beforehand).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this clarification we come to understand the true meaning of these narrations as being that the one who possesses an atom’s weight of Kibr in his heart is not from the people of Paradise (up to that point) and shall not gain admission into it without punishment (for his sin). Surely he deserves punishment – due to the enormity of the sin – similar to those who perform the Major (<i>Kabaa’ir</i>) sins. Allaah may punish him in the Fire as long as He wishes, but none from amongst the people of Tawheed shall remain in the Fire eternally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is to be the way we understand all the Hadeeth that have a similar meaning. This understanding is to be used when seeking the meaning of his (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) statement: <b>“The one who severs the ties of the womb shall not enter Jannah”</b>[4] or <b>“You shall not enter Jannah until you believe. And you shall not believe until you love one another. Shall I inform you of something that if you do you shall (truly) love each other? Spread the greetings of Salaam amongst yourselves.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the understanding that we are to have when pondering over the ahaadeeth that contain threats of Punishment. In this way we understand that the hadeeth is general and can be attributed to both the unbelievers and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one was to say: “All the Muslims enter Jannah due to their Islaam.” The response is that not all Muslims enter Jannah without punishment. Surely the people who have been threatened (with punishment in the Hereafter due to their sins) shall enter into the Fire to remain in it for the period that Allaah so wills even though they are not unbelievers. The individual who has some Eemaan coinciding with major sins may enter into the Fire and exit from it as a result of the <i>Shafaa‘ah</i> (Intercession) of the Prophet or by other reported means as articulated by the Prophet when he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“My Shafaa‘ah is for the people who commit Majors Sins from amongst my Ummah.”</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said as is reported in the Saheeh: <b>“I shall bring out of the Fire the one who possesses half a mustard seed of Eemaan.”</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way we understand what is in store for those whom Allaah has threatened with punishment – the murderer, fornicator/adulterer, the one who consumes intoxicants, and the one who misappropriates the wealth of the orphans, the one who witnesses falsehood and others who perform the deeds of the people of major sins. They – even if they are not unbelievers – are not deserving of the Jannah that they are promised (as Muslims) without first being (cleansed and purged through) punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The madh-hab (way and belief) of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa‘ah is that the <i>Foosaaq</i> (deviant sinners) from amongst the general body of Muslims are not going to be eternally punished in the Fire as held by the Khawaarij[7] and the Mu‘tazilah.[8] They are not complete in their religion (Deen), Eemaan and obedience to Allaah.[9] They have good and bad deeds that necessitate a measure of punishment and reward. This is a concise dissertation regarding the issue.</p>

Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: Reported by Imaam Muslim, Abu Dawood and At-Tirmidhee on the authority of Ibn Mas‘ood. See <i>Islaah al-Masaajid</i>, checked by Shaykh Al-Albaanee <i>rahimahullaah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Note: Reported by Imam Muslim (54), Ibn Khuzaymah, Abu Dawood, At-Tirmidhee and Ibn Sa‘d on the authority of Ibn Mas‘ood. At-Tabaraanee reports it on the authority of ‘Abdullah bin Salaam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Note: Allaah the Most High says in Surah an-Nisaa’ (4:48): <b>“Verily, Allaah forgives not that partners should be set up with him in worship, but He forgives what is besides that to whom He pleases, and whoever sets up partners with Allaah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Note: Reported by Imaam Muslim (1765 – Abridged) al-Haakim, al-Bayhaqee, Abu Dawood, and at-Tirmidhee on the authority of Jubayr bin Mut‘aam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Translator’s Note: Turn to the Chapter <b> “Shafaa‘ah for the People of Major Sins”</b> (Pg. 61-108) in the highly beneficial book of the world-renowned Muhaddith, Shaykh Muqbil bin Haadee al-Waadi‘ee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) titled: “Ash-Shafaa‘ah.” In the chapter the Shaykh reports seventy-six (76) ahaadeeth showing that those who perform Major sins are not excluded from the <i>Shafaa‘ah</i> of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). This particular hadeeth can be found in the book on page 85, hadeeth number 56. Shaikh Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Muqbil bin Haadee reports that the Hadeeth is collected by at-Tirmidhee (v. 4, pg. 45) on the authority of Anas and Jaabir. He then states: “And this hadeeth is Hasan Saheeh Ghareeb (good and authentic yet scarce in this mode). The Hadeeth is reported by Ibn Khuzaymah (pg. 270), Ibn Hibbaan as is stated in the Mawrid (pg. 640), and al-Haakim (vol. 1, pg. 69) said: ‘This hadeeth is authentic and meets the requirements set by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim even though they did not narrate it.’” Later on Shaykh Muqbil wrote: “Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer (vol. 1, pg. 487) that its chain of narration is Saheeh and meets the requirements set by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim.” The Shaykh then takes us step by step through the chain of narration and proves convincingly that the hadeeth does not meet the requirements of Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim due to the presence of Mu‘aamar reporting from Thaabit. For further detailed analysis turn to pg. 85-88. In Shaykh al-Albaani’s Saheeh al-Jaami‘, he declares the hadeeth Saheeh on the authority of Jaabir, Ibn ‘Abbas, Ibn ‘Umar, Ka‘b bin ‘Ajrah and Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Translator’s Note: This is a segment of the famous Hadeeth of Shafaa‘ah collected by Al-Bukhaaree (vol. 13, pg. 472)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Translator’s Note: Khawaarij is the plural of Kharijee – They are those who declared that a Muslim becomes a disbeliever due to committing a major sin alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Translator’s Note: The Mu‘tazilah deem the one who does not agree with their understanding of Tawheed (7 false principles) is deemed a Mushrik. They believe that the sinners who are Muslim shall be in a place between Jannah and the Fire. Their beliefs are built on false logical deductions that led them to negate many of the Names and Attributes of Allaah. They were the deviant group who opposed the Imaam of Ahlus-Sunnah, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal by falsely claiming that the Qur’aan is created and not the Speech of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Translator’s Note: The Murji’ah believe that sins, major or minor, do not affect faith and that Eemaan neither increases nor decreases. They claim that actions are not part of faith and that people do not vary in faith.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah -Rahimullaah- mentions in his explanation of the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">ادعوا ربَّكم تضرُّعًا وخُفيةً إنه لايحبُّ المعتدين…</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. <strong>[al-Aaraaf: 55]</strong></p>
<p>there are ten benefits of hiding your Dua’, and from amongst these benefits he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed the greatest of blessings is turning to Allaah and worshipping Him. Every blessing has the equivalent of it being envied by an envious person, whether openly or secretly. There is no greater blessing than of turning to Allaah and worshipping Him [making Dua&#8217;], indeed the souls of the envious are attached to that blessing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing more secure for the person who is envied than hiding his blessing from the envious person. Indeed Yaqoob said to Yusuf -alayhi as-Sallam:</p>
<h4 style="text-align:center;">قَالَ يَا بُنَيَّ لاَ تَقْصُصْ رُؤْيَاكَ عَلَى إِخْوَتِكَ فَيَكِيدُواْ لَكَ كَيْدًا</h4>
<p style="text-align:center;">&lt; &lt; O my son! Relate not your vision to your brothers, lest they arrange a plot against you &gt; &gt;</p>
<p>till the end of the Ayaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many of the people who have hearts, a connection and status with Allaah Ta’ala may perhaps have spoken about it, and informed people about it, and the envious one tried to plunder him over these blessings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why the righteous and elderly are advised to keep their secrets with Allaah Ta’ala, and not to allow anyone to be acquainted with them.<br />
This issue of hiding the blessing is of great benefit, its people know is benefits. Therefore, if it is commanded to do so in your Dua’/supplications, then this also includes the Dua’ for requesting this, and the Dua’ of praising Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Living and turning to Allaah Ta’ala is from the great treasures which has a right to be hidden from the eyes of the envious.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[From: &#8216;Majmoo al-Fatawa&#8217; 15/18-19]</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullâh, d. 728) wrote in “Kitâb-ul-Îmân”:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer is put to trial by the whisperings of the Devil and disbelieving thoughts that makes him feel bad/distress. The companions used to say: &#8220;Oh Messenger of Allâh! o­ne of us feels something of such a nature that he would rather fall down from the heaven than to utter it.&#8221; He (sallâ Allâhu ‘alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;That is true faith&#8221; (Ahmad 2/397 and Muslim 1/83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that these whispers and thoughts one feels, while one hates them and repels them from the heart, is part of true faith. This can be likened to the warrior who fights his enemy until he overpowers him. <strong>This is the greatest type of Jihâd and a faith that is as pure as pure milk</strong>. And the reason as to why it is pure, is that one hates and fights the devilish thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All creatures are subjected to these thoughts and whisperings. There are those humans that answer them and they then become disbelievers or hypocrites. And there are those whom have fallen so deeply into sins and desires, that they are first affected by these thoughts when they start to seek the religion. So the person either becomes a believer or a hypocrite. Thus, the humans often tend to get these whispers when they perform the prayer. The Devil will most often come when the servant wants to turn to his Lord and come closer to Him and have contact with Him. That is why the praying ones get thoughts that the non-praying ones do not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p align="center"><strong>Repelling the consequences of sinning</strong></p>
<p align="center">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p><strong> </strong>Shaykh ul-Islaam Ahmad bin AbdulHaleem <strong>Ibn Taymeeyah</strong> (d.728 A.H.) <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p>‘It has been established in the ‘Saheeh’ of al-Bukhari from the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> that he said:</p>
<p align="center">‘Indeed one’s actions are judged by his final actions.’</p>
<p>Therefore, if the believer commits evil than its consequences are repelled from him with ten means:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">That he repents, by which Allaah turns to him, since indeed the one who repents from a sin is like the one who has no sin at all.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or that the person seeks forgiveness from Allaah and Allaah forgives him.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or he does good actions to wipe out that sin, since indeed good deeds take away evil deeds.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or that his believing brothers supplicate for him and seek forgiveness for him, whether he is alive or deceased.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or relay to him the reward of his actions, those with which Allaah benefits him by.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or that his Prophet Muhammad intercedes for him.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or Allaah trials him in the Dunya with problems and difficulties expiate his sins.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or Allaah trials him in al-Barzakh (the stage after death until the Day of Judgment) with Fitnah and being squeezed in the grave, which expiate his sins.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or Allah trials him with events of al-Qayyama (Resurrection) due to the horror at that time, which expiate his sins.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Or The Most Merciful [Allaah] of those who show mercy has mercy upon him.</li>
</ol>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Mu’tazilah</em> (from <em>i’tazala</em>, “to remove oneself” or “to withdraw”) is one of the philosophical schools whose doctrines were affected by Greek philosophy. Originally the sect was established by Waasil Ibn ‘Ataa’ (80-131Hj/699-748 C.E.), who withdrew (<em>i’tazala</em>) from the circle of <strong>al-Hasan al-Basri</strong> (d.110Hj/728) because of his opposing view that the Muslim who commits a grave sin was neither a believer nor a <em>kaafir</em> , but somewhere between the two (<em>manzilah baynal- manzilatayn</em> ). This marked the beginning of this so-called rationalistic sect. In its early stages its concepts were close to those of the<em> Khaarijites</em>. In the third century of Hijrah, the <em>Mu’tazilah</em> became  influenced by the <em>Shee’ah. </em>The <em>Mu’tazilites</em> teachings were further developed under the influence of the Greek and Persian ideologies leading to the birth of <em>‘ilmul kalaam </em>(scholastic theology).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the main corrupt beliefs of the <em>Mu’tazilites</em> include:</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong>  Denying the Attributes of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(2)  </strong>Claiming that the Qur’aan is created. They were able to influence the <strong>Caliph al-Ma’moon</strong> (in 212Hj/827) and enforce this belief along with other distortions. Their scrutiny was a virtual inquisition. Many scholars were jailed and/or killed. Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal was tortured and jailed for his great stand defending the truth held by the <em>salaf</em> that the Qur’aan is the uncreated literal Word of Allaah. His great stand together with afew other scholars, led to the decline of the <em>fitnah, </em>and the <em>Mu’tazilite </em>doctrine was suppressed under the <strong>Caliph al-Mutawakkil</strong> (ruled 232-247Hj/ 847-861).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(3)</strong>  Claiming that man’s action is totally independent from Allaah’s Will. This is in direct opposition to what the Qur’aan and <em>sunnah</em> have affirmed, namely that man has the ability and the will to act, but like all other things, nothing escapes the Will of Allaah, the Most High. [107]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>(4)  </strong>Denying the general intercession for the sins committed by the disobedient Muslims and which Allaah approved for the Prophet (Peace be upon him) and others on the Day of Resurrection [See earlier in the text].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Blended under the title of “rational” this sect exists nowadays without openly carrying the same title it once held. The approach and methodology of those who make the intellectual proofs supersede the text (from the Qur’aan and <em>sunnah</em> ) is widespread. The opposite extreme is those who believe that rational evidences has no role whatsoever in implying many things which the textual evidences have proven. The medium path is that of the <em>salaf</em> , which affirms an implicative relationship between the textual evidences and intellectual proofs. The <em>shar’</em> (the Qur’aan and authentic <em>sunnah</em>) <span style="text-decoration:underline;">lead and guide</span> to the intellectual proofs and the latter <span style="text-decoration:underline;">share in guiding</span> to many things <span style="text-decoration:underline;">which the <em>shar’ </em>implies</span>. Basically, therefore, there is no contradiction between the two, but to the contrary, there is association. The basis for this relationship, however, is the <em>shar’</em>, and not the intellect, as the rationalists from the <em>Mu’tazilites </em>and the latter <em>Ash’arites</em> claim<em>. </em>This is because the <em>shar’ </em>is indispensable in itself and is not in need of our knowledge and reasoning. We are the ones who are in need of the <em>shar’ </em>and of its knowledge. So if the intellect knows the <em>shar’ </em>it attains a perfection which it lacked before. But if it fails, then it will remain ignorant and deficient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, the human intellect is one of the comparative or relative matters. Ahmad may know something by his intellect which Hasan’s intellect is totally unaware of. The same person may know of something under certain conditions which he may not know of at a different time and (or) state. The fact is that people have different levels of intellect in accordance with what Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;alaa) bestows upon them from reasoning, awareness, contemplation and deduction, and differentiation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is natural that the intellect may err and fall in contradictions and /or differences in matters to which it may be subjected. So, those who say that the intellect should be given precedence to the <em>shar’</em> are referring people to something to which there is no way to affirm and perceive its correctness. That is why many of the sects differed and split amongst themselves when they gave precedence to their rationalistic dogmas vis-à vis  the textual proofs. The irony is that each of these groups say that the intellect stands to support their positions! Another irony is that the top theologians who laid down many of these dogmas went into perplexity and confusion. Many of them like <strong>Imaam al-Juwaynee, Ar-Raazi, al-Ghazaali</strong>, and others, regretted their positions and asked Allaah to let them die on <em>fitrah</em> <em>. </em>In their cases, there is a lesson for those who still reiterate  the same dogmas from the latter <em>Ash’arites</em> <em>, Mu’tazilites </em>and many of those who exaggerate the role of the intellect! A great reminder for all is the saying of Allaah I about the <em>shar’</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">{ وَلَوْ كَانَ مِنْ عِنْدِ غَيرِ اللهِ لَوَجَدُوا فِيهِ اختِلافاً كَثِيراً } [النساء:82]<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p align="center"><strong>Had </strong>[the Qur’aan]<strong> been from other than Allaah, they would surely have found therein much contradictions</strong>. [Qur’aan, <em>Soorat An-Nisaa’</em> (4:82)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The authentic <em>sunnah</em> is a Revelation from Allaah and the Prophet (Peace be upon him) said: “<strong><em>I have been given the Qur’aan and something like it along with </em></strong><em>[i.e. the sunnah</em> <em>]</em>”<em>.</em> [108]  The <em>shar’</em> with its textual proofs guiding the intellect are from Allaah, and that is why the <em>salaf</em> who correctly understood this relationship were, by Allaah’s help, saved from falling into perplexity and confusion! All Praise is due to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#003300;">One of the biggest manipulations of the Jinn is through <strong>visions</strong>. Through these visions the Jinns are more likely to lead people away from the worship of Allah then any other way. When a person sees a vision in front of his eyes it is something which is very hard to explain away. Only by having knowledge of the world of the Jinn and conviction in Allah, can a person fight such a trial. The countless numbers of visions of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary over the centuries has been a popular choice for the devils. It almost seems as if leading Christians astray is the most easiest trick for the Jinns! Not only are Christians fooled by these visions, but often the Jinns possess and begin to talk from their voices. To the Christians this is known as the tongues of the Angels and thus a proof for their faith. However, the amount of unintelligible nonsense and rubbish which is heard is a clear proof that this is in fact the tongues of the devils! For other people, visions of their parents or relatives are commonplace. By taking on the form of peoples parents, the Jinns can convince people that the souls of dead people still mix with the people of the earth. This is why so many people believe in ghosts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#003300;">The onslaught of satanic visions has also hit the Muslims. Many Muslims claim to have seen visions of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) and even Allah! By doing this, Shaytan is able to lead astray the weak Muslims. Through such visions, Muslims are often told that the commands of Islam are not applicable to them. The Jinns tell them that Prayer, Fasting, Hajj etc. are not obligatory for them. It is a great deception and unfortunately one which has been very effective. The extent of satanic visions still continues to this day. The recent death of Diana Princess of Wales sparked off great love and adoration for this woman. In fact the grief of the British people was such, that it was as if Diana was something divine. No sooner had the mourning of Diana reached its peak, that visions of her were already being seen at Hampton Court Palace! If these visions did occur, the desire of Iblis and his army of Jinn to capitalize on this event, was evident. Such visions are clear attempts by Iblis to lead mankind away from the path of Allah [16].</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman is commanded to cover her hair with a veil when she prays by herself in her house, whereby she is allowed to expose it outside the salât. Therefore, it is the Right of Allâh on us to take an adornment when praying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one has the right to circumambulate the Ka’bah nakedly[1] even if he is alone in darkness where no one can see him. Likewise, it is not permissible for him to pray nakedly even if he is by himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is from this point that we understand that, taking of an adornment in salât, is not for the purpose of veiling from people. Doing that is one thing and veiling from people is another thing. Also, it is understood that, an individual may cover in salât that which is permissible for him to expose outside the salât, and a woman may expose in salât that which she covers from the sight of men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example of the first issue is like that of the shoulders. For verily the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam), has forbidden one of us to pray in one cloth that covers not his shoulders this is because it is the right of salât that one covers his shoulders when he prays though it is permissible for him to expose his shoulders to men outside the salât.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise the free woman,[2] it is a must on her to put on a head-covering when praying as the Prophet (Sallalaahu Alaihi wa Sallam),  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“لاَ يَقْبَلُ اللهُ صَلاَةَ حَاءِضٍ إِلاّ بِخِمَارٍ”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Allâh the Almighty will not accept the prayer of the woman who reached puberty except with a head-covering”</em> though it is not upon her to put on <strong>Khimâr</strong> [i.e., head-covering] whenever she is with her husband or her family members. That is because it is permissible for her to expose the hidden adornment to them, but it is not permissible for her to expose her head when praying, neither to her family members nor other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the opposite of that are the face, the hands and the feet. It is impermissible for her to expose these parts to foreign men according to the most correct opinion. Contrary to what was before the abrogation of that rule, as a matter of fact, she is only allowed to expose her garment. But as for covering those parts [face, hands and feet] in salât, it is not obligatory according to the consensus of the scholars though they are from the hidden adornment. But as for the ruling of the hands, the <strong>majority</strong> of the scholars like Abu Haneefah, Shafi’ee and others, have agreed upon the permissibility of exposing them in salât. And this is one of the narrations of Imam Ahmad. Also, according to Abu Haneefah it is permissible to expose the feet when praying, and this is the strongest opinion; because Ayesha has considered it from the apparent adornment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] It is agreed upon. And it is emanated in <strong>“Sahih Abi Dawud”</strong> [637] and <strong>“Ir’waa Al-Ghalil”</strong> [275].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] I said: Particularization of Khimâr to the free woman is of the issues that has no proof for it. Rather, the generality of the following Hadith negates that. And look in the previous comment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"> Taken from <strong>“The Veil of The Muslim Women and Her Dress in Salat” &#8211; </strong>by Sheikh-ul-Islâm Ibn Taymiyyah which has its verification by the Muhaddith of our times Sheikh Muhammad Nasrideen Al-Albaani may Allâh have mercy on them both. </span></p>

A fatwa from Ibn Taymiyah on Why we should seek Laylatul-Qadr on all of the last ten nights of Ramadan. Translated by Owais al Hashimi hafidhahullaah</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>When To Seek Out Laylatul-Qadr (The Night Of Decree)</strong><br />
Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah -rahimahullaah<br />
Translated by Aboo Talhah Daawood ibn Ronald Burbank rahimahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah -rahimahullaah- was asked about LaylatulQadr, whilst imprisoned in the mountain citadel (in Cairo) in the year 706 H. So he responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“All praise is for Allaah. Laylatul-Qadr is in the last ten (nights) of the month of Ramadaan. This is what is authentic from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) , that he said: &lt;&lt;<strong>It is within the last ten of Ramadaan</strong>&gt;&gt;, and it is within the odd nights from them [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However the odd nights may be counted with reference to what has already passed by, such that it should be sought on the night of the twenty first, the night of the twenty third, the night of the twenty fifth, the night of the twenty seventh, and the night of the twenty ninth; and they may otherwise be counted with reference to what remains, just as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>On the night when nine remain, on the night when seven remain, on the night when five remain, on the night when three remain</strong>.&gt;&gt; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based upon this, if the month is of thirty days, then that will be one of the even nights. So the twenty second will be (the night) when nine remain, the twenty fourth will be when seven remain; and this is how Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudree explained it in the authentic hadeeth; and this is how the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) established it in the month. If, however, the month is of twenty nine days, then counting in accordance with what remains will then be just the same as counting in accordance with what has passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this being the case, it is befitting that the Believer seeks it out in all of the last ten, just as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>Seek it out in the last ten</strong>.&gt;&gt; [3] And it occurs more frequently in the last seven; and it occurs most frequently on the twenty seventh, just as Ubayy ibn Ka`b used to swear an oath that it was the twenty seventh night. So it was said to him: “How have you come to know that?” So he replied: “On account of the sign which Allaah&#8221;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) informed us of. He informed us that the sun rises on the morning following it being like a brass dish, having no rays.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sign which Ubayy ibn Ka`b reported from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is from the most well known signs occurring in hadeeth; and it is related regarding its signs that it is a night that is &#8220;bright, shining&#8221;; and it is calm; it is not very hot, nor very cold. It may occur that Allaah reveals it to some of the people in a dream, or whilst awake, such that he sees its light, or he sees one who says to him: &#8220;This is Laylatul-Qadr&#8221;; or he may open his heart to witnessing such things that make the affair clear to him, and Allaah -the Most High- knows best.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[&#8220;Majmoo`ul-Fataawaa&#8221;: (25/284-286).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no.2016) and Muslim (no.1167/217) as a hadeeth of Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudree -radiyallaahu `anhu; and by al-Bukhaaree (no.2017) as a hadeeth of `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration of Muslim (no.1167/217) contains the addition that the narrator Abun-Nadrah said: &#8220;I said: &#8220;O Aboo Sa`eed! You know better about the numbers than us.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Indeed, we have more right to that than you.&#8221; He said: I said: &#8220;What is the ninth, the seventh, and the fifth?&#8221;He said: “When twenty one have passed, then that follows it is the twenty second:and it is the ninth; and when twenty three have passed, then that which follows it is the seventh; and when twenty five have passed, then that which follows it is the fifth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no.2021) as a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas -radiyallaahu `anhumaa.<br />
[3] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no.2020) and Muslim (no.1169) as a hadeeth of `Aa·ishah &#8211; radiyallaahu `anhaa.<br />
[4] Reported by Muslim (no.762).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p>&#8220;A statement that does not begin with praise of Allah and blessing upon me, remains deficient and bereft of blessings.&#8221; <strong>(Abu Dawud, 13/184)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same has been narrated about <em>Bismillah</em> also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic letter <em>Baa</em> in <em>Bismillah </em>stands for seeking help. From a syntactical point of view it relates to a noun or verb dropped by aphasia. The Quran contains examples of its relationship with both verb and noun. The example of verb is <em>Iqra bism-e-rabbika</em> (Read: &#8220;In the Name of your Lord&#8230;&#8221;) and the example of noun is <em>Bismillah-e-majreha</em> (In the Name of Allah will be its moving course).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Hamd</em> means praising orally a grace regardless of being benefited by it, be it a favour or anything else, such as a statement that &#8216;I did <em>Hamd</em> of a certain person in connection with the prize he had been awarded or for his feat of boldness.&#8217; <em>Shukr</em> (thanking) is that praise which is done orally or emotionally or by any other organ of the body in lieu of some favour. This shows that the word <em>Hamd</em> is commonly used in one situation and the <em>Shukr </em>in another situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Describing the mutual difference between<em> Hamd </em>and <em>Madh</em> (praise) Ibn Al-Qaiyim writes that<em> Hamd</em> denotes stating qualities with love and respect; and <em>Madh</em> denotes only declaration of the quality, it does not necessarily imply love and respect. That is why the connotation of<em> Hamd</em> is of a special nature and that of <em>Madh</em> a general.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the word<em> Al-Hamdu</em>, the prefix <em>Al </em>has been used comprehensiveness meaning that it includes all forms of <em>Hamd. </em>Some people have described it as a generic noun and have maintained that perfect <em>Hamd</em> is affirmed only for Allah. This word shows that Allah has all the Attributes of perfection and beauty.</p>
