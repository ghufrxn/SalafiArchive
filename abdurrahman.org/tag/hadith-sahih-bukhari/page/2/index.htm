<h3 align="center">Afflictions and the End of the World</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.088.172"></a>Volume 9, Book 88, Number 172:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I will be at my Lake-Fount (Kauthar) waiting for whoever will come to me. Then some people will be taken away from me whereupon I will say, &#8216;My followers!&#8217; It will be said, &#8216;You do not know they turned Apostates as renegades (deserted their religion).'&#8221; (Ibn Abi Mulaika said, &#8220;Allah, we seek refuge with You from turning on our heels from the (Islamic) religion and from being put to trial&#8221;).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 173:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I am your predecessor at the Lake-Fount (Kauthar) and some men amongst you will be brought to me, and when I will try to hand them some water, they will be pulled away from me by force whereupon I will say, &#8216;O Lord, my companions!&#8217; Then the Almighty will say, &#8216;You do not know what they did after you left, they introduced new things into the religion after you.'&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 174:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;I am your predecessor at the Lake-Fount (Kauthar), and whoever will come to it, will drink from it, and whoever will drink from it, will never become thirsty after that. There will come to me some people whom I know and they know me, and then a barrier will be set up between me and them.&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri added that the Prophet further said: &#8220;I will say those people are from me. It will be said, &#8216;You do not know what changes and new things they did after you.&#8217; Then I will say, &#8216;Far removed (from mercy), far removed (from mercy), those who changed (the religion) after me! &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 175:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to us, &#8220;You will see after me, selfishness (on the part of other people) and other matters that you will disapprove of.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;What do you order us to do, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? (under such circumstances)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Pay their rights to them (to the rulers) and ask your right from Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 176:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever disapproves of something done by his ruler then he should be patient, for whoever disobeys the ruler even a little (little = a span) will die as those who died in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance. (i.e. as rebellious Sinners).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 177:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever notices something which he dislikes done by his ruler, then he should be patient, for whoever becomes separate from the company of the Muslims even for a span and then dies, he will die as those who died in the Pre-lslamic period of Ignorance (as rebellious sinners). (Fateh-Al-Bari page 112, Vol. 16)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 178:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Junada bin Abi Umaiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We entered upon &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit while he was sick. We said, &#8220;May Allah make you healthy. Will you tell us a Hadith you heard from the Prophet and by which Allah may make you benefit?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The Prophet called us and we gave him the Pledge of allegiance for Islam, and among the conditions on which he took the Pledge from us, was that we were to listen and obey (the orders) both at the time when we were active and at the time when we were tired, and at our difficult time and at our ease and to be obedient to the ruler and give him his right even if he did not give us our right, and not to fight against him unless we noticed him having open Kufr (disbelief) for which we would have a proof with us from Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 179:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usaid bin Hudair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You appointed such-and-such person and you did not appoint me?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;After me you will see rulers not giving you your right (but you should give them their right) and be patient till you meet me.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 180:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the truthful and trusted by Allah (i.e., the Prophet ) saying, &#8220;The destruction of my followers will be through the hands of young men from Quraish.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 181:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zainab bint Jahsh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet got up from his sleep with a flushed red face and said, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah. Woe to the Arabs, from the Great evil that is nearly approaching them. Today a gap has been made in the wall of Gog and Magog like this.&#8221; (Sufyan illustrated by this forming the number 90 or 100 with his fingers.) It was asked, &#8220;Shall we be destroyed though there are righteous people among us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, if evil increased.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 182:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet stood over one of the high buildings of Medina and then said (to the people), &#8220;Do you see what I see?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I see afflictions falling among your houses as rain drops fall.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 183:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Time will pass rapidly, good deeds will decrease, miserliness will be thrown (in the hearts of the people) afflictions will appear and there will be much &#8216;Al-Harj.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is &#8220;Al-Harj?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Killing! Killing!&#8221; (See Hadith No. 63, Vol. 8)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 184:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah and Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Near the establishment of the Hour there will be days during which Religious ignorance will spread, knowledge will be taken away (vanish) and there will be much Al-Harj, and Al-Harj means killing.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Near the establishment of the Hour, there will be the days of Al-Harj, and the religious knowledge will be taken away (vanish i.e. by the death of Religious scholars) and general ignorance will spread.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Al-Harj, in the Ethiopian language, means killing,&#8221; Ibn Mas&#8217;ud added: I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying; (It will be) from among the most wicked people who will be living at the time when the Hour will be established.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We went to Anas bin Malik and complained about the wrong we were suffering at the hand of Al-Hajjaj.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle woke up one night in a state of terror and said, &#8220;Subhan Allah, How many treasures Allah has sent down! And how many afflictions have been sent down! Who will go and wake the lady dwellers (wives of the Prophet) up of these rooms (for prayers)?&#8221; He meant his wives, so that they might pray. He added, &#8220;A well-dressed (soul) in this world may be naked in the Hereafter.&#8221;</p>

The Prophet said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the day of An-Nahr?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;What town is this? Isn&#8217;t it the forbidden (Sacred) Town (Mecca)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Your blood, your properties, your honors and your skins (i.e., bodies) are as sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours. (Listen) Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Be witness (for it). So it is incumbent upon those who are present to convey it (this message of mine) to those who are absent because the informed one might comprehend what I have said better than the present audience who will convey it to him.)&#8221; The narrator added: In fact, it was like that.

<p style="text-align:justify;">The people used to ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the good but I used to ask him about the evil lest I should be overtaken by them. So I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We were living in ignorance and in an (extremely) worst atmosphere, then Allah brought to us this good (i.e., Islam); will there be any evil after this good?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I said, &#8216;Will there be any good after that evil?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, but it will be tainted (not pure.)&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What will be its taint?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;(There will be) some people who will guide others not according to my tradition? You will approve of some of their deeds and disapprove of some others.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Will there be any evil after that good?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, (there will be) some people calling at the gates of the (Hell) Fire, and whoever will respond to their call, will be thrown by them into the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah s Apostle! Will you describe them to us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They will be from our own people and will speak our language.&#8221; I said, &#8220;What do you order me to do if such a state should take place in my life?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Stick to the group of Muslims and their Imam (ruler).&#8221; I said, &#8220;If there is neither a group of Muslims nor an Imam (ruler)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then turn away from all those sects even if you were to bite (eat) the roots of a tree till death overtakes you while you are in that state.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An army unit was being recruited from the people of Medina and my name was written among them. Then I met &#8216;Ikrima, and when I informed him about it, he discouraged me very strongly and said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas told me that there were some Muslims who were with the pagans to increase their number against Allah&#8217;s Apostle (and the Muslim army) so arrows (from the Muslim army) would hit one of them and kill him or a Muslim would strike him (with his sword) and kill him. So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (by staying among the disbelievers).&#8217; (4.97)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 208:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle related to us, two prophetic narrations one of which I have seen fulfilled and I am waiting for the fulfillment of the other. The Prophet told us that the virtue of honesty descended in the roots of men&#8217;s hearts (from Allah) and then they learned it from the Qur&#8217;an and then they learned it from the Sunna (the Prophet&#8217;s traditions). The Prophet further told us how that honesty will be taken away: He said: &#8220;Man will go to sleep during which honesty will be taken away from his heart and only its trace will remain in his heart like the trace of a dark spot; then man will go to sleep, during which honesty will decrease further still, so that its trace will resemble the trace of blister as when an ember is dropped on one&#8217;s foot which would make it swell, and one would see it swollen but there would be nothing inside. People would be carrying out their trade but hardly will there be a trustworthy person. It will be said, &#8216;in such-and-such tribe there is an honest man,&#8217; and later it will be said about some man, &#8216;What a wise, polite and strong man he is!&#8217; Though he will not have faith equal even to a mustard seed in his heart.&#8221; No doubt, there came upon me a time when I did not mind dealing (bargaining) with anyone of you, for if he was a Muslim his Islam would compel him to pay me what is due to me, and if he was a Christian, the Muslim official would compel him to pay me what is due to me, but today I do not deal except with such-and-such person.</p>

You have turned on your heels (i.e., deserted Islam) by staying (in the desert) with the bedouins.&#8221; Salama replied, &#8220;No, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me to stay with the bedouin in the desert.&#8221; Narrated Yazid bin Abi Ubaid: When &#8216;Uthman bin Affan was killed (martyred), Salama bin Al-Akwa&#8217; went out to a place called Ar-Rabadha and married there and begot children, and he stayed there till a few nights before his death when he came to Medina.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The people started asking the Prophet too many questions importunately. So one day he ascended the pulpit and said, &#8220;You will not ask me any question but I will explain it to you.&#8221; I looked right and left, and behold, every man was covering his head with his garment and weeping. Then got up a man who, whenever quarreling with somebody, used to be accused of not being the son of his father. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is my father?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Your father is Hudhaifa.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar got up and said, &#8220;We accept Allah as our Lord, Islam as our religion and Muhammad as our Apostle and we seek refuge with Allah from the evil of afflictions.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221; I have never seen the good and bad like on this day. No doubt, Paradise and Hell was displayed in front of me till I saw them in front of that wall,&#8221; Qatada said: This Hadith used to be mentioned as an explanation of this Verse:&#8211; &#8216;O you who believe!

Bestow Your blessings on our Yemen.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! And also on our Najd.&#8221; I think the third time the Prophet said, &#8220;There (in Najd) is the place of earthquakes and afflictions and from there comes out the side of the head of Satan.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar came to us and we hoped that he would narrate to us a good Hadith. But before we asked him, a man got up and said to him, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman! Narrate to us about the battles during the time of the afflictions, as Allah says:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And fight them until there is no more afflictions (i.e. no more worshipping of others besides Allah).'&#8221; (2.193) Ibn &#8216;Umar said (to the man), &#8220;Do you know what is meant by afflictions? Let your mother bereave you! Muhammad used to fight against the pagans, for a Muslim was put to trial in his religion (The pagans will either kill him or chain him as a captive). His fighting was not like your fighting which is carried on for the sake of ruling.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet went out to one of the gardens of Medina for some business and I went out to follow him. When he entered the garden, I sat at its gate and said to myself, &#8220;To day I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet though he has not ordered me.&#8221; The Prophet went and finished his need and went to sit on the constructed edge of the well and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. In the meantime Abu Bakr came and asked permission to enter. I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get you permission.&#8221; Abu Bakr waited outside and I went to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Abu Bakr asks your permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; So Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. Then &#8216;Umar came and I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get you permission.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise.&#8221; So Umar entered and sat on the left side of the Prophet and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well so that one side of the well became fully occupied and there remained no place for any-one to sit. Then &#8216;Uthman came and I said (to him), &#8220;Wait till I get permission for you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise with a calamity which will befall him.&#8221; When he entered, he could not find any place to sit with them so he went to the other edge of the well opposite them and uncovered his legs and hung them in the well. I wished that a brother of mine would come, so I invoked Allah for his coming. (Ibn Al-Musaiyab said, &#8220;I interpreted that (narration) as indicating their graves. The first three are together and the grave of &#8216;Uthman is separate from theirs.&#8221;)</p>

I will never tell a ruler who rules over two men or more that he is good after I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;A man will be brought and put in Hell (Fire) and he will circumambulate (go around and round) in Hell (Fire) like a donkey of a (flour) grinding mill, and all the people of Hell (Fire) will gather around him and will say to him, O so-and-so! Didn&#8217;t you use to order others for good and forbid them from evil?&#8217; That man will say, &#8216;I used to order others to do good but I myself never used to do it, and I used to forbid others from evil while I myself used to do evil.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali moved with army units against Muawiya, &#8216;Amr bin AL-As said to Muawiya, &#8220;I see an army that will not retreat unless and until the opposing army retreats.&#8221; Muawiya said, &#8220;(If the Muslims are killed) who will look after their children?&#8221; &#8216;Amr bin Al-As said: I (will look after them). On that, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amir and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura said, &#8220;Let us meet Muawaiya and suggest peace.&#8221; Al-Hasan Al-Basri added: No doubt, I heard that Abu Bakra said, &#8220;Once while the Prophet was addressing (the people), Al-Hasan (bin &#8216;Ali) came and the Prophet said, &#8216;This son of mine is a chief, and Allah may make peace between two groups of Muslims through him.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(Usama&#8217;s Maula) Usama (bin Zaid) sent me to &#8216;Ali (at Kufa) and said, &#8220;&#8216;Ali will ask you, &#8216;What has prevented your companion from joining me?&#8217; You then should say to him, &#8216;If you (&#8216;Ali) were in the mouth of a lion, I would like to be with you, but in this matter I won&#8217;t take any part.&#8217; &#8221; Harmala added: &#8220;&#8216;Ali didn&#8217;t give me anything (when I conveyed the message to him) so I went to Hasan, Hussain and Ibn Ja&#8217;far and they loaded my camels with much (wealth).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 227:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the people of Medina dethroned Yazid bin Muawiya, Ibn &#8216;Umar gathered his special friends and children and said, &#8220;I heard the Prophet saying, &#8216;A flag will be fixed for every betrayer on the Day of Resurrection,&#8217; and we have given the oath of allegiance to this person (Yazid) in accordance with the conditions enjoined by Allah and His Apostle and I do not know of anything more faithless than fighting a person who has been given the oath of allegiance in accordance with the conditions enjoined by Allah and His Apostle , and if ever I learn that any person among you has agreed to dethrone Yazid, by giving the oath of allegiance (to somebody else) then there will be separation between him and me.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 228:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Al-Minhal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Ibn Ziyad and Marwan were in Sham and Ibn Az-Zubair took over the authority in Mecca and Qurra&#8217; (the Kharijites) revolted in Basra, I went out with my father to Abu Barza Al-Aslami till we entered upon him in his house while he was sitting in the shade of a room built of cane. So we sat with him and my father started talking to him saying, &#8220;O Abu Barza! Don&#8217;t you see in what dilemma the people has fallen?&#8221; The first thing heard him saying &#8220;I seek reward from Allah for myself because of being angry and scornful at the Quraish tribe. O you Arabs! You know very well that you were in misery and were few in number and misguided, and that Allah has brought you out of all that with Islam and with Muhammad till He brought you to this state (of prosperity and happiness) which you see now; and it is this worldly wealth and pleasures which has caused mischief to appear among you. The one who is in Sham (i.e., Marwan), by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain: and those who are among you, by Allah, are not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain; and that one who is in Mecca (i.e., Ibn Az-Zubair) by Allah, is not fighting except for the sake of worldly gain.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abi Waih:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman said, &#8216;The hypocrites of today are worse than those of the lifetime of the Prophet, because in those days they used to do evil deeds secretly but today they do such deeds openly.&#8217;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 230:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abi Asha&#8217;sha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa said, &#8216;In fact, it was hypocrisy that existed in the lifetime of the Prophet but today it is Kufr (disbelief) after belief.&#8217;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 231:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Hour will not be established till the buttocks of the women of the tribe of Daus move while going round Dhi-al-Khalasa.&#8221; Dhi-al-Khalasa was the idol of the Daus tribe which they used to worship in the Pre Islamic Period of ignorance.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 233:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 234:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Hour will not be established till a fire will come out of the land of Hijaz, and it will throw light on the necks of the camels at Busra.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 235:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Soon the river &#8220;Euphrates&#8221; will disclose the treasure (the mountain) of gold, so whoever will be present at that time should not take anything of it.&#8221; Al-A&#8217;raj narrated from Abii Huraira that the Prophet said the same but he said, &#8220;It (Euphrates) will uncover a mountain of gold (under it).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 236:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Haritha bin Wahb:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Give in charity because there will come a time on the people when a person will go out with his alms from place to place but will not find anybody to accept it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 237:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Hour will not be established (1) till two big groups fight each other whereupon there will be a great number of casualties on both sides and they will be following one and the same religious doctrine, (2) till about thirty Dajjals (liars) appear, and each one of them will claim that he is Allah&#8217;s Apostle, (3) till the religious knowledge is taken away (by the death of Religious scholars) (4) earthquakes will increase in number (5) time will pass quickly, (6) afflictions will appear, (7) Al-Harj, (i.e., killing) will increase, (8) till wealth will be in abundance &#8212;- so abundant that a wealthy person will worry lest nobody should accept his Zakat, and whenever he will present it to someone, that person (to whom it will be offered) will say, &#8216;I am not in need of it, (9) till the people compete with one another in constructing high buildings, (10) till a man when passing by a grave of someone will say, &#8216;Would that I were in his place (11) and till the sun rises from the West. So when the sun will rise and the people will see it (rising from the West) they will all believe (embrace Islam) but that will be the time when: (As Allah said,) &#8216;No good will it do to a soul to believe then, if it believed not before, nor earned good (by deeds of righteousness) through its Faith.&#8217; (6.158) And the Hour will be established while two men spreading a garment in front of them but they will not be able to sell it, nor fold it up; and the Hour will be established when a man has milked his she-camel and has taken away the milk but he will not be able to drink it; and the Hour will be established before a man repairing a tank (for his livestock) is able to water (his animals) in it; and the Hour will be established when a person has raised a morsel (of food) to his mouth but will not be able to eat it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nobody asked the Prophet as many questions as I asked regarding Ad-Dajjal. The Prophet said to me, &#8220;What worries you about him?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Because the people say that he will have a mountain of bread and a river of water with him (i.e. he will have abundance of food and water)&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Nay, he is too mean to be allowed such a thing by Allah&#8221;&#8216; (but it is only to test mankind whether they believe in Allah or in Ad-Dajjal.)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 239:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Ad-Dajjal will come and encamp at a place close to Medina and then Medina will shake thrice whereupon every Kafir (disbeliever) and hypocrite will go out (of Medina) towards him.&#8221;</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 242:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said. &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw myself (in a dream) performing Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba. Behold, I saw a reddish-white man with lank hair, and water was dropping from his head. I asked, &#8220;Who is this?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;The son of Mary.&#8217; Then I turned my face to see another man with a huge body, red complexion and curly hair and blind in one eye. His eye looked like a protruding out grape. They said (to me), He is Ad-Dajjal.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;The man he resembled most is Ibn Qatan, a man from the tribe of Khuza&#8217;a. &#8220;</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 9, Book 88, Number 245:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;No prophet was sent but that he warned his followers against the one-eyed liar (Ad-Dajjal). Beware! He is blind in one eye, and your Lord is not so, and there will be written between his (Ad-Dajjal&#8217;s) eyes (the word) Kafir (i.e., disbeliever).&#8221; (This Hadith is also quoted by Abu Huraira and Ibn &#8216;Abbas).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">One day Allah&#8217;s Apostle narrated to us a long narration about Ad-Dajjal and among the things he narrated to us, was: &#8220;Ad-Dajjal will come, and he will be forbidden to enter the mountain passes of Medina. He will encamp in one of the salt areas neighboring Medina and there will appear to him a man who will be the best or one of the best of the people. He will say &#8216;I testify that you are Ad-Dajjal whose story Allah&#8217;s Apostle has told us.&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say (to his audience), &#8216;Look, if I kill this man and then give him life, will you have any doubt about my claim?&#8217; They will reply, &#8216;No,&#8217; Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and then will make him alive. The man will say, &#8216;By Allah, now I recognize you more than ever!&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will then try to kill him (again) but he will not be given the power to do so.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There are angels at the mountain passes of Medina (so that) neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal can enter it.&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Ad-Dajjal will come to Medina and find the angels guarding it. So Allah willing, neither Ad-Dajjal, nor plague will be able to come near it.&#8221;</p>

Zainab bint Jahsh added: I said, &#8220;O Alllah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we be destroyed though there will be righteous people among us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, if the (number) of evil (persons) increased.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Interpretation of Dreams </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.087.111">Volume 9, Book 87, Number 111: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle was in the form of good righteous (true) dreams in his sleep. He never had a dream  but that it came true like bright day light. He used to go in seclusion (the cave of) Hira  where he used to worship(Allah Alone) continuously for many (days) nights. He used to take  with him the journey food for that (stay) and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take  his food like-wise again for another period to stay, till suddenly the Truth descended  upon him while he was in the cave of Hira. The angel came to him in it and asked him to  read. The Prophet replied, &#8220;I do not know how to read.&#8221; (The Prophet added),  &#8220;The angel caught me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it  anymore. He then released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, &#8220;I do not  know how to read,&#8221; whereupon he caught me again and pressed me a second time till I  could not bear it anymore. He then released me and asked me again to read, but again I  replied, &#8220;I do not know how to read (or, what shall I read?).&#8221; Thereupon he  caught me for the third time and pressed me and then released me and said, &#8220;Read: In  the Name of your Lord, Who has created (all that exists). Has created man from a clot.  Read and Your Lord is Most Generous&#8230;up to&#8230;.. ..that which he knew not.&#8221; (96.15) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned with the Inspiration, his  neck muscles twitching with terror till he entered upon Khadija and said, &#8220;Cover me!  Cover me!&#8221; They covered him till his fear was over and then he said, &#8220;O Khadija,  what is wrong with me?&#8221; Then he told her everything that had happened and said, &#8216;I  fear that something may happen to me.&#8221; Khadija said, &#8216;Never! But have the glad  tidings, for by Allah, Allah will never disgrace you as you keep good reactions with your  Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guest  generously and assist the deserving, calamity-afflicted ones.&#8221; Khadija then  accompanied him to (her cousin) Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Uzza bin Qusai.  Waraqa was the son of her paternal uncle, i.e., her father&#8217;s brother, who during the  Pre-Islamic Period became a Christian and used to write the Arabic writing and used to  write of the Gospels in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and  had lost his eyesight. Khadija said to him, &#8220;O my cousin! Listen to the story of your  nephew.&#8221; Waraqa asked, &#8220;O my nephew! What have you seen?&#8221; The Prophet  described whatever he had seen. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Waraqa said, &#8220;This is the same Namus (i.e., Gabriel,  the Angel who keeps the secrets) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and  could live up to the time when your people would turn you out.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked, &#8220;Will they turn me out?&#8221; Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said:  &#8220;Never did a man come with something similar to what you have brought but was treated  with hostility. If I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then I  would support you strongly.&#8221; But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine  Inspiration was also paused for a while and the Prophet became so sad as we have heard  that he intended several times to throw himself from the tops of high mountains and every  time he went up the top of a mountain in order to throw himself down, Gabriel would appear  before him and say, &#8220;O Muhammad! You are indeed Allah&#8217;s Apostle in truth&#8221;  whereupon his heart would become quiet and he would calm down and would return home. And  whenever the period of the coming of the inspiration used to become long, he would do as  before, but when he used to reach the top of a mountain, Gabriel would appear before him  and say to him what he had said before. (Ibn &#8216;Abbas said regarding the meaning of: &#8216;He it  is that Cleaves the daybreak (from the darkness)&#8217; (6.96) that Al-Asbah. means the light of  the sun during the day and the light of the moon at night). </font></p>

I asked, &#8216;Who is this man?&#8217; Somebody replied, &#8216;(He is) Messiah, son of Mary.&#8217;  Then I saw another man with very curly hair, blind in the right eye which looked like a  protruding out grape.

One day the Prophet visited her and she provided him with  food and started looking for lice in his head. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle slept and afterwards  woke up smiling. Um Haram asked, &#8220;What makes you smile, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;Some of my followers were presented before me in my dream as fighters in  Allah&#8217;s Cause, sailing in the middle of the seas like kings on the thrones or like kings  sitting on their thrones.&#8221; (The narrator Ishaq is not sure as to which expression was  correct). Um Haram added, &#8216;I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah, to make me one  of them;&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle invoked Allah for her and then laid his head down (and  slept). Then he woke up smiling (again). (Um Haram added): I said, &#8220;What makes you  smile, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Some people of my followers were presented  before me (in a dream) as fighters in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; He said the same as he had said  before. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to make me from them.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;You are among the first ones.&#8221; Then Um Haram sailed over the sea during the  Caliphate of Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan, and she fell down from her riding animal after coming  ashore, and died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Al-&#8216;Ala an Ansari woman who had given a pledge of  allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle told me:, &#8220;The Muhajirln (emigrants) were distributed  amongst us by drawing lots, and we got &#8216;Uthman bin Maz&#8217;un in our share. We made him stay  with us in our house. Then he suffered from a disease which proved fatal. When he died and  was given a bath and was shrouded in his clothes. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came, I said,  (addressing the dead body), &#8216;O Aba As-Sa&#8217;ib! May Allah be Merciful to you! I testify that  Allah has honored you.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;How do you know that Allah has honored  him?&#8221; I replied, &#8216;Let my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! On whom  else shall Allah bestow. His honor?&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;As for him, by Allah, death  has come to him. By Allah, I wish him all good (from Allah). By Allah, in spite of the  fact that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I do not know what Allah will do to me.&#8221;, Um Al-&#8216;Ala  added, &#8220;By Allah, I will never attest the righteousness of anybody after that.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(a companion of the Prophet and one of his cavalry men)  &#8220;I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;A good dream is from Allah, and a bad dream is  from Satan; so, if anyone of you had a bad dream which he disliked, then he should spit on  his left and seek refuge with Allah from it, for it will not harm him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When the Day of Resurrection  approaches, the dreams of a believer will hardly fail to come true, and a dream of a  believer is one of forty-six parts of prophetism, and whatever belongs to prothetism can  never be false.&#8221; Muhammad bin Sirin said, &#8220;But I say this.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;It used to be said, &#8216;There are three types of dreams: The reflection of one&#8217;s  thoughts and experiences one has during wakefulness, what is suggested by Satan to  frighten the dreamer, or glad tidings from Allah. So, if someone has a dream which he  dislikes, he should not tell it to others, but get up and offer a prayer.&#8221; He added,  &#8220;He (Abu Huraira) hated to see a Ghul (i.e., iron collar around his neck in a dream)  and people liked to see fetters (on their feet in a dream). The fetters on the feet  symbolizes one&#8217;s constant and firm adherence to religion.&#8221; And Abu &#8216;Abdullah said,  &#8220;Ghuls (iron collars) are used only for necks.&#8221; </font></p>

I testify that Allah has honored you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;How  do you know that?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I do not know, by Allah.&#8217; He said, &#8216;As for him, death has  come to him and I wish him all good from Allah. By Allah, though I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I  neither know what will happen to me, nor to you.'&#8221; Um Al-&#8216;Ala said, &#8220;By Allah, I  will never attest the righteousness of anybody after that.&#8221; She added, &#8220;Later I  saw in a dream, a flowing spring for &#8216;Uthman.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Men from the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to see  dreams during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they used to narrate those dreams to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle would interpret them as Allah wished. I was a young man  and used to stay in the mosque before my wedlock. I said to myself, &#8220;If there were  any good in myself, I too would see what these people see.&#8221; So when I went to bed one  night, I said, &#8220;O Allah! If you see any good in me, show me a good dream.&#8221; So  while I was in that state, there came to me (in a dream) two angels. In the hand of each  of them, there was a mace of iron, and both of them were taking me to Hell, and I was  between them, invoking Allah, &#8220;O Allah! I seek refuge with You from Hell.&#8221; Then  I saw myself being confronted by another angel holding a mace of iron in his hand. He said  to me, &#8220;Do not be afraid, you will be an excellent man if you only pray more  often.&#8221; So they took me till they stopped me at the edge of Hell, and behold, it was  built inside like a well and it had side posts like those of a well, and beside each post  there was an angel carrying an iron mace. I saw therein many people hanging upside down  with iron chains, and I recognized therein some men from the Quraish. Then (the angels)  took me to the right side. I narrated this dream to (my sister) Hafsa and she told it to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No doubt, &#8216;Abdullah is a good man.&#8221;  (Nafi&#8217; said, &#8220;Since then &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar used to pray much.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;While I was sleeping, two  golden bangles were put in my two hands, so I got scared (frightened) and disliked it, but  I was given permission to blow them off, and they flew away. I interpret it as a symbol of  two liars who will appear.&#8221; &#8216;Ubaidullah said, &#8220;One of them was Al-&#8216;Ansi who was  killed by Fairuz at Yemen and the other was Musailama (at Najd) . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I saw in a dream that I was  migrating from Mecca to a land where there were date palm trees. I thought that it might  be the land of Al-Yamama or Hajar, but behold, it turned out to be Yathrib (i.e. Medina).  And I saw cows (being slaughtered) there, but the reward given by Allah is better (than  worldly benefits). Behold, those cows proved to symbolize the believers (who were killed)  on the Day (of the battle) of Uhud, and the good (which I saw in the dream) was the good  and the reward and the truth which Allah bestowed upon us after the Badr battle. (or the  Battle of Uhud) and that was the victory bestowed by Allah in the Battle of Khaibar and  the conquest of Mecca) . </font></p>

Then I interpreted that those two bangles were the liars between whom I was (i.e.,  the one of San&#8217;a&#8217; and the one of Yamama).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;I saw in a  dream, a cloud having shade. Butter and honey were dropping from it and I saw the people  gathering it in their hands, some gathering much and some a little. And behold, there was  a rope extending from the earth to the sky, and I saw that you (the Prophet) held it and  went up, and then another man held it and went up and (after that) another (third) held it  and went up, and then after another (fourth) man held it, but it broke and then got  connected again.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed  for you! Allow me to interpret this dream.&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Interpret  it.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;The cloud with shade symbolizes Islam, and the butter and  honey dropping from it, symbolizes the Quran, its sweetness dropping and some people  learning much of the Qur&#8217;an and some a little. The rope which is extended from the sky to  the earth is the Truth which you (the Prophet) are following. You follow it and Allah will  raise you high with it, and then another man will follow it and will rise up with it and  another person will follow it and then another man will follow it but it will break and  then it will be connected for him and he will rise up with it. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Let my  father be sacrificed for you! Am I right or wrong?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;You  are right in some of it and wrong in some.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet!  By Allah, you must tell me in what I was wrong.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not  swear.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 87, Number 171: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Samura bin Jundub: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle very often used to ask his companions,  &#8220;Did anyone of you see a dream?&#8221; So dreams would be narrated to him by those  whom Allah wished to tell. One morning the Prophet said, &#8220;Last night two persons came  to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; I set out with them and we  came across a man Lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding  a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man&#8217;s head, injuring it. The rock  rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man,  his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done  before. I said to my two companions, &#8216;Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?&#8217; They said,  &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded and came to a man Lying flat on his back and another man  standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of  the man&#8217;s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly  tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the  other side of the man&#8217;s face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly  completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to  it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, &#8216;Subhan Allah! Who are  these two persons?&#8217; They said to me, &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded and came across something  like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).&#8221; I  think the Prophet said, &#8220;In that oven t here was much noise and voices.&#8221; The  Prophet added, &#8220;We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame  of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly.  I asked them, &#8216;Who are these?&#8217; They said to me, &#8216;Proceed!&#8217; And so we proceeded and came  across a river.&#8221; I think he said, &#8220;&#8230;. red like blood.&#8221; The Prophet added,  &#8220;And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man  who had collected many stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him.  The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth  whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time the performance was repeated,  I asked my two companions, &#8216;Who are these (two) persons?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;Proceed!  Proceed!&#8217; And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most  repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was  kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, &#8216;Who is this (man)?&#8217; They said  to me, &#8216;Proceed! Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense  vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very  tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there  were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, &#8216;Who  is this?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;Proceed! Proceed!&#8217; So we proceeded till we came to a majestic  huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, &#8216;Go  up and I went up&#8217; The Prophet added, &#8220;So we ascended till we reached a city built of  gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the  gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of  their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side  as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to  throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and  its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then  returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the  best shape.&#8221; The Prophet further added, &#8220;My two companions (angels) said to me,  &#8216;This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.&#8217; I raised up my sight, and  behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, &#8216;That  (palace) is your place.&#8217; I said to them, &#8216;May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day) I said to  them, &#8216;I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon whose head was being  injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither  recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for the  man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to  back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so  many lies that it spreads all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw  in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses;, and  the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of  usury (Riba) and the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going  round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is  Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic  Faith).&#8221; The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  What about the children of pagans?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;And also the children  of pagans.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;My two companions added, &#8216;The men you saw half  handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another  that was bad, but Allah forgave them.'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.084.053">Volume 9, Book 84, Number 53: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Verse: &#8216;It is those who believe and confuse not  their belief with wrong (i.e., worshipping others besides Allah): (6.82) was revealed, it  became very hard on the companions of the Prophet and they said, &#8220;Who among us has  not confused his belief with wrong (oppression)?&#8221; On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;This is not meant (by the Verse). Don&#8217;t you listen to Luqman&#8217;s statement: &#8216;Verily!  Joining others in worship with Allah is a great wrong indeed.&#8217; (31.13) </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.084.054"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 84, Number 54: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Bakra: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet. said, &#8220;The biggest of the great sins are:  To join others in worship with Allah, to be undutiful to one&#8217;s parents, and to give a  false witness.&#8221; He repeated it thrice, or said, &#8220;&#8230;.a false statement,&#8221;  and kept on repeating that warning till we wished he would stop saying it. (See Hadith  No.7, Vol. 8) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 84, Number 55: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! What are the biggest sins?: The Prophet said, &#8220;To join others in worship  with Allah.&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;To  be undutiful to one&#8217;s parents.&#8221; The bedouin said &#8220;What is next?&#8221; The  Prophet said &#8220;To take an oath &#8216;Al-Ghamus.&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;What is an  oath &#8216;Al-Ghamus&#8217;?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The false oath through which one deprives  a Muslim of his property (unjustly).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Mas&#8217;ud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we be punished  for what we did in the Prelslamic Period of ignorance?&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Whoever does good in Islam will not be punished for what he did in the Pre-lslamic  Period of ignorance and whoever does evil in Islam will be punished for his former and  later (bad deeds).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 84, Number 57: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ikrima: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some Zanadiqa (atheists) were brought to &#8216;Ali and he burnt  them. The news of this event, reached Ibn &#8216;Abbas who said, &#8220;If I had been in his  place, I would not have burnt them, as Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade it, saying, &#8216;Do not punish  anybody with Allah&#8217;s punishment (fire).&#8217; I would have killed them according to the  statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8216;Whoever changed his Islamic religion, then kill him.'&#8221;  </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.084.058"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 84, Number 58: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Burda: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Musa said, &#8220;I came to the Prophet along with two  men (from the tribe) of Ash&#8217;ariyin, one on my right and the other on my left, while  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was brushing his teeth (with a Siwak), and both men asked him for some  employment. The Prophet said, &#8216;O Abu Musa (O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais!).&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Him Who  sent you with the Truth, these two men did not tell me what was in their hearts and I did  not feel (realize) that they were seeking employment.&#8217; As if I were looking now at his  Siwak being drawn to a corner under his lips, and he said, &#8216;We never (or, we do not)  appoint for our affairs anyone who seeks to be employed. But O Abu Musa! (or &#8216;Abdullah bin  Qais!) Go to Yemen.'&#8221; The Prophet then sent Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal after him and when  Mu&#8217;adh reached him, he spread out a cushion for him and requested him to get down (and sit  on the cushion). Behold: There was a fettered man beside Abu Muisa. Mu&#8217;adh asked,  &#8220;Who is this (man)?&#8221; Abu Muisa said, &#8220;He was a Jew and became a Muslim and  then reverted back to Judaism.&#8221; Then Abu Muisa requested Mu&#8217;adh to sit down but  Mu&#8217;adh said, &#8220;I will not sit down till he has been killed. This is the judgment of  Allah and His Apostle (for such cases) and repeated it thrice. Then Abu Musa ordered that  the man be killed, and he was killed. Abu Musa added, &#8220;Then we discussed the night  prayers and one of us said, &#8216;I pray and sleep, and I hope that Allah will reward me for my  sleep as well as for my prayers.'&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 84, Number 59: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet died and Abu Bakr became his successor and  some of the Arabs reverted to disbelief, &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! How can you fight  these people although Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;I have been ordered to fight the people till  they say: &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, &#8216;and whoever said, &#8216;None has the  right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217;, Allah will save his property and his life from me,  unless (he does something for which he receives legal punishment) justly, and his account  will be with Allah?&#8217; &#8220;Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah! I will fight whoever  differentiates between prayers and Zakat as Zakat is the right to be taken from property  (according to Allah&#8217;s Orders). By Allah! If they refused to pay me even a kid they used to  pay to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I would fight with them for withholding it.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said,  &#8220;By Allah: It was nothing, but I noticed that Allah opened Abu Bakr&#8217;s chest towards  the decision to fight, therefore I realized that his decision was right.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 84, Number 60: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Jew passed by Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;As-Samu  &#8216;Alaika.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said in reply, &#8220;We &#8216;Alaika.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then  said to his companions, &#8220;Do you know what he (the Jew) has said? He said, &#8216;As-Samu  &#8216;Alaika.'&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we kill him?&#8221; The Prophet,  said, &#8220;No. When the people of the Book greet you, say: &#8216;Wa &#8216;Alaikum.'&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.084.061"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 84, Number 61: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of Jews asked permission to visit the Prophet (and  when they were admitted) they said, &#8220;As-Samu &#8216;Alaika (Death be upon you).&#8221; I  said (to them), &#8220;But death and the curse of Allah be upon you!&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha! Allah is kind and lenient and likes that one should be kind and  lenient in all matters.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you heard what they said?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;I said (to them), &#8216;Wa &#8216;Alaikum (and upon you). </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.084.062"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 84, Number 62: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When the Jews greet anyone of  you they say: &#8216;Sam&#8217;Alaika (death be upon you); so you should say; &#8216;Wa &#8216;Alaika (and upon  you).'&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.084.063"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 84, Number 63: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>As if I am looking at the Prophet while he was speaking  about one of the prophets whose people have beaten and wounded him, and he was wiping the  blood off his face and saying, &#8220;O Lord! Forgive my, people as they do not know.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.084.064"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 84, Number 64: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever I tell you a narration from Allah&#8217;s Apostle, by  Allah, I would rather fall down from the sky than ascribe a false statement to him, but if  I tell you something between me and you (not a Hadith) then it was indeed a trick (i.e., I  may say things just to cheat my enemy). No doubt I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying,  &#8220;During the last days there will appear some young foolish people who will say the  best words but their faith will not go beyond their throats (i.e. they will have no faith)  and will go out from (leave) their religion as an arrow goes out of the game. So,  where-ever you find them, kill them, for who-ever kills them shall have reward on the Day  of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 84, Number 65: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin Yasar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That they visited Abu Sa&#8217;id Al-Khudri and asked him about  Al-Harauriyya, a special unorthodox religious sect, &#8220;Did you hear the Prophet saying  anything about them?&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id said, &#8220;I do not know what Al-Harauriyya is, but  I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;There will appear in this nation&#8212;- he did not say:  From this nation &#8212;- a group of people so pious apparently that you will consider your  prayers inferior to their prayers, but they will recite the Quran, the teachings of which  will not go beyond their throats and will go out of their religion as an arrow darts  through the game, whereupon the archer may look at his arrow, its Nasl at its Risaf and  its Fuqa to see whether it is blood-stained or not (i.e. they will have not even a trace  of Islam in them).&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.084.066"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 84, Number 66: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Regarding Al-Harauriyya: The Prophet said, &#8220;They will  go out of Islam as an arrow darts out of the game&#8217;s body.&#8217; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="009.084.067"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 9, Book 84, Number 67: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Sa&#8217;id: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was distributing (something, &#8216;Abdullah  bin Dhil Khawaisira At-Tamimi came and said, &#8220;Be just, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to you ! Who would be just if I were not?&#8221; &#8216;Umar bin  Al-Khattab said, &#8220;Allow me to cut off his neck ! &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221;  Leave him, for he has companions, and if you compare your prayers with their prayers and  your fasting with theirs, you will look down upon your prayers and fasting, in comparison  to theirs. Yet they will go out of the religion as an arrow darts through the game&#8217;s body  in which case, if the Qudhadh of the arrow is examined, nothing will be found on it, and  when its Nasl is examined, nothing will be found on it; and then its Nadiyi is examined,  nothing will be found on it. The arrow has been too fast to be smeared by dung and blood.  The sign by which these people will be recognized will be a man whose one hand (or breast)  will be like the breast of a woman (or like a moving piece of flesh). These people will  appear when there will be differences among the people (Muslims).&#8221; Abu Sa&#8217;id added: I  testify that I heard this from the Prophet and also testify that &#8216;Ali killed those people  while I was with him. The man with the description given by the Prophet was brought to  &#8216;Ali. The following Verses were revealed in connection with that very person (i.e.,  &#8216;Abdullah bin Dhil-Khawaisira At-Tarnimi): &#8216;And among them are men who accuse you (O  Muhammad) in the matter of (the distribution of) the alms.&#8217; (9.58) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Yusair bin &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Sahl bin Hunaif, &#8220;Did you hear the Prophet  saying anything about Al-Khawarij?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I heard him saying while pointing  his hand towards Iraq. &#8220;There will appear in it (i.e, Iraq) some people who will  recite the Quran but it will not go beyond their throats, and they will go out from  (leave) Islam as an arrow darts through the game&#8217;s body.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Verse:&#8211;&#8216;Those who believe and did not confuse  their belief with wrong (worshipping others besides Allah).&#8217; (6.82) was revealed, it was  hard on the companions of the Prophet and they said, &#8220;Who among us has not wronged  (oppressed) himself?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The meaning of the Verse is not as  you think, but it is as Luqman said to his son, &#8216;O my son! Join not in worship others with  Allah, Verily! Joining others in worship with Allah is a great wrong indeed.'&#8221;  (31.13) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Itban bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me in the morning, and a man  among us said, &#8220;Where is Malik bin Ad-Dukhshun?&#8221; Another man from us replied,  &#8220;He is a hypocrite who does not love Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that he says: None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, only  for Allah&#8217;s sake?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Nobody will  meet Allah with that saying on the Day of Resurrection, but Allah will save him from the  Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman and Hibban bin &#8216;Atiyya had a dispute.

What is that?&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said,  &#8220;Something I heard him saying.&#8221; The other said, &#8220;What was it?&#8221;  &#8216;AbdurRahman said, &#8220;&#8216;Ali said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for me, Az-Zubair and Abu  Marthad, and all of us were cavalry men, and said, &#8216;Proceed to Raudat-Hajj (Abu Salama  said that Abu &#8216;Awana called it like this, i.e., Hajj where there is a woman carrying a  letter from Hatib bin Abi Balta&#8217;a to the pagans (of Mecca). So bring that letter to me.&#8217;  So we proceeded riding on our horses till we overtook her at the same place of which  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had told us. She was traveling on her camel. In that letter Hatib had  written to the Meccans about the proposed attached of Allah&#8217;s Apostle against them. We  asked her, &#8220;Where is the letter which is with you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;I haven&#8217;t got any  letter.&#8217; So we made her camel kneel down and searched her luggage, but we did not find  anything. My two companions said, &#8216;We do not think that she has got a letter.&#8217; I said, &#8216;We  know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle has not told a lie.'&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then &#8216;Ali took an oath saying, &#8220;By Him by Whom one  should swear! You shall either bring out the letter or we shall strip off your  clothes.&#8221; She then stretched out her hand for her girdle (round her waist) and  brought out the paper (letter). They took the letter to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8216;Umar said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (Hatib) has betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers; let me  chop off his neck!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Hatib! What obliged you to do what  you have done?&#8221; Hatib replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Why (for what reason) should  I not believe in Allah and His Apostle? But I intended to do the (Mecca) people a favor by  virtue of which my family and property may be protected as there is none of your  companions but has some of his people (relatives) whom Allah urges to protect his family  and property.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He has said the truth; therefore, do not say  anything to him except good.&#8221; &#8216;Umar again said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He has  betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers; let me chop his neck off!&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he from those who fought the battle of Badr? And what do you know, Allah  might have looked at them (Badr warriors) and said (to them), &#8216;Do what you like, for I  have granted you Paradise?&#8217; &#8221; On that, &#8216;Umar&#8217;s eyes became flooded with tears and he  said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know best.&#8221; </font></p>

Whenever the charitable man tries to give a charitable gift, his iron cloak expands till it becomes so wide that it will cover his fingertips and obliterate his tracks And, whenever the miser wants to give a charitable gift, his cloak becomes very tight over him and every ring gets stuck to its place Abu Huraira added; I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle putting his finger in the (chest) pocket of his shirt like that If you but saw him trying to widen (the opening of his shirt) but it did not widen</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet went to answer the call of nature, and when he returned, I met him with water and he performed the ablution while he was wearing a Sham, cloak. He rinsed his mouth, put the water in his nose and blew it out, washed his face and tried to take his hands out of his sleeves, but they were too narrow, so he took out his hands from under his chest and washed them and then passed his wet hands over his head and Khuffs (leather socks) .</p>

Then he came back and I poured water for him from the pot (for the ablution). He washed his face and hands while he was wearing a woollen cloak (the sleeves of which were narrow), so he could not take his arms out of it. So he took them out from underneath the cloak. Then he washed his forearms and passed his wet hands over his head. Then I tried to take off his Khuffs, but he said, &#8220;Leave them, for I have performed ablution before putting them on.&#8221; And so he passed his wet hands over them</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Some Muslim men emigrated to Ethiopia whereupon Abu Bakr also prepared himself for the emigration, but the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Wait, for I hope that Allah will allow me also to emigrate.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. Do you hope that (emigration)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8216;Yes.&#8221; So Abu Bakr waited to accompany the Prophet and fed two she-camels he had on the leaves of As-Samur tree regularly for four months One day while we were sitting in our house at midday, someone said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Here is Allah&#8217;s Apostle, coming with his head and a part of his face covered with a cloth-covering at an hour he never used to come to us.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you, (O Prophet)! An urgent matter must have brought you here at this hour.&#8221; The Prophet came and asked the permission to enter, and he was allowed. The Prophet entered and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Let those who are with you, go out.&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;(There is no stranger); they are your family. Let my father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I have been allowed to leave (Mecca).&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8221; I shall accompany you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostles, Let my father be sacrificed for you!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostles! Let my father be sacrificed for you. Take one of these two she-camels of mine&#8221; The Prophet said. I will take it only after paying its price.&#8221; So we prepared their baggage and put their journey food In a leather bag. And Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr cut a piece of her girdle and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it. That is why she was called Dhat-an-Nitaqaln. Then the Prophet and Abu Bakr went to a cave in a mountain called Thour and remained there for three nights. &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Bakr. who was a young intelligent man. used to stay with them at night and leave before dawn so that in the morning, he would he with the Quraish at Mecca as if he had spent the night among them. If he heard of any plot contrived by the Quraish against the Prophet and Abu Bakr, he would understand it and (return to) inform them of it when it became dark. &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr used to graze a flock of milch sheep for them and he used to take those sheep to them when an hour had passed after the &#8216;Isha prayer. They would sleep soundly till &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira awakened them when it was still dark. He used to do that in each of those three nights.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For one year I wanted to ask &#8216;Umar about the two women who helped each other against the Prophet but I was afraid of him. One day he dismounted his riding animal and went among the trees of Arak to answer the call of nature, and when he returned, I asked him and he said, &#8220;(They were) &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;We never used to give significance to ladies in the days of the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance, but when Islam came and Allah mentioned their rights, we used to give them their rights but did not allow them to interfere in our affairs. Once there was some dispute between me and my wife and she answered me back in a loud voice. I said to her, &#8216;Strange! You can retort in this way?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes. Do you say this to me while your daughter troubles Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; So I went to Hafsa and said to her, &#8216;I warn you not to disobey Allah and His Apostle.&#8217; I first went to Hafsa and then to Um Salama and told her the same. She said to me, &#8216;O &#8216;Umar! It surprises me that you interfere in our affairs so much that you would poke your nose even into the affairs of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his wives.&#8217; So she rejected my advice. There was an Ansari man; whenever he was absent from Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I was present there, I used to convey to him what had happened (on that day), and when I was absent and he was present there, he used to convey to me what had happened as regards news from Allah&#8217;s Apostle . During that time all the rulers of the nearby lands had surrendered to Allah&#8217;s Apostle except the king of Ghassan in Sham, and we were afraid that he might attack us. All of a sudden the Ansari came and said, &#8216;A great event has happened!&#8217; I asked him, &#8216;What is it? Has the Ghassani (king) come?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Greater than that! Allah&#8217;s Apostle has divorced his wives! I went to them and found all of them weeping in their dwellings, and the Prophet had ascended to an upper room of his. At the door of the room there was a slave to whom I went and said, &#8220;Ask the permission for me to enter.&#8221; He admitted me and I entered to see the Prophet lying on a mat that had left its imprint on his side. Under his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. Behold! There were some hides hanging there and some grass for tanning. Then I mentioned what I had said to Hafsa and Um Salama and what reply Um Salama had given me. Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled and stayed there for twenty nine days and then came down.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 648, Vol. 3 for details)</p>

Many well dressed soul (people) in this world, will be naked on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</p>

Then he said, &#8220;Bring me Um Khalid,&#8221; So I was brought to him and he dressed me with it with his own hands and said twice, &#8220;May you live so long that you will wear out many garments.&#8221; He then started looking at the embroidery of that Khamisa and said, &#8220;O Um Khalid!

<h3 align="center">Expiation for Unfulfilled Oaths</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="008.079.699"></a>Volume 8, Book 79, Number 699:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to the Prophet and he said to me, &#8220;Come near.&#8221; So I went near to him and he said, &#8220;Are your lice troubling you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Shave your head and) make expiation in the form of fasting, Sadaqa (giving in charity), or offering a sacrifice.&#8221; (The sub-narrator) Aiyub said, &#8220;Fasting should be for three days, and the Nusuk (sacrifice) is to be a sheep, and the Sadaqa is to be given to six poor persons.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 700:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I had sexual relation with my wife (while I was fasting) in Ramadan.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Have you got enough to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Sit down,&#8221; and he sat down. Afterwards an &#8216;Irq, i.e., a big basket containing dates was brought to the Prophet and the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Take this and give it in charity.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we?&#8221; On that, the Prophet smiled till his premolar teeth became visible, and then told him, &#8220;Feed your family with it.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 157, Vol 3)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 701:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have done a sexual relation with my wife (while fasting) in Ramadan.&#8221; The Prophet said to him?&#8221; &#8220;Can you afford to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then an Ansari man came with an Irq (a big basket full of dates). The Prophet said (to the man), &#8220;Take this (basket) and give it in charity.&#8221; That man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? By Him Who has sent you with the Truth! There is no house in between the two mountains (of the city of Medina) poorer than we.&#8221; So the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Go and feed it to your family.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 702:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophets and said, &#8220;I am ruined!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have done a sexual relation with my wife (while fasting) in Ramadan&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Can you afford to manumit a slave?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you fast for two successive months?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Can you feed sixty poor persons?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have nothing.&#8221; Later on an Irq (big basket) containing dates was given to the Prophet, and the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Take this basket and give it in charity.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;To poorer people than we? Indeed, there is nobody between its (i.e., Medina&#8217;s) two mountains who is poorer than we.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;Take it and feed your family with it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 703:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Ju&#8217;aid bin Abdur-Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sa&#8217;ib bin Yazid said, &#8220;The Sa&#8217; at the time of the Prophet was equal to one Mudd plus one-third of a Mudd of your time, and then it was increased in the time of Caliph &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul Aziz.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 704:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Umar used to give the Zakat of Ramadan (Zakat-al-Fitr) according to the Mudd of the Prophet, the first Mudd, and he also used to give things for expiation for oaths according to the Mudd of the Prophet. Abu Qutaiba said, &#8220;Malik said to us, &#8216;Our Mudd (i.e., of Medina) is better than yours and we do not see any superiority except in the Mudd of the Prophet!&#8217; Malik further said, to me, &#8216;If a ruler came to you and fixed a Mudd smaller than the one of the Prophet, by what Mudd would you measure what you give (for expiation or Zakat-al-Fitr?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;We would give it according to the Mudd of the Prophet&#8217; On that, Malik said, &#8216;Then, don&#8217;t you see that we have to revert to the Mudd of the Prophet ultimately?'&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 705:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow Your Blessings on their measures, Sa&#8217; and Mudd (i.e., of the people of Medina) &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 706:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If somebody manumits a Muslim slave, Allah will save from the Fire every part of his body for freeing the corresponding parts of the slave&#8217;s body, even his private parts will be saved from the Fire) because of freeing the slave&#8217;s private parts.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 707:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jabir said: An Ansari man made his slave a Mudabbar and he had no other property than him. When the Prophet heard of that, he said (to his companions), &#8220;Who wants to buy him (i.e., the slave) for me?&#8221; Nu&#8217;aim bin An-Nahham bought him for eight hundred Dirhams. I heard Jabir saying, &#8220;That was a coptic slave who died in the same year.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 708:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that she intended to buy Barira (a slave girl) and her masters stipulated that they would have her Wala&#8217;. When &#8216;Aisha mentioned that to the Prophet ; he said, &#8220;Buy her, for the Wala&#8217; is for the one who manumits.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 709:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with a group of people from (the tribe of) Al-Ash&#8217;ari, asking for mounts. The Prophet said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not give you anything to ride, and I have nothing to mount you on.&#8221; We stayed there as long as Allah wished, and after that, some camels were brought to the Prophet and he ordered that we be given three camels. When we set out, some of us said to others, &#8220;Allah will not bless us, as we all went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle asking him for mounts, and although he had sworn that he would not give us mounts, he did give us.&#8221; So we returned to the Prophet; and mentioned that to him. He said, &#8220;I have not provided you with mounts, but Allah has. By Allah, Allah willing, if I ever take an oath, and then see that another is better than the first, I make expiration for my (dissolved) oath, and do what is better and make expiration.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 710:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hammad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the same narration above (i.e. 709), &#8220;I make expiation for my dissolved oath, and I do what is better, or do what is better and make expiation.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 711:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Prophet) Solomon said, &#8220;Tonight I will sleep with (my) ninety wives, each of whom will get a male child who will fight for Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; On that, his companion (Sufyan said that his companion was an angel) said to him, &#8220;Say, &#8220;If Allah will (Allah willing).&#8221; But Solomon forgot (to say it). He slept with all his wives, but none of the women gave birth to a child, except one who gave birth to a halfboy. Abu Huraira added: The Prophet said, &#8220;If Solomon had said, &#8220;If Allah will&#8221; (Allah willing), he would not have been unsuccessful in his action, and would have attained what he had desired.&#8221; Once Abu Huraira added: Allah apostle said, &#8220;If he had accepted.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 712:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zahdam al-Jarmi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were sitting with Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;sari, and as there were ties of friendship and mutual favors between us and his tribe. His meal was presented before him and there was chicken meat in it. Among those who were present there was a man from Bani Taimillah having a red complexion as a non-Arab freed slave, and that man did not approach the meal. Abu Musa said to him, &#8220;Come along! I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle eating of that (i.e., chicken).&#8221; The man said, &#8220;I have seen it (chickens) eating something I regarded as dirty, and so I have taken an oath that I shall not eat (its meat) chicken.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come along! I will inform you about it (i.e., your oath).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in company with a group of Ash&#8217;airiyin, asking him for mounts while he was distributing some camels from the camels of Zakat. (Aiyub said, &#8220;I think he said that the Prophet was in an angry mood at the time.&#8221;) The Prophet said, &#8216;By Allah! I will not give you mounts, and I have nothing to mount you on.&#8217; After we had left, some camels of booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he said, &#8220;Where are those Ash&#8217;ariyin? Where are those Ash&#8217;ariyin?&#8221; So we went (to him) and he gave us five very fat good-looking camels. We mounted them and went away, and then I said to my companions, &#8216;We went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to give us mounts, but he took an oath that he would not give us mounts, and then later on he sent for us and gave us mounts, perhaps Allah&#8217;s Apostle forgot his oath. By Allah, we will never be successful, for we have taken advantage of the fact that Allah&#8217;s Apostle forgot to fulfill his oath. So let us return to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to remind him of his oath.&#8217; We returned and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We came to you and asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us mounts) but later on you gave us mounts, and we thought or considered that you have forgotten your oath.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Depart, for Allah has given you Mounts. By Allah, Allah willing, if I take an oath and then later find another thing better than that, I do what is better, and make expiation for the oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">the same narration as above (i.e. No. 712).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 8, Book 79, Number 715:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Samura:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman!) Do not seek to be a ruler, for, if you are given the authority of ruling without your asking for it, then Allah will help you; but if you are given it by your asking, then you will be held responsible for it (i.e. Allah will not help you ) . And if you take an oath to do something and later on find another thing, better than that, then do what is better and make expiation for (the dissolution of) your oath.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people from the tribe of &#8216;Ukl came to the Prophet and  embraced Islam. The climate of Medina did not suit them, so the Prophet ordered them to go  to the (herd of milch) camels of charity and to drink, their milk and urine (as a  medicine). They did so, and after they had recovered from their ailment (became healthy)  they turned renegades (reverted from Islam) and killed the shepherd of the camels and took  the camels away. The Prophet sent (some people) in their pursuit and so they were (caught  and) brought, and the Prophets ordered that their hands and legs should be cut off and  that their eyes should be branded with heated pieces of iron, and that their cut hands and  legs should not be cauterized, till they die. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet cut off the hands and feet of the men belonging  to the tribe of &#8216;Uraina and did not cauterise (their bleeding limbs) till they died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 796: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of people from &#8216;Ukl (tribe) came to the Prophet and  they were living with the people of As-Suffa, but they became ill as the climate of Medina  did not suit them, so they said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Provide us with milk.&#8221; The  Prophet said, I see no other way for you than to use the camels of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221;  So they went and drank the milk and urine of the camels, (as medicine) and became healthy  and fat. Then they killed the shepherd and took the camels away. When a help-seeker came  to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he sent some men in their pursuit, and they were captured and brought  before mid day. The Prophet ordered for some iron pieces to be made red hot, and their  eyes were branded with them and their hands and feet were cut off and were not cauterized.  Then they were put at a place called Al-Harra, and when they asked for water to drink they  were not given till they died. (Abu Qilaba said, &#8220;Those people committed theft and  murder and fought against Allah and His Apostle.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 797: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of people from &#8216;Ukl (or &#8216;Uraina) tribe &#8212;-but I  think he said that they were from &#8216;Ukl came to Medina and (they became ill, so) the  Prophet ordered them to go to the herd of (Milch) she-camels and told them to go out and  drink the camels&#8217; urine and milk (as a medicine). So they went and drank it, and when they  became healthy, they killed the shepherd and drove away the camels. This news reached the  Prophet early in the morning, so he sent (some) men in their pursuit and they were  captured and brought to the Prophet before midday. He ordered to cut off their hands and  legs and their eyes to be branded with heated iron pieces and they were thrown at  Al-Harra, and when they asked for water to drink, they were not given water. (Abu Qilaba  said, &#8220;Those were the people who committed theft and murder and reverted to disbelief  after being believers (Muslims), and fought against Allah and His Apostle&#8221;). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 798: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Seven (people) will be shaded by  Allah by His Shade on the Day of Resurrection when there will be no shade except His  Shade. (They will be), a just ruler, a young man who has been brought up in the worship of  Allah, a man who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes are then flooded with tears, a  man whose heart is attached to mosques (offers his compulsory congregational prayers in  the mosque), two men who love each other for Allah&#8217;s Sake, a man who is called by a  charming lady of noble birth to commit illegal sexual intercourse with her, and he says,  &#8216;I am afraid of Allah,&#8217; and (finally), a man who gives in charity so secretly that his  left hand does not know what his right hand has given.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever guarantees me (the chastity  of) what is between his legs (i.e. his private parts), and what is between his jaws (i.e.,  his tongue), I guarantee him Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 800i: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I will narrate to you a narration which nobody will narrate  to you after me. I heard that form the Prophet. I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;The Hour  sill not be established&#8221; or said: &#8220;From among the portents of the Hour is that  the religious knowledge will betaken away (by the death of religious Scholars) and general  ignorance (of religion) will appear; and the drinking of alcoholic drinks will be very  common, and (open) illegal sexual intercourse will prevail, and men will decrease in  number while women will increase so much so that, for fifty women there will only be one  man to look after them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ikrima from Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostles said, &#8220;When a slave (of Allah)  commits illegal sexual intercourse, he is not a believer at the time of committing it; and  if he steals, he is not a believer at the time of stealing; and if he drinks an alcoholic  drink, when he is not a believer at the time of drinking it; and he is not a believer when  he commits a murder,&#8221; &#8216;Ikrima said: I asked Ibn Abbas, &#8220;How is faith taken away  from him?&#8221; He said, Like this,&#8221; by clasping his hands and then separating them,  and added, &#8220;But if he repents, faith returns to him like this, by clasping his hands  again. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The one who commits an illegal  sexual intercourse is not a believer at the time of committing illegal sexual intercourse  and a thief is not a believer at the time of committing theft and a drinker of alcoholic  drink is not a believer at the time of drinking. Yet, (the gate of) repentance is open  thereafter.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Which is the biggest  sin?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To set up rivals to Allah by worshipping others though He alone  has created you.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To kill your  child lest it should share your food.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;To commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor.&#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet asked them. &#8220;What is  the legal punishment (for this sin) in your Book (Torah)?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Our  priests have innovated the punishment of blackening the faces with charcoal and  Tajbiya.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, tell them to bring the  Torah.&#8221; The Torah was brought, and then one of the Jews put his hand over the Divine  Verse of the Rajam (stoning to death) and started reading what preceded and what followed  it. On that, Ibn Salam said to the Jew, &#8220;Lift up your hand.&#8221; Behold! The Divine  Verse of the Rajam was under his hand.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Ma&#8217;iz bin Malik came to the Prophet (in order to  confess), the Prophet said to him, &#8220;Probably you have only kissed (the lady), or  winked, or looked at her?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet  said, using no euphemism, &#8220;Did you have sexual intercourse with her?&#8221; The  narrator added: At that, (i.e. after his confession) the Prophet ordered that he be stoned  (to death). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man from among the people, came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting in the mosque, and addressed him, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! I have committed an illegal sexual intercourse.&#8221; The Prophet turned his face  away from him. The man came to that side to which the Prophet had turned his face, and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have committed an illegal intercourse.&#8221; The Prophet  turned his face to the other side, and the man came to that side, and when he confessed  four times, the Prophet called him and said, &#8220;Are you mad?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Are you married?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes,  O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said (to the people), &#8220;Take him away and stone  him to death.&#8221; Ibn Shihab added, &#8220;I was told by one who heard Jabir, that Jabir  said, &#8216;I was among those who stoned the man, and we stoned him at the Musalla (&#8216;Id praying  Place), and when the stones troubled him, he jumped quickly and ran away, but we overtook  him at Al-Harra and stoned him to death (there).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were with the Prophet , a man stood up and said  (to the Prophet ), &#8220;I beseech you by Allah, that you should judge us according to  Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; Then the man&#8217;s opponent who was wiser than him, got up saying (to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle) &#8220;Judge us according to Allah&#8217;s Law and kindly allow me (to  speak).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;&#8216;Speak.&#8221; He said, &#8220;My son was a laborer  working for this man and he committed an illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and I  gave one-hundred sheep and a slave as a ransom for my son&#8217;s sin. Then I asked a learned  man about this case and he informed me that my son should receive one hundred lashes and  be exiled for one year, and the man&#8217;s wife should be stoned to death.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to the Laws of  Allah. Your one-hundred sheep and the slave are to be returned to you, and your son has to  receive one-hundred lashes and be exiled for one year. O Unais! Go to the wife of this  man, and if she confesses, then stone her to death.&#8221; Unais went to her and she  confessed. He then stoned her to death. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I am afraid that after a long time has  passed, people may say, &#8220;We do not find the Verses of the Rajam (stoning to death) in  the Holy Book,&#8221; and consequently they may go astray by leaving an obligation that  Allah has revealed. Lo! I confirm that the penalty of Rajam be inflicted on him who  commits illegal sexual intercourse, if he is already married and the crime is proved by  witnesses or pregnancy or confession.&#8221; Sufyan added, &#8220;I have memorized this  narration in this way.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;Surely Allah&#8217;s Apostle carried out the  penalty of Rajam, and so did we after him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 817: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I used to teach (the Qur&#8217;an to) some people of the  Muhajirln (emigrants), among whom there was &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin &#8216;Auf. While I was in his  house at Mina, and he was with &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab during &#8216;Umar&#8217;s last Hajj, Abdur-Rahman  came to me and said, &#8220;Would that you had seen the man who came today to the Chief of  the Believers (&#8216;Umar), saying, &#8216;O Chief of the Believers! What do you think about  so-and-so who says, &#8216;If &#8216;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of allegiance to  such-and-such person, as by Allah, the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr was nothing but a  prompt sudden action which got established afterwards.&#8217; &#8216;Umar became angry and then said,  &#8216;Allah willing, I will stand before the people tonight and warn them against those people  who want to deprive the others of their rights (the question of rulership).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;I said, &#8216;O Chief of the  believers! Do not do that, for the season of Hajj gathers the riff-raff and the rubble,  and it will be they who will gather around you when you stand to address the people. And I  am afraid that you will get up and say something, and some people will spread your  statement and may not say what you have actually said and may not understand its meaning,  and may interpret it incorrectly, so you should wait till you reach Medina, as it is the  place of emigration and the place of Prophet&#8217;s Traditions, and there you can come in touch  with the learned and noble people, and tell them your ideas with confidence; and the  learned people will understand your statement and put it in its proper place.&#8217; On that,  &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;By Allah! Allah willing, I will do this in the first speech I will deliver  before the people in Medina.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas added: We reached Medina by the end of the month  of Dhul-Hijja, and when it was Friday, we went quickly (to the mosque) as soon as the sun  had declined, and I saw Sa&#8217;id bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail sitting at the corner of the  pulpit, and I too sat close to him so that my knee was touching his knee, and after a  short while &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab came out, and when I saw him coming towards us, I said to  Said bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail &#8220;Today &#8216;Umar will say such a thing as he has never  said since he was chosen as Caliph.&#8221; Said denied my statement with astonishment and  said, &#8220;What thing do you expect &#8216;Umar to say the like of which he has never said  before?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the meantime, &#8216;Umar sat on the pulpit and when the  callmakers for the prayer had finished their call, &#8216;Umar stood up, and having glorified  and praised Allah as He deserved, he said, &#8220;Now then, I am going to tell you  something which (Allah) has written for me to say. I do not know; perhaps it portends my  death, so whoever understands and remembers it, must narrate it to the others wherever his  mount takes him, but if somebody is afraid that he does not understand it, then it is  unlawful for him to tell lies about me. Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and revealed  the Holy Book to him, and among what Allah revealed, was the Verse of the Rajam (the  stoning of married person (male &amp; female) who commits illegal sexual intercourse, and  we did recite this Verse and understood and memorized it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle did carry out  the punishment of stoning and so did we after him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I am afraid that after a long time has passed, somebody  will say, &#8216;By Allah, we do not find the Verse of the Rajam in Allah&#8217;s Book,&#8217; and thus they  will go astray by leaving an obligation which Allah has revealed. And the punishment of  the Rajam is to be inflicted to any married person (male &amp; female), who commits  illegal sexual intercourse, if the required evidence is available or there is conception  or confession. And then we used to recite among the Verses in Allah&#8217;s Book: &#8216;O people! Do  not claim to be the offspring of other than your fathers, as it is disbelief  (unthankfulness) on your part that you claim to be the offspring of other than your real  father.&#8217; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Do not praise me excessively as Jesus, son of Marry  was praised, but call me Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostles.&#8217; (O people!) I have been informed  that a speaker amongst you says, &#8216;By Allah, if &#8216;Umar should die, I will give the pledge of  allegiance to such-and-such person.&#8217; One should not deceive oneself by saying that the  pledge of allegiance given to Abu Bakr was given suddenly and it was successful. No doubt,  it was like that, but Allah saved (the people) from its evil, and there is none among you  who has the qualities of Abu Bakr. Remember that whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to  anybody among you without consulting the other Muslims, neither that person, nor the  person to whom the pledge of allegiance was given, are to be supported, lest they both  should be killed. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>And no doubt after the death of the Prophet we were  informed that the Ansar disagreed with us and gathered in the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;da. &#8216;Ali and  Zubair and whoever was with them, opposed us, while the emigrants gathered with Abu Bakr.  I said to Abu Bakr, &#8216;Let&#8217;s go to these Ansari brothers of ours.&#8217; So we set out seeking  them, and when we approached them, two pious men of theirs met us and informed us of the  final decision of the Ansar, and said, &#8216;O group of Muhajirin (emigrants) ! Where are you  going?&#8217; We replied, &#8216;We are going to these Ansari brothers of ours.&#8217; They said to us, &#8216;You  shouldn&#8217;t go near them. Carry out whatever we have already decided.&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Allah, we  will go to them.&#8217; And so we proceeded until we reached them at the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;da.  Behold! There was a man sitting amongst them and wrapped in something. I asked, &#8216;Who is  that man?&#8217; They said, &#8216;He is Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;What is wrong with him?&#8217; They  said, &#8216;He is sick.&#8217; After we sat for a while, the Ansar&#8217;s speaker said, &#8216;None has the  right to be worshipped but Allah,&#8217; and praising Allah as He deserved, he added, &#8216;To  proceed, we are Allah&#8217;s Ansar (helpers) and the majority of the Muslim army, while you,  the emigrants, are a small group and some people among you came with the intention of  preventing us from practicing this matter (of caliphate) and depriving us of it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the speaker had finished, I intended to speak as I had  prepared a speech which I liked and which I wanted to deliver in the presence of Abu Bakr,  and I used to avoid provoking him. So, when I wanted to speak, Abu Bakr said, &#8216;Wait a  while.&#8217; I disliked to make him angry. So Abu Bakr himself gave a speech, and he was wiser  and more patient than I. By Allah, he never missed a sentence that I liked in my own  prepared speech, but he said the like of it or better than it spontaneously. After a pause  he said, &#8216;O Ansar! You deserve all (the qualities that you have attributed to yourselves,  but this question (of Caliphate) is only for the Quraish as they are the best of the Arabs  as regards descent and home, and I am pleased to suggest that you choose either of these  two men, so take the oath of allegiance to either of them as you wish. And then Abu Bakr  held my hand and Abu Ubada bin Abdullah&#8217;s hand who was sitting amongst us. I hated nothing  of what he had said except that proposal, for by Allah, I would rather have my neck  chopped off as expiator for a sin than become the ruler of a nation, one of whose members  is Abu Bakr, unless at the time of my death my own-self suggests something I don&#8217;t feel at  present.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>And then one of the Ansar said, &#8216;I am the pillar on which  the camel with a skin disease (eczema) rubs itself to satisfy the itching (i.e., I am a  noble), and I am as a high class palm tree! O Quraish. There should be one ruler from us  and one from you.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then there was a hue and cry among the gathering and their  voices rose so that I was afraid there might be great disagreement, so I said, &#8216;O Abu  Bakr! Hold your hand out.&#8217; He held his hand out and I pledged allegiance to him, and then  all the emigrants gave the Pledge of allegiance and so did the Ansar afterwards. And so we  became victorious over Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada (whom Al-Ansar wanted to make a ruler). One of the  Ansar said, &#8216;You have killed Sa&#8217;d bin Ubada.&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Allah has killed Sa&#8217;d bin  Ubada.&#8217; Umar added, &#8220;By Allah, apart from the great tragedy that had happened to us  (i.e. the death of the Prophet), there was no greater problem than the allegiance pledged  to Abu Bakr because we were afraid that if we left the people, they might give the Pledge  of allegiance after us to one of their men, in which case we would have given them our  consent for something against our real wish, or would have opposed them and caused great  trouble. So if any person gives the Pledge of allegiance to somebody (to become a Caliph)  without consulting the other Muslims, then the one he has selected should not be granted  allegiance, lest both of them should be killed.&#8221; </font></p>

Give your verdict according to Allah&#8217;s Laws  (in our case).&#8221; Then his opponent got up and said, &#8220;He has told the truth, O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Decide his case according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. My son was a laborer working  for this person, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his wife, and the people  told me that my son should be stoned to death, but I offered one-hundred sheep and a slave  girl as a ransom for him. Then I asked the religious learned people, and they told me that  my son should be flogged with one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, I will judge you according to Allah&#8217;s  Laws. The sheep and the slave girl will be returned to you and your son will be flogged  one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And you, O Unais! Go to the wife of this  man (and if she confesses), stone her to death.&#8221; So Unais went in the morning and  stoned her to death (after she had confessed). </font></p>

One of them put his hand over the verse of the Rajam and read what was before  and after it. Abdullah bin Salam said to him, &#8220;Lift up your hand.&#8221; Where he  lifted it there appeared the verse of the Rajam. So they said, &#8220;O Muhammad! He has  said the truth, the verse of the Rajam is in it (Torah).&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered that the two persons (guilty of illegal sexual intercourse) be stoned to death,  and so they were stoned, and I saw the man bending over the woman so as to protect her  from the stones. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;My wife  has delivered a black child.&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Have you camels?&#8221;  He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What color are they?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;They are red.&#8221; The Prophet further asked, &#8220;Are any of them gray  in color?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet asked him, &#8220;Whence did that  grayness come?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I thing it descended from the camel&#8217;s ancestors.&#8221;  Then the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Therefore, this child of yours has most probably  inherited the color from his ancestors.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade Al-Wisal (fasting continuously for  more than one day without taking any meals). A man from the Muslims said, &#8220;But you do  Al-Wisal, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle I said, &#8220;Who among you is similar  to me? I sleep and my Lord makes me eat and drink.&#8221; When the people refused to give  up Al-Wisal, the Prophet fasted along with them for one day, and did not break his fast  but continued his fast for another day, and when they saw the crescent, the Prophet said,  &#8220;If the crescent had not appeared, I would have made you continue your fast (for a  third day),&#8221; as if he wanted to punish them for they had refused to give up Al-Wisal.  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I witnessed the case of Lian (the case of a man who charged  his wife for committing illegal sexual intercourse when I was fifteen years old. The  Prophet ordered that they be divorced, and the husband said, &#8220;If I kept her, I would  be a liar.&#8221; I remember that Az-Zubair also said, &#8220;(It was said) that if that  woman brought forth the child with such-and-such description, her husband would prove  truthful, but if she brought it with such-and-such description looking like a Wahra (a red  insect), he would prove untruthful.&#8221; I heard Az-Zubair also saying, &#8220;Finally she  gave birth to a child of description which her husband disliked . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas mentioned the couple who had taken the oath of  Lian. &#8216;Abdullah bin Shaddad said (to him), &#8220;Was this woman about whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8216;If I were ever to stone to death any woman without witnesses. (I would have stoned  that woman to death)?&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas replied,&#8221; No, that lady exposed herself (by her  suspicious behavior).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 8, Book 82, Number 839: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Lian was mentioned in the presence of the Prophet, Asim bin  Adi said a statement about it, and when he left, a man from his tribe came to him  complaining that he had seen a man with his wife. Asim said, &#8220;I have been put to  trial only because of my statement.&#8221; So he took the man to the Prophet and the man  told him about the incident. The man (husband) was of yellow complexion, thin, and of lank  hair, while the man whom he had accused of having been with his wife, was reddish brown  with fat thick legs and fat body. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Reveal the truth.&#8221;  Later on the lady delivered a child resembling the man whom the husband had accused of  having been with her. So the Prophet made them take the oath of Lian. A man said to Ibn  Abbas in the gathering, &#8220;Was that the same lady about whom the Prophet said, &#8220;If  I were to stone any lady (for committing illegal sexual intercourse) to death without  witnesses, I would have stoned that lade to death?&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;No, that  was another lady who used to behave in such a suspicious way among the Muslims that one  might accuse her of committing illegal sexual intercourse.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Avoid the seven great destructive  sins.&#8221; They (the people!) asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What are they?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;To join partners in worship with Allah; to practice sorcery; to kill the life  which Allah has forbidden except for a just cause (according to Islamic law); to eat up  usury (Riba), to eat up the property of an orphan; to give one&#8217;s back to the enemy and  freeing from the battle-field at the time of fighting and to accuse chaste women who never  even think of anything touching chastity and are good believers.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I beseech you to  judge us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; Then his opponent who was wiser than he, got up  and said, &#8220;He has spoken the truth. So judge us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws and please  allow me (to speak), O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;My son was a laborer for the family of this man and he committed illegal  sexual intercourse with his wife, and I gave one-hundred sheep and a slave as a ransom  (for my son), but I asked the religious learned people (regarding this case), and they  informed me that my son should be flogged one-hundred stripes, and be exiled for one year,  and the wife of this man should be stoned (to death).&#8221;The Prophet said, &#8220;By Him  in Whose Hand my soul is, I will Judge you (in this case) according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. The  one-hundred (sheep) and the slave shall be returned to you and your son shall be flogged  one-hundred stripes and be exiled for one year. And O Unais! Go in the morning to the wife  of this man and ask her, and if she confesses, stone her to death.&#8221; She confessed and  he stoned her to death. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the truthful and truly-inspired, said,  &#8220;Each one of you collected in the womb of his mother for forty days, and then turns  into a clot for an equal period (of forty days) and turns into a piece of flesh for a  similar period (of forty days) and then Allah sends an angel and orders him to write four  things, i.e., his provision, his age, and whether he will be of the wretched or the  blessed (in the Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into him. And by Allah, a person  among you (or a man) may do deeds of the people of the Fire till there is only a cubit or  an arm-breadth distance between him and the Fire, but then that writing (which Allah has  ordered the angel to write) precedes, and he does the deeds of the people of Paradise and  enters it; and a man may do the deeds of the people of Paradise till there is only a cubit  or two between him and Paradise, and then that writing precedes and he does the deeds of  the people of the Fire and enters it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah puts an angel in charge of  the uterus and the angel says, &#8216;O Lord, (it is) semen! O Lord, (it is now ) a clot! O  Lord, (it is now) a piece of flesh.&#8217; And then, if Allah wishes to complete its creation,  the angel asks, &#8216;O Lord, (will it be) a male or a female? A wretched (an evil doer) or a  blessed (doer of good)? How much will his provisions be? What will his age be?&#8217; So all  that is written while the creature is still in the mother&#8217;s womb.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Can the people of  Paradise be known (differentiated) from the people of the Fire; The Prophet replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Why do people (try to) do (good) deeds?&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Everyone will do the deeds for which he has been created to do or he  will do those deeds which will be made easy for him to do.&#8221; (i.e. everybody will find  easy to do such deeds as will lead him to his destined place for which he has been  created). </font></p>

The Prophet told the  messenger to tell her, &#8220;It is for Allah what He takes, and it is for Allah what He  gives, and everything has its fixed time (limit). So (she should) be patient and look for  Allah&#8217;s reward.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That while he was sitting with the Prophet a man from the  Ansar came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet once delivered a speech in front of us wherein  he left nothing but mentioned (about) everything that would happen till the Hour.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were sitting with the Prophet who had a stick with  which he was scraping the earth, he lowered his head and said, &#8220;There is none of you  but has his place assigned either in the Fire or in Paradise.&#8221; Thereupon a man from  the people said, &#8220;Shall we not depend upon this, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;No, but carry on and do your deeds, for everybody finds it easy to do such  deeds (as will lead him to his place).&#8221; The Prophet then recited the Verse: &#8216;As for  him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allah..&#8217; (92.5) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We witnessed along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle the Khaibar  (campaign). Allah&#8217;s Apostle told his companions about a man who claimed to be a Muslim,  &#8220;This man is from the people of the Fire.&#8221; When the battle started, the man  fought very bravely and received a great number of wounds and got crippled. On that, a man  from among the companions of the Prophet came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you  know what the man you described as of the people of the Fire has done? He has fought very  bravely for Allah&#8217;s Cause and he has received many wounds.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;But he is indeed one of the people of the Fire.&#8221; Some of the Muslims were about  to have some doubt about that statement. So while the man was in that state, the pain  caused by the wounds troubled him so much that he put his hand into his quiver and took  out an arrow and committed suicide with it. Off went some men from among the Muslims to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has made your statement true.  So-and-so has committed suicide.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Bilal! Get up and  announce in public: None will enter Paradise but a believer, and Allah may support this  religion (Islam) with a wicked man.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sa&#8217;d: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a man who fought most bravely of all the Muslims  on behalf of the Muslims in a battle (Ghazwa) in the company of the Prophet. The Prophet  looked at him and said. &#8220;If anyone would like to see a man from the people of the  Fire, let him look at this (brave man).&#8221; On that, a man from the People (Muslims)  followed him, and he was in that state i.e., fighting fiercely against the pagans till he  was wounded, and then he hastened to end his life by placing his sword between his breasts  (and pressed it with great force) till it came out between his shoulders. Then the man  (who was watching that person) went quickly to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I testify that  you are Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet asked him, &#8220;Why do you say that?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;You said about so-and-so, &#8216;If anyone would like to see a man from the people  of the Fire, he should look at him.&#8217; He fought most bravely of all of us on behalf of the  Muslims and I knew that he would not die as a Muslim (Martyr). So when he got wounded, he  hastened to die and committed suicide.&#8221; There-upon the Prophet said, &#8220;A man may  do the deeds of the people of the Fire while in fact he is one of the people of Paradise,  and he may do the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he belongs to the people  of Fire, and verily, (the rewards of) the deeds are decided by the last actions  (deeds)&#8221;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a holy battle, we  never went up a hill or reached its peak or went down a valley but raised our voices with  Takbir. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came close to us and said, &#8220;O people! Don&#8217;t exert yourselves,  for you do not call a deaf or an absent one, but you call the All-Listener, the  All-Seer.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais! Shall I teach you a  sentence which is from the treasures of Paradise? ( It is): &#8216;La haula wala quwata illa  billah. (There is neither might nor power except with Allah).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I did not see anything so resembling minor sins as what Abu  Huraira said from the Prophet, who said, &#8220;Allah has written for the son of Adam his  inevitable share of adultery whether he is aware of it or not: The adultery of the eye is  the looking (at something which is sinful to look at), and the adultery of the tongue is  to utter (what it is unlawful to utter), and the innerself wishes and longs for (adultery)  and the private parts turn that into reality or refrain from submitting to the  temptation.&#8221; </font></p>

Allah favored you with His talk (talked  to you directly) and He wrote (the Torah) for you with His Own Hand. Do you blame me for  action which Allah had written in my fate forty years before my creation?&#8217; So Adam  confuted Moses, Adam confuted Moses,&#8221; the Prophet added, repeating the Statement  three times. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ash&#8217;ari: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Give food to the hungry, pay a  visit to the sick and release (set free) the one in captivity (by paying his  ransom).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 287i: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once while I was in a state of fatigue (because of severe  hunger), I met &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab, so I asked him to recite a verse from Allah&#8217;s Book to  me. He entered his house and interpreted it to me. (Then I went out and) after walking for  a short distance, I fell on my face because of fatigue and severe hunger. Suddenly I saw  Allah&#8217;s Apostle standing by my head. He said, &#8220;O Abu Huraira!&#8221; I replied,  &#8220;Labbaik, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and Sadaik!&#8221; Then he held me by the hand, and made  me get up. Then he came to know what I was suffering from. He took me to his house, and  ordered a big bowl of milk for me. I drank thereof and he said, &#8220;Drink more, O Abu  Hirr!&#8221; So I drank again, whereupon he again said, &#8220;Drink more.&#8221; So I drank  more till my belly became full and looked like a bowl. Afterwards I met &#8216;Umar and  mentioned to him what had happened to me, and said to him, &#8220;Somebody, who had more  right than you, O &#8216;Umar, took over the case. By Allah, I asked you to recite a Verse to me  while I knew it better than you.&#8221; On that Umar said to me, &#8220;By Allah, if I  admitted and entertained you, it would have been dearer to me than having nice red camels.  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a boy under the care of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and my hand  used to go around the dish while I was eating. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8216;O boy!  Mention the Name of Allah and eat with your right hand, and eat of the dish what is nearer  to you.&#8221; Since then I have applied those instructions when eating. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Who was the son of Um Salama, the wife of the Prophet: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I ate a meal with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I was eating  from all sides of the dish. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;Eat of the dish what is  nearer to you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Wahb bin Kaisan Abi Nu&#8217;aim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A meal was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while his step-son,  &#8216;Umar bin Abi Salama was with him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;Mention the Name of  Allah and eat of the dish what is nearer to you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A tailor invited Allah&#8217;s Apostle to a meal which he had  prepared. I went along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and saw him seeking to eat the pieces of gourd  from the various sides of the dish. Since that day I have liked to eat gourd. &#8216;Umar bin  Abi Salama said: The Prophet, said to me, &#8220;Eat with your right hand.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet used to love to start doing things from the  right side whenever possible, in performing ablution, putting on his shoes, and combing  his hair. (Al-Ash&#8217;ath said: The Prophet used to do so in all his affairs.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 293: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha said to Um Sulaim, &#8220;I have heard the voice  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle which was feeble, and I think that he is hungry. Have you got something  (to eat)?&#8221; She took out some loaves of barley bread, then took her face-covering  sheet and wrapped the bread in part of it, and pushed it under my garment and turned the  rest of it around my body and sent me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . I went with that, and found  Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the mosque with some people. I stood up near them, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked me, &#8220;Have you been sent by Abu Talha?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked,  &#8220;With some food (for us)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to  all those who were with him, &#8220;Get up!&#8221; He set out (and all the people  accompanied him) and I proceeded ahead of them till I came to Abu Talha. Abu Talha then  said, &#8220;O Um Sulaim! Allah&#8217;s Apostle has arrived along with the people, and we do not  have food enough to feed them all.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know  better.&#8221; So Abu Talha went out till he met Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then Abu Talha and  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and entered the house. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Um Sulaim ! Bring  whatever you have.&#8221; She brought that very bread. The Prophet ordered that it be  crushed into small pieces, and Um Sulaim pressed a skin of butter on it. Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said whatever Allah wished him to say (to bless the food) and then added,  &#8220;Admit ten (men).&#8221; So they were admitted, ate their fill and went out. The  Prophet then said, &#8220;Admit ten (more).&#8221; They were admitted, ate their full, and  went out. He then again said, &#8220;Admit ten more!&#8221; They were admitted, ate their  fill, and went out. He admitted ten more, and so all those people ate their fill, and they  were eighty men. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 65, Number 294: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were one hundred and thirty men sitting with the  Prophet. The Prophet said, &#8220;Have anyone of you any food with him?&#8221; It happened  that one man had one Sa of wheat flour (or so) which was turned into dough then. After a  while a tall lanky pagan came, driving some sheep. The Prophet asked, &#8216;Will you sell us (a  sheep), or give (it to) us as a gift?&#8221; The pagan said, &#8220;No, but I will sell it  &#8221; So the Prophet bought from him a sheep which was slaughtered, and then the Prophet  ordered that the liver, the kidneys, lungs and heart, etc., of that sheep be roasted. By  Allah, none of those one hundred and thirty men but had his share of those things. The  Prophet gave to those who were present, and also kept a share for those who were absent He  then served that cooked sheep in two big trays and we all ate together our fill; yet there  remained a part of it in those two trays which I carried on the camel. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Suwaid bin An-Nu&#8217;man: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Khaibar, and when we  were at As-Sahba&#8217;, (Yahya, a sub-narrator said, &#8220;As-Sahba&#8217; is a place at a distance  of one day&#8217;s journey to Khaibar).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked the people to bring their  food, but there was nothing with the people except Sawiq. So we all chewed and ate of it.  Then the Prophet asked for some water and he rinsed his mouth, and we too, rinsed our  mouths. Then he led us in the Maghrib prayer without performing ablution (again). </font></p>

The Prophet invited the people to  those mastigures and they were eaten on his dining sheet, but the Prophet did not eat of  it, as if he disliked it.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he went with Allah&#8217;s Apostle to the house of Maimuna,  who was his and Ibn &#8216;Abbas&#8217; aunt. He found with her a roasted mastigure which her sister  Hufaida bint Al-Harith had brought from Najd. Maimuna presented the mastigure before  Allah&#8217;s Apostle who rarely started eating any (unfamiliar) food before it was described  and named for him. (But that time) Allah&#8217;s Apostle stretched his hand towards the (meat of  the) mastigure whereupon a lady from among those who were present, said, &#8220;You should  inform Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what you have presented to him. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! It is the  meat of a mastigure.&#8221; (On learning that) Allah&#8217;s Apostle withdrew his hand from the  meat of the mastigure. Khalid bin Al-Walid said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is this unlawful  to eat?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;No, but it is not found in the land of my  people, so I do not like it.&#8221; Khalid said, &#8220;Then I pulled the mastigure (meat)  towards me and ate it while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was looking at me. </font></p>

I have lost my eyesight and I  lead my people in the prayer (as an Imam). When it rains, the valley which is between me  and my people, flows with water, and then I cannot go to their mosque to lead them in the  prayer. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I wish that you could come and pray in my house so that I may  take it as a praying place. The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah willing, I will do that.&#8221;  The next morning, soon after the sun had risen, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came with Abu Bakr. The  Prophet asked for the permission to enter and I admitted him. The Prophet had not sat till  he had entered the house and said to me, &#8220;Where do you like me to pray in your  house?&#8221; I pointed at a place in my house whereupon he stood and said, &#8220;Allahu  Akbar.&#8221; We lined behind him and he prayed two Rakat and finished it with Taslim. We  then requested him to stay for a special meal of Khazira which we had prepared. A large  number of men from the adjoining area gathered in the house. One of them said, &#8220;Where  is Malik bin Ad-Dukhshun?&#8221; Another man said, &#8220;He is a hypocrite and does not  love Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not say so. Do you not think  that he has said: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,&#8221; seeking  Allah&#8217;s pleasure? The man said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better, but we have  always seen him mixing with hypocrites and giving them advice.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Allah has forbidden the (Hell) Fire for those who testify that none has the right to  be worshipped but Allah, seeking Allah&#8217;s pleasure. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Three traditions have been established because of Barira:  &#8216;Aisha intended to buy her and set her free, but Barira&#8217;s masters said, &#8220;Her wala&#8217;  will be for us.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha mentioned that to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who said, &#8220;You could  accept their condition if you wished, for the wala is for the one who manumits the  slave.&#8221; Barira was manumitted, then she was given the choice either to stay with her  husband or leave him; One day Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s house while there was a  cooking pot of food boiling on the fire. The Prophet asked for lunch, and he was presented  with bread and some extra food from the home-made Udm (e.g. soup). He asked, &#8220;Don&#8217;t I  see meat (being cooked)?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! But it is the meat  that has been given to Barira in charity and she has given it to us as a present.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;For Barira it is alms, but for us it is a present.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a Jew in Medina who used to lend me money up to  the season of plucking dates. (Jabir had a piece of land which was on the way to Ruma).  That year the land was not promising, so the payment of the debt was delayed one year. The  Jew came to me at the time of plucking, but gathered nothing from my land. I asked him to  give me one year respite, but he refused. This news reached the Prophet whereupon he said  to his companions, &#8220;Let us go and ask the Jew for respite for Jabir.&#8221; All of  them came to me in my garden, and the Prophet started speaking to the Jew, but he Jew  said, &#8220;O Abu Qasim! I will not grant him respite.&#8221; When the Prophet saw the  Jew&#8217;s attitude, he stood up and walked all around the garden and came again and talked to  the Jew, but the Jew refused his request. I got up and brought some ripe fresh dates and  put it in front of the Prophet. He ate and then said to me, &#8220;Where is your hut, O  Jabir?&#8221; I informed him, and he said, &#8220;Spread out a bed for me in it.&#8221; I  spread out a bed, and he entered and slept. When he woke up, I brought some dates to him  again and he ate of it and then got up and talked to the Jew again, but the Jew again  refused his request. Then the Prophet got up for the second time amidst the palm trees  loaded with fresh dates, and said, &#8220;O Jabir! Pluck dates to repay your debt.&#8221;  The Jew remained with me while I was plucking the dates, till I paid him all his right,  yet there remained extra quantity of dates. So I went out and proceeded till I reached the  Prophet and informed him of the good news, whereupon he said, &#8220;I testify that I am  Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; </font></p>

If you wish, you may invite him; and if you wish, you may refuse  him.&#8221; Abu Shu&#8217;aib said, &#8220;No, I will admit him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I know (about) the Hijab (the order of veiling of women)  more than anybody else. Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b used to ask me about it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle became the  bridegroom of Zainab bint Jahsh whom he married at Medina. After the sun had risen high in  the sky, the Prophet invited the people to a meal. Allah&#8217;s Apostle remained sitting and  some people remained sitting with him after the other guests had left. Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle got up and went away, and I too, followed him till he reached the door of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s  room. Then he thought that the people must have left the place by then, so he returned and  I also returned with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he  went back again for the second time, and I went along with him too. When we reached the  door of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s room, he returned and I also returned with him to see that the people had  left. Thereupon the Prophet hung a curtain between me and him and the Verse regarding the  order for (veiling of women) Hijab was revealed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Ishaq: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once, while I was sitting beside Zaid bin Al-Arqam, he was  asked, &#8220;How many Ghazwat did the Prophet undertake?&#8221; Zaid replied,  &#8220;Nineteen.&#8221; They said, &#8220;In how many Ghazwat did you join him?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;Seventeen.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Which of these was the first?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;Al-&#8216;Ashira or Al-&#8216;Ashiru.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 286: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>From Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh: Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh was an intimate friend  of Umaiya bin Khalaf and whenever Umaiya passed through Medina, he used to stay with Sad,  and whenever Sad went to Mecca, he used to stay with Umaiya. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived  at Medina, Sa&#8217;d went to perform &#8216;Umra and stayed at Umaiya&#8217;s home in Mecca. He said to  Umaiya, &#8220;Tell me of a time when (the Mosque) is empty so that I may be able to  perform Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; So Umaiya went with him about midday. Abu Jahl met  them and said, &#8220;O Abu Safwan! Who is this man accompanying you?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;He is Sad.&#8221; Abu Jahl addressed Sad saying, &#8220;I see you wandering about  safely in Mecca inspite of the fact that you have given shelter to the people who have  changed their religion (i.e. became Muslims) and have claimed that you will help them and  support them. By Allah, if you were not in the company of Abu Safwan, you would not be  able to go your family safely.&#8221; Sad, raising his voice, said to him, &#8220;By Allah,  if you should stop me from doing this (i.e. performing Tawaf) I would certainly prevent  you from something which is more valuable for you, that is, your passage through  Medina.&#8221; On this, Umaiya said to him, &#8220;O Sad do not raise your voice before  Abu-l-Hakam, the chief of the people of the Valley (of Mecca).&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;O  Umaiya, stop that! By Allah, I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle predicting that the Muslim will  kill you.&#8221; Umaiya asked, &#8220;In Mecca?&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;I do not know.&#8221;  Umaiya was greatly scared by that news. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Umaiya returned to his family, he said to his wife,  &#8220;O Um Safwan! Don&#8217;t you know what Sad told me? &#8220;She said, &#8220;What has he told  you?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;He claims that Muhammad has informed them (i.e. companions  that they will kill me. I asked him, &#8216;In Mecca?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I do not know.&#8221; Then  Umaiya added, &#8220;By Allah, I will never go out of Mecca.&#8221; But when the day of (the  Ghazwa of) Badr came, Abu Jahl called the people to war, saying, &#8220;Go and protect your  caravan.&#8221; But Umaiya disliked to go out (of Mecca). Abu Jahl came to him and said,  &#8220;O Abu Safwan! If the people see you staying behind though you are the chief of the  people of the Valley, then they will remain behind with you.&#8221; Abu Jahl kept on urging  him to go until he (i.e. Umaiya) said, &#8220;As you have forced me to change my mind, by  Allah, I will buy the best camel in Mecca. Then Umaiya said (to his wife). &#8220;O Um  Safwan, prepare what I need (for the journey).&#8221; She said to him, &#8220;O Abu Safwan!  Have you forgotten what your Yathribi brother told you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, but I do  not want to go with them but for a short distance.&#8221; So when Umaiya went out, he used  to tie his camel wherever he camped. He kept on doing that till Allah caused him to be  killed at Badr. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 287: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Kab bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I never failed to join Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any of his  Ghazawat except in the Ghazwa of Tabuk. However, I did not take part in the Ghazwa of  Badr, but none who failed to take part in it, was blamed, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle had gone out  to meet the caravans of (Quraish, but Allah caused them (i.e. Muslims) to meet their enemy  unexpectedly (with no previous intention) . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Masud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I witnessed Al-Miqdad bin Al-Aswad in a scene which would  have been dearer to me than anything had I been the hero of that scene. He (i.e.  Al-Miqdad) came to the Prophet while the Prophet was urging the Muslims to fight with the  pagans. Al-Miqdad said, &#8220;We will not say as the People of Moses said: Go you and your  Lord and fight you two. (5.27). But we shall fight on your right and on your left and in  front of you and behind you.&#8221; I saw the face of the Prophet getting bright with  happiness, for that saying delighted him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of the battle of Badr, the Prophet said, &#8220;O  Allah! I appeal to You (to fulfill) Your Covenant and Promise. O Allah! If Your Will is  that none should worship You (then give victory to the pagans).&#8221; Then Abu Bakr took  hold of him by the hand and said, &#8220;This is sufficient for you.&#8221; The Prophet came  out saying, &#8220;Their multitude will be put to flight and they will show their  backs.&#8221; (54.45) </font></p>

Then he returned and the enemy got hold of the bridle of his  (horse) and struck him two blows (with the sword) on his shoulder. Between these two  wounds there was a scar caused by a blow, he had received on the day of Badr (battle).  When I was a child I used to play with those scars by putting my fingers in them. On that  day (my brother) &#8220;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair was also with him and he was ten years old.  Az-Zubair had carried him on a horse and let him to the care of some men. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of Badr, the Prophet ordered that the corpses of  twenty four leaders of Quraish should be thrown into one of the dirty dry wells of Badr.  (It was a habit of the Prophet that whenever he conquered some people, he used to stay at  the battle-field for three nights. So, on the third day of the battle of Badr, he ordered  that his she-camel be saddled, then he set out, and his companions followed him saying  among themselves.&#8221; &#8220;Definitely he (i.e. the Prophet) is proceeding for some  great purpose.&#8221; When he halted at the edge of the well, he addressed the corpses of  the Quraish infidels by their names and their fathers&#8217; names, &#8220;O so-and-so, son of  so-and-so and O so-and-so, son of so-and-so! Would it have pleased you if you had obeyed  Allah and His Apostle? We have found true what our Lord promised us.

We said  (to her),&#8221;(Give us) the letter.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have no letter.&#8221; Then we  made her camel kneel down and we searched her, but we found no letter. Then we said,  &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not told us a lie, certainly. Take out the letter, otherwise we  will strip you naked.&#8221; When she saw that we were determined, she put her hand below  her waist belt, for she had tied her cloak round her waist, and she took out the letter,  and we brought her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle Then &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (This  Hatib) has betrayed Allah, His Apostle and the believers! Let me cut off his neck!&#8221;  The Prophet asked Hatib, &#8220;What made you do this?&#8221; Hatib said, &#8220;By Allah, I  did not intend to give up my belief in Allah and His Apostle but I wanted to have some  influence among the (Mecca) people so that through it, Allah might protect my family and  property. There is none of your companions but has some of his relatives there through  whom Allah protects his family and property.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He has spoken  the truth; do no say to him but good.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;He as betrayed Allah, His  Apostle and the faithful believers. Let me cut off his neck!&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Is he not one of the Badr warriors? May be Allah looked at the Badr warriors and  said, &#8216;Do whatever you like, as I have granted Paradise to you, or said, &#8216;I have forgiven  you.&#8221;&#8216; On this, tears came out of Umar&#8217;s eyes, and he said, &#8220;Allah and His  Apostle know better.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of Uhud the Prophet appointed &#8216;Abdullah bin  Jubair as chief of the archers, and seventy among us were injured and martyred. On the day  (of the battle) of Badr, the Prophet and his companions had inflicted 140 casualties on  the pagans, 70 were taken prisoners, and 70 were killed. Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;This is a  day of (revenge) for the day of Badr and the issue of war is undecided .&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was fighting in the front file on the day (of the  battle) of Badr, suddenly I looked behind and saw on my right and left two young boys and  did not feel safe by standing between them. Then one of them asked me secretly so that his  companion may not hear, &#8220;O Uncle! Show me Abu Jahl.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O nephew!  What will you do to him?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have promised Allah that if I see him  (i.e. Abu Jahl), I will either kill him or be killed before I kill him.&#8221; Then the  other said the same to me secretly so that his companion should not hear. I would not have  been pleased to be in between two other men instead of them. Then I pointed him (i.e. Abu  Jahl) out to them. Both of them attacked him like two hawks till they knocked him down.  Those two boys were the sons of &#8216;Afra&#8217; (i.e. an Ansari woman). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 325: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent out ten spies under the command of  &#8216;Asim bin Thabit Al-Ansari, the grand-father of &#8216;Asim bin &#8216;Umar Al-Khattab. When they  reached (a place called) Al-Hadah between &#8216;Usfan and Mecca, their presence was made known  to a sub-tribe of Hudhail called Banu Lihyan. So they sent about one hundred archers after  them. The archers traced the footsteps (of the Muslims) till they found the traces of  dates which they had eaten at one of their camping places. The archers said, &#8220;These  dates are of Yathrib (i.e. Medina),&#8221; and went on tracing the Muslims&#8217; footsteps. When  &#8216;Asim and his companions became aware of them, they took refuge in a (high) place. But the  enemy encircled them and said, &#8220;Come down and surrender. We give you a solemn promise  and covenant that we will not kill anyone of you.&#8221; &#8216;Asim bin Thabit said, &#8220;O  people! As for myself, I will never get down to be under the protection of an infidel. O  Allah! Inform your Prophet about us.&#8221; So the archers threw their arrows at them and  martyred &#8216;Asim. Three of them came down and surrendered to them, accepting their promise  and covenant and they were Khubaib, Zaid bin Ad-Dathina and another man. When the archers  got hold of them, they untied the strings of the arrow bows and tied their captives with  them. The third man said, &#8220;This is the first proof of treachery! By Allah, I will not  go with you for I follow the example of these.&#8221; He meant the martyred companions. The  archers dragged him and struggled with him (till they martyred him). Then Khubaib and Zaid  bin Ad-Dathina were taken away by them and later on they sold them as slaves in Mecca  after the event of the Badr battle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The sons of Al-Harit bin &#8216;Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib for  he was a person who had killed (their father) Al-Hari bin &#8216;Amr on the day (of the battle)  of Badr. Khubaib remained imprisoned by them till they decided unanimously to kill him.  One day Khubaib borrowed from a daughter of Al-Harith, a razor for shaving his public  hair, and she lent it to him. By chance, while she was inattentive, a little son of hers  went to him (i.e. Khubaib) and she saw that Khubaib had seated him on his thigh while the  razor was in his hand. She was so much terrified that Khubaib noticed her fear and said,  &#8220;Are you afraid that I will kill him? Never would I do such a thing.&#8221; Later on  (while narrating the story) she said, &#8220;By Allah, I had never seen a better captive  than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes in his hand while  he was fettered with iron chains and (at that time) there was no fruit in Mecca.&#8221; She  used to say,&#8221; It was food Allah had provided Khubaib with.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When they took him to Al-Hil out of Mecca sanctuary to  martyr him, Khubaib requested them. &#8220;Allow me to offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer.&#8221;  They allowed him and he prayed two Rakat and then said, &#8220;By Allah! Had I not been  afraid that you would think I was worried, I would have prayed more.&#8221; Then he  (invoked evil upon them) saying, &#8220;O Allah! Count them and kill them one by one, and  do not leave anyone of them&#8221;&#8216; Then he recited: &#8220;As I am martyred as a Muslim, I  do not care in what way I receive my death for Allah&#8217;s Sake, for this is for the Cause of  Allah. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs of my body.&#8221; Then Abu Sarva, &#8216;Ubqa  bin Al-Harith went up to him and killed him. It was Khubaib who set the tradition of  praying for any Muslim to be martyred in captivity (before he is executed). The Prophet  told his companions of what had happened (to those ten spies) on the same day they were  martyred. Some Quraish people, being informed of &#8216;Asim bin Thabit&#8217;s death, sent some  messengers to bring a part of his body so that his death might be known for certain, for  he had previously killed one of their leaders (in the battle of Badr). But Allah sent a  swarm of wasps to protect the dead body of &#8216;Asim, and they shielded him from the  messengers who could not cut anything from his body. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Umar was once told that Said bin Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin  Nufail, one of the Badr warriors, had fallen ill on a Friday.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Subaia bint Al-Harith: That she was married to Sad  bin Khaula who was from the tribe of Bani &#8216;Amr bin Luai, and was one of those who fought  the Badr battle. He died while she wa pregnant during Hajjat-ul-Wada.&#8217; Soon after his  death, she gave birth to a child. When she completed the term of deliver (i.e. became  clean), she prepared herself for suitors. Abu As-Sanabil bin Bu&#8217;kak, a man from the tribe  of Bani Abd-ud-Dal called on her and said to her, &#8220;What! I see you dressed up for the  people to ask you in marriage. Do you want to marry By Allah, you are not allowed to marry  unless four months and ten days have elapsed (after your husband&#8217;s death).&#8221; Subai&#8217;a  in her narration said, &#8220;When he (i.e. Abu As-Sanabil) said this to me. I put on my  dress in the evening and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and asked him about this problem. He gave  the verdict that I was free to marry as I had already given birth to my child and ordered  me to marry if I wished.&#8221; </font></p>

When &#8216;Umar died, Az-Zubair  took it back, and then &#8216;Uthman demanded it from him and he gave it to him. When &#8216;Uthman  was martyred, the spear remained with Ali&#8217;s offspring. Then &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair  demanded it back, and it remained with him till he was martyred. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I had a she-camel which I got in my share from the booty of  the battle of Badr, and the Prophet had given me another she camel from the Khumus which  Allah had bestowed on him that day. And when I intended to celebrate my marriage to  Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet, I made an arrangement with a goldsmith from Bani  Qainuqa &#8216;that he should go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass used by  gold-smiths) which I intended to sell to gold-smiths in order to spend its price on the  marriage banquet. While I was collecting ropes and sacks of pack saddles for my two  she-camels which were kneeling down beside an Ansari&#8217;s dwelling and after collecting what  I needed, I suddenly found that the humps of the two she-camels had been cut off and their  flanks had been cut open and portions of their livers had been taken out. On seeing that,  I could not help weeping. I asked, &#8220;Who has done that?&#8221; They (i.e. the people)  said, &#8220;Hamza bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib has done it. He is present in this house with some  Ansari drinkers, a girl singer, and his friends. The singer said in her song, &#8220;O  Hamza, get at the fat she-camels!&#8221; On hearing this, Hamza rushed to his sword and cut  of the camels&#8217; humps and cut their flanks open and took out portions from their  livers.&#8221; Then I came to the Prophet, with whom Zaid bin Haritha was present. The  Prophet noticed my state and asked, &#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I have never experienced such a day as today! Hamza attacked my two  she-camels, cut off their humps and cut their flanks open, and he is still present in a  house along some drinkers.&#8221; The Prophet asked for his cloak, put it on, and  proceeded, followed by Zaid bin Haritha and myself, till he reached the house where Hamza  was. He asked the permission to enter, and he was permitted. The Prophet started blaming  Hamza for what he had done. Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red. He looked at the  Prophet then raised his eyes to look at his knees and raised his eves more to look at his  face and then said, &#8220;You are not but my father&#8217;s slaves.&#8221; When the Prophet  understood that Hamza was drunk, he retreated, walking backwards went out and we left with  him. </font></p>

Some days later, Allah&#8217;s Apostle demanded her hand in marriage and I married  her to him. Later on Abu Bakr met me and said, &#8220;Perhaps you were angry with me when  you offered me Hafsa for marriage and I gave no reply to you?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Abu Bakr  said, &#8216;Nothing prevented me from accepting your offer except that I learnt that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle had referred to the issue of Hafsa and I did not want to disclose the secret of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle , but had he (i.e. the Prophet) given her up I would surely have accepted  her.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That &#8216;Amr bin Auf, who was an ally of Bani &#8216;Amir bin Luai  and one of those who fought at Badr in the company of the Prophet , said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s  Apostle sent Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah to Bahrain to bring the Jizya taxation from its  people, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle had made a peace treaty with the people of Bahrain and  appointed Al-&#8216;Ala&#8217; bin Al-Hadrami as their ruler. So, Abu &#8216;Ubaida arrived with the money  from Bahrain. When the Ansar heard of the arrival of Abu &#8216;Ubaida (on the next day) they  offered the morning prayer with the Prophet and when the morning prayer had finished, they  presented themselves before him. On seeing the Ansar, Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled and said,  &#8220;I think you have heard that Abu &#8216;Ubaida has brought something?&#8221; They replied,  &#8220;Indeed, it is so, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He said, &#8220;Be happy, and hope for  what will please you. By Allah, I am not afraid that you will be poor, but I fear that  worldly wealth will be bestowed upon you as it was bestowed upon those who lived before  you. So you will compete amongst yourselves for it, as they competed for it and it will  destroy you as it did them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Malik bin Aus Al-Hadathan An-Nasri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That once &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab called him and while he was  sitting with him, his gatekeeper, Yarfa came and said, &#8220;Will you admit &#8216;Uthman,  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf, AzZubair and Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) who are waiting for your  permission?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes, let them come in.&#8221; After a while, Yarfa-  came again and said, &#8220;Will you admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas who are asking your  permission?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So, when the two entered, &#8216;Abbas said,  &#8220;O chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. &#8216;Ali). &#8220;Both of them  had a dispute regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle  as Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting), &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas started reproaching each  other. The (present) people (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and his companions) said, &#8220;O chief of the  believers! Give your verdict in their case and relieve each from) the other.&#8221; &#8216;Umar  said, &#8220;Wait I beseech you, by Allah, by Whose Permission both the heaven and the  earth stand fast! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;We (Prophets) our properties are  not to be inherited, and whatever we leave, is to be spent in charity,&#8217; and he said it  about himself?&#8221; They (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and his company) said, &#8220;He did say it.  &#8220;&#8216;Umar then turned towards &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you both, by  Allah! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said this?&#8221; They replied in the affirmative.  He said, &#8220;Now I am talking to you about this matter. Allah the Glorified favored His  Apostle with something of this Fai (i.e. booty won without fighting) which He did not give  to anybody else. Allah said:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And what Allah gave to His Apostle  (&#8220;Fai&#8221;&#8221; Booty) from them&#8211;For which you made no expedition With either  Calvary or camelry. But Allah gives power to His Apostles Over whomsoever He will And  Allah is able to do all things.&#8221; (59.6) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So this property was especially granted to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  . But by Allah, the Prophet neither took it all for himself only, nor deprived you of it,  but he gave it to all of you and distributed it amongst you till only this remained out of  it. And from this Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to spend the yearly maintenance for his family, and  whatever used to remain, he used to spend it where Allah&#8217;s Property is spent (i.e. in  charity), Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on acting like that during all his life, Then he died, and  Abu Bakr said, &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; So he (i.e. Abu Bakr) took charge  of this property and disposed of it in the same manner as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and  all of you (at that time) knew all about it.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar turned towards &#8216;Ali and  &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;You both remember that Abu Bakr disposed of it in the way you have  described and Allah knows that, in that matter, he was sincere, pious, rightly guided and  the follower of the right. Then Allah caused Abu Bakr to die and I said, &#8216;I am the  successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I kept this property in my possession for  the first two years of my rule (i.e. Caliphate and I used to dispose of it in the same wa  as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr used to do; and Allah knows that I have been sincere,  pious, rightly guided an the follower of the right (in this matte Later on both of you  (i.e. &#8216;Ali and Abbas) came to me, and the claim of you both was one and the same, O  &#8216;Abbas! You also came to me. So I told you both that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Our  property is not inherited, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity.&#8217; Then when I  thought that I should better hand over this property to you both or the condition that you  will promise and pledge before Allah that you will dispose it off in the same way as  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did and as I have done since the beginning of my caliphate or  else you should not speak to me (about it).&#8217; So, both of you said to me, &#8216;Hand it over to  us on this condition.&#8217; And on this condition I handed it over to you. Do you want me now  to give a decision other than that (decision)? By Allah, with Whose Permission both the  sky and the earth stand fast, I will never give any decision other than that (decision)  till the Last Hour is established. But if you are unable to manage it (i.e. that  property), then return it to me, and I will manage on your behalf.&#8221; The sub-narrator  said, &#8220;I told &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair of this Hadith and he said, &#8216;Malik bin Aus has told  the truth&#8221; I heard &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet saying, &#8216;The wives of the Prophet  sent &#8216;Uthman to Abu Bakr demanding from him their 1/8 of the Fai which Allah had granted  to his Apostle. But I used to oppose them and say to them: Will you not fear Allah? Don&#8217;t  you know that the Prophet used to say: Our property is not inherited, but whatever we  leave is to be given in charity? The Prophet mentioned that regarding himself. He added:  &#8216;The family of Muhammad can take their sustenance from this property. So the wives of the  Prophet stopped demanding it when I told them of that.&#8217; So, this property (of Sadaqa) was  in the hands of Ali who withheld it from &#8216;Abbas and overpowered him. Then it came in the  hands of Hasan bin &#8216;Ali, then in the hands of Husain bin &#8216;Ali, and then in the hands of  Ali bin Husain and Hasan bin Hasan, and each of the last two used to manage it in turn,  then it came in the hands of Zaid bin Hasan, and it was truly the Sadaqa of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle .&#8221; </font></p>

Would you like that I kill him?&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama said, &#8220;Then allow me to say a (false) thing  (i.e. to deceive Kab). &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;You may say it.&#8221; Then Muhammad  bin Maslama went to Kab and said, &#8220;That man (i.e. Muhammad demands Sadaqa (i.e.  Zakat) from us, and he has troubled us, and I have come to borrow something from  you.&#8221; On that, Kab said, &#8220;By Allah, you will get tired of him!&#8221; Muhammad  bin Maslama said, &#8220;Now as we have followed him, we do not want to leave him unless  and until we see how his end is going to be. Now we want you to lend us a camel load or  two of food.&#8221; (Some difference between narrators about a camel load or two.) Kab  said, &#8220;Yes, (I will lend you), but you should mortgage something to me.&#8221;  Muhammad bin Mas-lama and his companion said, &#8220;What do you want?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b replied,  &#8220;Mortgage your women to me.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How can we mortgage our women to  you and you are the most handsome of the &#8216;Arabs?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Then mortgage your  sons to me.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How can we mortgage our sons to you? Later they would  be abused by the people&#8217;s saying that so-and-so has been mortgaged for a camel load of  food. That would cause us great disgrace, but we will mortgage our arms to you.&#8221;  Muhammad bin Maslama and his companion promised Kab that Muhammad would return to him. He  came to Kab at night along with Kab&#8217;s foster brother, Abu Na&#8217;ila. Kab invited them to come  into his fort, and then he went down to them. His wife asked him, &#8220;Where are you  going at this time?&#8221; Kab replied, &#8220;None but Muhammad bin Maslama and my (foster)  brother Abu Na&#8217;ila have come.&#8221; His wife said, &#8220;I hear a voice as if dropping  blood is from him, Ka&#8217;b said. &#8220;They are none but my brother Muhammad bin Maslama and  my foster brother Abu Naila. A generous man should respond to a call at night even if  invited to be killed.&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama went with two men. (Some narrators  mention the men as &#8216;Abu bin Jabr. Al Harith bin Aus and Abbad bin Bishr). So Muhammad bin  Maslama went in together with two men, and sail to them, &#8220;When Ka&#8217;b comes, I will  touch his hair and smell it, and when you see that I have got hold of his head, strip him.  I will let you smell his head.&#8221; Kab bin Al-Ashraf came down to them wrapped in his  clothes, and diffusing perfume. Muhammad bin Maslama said. &#8221; have never smelt a  better scent than this. Ka&#8217;b replied. &#8220;I have got the best &#8216;Arab women who know how  to use the high class of perfume.&#8221; Muhammad bin Maslama requested Ka&#8217;b &#8220;Will you  allow me to smell your head?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Muhammad smelt it and made  his companions smell it as well. Then he requested Ka&#8217;b again, &#8220;Will you let me  (smell your head)?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; When Muhammad got a strong hold of  him, he said (to his companions), &#8220;Get at him!&#8221; So they killed him and went to  the Prophet and informed him. (Abu Rafi) was killed after Ka&#8217;b bin Al-Ashraf.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 371: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara bin Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent some men from the Ansar to ((kill) Abu  Rafi, the Jew, and appointed &#8216;Abdullah bin Atik as their leader. Abu Rafi used to hurt  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and help his enemies against him. He lived in his castle in the land of  Hijaz. When those men approached (the castle) after the sun had set and the people had  brought back their livestock to their homes. Abdullah (bin Atik) said to his companions,  &#8220;Sit down at your places. I am going, and I will try to play a trick on the  gate-keeper so that I may enter (the castle).&#8221; So &#8216;Abdullah proceeded towards the  castle, and when he approached the gate, he covered himself with his clothes, pretending  to answer the call of nature. The people had gone in, and the gate-keeper (considered  &#8216;Abdullah as one of the castle&#8217;s servants) addressing him saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Servant!  Enter if you wish, for I want to close the gate.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added in his story,  &#8220;So I went in (the castle) and hid myself. When the people got inside, the  gate-keeper closed the gate and hung the keys on a fixed wooden peg. I got up and took the  keys and opened the gate. Some people were staying late at night with Abu Rafi for a  pleasant night chat in a room of his. When his companions of nightly entertainment went  away, I ascended to him, and whenever I opened a door, I closed it from inside. I said to  myself, &#8216;Should these people discover my presence, they will not be able to catch me till  I have killed him.&#8217; So I reached him and found him sleeping in a dark house amidst his  family, I could not recognize his location in the house. So I shouted, &#8216;O Abu Rafi!&#8217; Abu  Rafi said, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; I proceeded towards the source of the voice and hit him with the  sword, and because of my perplexity, I could not kill him. He cried loudly, and I came out  of the house and waited for a while, and then went to him again and said, &#8216;What is this  voice, O Abu Rafi?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Woe to your mother! A man in my house has hit me with a  sword! I again hit him severely but I did not kill him. Then I drove the point of the  sword into his belly (and pressed it through) till it touched his back, and I realized  that I have killed him. I then opened the doors one by one till I reached the staircase,  and thinking that I had reached the ground, I stepped out and fell down and got my leg  broken in a moonlit night. I tied my leg with a turban and proceeded on till I sat at the  gate, and said, &#8216;I will not go out tonight till I know that I have killed him.&#8217; So, when  (early in the morning) the cock crowed, the announcer of the casualty stood on the wall  saying, &#8216;I announce the death of Abu Rafi, the merchant of Hijaz. Thereupon I went to my  companions and said, &#8216;Let us save ourselves, for Allah has killed Abu Rafi,&#8217; So I (along  with my companions proceeded and) went to the Prophet and described the whole story to  him. &#8220;He said, &#8216;Stretch out your (broken) leg. I stretched it out and he rubbed it  and it became All right as if I had never had any ailment whatsoever.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Atik and &#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Utba with a group of men to Abu Rafi (to kill him). They proceeded till they approached  his castle, whereupon &#8216;Abdullah bin Atik said to them, &#8220;Wait (here), and in the  meantime I will go and see.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said later on, &#8220;I played a trick in order  to enter the castle. By chance, they lost a donkey of theirs and came out carrying a  flaming light to search for it. I was afraid that they would recognize me, so I covered my  head and legs and pretended to answer the call to nature. The gatekeeper called, &#8216;Whoever  wants to come in, should come in before I close the gate.&#8217; So I went in and hid myself in  a stall of a donkey near the gate of the castle. They took their supper with Abu Rafi and  had a chat till late at night. Then they went back to their homes. When the voices  vanished and I no longer detected any movement, I came out. I had seen where the  gate-keeper had kept the key of the castle in a hole in the wall. I took it and unlocked  the gate of the castle, saying to myself, &#8216;If these people should notice me, I will run  away easily.&#8217; Then I locked all the doors of their houses from outside while they were  inside, and ascended to Abu Rafi by a staircase. I saw the house in complete darkness with  its light off, and I could not know where the man was. So I called, &#8216;O Abu Rafi!&#8217; He  replied, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; I proceeded towards the voice and hit him. He cried loudly but my  blow was futile. Then I came to him, pretending to help him, saying with a different tone  of my voice, &#8216; What is wrong with you, O Abu Rafi?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Are you not surprised? Woe  on your mother! A man has come to me and hit me with a sword!&#8217; So again I aimed at him and  hit him, but the blow proved futile again, and on that Abu Rafi cried loudly and his wife  got up. I came again and changed my voice as if I were a helper, and found Abu Rafi lying  straight on his back, so I drove the sword into his belly and bent on it till I heard the  sound of a bone break. Then I came out, filled with astonishment and went to the staircase  to descend, but I fell down from it and got my leg dislocated. I bandaged it and went to  my companions limping. I said (to them), &#8216;Go and tell Allah&#8217;s Apostle of this good news,  but I will not leave (this place) till I hear the news of his (i.e. Abu Rafi&#8217;s) death.&#8217;  When dawn broke, an announcer of death got over the wall and announced, &#8216;I convey to you  the news of Abu Rafi&#8217;s death.&#8217; I got up and proceeded without feeling any pain till I  caught up with my companions before they reached the Prophet to whom I conveyed the good  news.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We faced the pagans on that day (of the battle of Uhud) and  the Prophet placed a batch of archers (at a special place) and appointed &#8216;Abdullah (bin  Jubair) as their commander and said, &#8220;Do not leave this place; and if you should see  us conquering the enemy, do not leave this place, and if you should see them conquering  us, do not (come to) help us,&#8221; So, when we faced the enemy, they took to their heel  till I saw their women running towards the mountain, lifting up their clothes from their  legs, revealing their leg-bangles. The Muslims started saying, &#8220;The booty, the  booty!&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair said, &#8220;The Prophet had taken a firm promise from me  not to leave this place.&#8221; But his companions refused (to stay). So when they refused  (to stay there), (Allah) confused them so that they could not know where to go, and they  suffered seventy casualties. Abu Sufyan ascended a high place and said, &#8220;Is Muhammad  present amongst the people?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221; Abu  Sufyan said, &#8220;Is the son of Abu Quhafa present among the people?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Do not answer him.&#8221; Abd Sufyan said, &#8220;Is the son of Al-Khattab  amongst the people?&#8221; He then added, &#8220;All these people have been killed, for,  were they alive, they would have replied.&#8221; On that, &#8216;Umar could not help saying,  &#8220;You are a liar, O enemy of Allah! Allah has kept what will make you unhappy.&#8221;  Abu Safyan said, &#8220;Superior may be Hubal!&#8221; On that the Prophet said (to his  companions), &#8220;Reply to him.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;What may we say?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Say: Allah is More Elevated and More Majestic!&#8221; Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;We have  (the idol) Al-&#8216;Uzza, whereas you have no &#8216;Uzza!&#8221; The Prophet said (to his  companions), &#8220;Reply to him.&#8221; They said, &#8220;What may we say?&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Say: Allah is our Helper and you have no helper.&#8221; Abu Sufyan said,  &#8220;(This) day compensates for our loss at Badr and (in) the battle (the victory) is  always undecided and shared in turns by the belligerents. You will see some of your dead  men mutilated, but neither did I urge this action, nor am I sorry for it.&#8221; Narrated  Jabir: Some people took wine in the morning of the day of Uhud and were then killed as  martyrs. </font></p>

Then worldly wealth was bestowed upon  us and we were given thereof too much. We are afraid that the reward of our deeds have  been given to us in this life.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman then started weeping so much that he  left the food. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We migrated in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, seeking  Allah&#8217;s Pleasure. So our reward became due and sure with Allah. Some of us have been dead  without enjoying anything of their rewards (here), and one of them was Mus&#8217;ab bin &#8216;Umar  who was martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud, and did not leave anything except a  Namira (i.e. a sheet in which he was shrouded). If we covered his head with it, his feet  became naked, and if we covered his feet with it, his head became naked. So the Prophet  said to us, &#8220;Cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass) over  his feet or throw Idhkhir over his feet.&#8221; But some amongst us have got the fruits of  their labor ripened, and they are collecting them. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: His uncle (Anas bin An-Nadr) was absent from  the battle of Badr and he said, &#8220;I was absent from the first battle of the Prophet  (i.e. Badr battle), and if Allah should let me participate in (a battle) with the Prophet,  Allah will see how strongly I will fight.&#8221; So he encountered the day of Uhud battle.  The Muslims fled and he said, &#8220;O Allah ! I appeal to You to excuse me for what these  people (i.e. the Muslims) have done, and I am clear from what the pagans have done.&#8221;  Then he went forward with his sword and met Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh (fleeing), and asked him,  &#8220;Where are you going, O Sad? I detect a smell of Paradise before Uhud.&#8221; Then he  proceeded on and was martyred. No-body was able to recognize him till his sister  recognized him by a mole on his body or by the tips of his fingers. He had over 80 wounds  caused by stabbing, striking or shooting with arrows. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Among the Believers are men Who have been true to Their  Covenant with Allah, Of them, some have fulfilled Their obligations to Allah (i.e. they  have been Killed in Allah&#8217;s Cause), And some of them are (still) waiting&#8221; (33.23) So  we wrote this in its place in the Quran. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet set out for (the battle of) Uhud, some of  those who had gone out with him, returned. The companions of the Prophet were divided into  two groups. One group said, &#8220;We will fight them (i.e. the enemy),&#8221; and the other  group said, &#8220;We will not fight them.&#8221; So there came the Divine Revelation:&#8211; &#8216;(O  Muslims!) Then what is the matter within you that you are divided. Into two parties about  the hypocrites? Allah has cast them back (to disbelief) Because of what they have earned.&#8217;  (4.88) On that, the Prophet said, &#8220;That is Taiba (i.e. the city of Medina) which  clears one from one&#8217;s sins as the fire expels the impurities of silver.&#8221; </font></p>

My father was martyred on the day of Uhud and left nine (orphan) daughters who  are my nine sisters; so I disliked to have another young girl of their age, but (I sought)  an (elderly) woman who could comb their hair and look after them.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;You have done the right thing.&#8221; </font></p>

When the creditors saw  him, they started claiming their debts from me then in such a harsh manner (as they had  never done before). So when he saw their attitude, he went round the biggest heap of dates  thrice, and then sat over it and said, &#8216;O Jabir), call your companions (i.e. the  creditors).&#8217; Then he kept on measuring (and giving) to the creditors (their due) till  Allah paid all the debt of my father. I would have been satisfied to retain nothing of  those dates for my sisters after Allah had paid the debts of my father. But Allah saved  all the heaps (of dates), so that when I looked at the heap where the Prophet had been  sitting, it seemed as if a single date had not been taken away thereof.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When it was the day of Uhud, the people left the Prophet  while Abu Talha was in front of the Prophet shielding him with his leather shield. Abu  Talha was a skillful archer who used to shoot violently. He broke two or three arrow bows  on that day. If a man carrying a quiver full of arrows passed by, the Prophet would say  (to him), put (scatter) its contents for Abu Talha.&#8221; The Prophet would raise his head  to look at the enemy, whereupon Abu Talha would say, &#8220;Let my father and mother be  sacrificed for you ! Do not raise your head, lest an arrow of the enemy should hit you.  (Let) my neck (be struck) rather than your neck.&#8221; I saw &#8216;Aisha, the daughter of Abu  Bakr, and Um Sulaim rolling up their dresses so that I saw their leg-bangles while they  were carrying water skins on their backs and emptying them in the mouths of the (wounded)  people. They would return to refill them and again empty them in the mouths of the  (wounded) people. The sword fell from Abu Talha&#8217;s hand twice or thrice (on that day). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When it was the day of Uhud, the pagans were defeated. Then  Satan, Allah&#8217;s Curse be upon him, cried loudly, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Worshippers, beware of  what is behind!&#8221; On that, the front files of the (Muslim) forces turned their backs  and started fighting with the back files. Hudhaifa looked, and on seeing his father  Al-Yaman, he shouted, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Worshippers, my father, my father!&#8221; But by  Allah, they did not stop till they killed him. Hudhaifa said, &#8220;May Allah forgive  you.&#8221; (The sub-narrator, &#8216;Urwa, said, &#8220;By Allah, Hudhaifa continued asking  Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for the killers of his father till he departed to Allah (i.e.  died).&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Uthman bin Mauhab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to perform the Hajj to (Allah&#8217;s) House. Seeing  some people sitting, he said, &#8220;Who are these sitting people?&#8221; Somebody said,  &#8220;They are the people of Quraish.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Who is the old man?&#8221; They  said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Umar.&#8221; He went to him and said, &#8220;I want to ask you about  something; will you tell me about it? I ask you with the respect due to the sanctity of  this (Sacred) House, do you know that &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan fled on the day of Uhud?&#8221;  Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you know that he (i.e. &#8216;Uthman) was  absent from the Badr (battle) and did not join it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Do you know that he failed to be present at the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance  (i.e. Pledge of allegiance at Hudaibiya) and did not witness it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar replied,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; He then said, &#8220;Allahu-Akbar!&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Come along;  I will inform you and explain to you what you have asked. As for the flight (of &#8216;Uthman)  on the day of Uhud, I testify that Allah forgave him. As regards his absence from the Badr  (battle), he was married to the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she was ill, so the  Prophet said to him, &#8216;You will have such reward as a man who has fought the Badr battle  will get, and will also have the same share of the booty.&#8217; As for his absence from the  Ridwan Pledge of allegiance if there had been anybody more respected by the Meccans than  &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan, the Prophet would surely have sent that man instead of &#8216;Uthman. So the  Prophet sent him (i.e. &#8216;Uthman to Mecca) and the Ridwan Pledge of allegiance took place  after &#8216;Uthman had gone to Mecca. The Prophet raised his right hand saying. &#8216;This is the  hand of &#8216;Uthman,&#8217; and clapped it over his other hand and said, &#8220;This is for  &#8216;Uthman.'&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then said (to the man), &#8220;Go now, after taking this  information.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jafar bin &#8216;Amr bin Umaiya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went out with &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Adi Al-Khaiyar. When we  reached Hims (i.e. a town in Syria), &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Adi said (to me), &#8220;Would you  like to see Wahshi so that we may ask him about the killing of Hamza?&#8221; I replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Wahshi used to live in Hims. We enquired about him and somebody said to  us, &#8220;He is that in the shade of his palace, as if he were a full water skin.&#8221; So  we went up to him, and when we were at a short distance from him, we greeted him and he  greeted us in return. &#8216;Ubaidullah was wearing his turban and Wahshi could not see except  his eyes and feet. &#8216;Ubaidullah said, &#8220;O Wahshi! Do you know me?&#8221; Wahshi looked  at him and then said, &#8220;No, by Allah! But I know that &#8216;Adi bin Al-Khiyar married a  woman called Um Qital, the daughter of Abu Al-Is, and she delivered a boy for him at  Mecca, and I looked for a wet nurse for that child. (Once) I carried that child along with  his mother and then I handed him over to her, and your feet resemble that child&#8217;s  feet.&#8221; Then &#8216;Ubaidullah uncovered his face and said (to Wahshi), &#8220;Will you tell  us (the story of) the killing of Hamza?&#8221; Wahshi replied &#8220;Yes, Hamza killed  Tuaima bin &#8216;Adi bin Al-Khaiyar at Badr (battle) so my master, Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im said to  me, &#8216;If you kill Hamza in revenge for my uncle, then you will be set free.&#8221; When the  people set out (for the battle of Uhud) in the year of &#8216;Ainain ..&#8217;Ainain is a mountain  near the mountain of Uhud, and between it and Uhud there is a valley.. I went out with the  people for the battle. When the army aligned for the fight, Siba&#8217; came out and said, &#8216;Is  there any (Muslim) to accept my challenge to a duel?&#8217; Hamza bin &#8216;Abdul Muttalib came out  and said, &#8216;O Siba&#8217;. O Ibn Um Anmar, the one who circumcises other ladies! Do you challenge  Allah and His Apostle?&#8217; Then Hamza attacked and killed him, causing him to be non-extant  like the bygone yesterday. I hid myself under a rock, and when he (i.e. Hamza) came near  me, I threw my spear at him, driving it into his umbilicus so that it came out through his  buttocks, causing him to die. When all the people returned to Mecca, I too returned with  them. I stayed in (Mecca) till Islam spread in it (i.e. Mecca). Then I left for Taif, and  when the people (of Taif) sent their messengers to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I was told that the  Prophet did not harm the messengers; So I too went out with them till I reached Allah&#8217;s  Apostle. When he saw me, he said, &#8216;Are you Wahshi?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Was it you  who killed Hamza?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;What happened is what you have been told of.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Can  you hide your face from me?&#8217; So I went out when Allah&#8217;s Apostle died, and Musailamah  Al-Kadhdhab appeared (claiming to be a prophet). I said, &#8216;I will go out to Musailamah so  that I may kill him, and make amends for killing Hamza. So I went out with the people (to  fight Musailamah and his followers) and then famous events took place concerning that  battle. Suddenly I saw a man (i.e. Musailamah) standing near a gap in a wall. He looked  like an ash-colored camel and his hair was dishevelled. So I threw my spear at him,  driving it into his chest in between his breasts till it passed out through his shoulders,  and then an Ansari man attacked him and struck him on the head with a sword. &#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;A slave girl on the roof of a house said: Alas! The chief of the believers  (i.e. Musailamah) has been killed by a black slave.&#8221; </font></p>

When Fatima saw that the water aggravated the  bleeding, she took a piece of a mat, burnt it, and inserted its ashes into the wound so  that the blood was congealed (and bleeding stopped).

So they set  out, and when they reached (a place) between &#8216;Usfan and Mecca, they were mentioned to one  of the branch tribes of Bani Hudhail called Lihyan. So, about one-hundred archers followed  their traces till they (i.e. the archers) came to a journey station where they (i.e. &#8216;Asim  and his companions) had encamped and found stones of dates they had brought as journey  food from Medina. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The archers said, &#8220;These are the dates of  Medina,&#8221; and followed their traces till they took them over. When &#8216;Asim and his  companions were not able to go ahead, they went up a high place, and their pursuers  encircled them and said, &#8220;You have a covenant and a promise that if you come down to  us, we will not kill anyone of you.&#8221; &#8216;Asim said, &#8220;As for me, I will never come  down on the security of an infidel. O Allah! Inform Your Prophet about us.&#8221; So they  fought with them till they killed &#8216;Asim along with seven of his companions with arrows,  and there remained Khubaib, Zaid and another man to whom they gave a promise and a  covenant. So when the infidels gave them the covenant and promise, they came down. When  they captured them, they opened the strings of their arrow bows and tied them with it. The  third man who was with them said, &#8220;This is the first breach in the covenant,&#8221;  and refused to accompany them. They dragged him and tried to make him accompany them, but  he refused, and they killed him. Then they proceeded on taking Khubaib and Zaid till they  sold them in Mecca. The sons of Al-Harith bin &#8216;Amr bin Naufal bought Khubaib. It was  Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin &#8216;Amr on the day of Badr. Khubaib stayed with them for  a while as a captive till they decided unanimously to kill him. (At that time) Khubaib  borrowed a razor from one of the daughters of Al-Harith to shave his pubic hair. She gave  it to him. She said later on, &#8220;I was heedless of a little baby of mine, who moved  towards Khubaib, and when it reached him, he put it on his thigh. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I saw it, I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed my  distress while he was carrying the razor in his hand. He said &#8216;Are you afraid that I will  kill it? Allah willing, I will never do that,&#8217; &#8221; Later on she used to say, &#8220;I  have never seen a captive better than Khubaib Once I saw him eating from a bunch of grapes  although at that time no fruits were available at Mecca, and he was fettered with iron  chains, and in fact, it was nothing but food bestowed upon him by Allah.&#8221; So they  took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him. He said, &#8220;Allow me to offer a  two-Rak&#8217;at prayer.&#8221; Then he went to them and said, &#8220;Had I not been afraid that  you would think I was afraid of death, I would have prayed for a longer time.&#8221; So it  was Khubaib who first set the tradition of praying two Rakat before being executed. He  then said, &#8220;O Allah! Count them one by one,&#8221; and added, &#8216;When I am being  martyred as a Muslim, I do not care in what way I receive my death for Allah&#8217;s Sake,  because this death is in Allah&#8217;s Cause. If He wishes, He will bless the cut limbs.&#8221;  Then &#8216;Uqba bin Al-Harith got up and martyred him. The narrator added: The Quraish  (infidels) sent some people to &#8216;Asim in order to bring a part of his body so that his  death might be known for certain, for &#8216;Asim had killed one of their chiefs on the day of  Badr. But Allah sent a cloud of wasps which protected his body from their messengers who  could not harm his body consequently. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas said, &#8220;The Prophet sent seventy men, called  Al-Qurra &#8216;for some purpose. The two groups of Bani Sulaim called Ri&#8217;l and Dhakwan,  appeared to them near a well called Bir Ma&#8217;una. The people (i.e. Al-Qurra) said, &#8216;By  Allah, we have not come to harm you, but we are passing by you on our way to do something  for the Prophet.&#8217; But (the infidels) killed them. The Prophet therefore invoked evil upon  them for a month during the morning prayer. That was the beginning of Al Qunut and we used  not to say Qunut before that.&#8221; A man asked Anas about Al-Qunut, &#8220;Is it to be  said after the Bowing (in the prayer) or after finishing the Recitation (i.e. before  Bowing)?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;No, but (it is to be said) after finishing the  Recitation.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(The tribes of) Ril, Dhakwan, &#8216;Usaiya and Bani Lihyan asked  Allah&#8217;s Apostle to provide them with some men to support them against their enemy. He  therefore provided them with seventy men from the Ansar whom we used to call Al-Qurra&#8217; in  their lifetime. They used to collect wood by daytime and pray at night. When they were at  the well of Ma&#8217;una, the infidels killed them by betraying them. When this news reached the  Prophet , he said Al-Qunut for one month In the morning prayer, invoking evil upon some of  the &#8216;Arab tribes, upon Ril, Dhakwan, &#8216;Usaiya and Bani Libyan. We used to read a verse of  the Qur&#8217;an revealed in their connection, but later the verse was cancelled. It was:  &#8220;convey to our people on our behalf the information that we have met our Lord, and He  is pleased with us, and has made us pleased.&#8221; (Anas bin Malik added:) Allah&#8217;s Prophet  said Qunut for one month in the morning prayer, invoking evil upon some of the &#8216;Arab  tribes (namely), Ril, Dhakwan, Usaiya, and Bani Libyan.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That the Prophet sent his uncle, the brother of Um Sulaim  at the head of seventy riders. The chief of the pagans, &#8216;Amir bin At-Tufail proposed three  suggestions (to the Prophet ) saying, &#8220;Choose one of three alternatives: (1) that the  bedouins will be under your command and the townspeople will be under my command; (2) or  that I will be your successor, (3) or otherwise I will attack you with two thousand from  Bani Ghatafan.&#8221; But &#8216;Amir was infected with plague in the House of Um so-and-so. He  said, &#8220;Shall I stay in the house of a lady from the family of so-and-so after having  a (swelled) gland like that she-camel? Get me my horse.&#8221; So he died on the back of  his horse. Then Haram, the brother of Um Sulaim and a lame man along with another man from  so-and-so (tribe) went towards the pagans (i.e. the tribe of &#8216;Amir). Haram said (to his  companions), &#8220;Stay near to me, for I will go to them. If they (i.e. infidels) should  give me protection, you will be near to me, and if they should kill me, then you should go  back to your companions. Then Haram went to them and said, &#8220;Will you give me  protection so as to convey the message of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; So, he started talking  to them&#8217; but they signalled to a man (to kill him) and he went behind him and stabbed him  (with a spear). He (i.e. Haram) said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar! I have succeeded, by the Lord of  the Ka&#8217;ba!&#8221; The companion of Haram was pursued by the infidels, and then they (i.e.  Haram&#8217;s companions) were all killed except the lame man who was at the top of a mountain.  Then Allah revealed to us a verse that was among the cancelled ones later on. It was: &#8216;We  have met our Lord and He is pleased with us and has made us pleased.&#8217; (After this event)  the Prophet invoked evil on the infidels every morning for 30 days. He invoked evil upon  the (tribes of) Ril, Dhakwan, Bani Lihyan and Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and His Apostle </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr asked the Prophet to allow him to go out (of  Mecca) when he was greatly annoyed (by the infidels). But the Prophet said to him,  &#8221;Wait.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you hope that you will be allowed (to  migrate)?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;I hope so.&#8221; So Abu Bakr waited for him  till one day Allah&#8217;s Apostle came at noon time and addressed him saying &#8220;Let whoever  is present with you, now leave you.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;None is present but my two  daughters.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Have you noticed that I have been allowed to go  out (to migrate)?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I would like to accompany  you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You will accompany me.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have got two she-camels which I had prepared and kept ready for (our)  going out.&#8221; So he gave one of the two (she-camels) to the Prophet and it was Al-Jad&#8217;a  . They both rode and proceeded till they reached the Cave at the mountain of Thaur where  they hid themselves. Amir bin Fuhaira was the slave of &#8216;Abdullah bin Al-Tufail bin  Sakhbara &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s brother from her mother&#8217;s side. Abu Bakr had a milch she-camel. Amir  used to go with it (i.e. the milch she-camel) in the afternoon and come back to them  before noon by setting out towards them in the early morning when it was still dark and  then he would take it to the pasture so that none of the shepherds would be aware of his  job. When the Prophet (and Abu Bakr) went away (from the Cave), he (i.e. &#8216;Amir) too went  along with them and they both used to make him ride at the back of their camels in turns  till they reached Medina. &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira was martyred on the day of Bir Ma&#8217;una. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa: When those (Muslims) at Bir Ma&#8217;una were  martyred and &#8216;Amr bin Umaiya Ad-Damri was taken prisoner, &#8216;Amir bin At-Tufail, pointing at  a killed person, asked Amr, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; &#8216;Amr bin Umaiya said to him, &#8220;He  is &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira.&#8221; &#8216;Amir bin At-Tufail said, &#8220;I saw him lifted to the sky  after he was killed till I saw the sky between him and the earth, and then he was brought  down upon the earth. Then the news of the killed Muslims reached the Prophet and he  announced the news of their death saying, &#8220;Your companions (of Bir Ma&#8217;una) have been  killed, and they have asked their Lord saying, &#8216;O our Lord! Inform our brothers about us  as we are pleased with You and You are pleased with us.&#8221; So Allah informed them (i.e.  the Prophet and his companions) about them (i.e. martyrs of Bir Mauna). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On that day, &#8216;Urwa bin Asma bin As-Salt who was one of  them, was killed, and Urwa (bin Az-Zubair) was named after &#8216;Urwa bin Asma and Mundhir (bin  AzZubair) was named after Mundhir bin &#8216;Amr (who had also been martyred on that day). </font></p>

The Prophet had sent some people called Al-Qurra who  were seventy in number, to some pagan people who had concluded a peace treaty with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle . But those who had concluded the treaty with Allah&#8217;s Apostle violated the treaty  (and martyred all the seventy men). So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said Al-Qunut after Bowing (in the  prayer) for one month, invoking evil upon them. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were digging (the trench) on the day of (Al-Khandaq (  i.e. Trench )) and we came across a big solid rock. We went to the Prophet and said,  &#8220;Here is a rock appearing across the trench.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am coming  down.&#8221; Then he got up, and a stone was tied to his belly for we had not eaten  anything for three days. So the Prophet took the spade and struck the big solid rock and  it became like sand. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to go home.&#8221; (When the  Prophet allowed me) I said to my wife, &#8220;I saw the Prophet in a state that I cannot  treat lightly. Have you got something (for him to eat?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I have  barley and a she goat.&#8221; So I slaughtered the she-kid and she ground the barley; then  we put the meat in the earthenware cooking pot. Then I came to the Prophet when the dough  had become soft and fermented and (the meat in) the pot over the stone trivet had nearly  been well-cooked, and said, &#8220;I have got a little food prepared, so get up O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, you and one or two men along with you (for the food).&#8221; The Prophet asked,  &#8220;How much is that food?&#8221; I told him about it. He said, &#8220;It is abundant and  good. Tell your wife not to remove the earthenware pot from the fire and not to take out  any bread from the oven till I reach there.&#8221; Then he said (to all his companions),  &#8220;Get up.&#8221; So the Muhajirn (i.e. Emigrants) and the Ansar got up. When I came to  my wife, I said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon you! The Prophet came along with the  Muhajirin and the Ansar and those who were present with them.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Did  the Prophet ask you (how much food you had)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then the  Prophet said, &#8220;Enter and do not throng.&#8221; The Prophet started cutting the bread  (into pieces) and put the cooked meat over it. He covered the earthenware pot and the oven  whenever he took something out of them. He would give the food to his companions and take  the meat out of the pot. He went on cutting the bread and scooping the meat (for his  companions) till they all ate their fill, and even then, some food remained. Then the  Prophet said (to my wife), &#8220;Eat and present to others as the people are struck with  hunger.&#8221; </font></p>

So I returned to my wife and said, &#8220;Have you got anything (to eat),  for I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a state of severe hunger.&#8221; She brought out for me,  a bag containing one Sa of barley, and we had a domestic she animal (i.e. a kid) which I  slaughtered then, and my wife ground the barley and she finished at the time I finished my  job (i.e. slaughtering the kid). Then I cut the meat into pieces and put it in an  earthenware (cooking) pot, and returned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . My wife said, &#8220;Do not  disgrace me in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and those who are with him.&#8221; So I went to him  and said to him secretly, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have slaughtered a she-animal (i.e.  kid) of ours, and we have ground a Sa of barley which was with us. So please come, you and  another person along with you.&#8221; The Prophet raised his voice and said, &#8220;O people  of Trench ! Jabir has prepared a meal so let us go.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me,  &#8220;Don&#8217;t put down your earthenware meat pot (from the fireplace) or bake your dough  till I come.&#8221; So I came (to my house) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle too, came, proceeding  before the people. When I came to my wife, she said, &#8220;May Allah do so-and-so to  you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I have told the Prophet of what you said.&#8221; Then she brought  out to him (i.e. the Prophet the dough, and he spat in it and invoked for Allah&#8217;s  Blessings in it. Then he proceeded towards our earthenware meat-pot and spat in it and  invoked for Allah&#8217;s Blessings in it. Then he said (to my wife). Call a lady-baker to bake  along with you and keep on taking out scoops from your earthenware meat-pot, and do not  put it down from its fireplace.&#8221; They were one-thousand (who took their meals), and  by Allah they all ate, and when they left the food and went away, our earthenware pot was  still bubbling (full of meat) as if it had not decreased, and our dough was still being  baked as if nothing had been taken from it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When it was the day of Al-Ahzab (i.e. the clans) and  Allah&#8217;s Apostle dug the trench, I saw him carrying earth out of the trench till dust made  the skin of his abdomen out of my sight and he was a hairy man. I heard him reciting the  poetic verses composed by Ibn Rawaha while he was carrying the earth, &#8220;O Allah!  Without You we would not have been guided, nor would we have given in charity, nor would  we have prayed. So, (O Allah), please send Sakina (i.e. calmness) upon us and make our  feet firm if we meet the enemy, as they have rebelled against us. And if they intend  affliction (i.e. want to frighten us, and fight against us) then we would not (flee but  withstand them).&#8221; The Prophet would then prolong his voice at the last words. </font></p>

I said, &#8216;The condition of the people is as you see, and  no authority has been given to me.&#8217; Hafsa said, (to me), &#8216;Go to them, and as they (i.e.  the people) are waiting for you, and I am afraid your absence from them will produce  division amongst them.&#8217; &#8221; So Hafsa did not leave Ibn &#8216;Umar till we went to them. When  the people differed. Muawiya addressed the people saying, &#8220;&#8216;If anybody wants to say  anything in this matter of the Caliphate, he should show up and not conceal himself, for  we are more rightful to be a Caliph than he and his father.&#8221; On that, Habib bin  Masalama said (to Ibn &#8216;Umar), &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you reply to him (i.e. Muawiya)?&#8221;  &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I untied my garment that was going round my back and legs  while I was sitting and was about to say, &#8216;He who fought against you and against your  father for the sake of Islam, is more rightful to be a Caliph,&#8217; but I was afraid that my  statement might produce differences amongst the people and cause bloodshed, and my  statement might be interpreted not as I intended. (So I kept quiet) remembering what Allah  has prepared in the Gardens of Paradise (for those who are patient and prefer the  Hereafter to this worldly life).&#8221; Habib said, &#8220;You did what kept you safe and  secure (i.e. you were wise in doing so).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sad was wounded on the day of Khandaq (i.e. Trench) when a  man from Quraish, called Hibban bin Al-&#8216;Araqa hit him (with an arrow). The man was Hibban  bin Qais from (the tribe of) Bani Mais bin &#8216;Amir bin Lu&#8217;ai who shot an arrow at Sad&#8217;s  medial arm vein (or main artery of the arm). The Prophet pitched a tent (for Sad) in the  Mosque so that he might be near to the Prophet to visit. When the Prophet returned from  the (battle) of Al-Khandaq (i.e. Trench) and laid down his arms and took a bath Gabriel  came to him while he (i.e. Gabriel) was shaking the dust off his head, and said, &#8220;You  have laid down the arms?&#8221; By Allah, I have not laid them down. Go out to them (to  attack them).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Where?&#8221; Gabriel pointed towards Bani  Quraiza. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to them (i.e. Banu Quraiza) (i.e. besieged them). They  then surrendered to the Prophet&#8217;s judgment but he directed them to Sad to give his verdict  concerning them. Sad said, &#8220;I give my judgment that their warriors should be killed,  their women and children should be taken as captives, and their properties  distributed.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hisham: My father informed me that &#8216;Aisha said,  &#8220;Sad said, &#8220;O Allah! You know that there is nothing more beloved to me than to  fight in Your Cause against those who disbelieved Your Apostle and turned him out (of  Mecca). O Allah! I think you have put to an end the fight between us and them (i.e.  Quraish infidels). And if there still remains any fight with the Quraish (infidels), then  keep me alive till I fight against them for Your Sake. But if you have brought the war to  an end, then let this wound burst and cause my death thereby.&#8217; So blood gushed from the  wound. There was a tent in the Mosque belonging to Banu Ghifar who were surprised by the  blood flowing towards them . They said, &#8216;O people of the tent! What is this thing which is  coming to us from your side?&#8217; Behold! Blood was flowing profusely out of Sad&#8217;s wound. Sad  then died because of that.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Muhairiz: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I entered the Mosque and saw Abu Said Al-Khudri and sat  beside him and asked him about Al-Azl (i.e. coitus interruptus). Abu Said said, &#8220;We  went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle for the Ghazwa of Banu Al-Mustaliq and we received captives  from among the Arab captives and we desired women and celibacy became hard on us and we  loved to do coitus interruptus. So when we intended to do coitus interrupt us, we said,  &#8216;How can we do coitus interruptus before asking Allah&#8217;s Apostle who is present among  us?&#8221; We asked (him) about it and he said, &#8216;It is better for you not to do so, for if  any soul (till the Day of Resurrection) is predestined to exist, it will exist.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We took part in the Ghazwa of Najd along with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and when the time for the afternoon rest approached while he was in a valley with  plenty of thorny trees, he dismounted under a tree and rested in its shade and hung his  sword (on it). The people dispersed amongst the trees in order to have shade. While we  were in this state, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called us and we came and found a bedouin sitting in  front of him. The Prophet said, &#8220;This (Bedouin) came to me while I was asleep, and he  took my sword stealthily. I woke up while he was standing by my head, holding my sword  without its sheath. He said, &#8216;Who will save you from me?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Allah.&#8217; So he  sheathed it (i.e. the sword) and sat down, and here he is.&#8221; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle did  not punish him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 59, Number 462: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to go on a journey, he  used to draw lots amongst his wives, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to take with him the one on  whom lot fell. He drew lots amongst us during one of the Ghazwat which he fought. The lot  fell on me and so I proceeded with Allah&#8217;s Apostle after Allah&#8217;s order of veiling (the  women) had been revealed. I was carried (on the back of a camel) in my howdah and carried  down while still in it (when we came to a halt). So we went on till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had  finished from that Ghazwa of his and returned. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When we approached the city of Medina he announced at night  that it was time for departure. So when they announced the news of departure, I got up and  went away from the army camps, and after finishing from the call of nature, I came back to  my riding animal. I touched my chest to find that my necklace which was made of Zifar  beads (i.e. Yemenite beads partly black and partly white) was missing. So I returned to  look for my necklace and my search for it detained me. (In the meanwhile) the people who  used to carry me on my camel, came and took my howdah and put it on the back of my camel  on which I used to ride, as they considered that I was in it. In those days women were  light in weight for they did not get fat, and flesh did not cover their bodies in  abundance as they used to eat only a little food. Those people therefore, disregarded the  lightness of the howdah while lifting and carrying it; and at that time I was still a  young girl. They made the camel rise and all of them left (along with it). I found my  necklace after the army had gone. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then I came to their camping place to find no call maker of  them, nor one who would respond to the call. So I intended to go to the place where I used  to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back to me (in my search). While I was  sitting in my resting place, I was overwhelmed by sleep and slept. Safwan bin Al-Muattal  As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the army. When he reached my place in the morning, he  saw the figure of a sleeping person and he recognized me on seeing me as he had seen me  before the order of compulsory veiling (was prescribed). So I woke up when he recited  Istirja&#8217; (i.e. &#8220;Inna lillahi wa inna llaihi raji&#8217;un&#8221;) as soon as he recognized  me. I veiled my face with my head cover at once, and by Allah, we did not speak a single  word, and I did not hear him saying any word besides his Istirja&#8217;. He dismounted from his  camel and made it kneel down, putting his leg on its front legs and then I got up and rode  on it. Then he set out leading the camel that was carrying me till we overtook the army in  the extreme heat of midday while they were at a halt (taking a rest). (Because of the  event) some people brought destruction upon themselves and the one who spread the Ifk  (i.e. slander) more, was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai Ibn Salul.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(Urwa said, &#8220;The people propagated the slander and  talked about it in his (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s) presence and he confirmed it and listened to it  and asked about it to let it prevail.&#8221; Urwa also added, &#8220;None was mentioned as  members of the slanderous group besides (&#8216;Abdullah) except Hassan bin Thabit and Mistah  bin Uthatha and Hamna bint Jahsh along with others about whom I have no knowledge, but  they were a group as Allah said. It is said that the one who carried most of the slander  was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul.&#8221; Urwa added, &#8220;&#8216;Aisha disliked to have Hassan  abused in her presence and she used to say, &#8216;It was he who said: My father and his (i.e.  my father&#8217;s) father and my honor are all for the protection of Muhammad&#8217;s honor from  you.&#8221;). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;After we returned to Medina, I became  ill for a month. The people were propagating the forged statements of the slanderers while  I was unaware of anything of all that, but I felt that in my present ailment, I was not  receiving the same kindness from Allah&#8217;s Apostle as I used to receive when I got sick.  (But now) Allah&#8217;s Apostle would only come, greet me and say,&#8217; How is that (lady)?&#8217; and  leave. That roused my doubts, but I did not discover the evil (i.e. slander) till I went  out after my convalescence, I went out with Um Mistah to Al-Manasi&#8217; where we used to  answer the call of nature and we used not to go out (to answer the call of nature) except  at night, and that was before we had latrines near our houses. And this habit of our  concerning evacuating the bowels, was similar to the habits of the old &#8216;Arabs living in  the deserts, for it would be troublesome for us to take latrines near our houses. So I and  Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abu Ruhm bin Al-Muttalib bin Abd Manaf, whose mother was  the daughter of Sakhr bin &#8216;Amir and the aunt of Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and whose son was  Mistah bin Uthatha bin &#8216;Abbas bin Al-Muttalib, went out. I and Um Mistah returned to my  house after we finished answering the call of nature. Um Mistah stumbled by getting her  foot entangled in her covering sheet and on that she said, &#8216;Let Mistah be ruined!&#8217; I said,  &#8216;What a hard word you have said. Do you abuse a man who took part in the battle of Badr?&#8217;  On that she said, &#8216;O you Hantah! Didn&#8217;t you hear what he (i.e. Mistah) said? &#8216;I said,  &#8216;What did he say?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then she told me the slander of the people of Ifk. So my  ailment was aggravated, and when I reached my home, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me, and after  greeting me, said, &#8216;How is that (lady)?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Will you allow me to go to my parents?&#8217;  as I wanted to be sure about the news through them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me (and I went  to my parents) and asked my mother, &#8216;O mother! What are the people talking about?&#8217; She  said, &#8216;O my daughter! Don&#8217;t worry, for scarcely is there a charming woman who is loved by  her husband and whose husband has other wives besides herself that they (i.e. women) would  find faults with her.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Subhan-Allah! (I testify the uniqueness of Allah). Are the  people really talking in this way?&#8217; I kept on weeping that night till dawn I could neither  stop weeping nor sleep then in the morning again, I kept on weeping. When the Divine  Inspiration was delayed. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle called &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin  Zaid to ask and consult them about divorcing me. Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of my  innocence, and the respect he preserved in himself for me. Usama said, &#8216;(O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle!) She is your wife and we do not know anything except good about her.&#8217; &#8216;Ali bin  Abi Talib said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah does not put you in difficulty and there are  plenty of women other than she, yet, ask the maid-servant who will tell you the truth.&#8217; On  that Allah&#8217;s Apostle called Barira (i.e. the maid-servant) and said, &#8216;O Barira! Did you  ever see anything which aroused your suspicion?&#8217; Barira said to him, &#8216;By Him Who has sent  you with the Truth. I have never seen anything in her (i.e. Aisha) which I would conceal,  except that she is a young girl who sleeps leaving the dough of her family exposed so that  the domestic goats come and eat it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So, on that day, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up on the pulpit and  complained about &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai (bin Salul) before his companions, saying, &#8216;O you  Muslims! Who will relieve me from that man who has hurt me with his evil statement about  my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family and they have blamed a man  about whom I know nothing except good and he used never to enter my home except with me.&#8217;  Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh the brother of Banu &#8216;Abd Al-Ashhal got up and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I  will relieve you from him; if he is from the tribe of Al-Aus, then I will chop his head  off, and if he is from our brothers, i.e. Al-Khazraj, then order us, and we will fulfill  your order.&#8217; On that, a man from Al-Khazraj got up. Um Hassan, his cousin, was from his  branch tribe, and he was Sad bin Ubada, chief of Al-Khazraj. Before this incident, he was  a pious man, but his love for his tribe goaded him into saying to Sad (bin Mu&#8217;adh). &#8216;By  Allah, you have told a lie; you shall not and cannot kill him. If he belonged to your  people, you would not wish him to be killed.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On that, Usaid bin Hudair who was the cousin of Sad (bin  Mu&#8217;adh) got up and said to Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, &#8216;By Allah! You are a liar! We will surely kill  him, and you are a hypocrite arguing on the behalf of hypocrites.&#8217; On this, the two tribes  of Al-Aus and Al Khazraj got so much excited that they were about to fight while Allah&#8217;s  Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on quietening them till they  became silent and so did he. All that day I kept on weeping with my tears never ceasing,  and I could never sleep. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the morning my parents were with me and I wept for two  nights and a day with my tears never ceasing and I could never sleep till I thought that  my liver would burst from weeping. So, while my parents were sitting with me and I was  weeping, an Ansari woman asked me to grant her admittance. I allowed her to come in, and  when she came in, she sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this state,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came, greeted us and sat down. He had never sat with me since that day of  the slander. A month had elapsed and no Divine Inspiration came to him about my case.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle then recited Tashah-hud and then said, &#8216;Amma Badu, O &#8216;Aisha! I have been  informed so-and-so about you; if you are innocent, then soon Allah will reveal your  innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then repent to Allah and ask Him for  forgiveness for when a slave confesses his sins and asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah  accepts his repentance.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished his speech, my tears ceased  flowing completely that I no longer felt a single drop of tear flowing. I said to my  father, &#8216;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has said.&#8217; My father  said, &#8216;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8217; Then I said to my mother,  &#8216;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf concerning what he has said.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah,  I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; In spite of the fact that I was a young  girl and had a little knowledge of Quran, I said, &#8216;By Allah, no doubt I know that you  heard this (slanderous) speech so that it has been planted in your hearts (i.e. minds) and  you have taken it as a truth. Now if I tell you that I am innocent, you will not believe  me, and if confess to you about it, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will surely  believe me. By Allah, I find no similitude for me and you except that of Joseph&#8217;s father  when he said, &#8216;(For me) patience in the most fitting against that which you assert; it is  Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.&#8217; Then I turned to the other side and lay on my  bed; and Allah knew then that I was innocent and hoped that Allah would reveal my  innocence. But, by Allah, I never thought that Allah would reveal about my case, Divine  Inspiration, that would be recited (forever) as I considered myself too unworthy to be  talked of by Allah with something of my concern, but I hoped that Allah&#8217;s Apostle might  have a dream in which Allah would prove my innocence. But, by Allah, before Allah&#8217;s  Apostle left his seat and before any of the household left, the Divine inspiration came to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to  overtake him, (when he used to be inspired Divinely). The sweat was dropping from his body  like pearls though it was a wintry day and that was because of the weighty statement which  was being revealed to him. When that state of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was over, he got up smiling,  and the first word he said was, &#8216;O &#8216;Aisha! Allah has declared your innocence!&#8217; Then my  Mother said to me, &#8216;Get up and go to him (i.e. Allah&#8217;s Apostle). I replied, &#8216;By Allah, I  will not go to him, and I praise none but Allah. So Allah revealed the ten Verses:&#8211;  &#8220;Verily! They who spread the slander Are a gang, among you&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;  (24.11-20) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah revealed those Quranic Verses to declare my  innocence. Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to disburse money for Mistah bin Uthatha because of  his relationship to him and his poverty, said, &#8216;By Allah, I will never give to Mistah bin  Uthatha anything after what he has said about Aisha.&#8217; Then Allah revealed:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And let not those among you who are good and wealthy  swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have  left their homes for Allah&#8217;s cause, let them pardon and forgive. Do you not love that  Allah should forgive you? And Allah is oft-Forgiving Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, &#8216;Yes, by Allah, I would like that  Allah forgive me.&#8217; and went on giving Mistah the money he used to give him before. He also  added, &#8216;By Allah, I will never deprive him of it at all.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aisha further said:.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle also asked  Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. his wife) about my case. He said to Zainab, &#8216;What do you know and  what did you see?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I refrain from claiming  falsely that I have heard or seen anything. By Allah, I know nothing except good (about  &#8216;Aisha).&#8217; From amongst the wives of the Prophet Zainab was my peer (in beauty and in the  love she received from the Prophet) but Allah saved her from that evil because of her  piety. Her sister Hamna, started struggling on her behalf and she was destroyed along with  those who were destroyed. The man who was blamed said, &#8216;Subhan-Allah! By Him in Whose Hand  my soul is, I have never uncovered the cover (i.e. veil) of any female.&#8217; Later on the man  was martyred in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Ruman, the mother of &#8216;Aisha said that while &#8216;Aisha and  she were sitting, an Ansari woman came and said, &#8220;May Allah harm such and-such a  person!&#8221; Um Ruman said to her, What is the matter?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;My son  was amongst those who talked of the story (of the Slander).&#8221; Um Ruman said,  &#8220;What is that?&#8221; She said, &#8220;So-and-so&#8230;.&#8221; and narrated the whole  story. On that &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Did Allah&#8217;s Apostle hear about that?&#8221; She replies,  &#8220;yes.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;And Abu Bakr too?&#8221; She replied,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; On that, &#8216;Aisha fell down fainting, and when she came to her senses, she  had got fever with rigors. I put her clothes over her and covered her. The Prophet came  and asked, &#8220;What is wrong with this (lady)?&#8221; Um Ruman replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! She (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) has got temperature with rigors.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Perhaps  it is because of the story that has been talked about?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;  &#8216;Aisha sat up and said, &#8220;By Allah, if I took an oath (that I am innocent), you would  not believe me, and if I said (that I am not innocent), you would not excuse me. My and  your example is like that of Jacob and his sons (as Jacob said ): &#8216;It is Allah (Alone)  Whose Help can be sought against that you assert.&#8217; Um Ruman said, &#8220;The Prophet then  went out saying nothing. Then Allah declared her innocence. On that, &#8216;Aisha said (to the  Prophet), &#8220;I thank Allah only; thank neither anybody else nor you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Do you (people) consider the conquest of Mecca, the Victory  (referred to in the Qur&#8217;an 48:1). Was the conquest of Mecca a victory? We really consider  that the actual Victory was the Ar-Ridwan Pledge of allegiance which we gave on the day of  Al-Hudaibiya (to the Prophet) . On the day of Al-Hudaibiya we were fourteen hundred men  along with the Prophet Al-Hudaibiya was a well, the water of which we used up leaving not  a single drop of water in it. When the Prophet was informed of that, he came and sat on  its edge. Then he asked for a utensil of water, performed ablution from it, rinsed (his  mouth), invoked (Allah), and poured the remaining water into the well. We stayed there for  a while and then the well brought forth what we required of water for ourselves and our  riding animals. </font></p>

We haven&#8217;t got any water to perform ablution  with or to drink, except what you have in your utensil.&#8217; So the Prophet put his hand in  the utensil and the water started spouting out between his fingers like springs. So we  drank and performed ablution.&#8221; I said to Jabir, &#8220;What was your number on that  day?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Even if we had been one hundred thousand, that water would  have been sufficient for us.

Give me your opinion. Do you recommend that I  should destroy the families and offspring of those who want to stop us from the Ka&#8217;ba? If  they should come to us (for peace) then Allah will destroy a spy from the pagans, or  otherwise we will leave them in a miserable state.&#8221; On that Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O  Allah Apostle! You have come with the intention of visiting this House (i.e. Ka&#8217;ba) and  you do not want to kill or fight anybody.

The believers disliked this condition and got disgusted  with it and argued about it. But when Suhail refused to conclude the truce with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle except on that condition, Allah&#8217;s Apostle concluded it. Accordingly, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle then returned Abu Jandal bin Suhail to his father, Suhail bin &#8216;Amr, and returned  every man coming to him from them during that period even if he was a Muslim. The  believing women Emigrants came (to Medina) and Um Kulthum, the daughter of &#8216;Uqba bin Abi  Mu&#8217;ait was one of those who came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she was an adult at that time. Her  relatives came, asking Allah&#8217;s Apostle to return her to them, and in this connection,  Allah revealed the Verses dealing with the believing (women). Aisha said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s  Apostle used to test all the believing women who migrated to him, with the following  Verse:&#8211; &#8220;O Prophet!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to say that Ibn &#8216;Umar had embraced Islam  before &#8216;Umar. This is not true. What happened is that &#8216;Umar sent &#8216;Abdullah to bring his  horse from an Ansari man so as to fight on it. At that time the people were giving the  Pledge of allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle near the Tree, and &#8216;Umar was not aware of that. So  Abdullah (bin Umar) gave the Pledge of Allegiance (to the Prophet) and went to take the  horse and brought it to &#8216;Umar. While &#8216;Umar was putting on the armor to get ready for  fighting, &#8216;Abdullah informed him that the people were giving the Pledge of allegiance to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle beneath the Tree. So &#8216;Umar set out and &#8216;Abdullah accompanied him till he  gave the Pledge of allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and it was this event that made people  say that Ibn &#8216;Umar had embraced Islam before &#8216;Umar. &#8220;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar added,  &#8220;The people were along with the Prophet on the day of Al-Hudaibiya spreading in the  shade of the trees. Suddenly the people surrounded the Prophet and started looking at  him.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah! Go and see why the people are encircling Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and looking at him.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar then saw the people giving the Pledge  o allegiance to the Prophet. So he also gave the Pledge of allegiance and returned to  &#8216;Umar who went out in his turn and gave the Pledge of allegiance to the Prophet.&#8217; </font></p>

Allah and His Apostle know  (what is convenient) better. Whenever we put our swords on our shoulders for any matter  that terrified us, our swords led us to an easy agreeable solution before the present  situation (of disagreement and dispute between the Muslims). When we mend the breach in  one side, it opened in another, and we do not know what to do about it.&#8221; </font></p>

We are  the owners of milch livestock (i.e. bedouins) and not farmers (i.e. countrymen).&#8221;  They found the climate of Medina unsuitable for them. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that they  should be provided with some milch camels and a shepherd and ordered them to go out of  Medina and to drink the camels&#8217; milk and urine (as medicine) So they set out and when they  reached Al-Harra, they reverted to Heathenism after embracing Islam, and killed the  shepherd of the Prophet and drove away the camels. When this news reached the Prophet, he  sent some people in pursuit of them. (So they were caught and brought back to the Prophet  ). The Prophet gave his orders in their concern. So their eyes were branded with pieces of  iron and their hands and legs were cut off and they were left away in Harra till they died  in that state of theirs. (See Hadith 234 Vol 1) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I went (from Medina) towards (Al-Ghaba) before the  first Adhan of the Fajr Prayer. The she-camels of Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to graze at a place  called Dhi-Qarad. A slave of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf met me (on the way) and said,  &#8220;The she-camels of Allah&#8217;s Apostle had been taken away by force.&#8221; I asked,  &#8220;Who had taken them?&#8221; He replied &#8220;(The people of) Ghatafan.&#8221; I made  three loud cries (to the people of Medina) saying, &#8220;O Sabahah!&#8221; I made the  people between the two mountains of Medina hear me. Then I rushed onward and caught up  with the robbers while they were watering the camels. I started throwing arrows at them as  I was a good archer and I was saying, &#8220;I am the son of Al-Akwa&#8217;, and today will  perish the wicked people.&#8221; I kept on saying like that till I restored the she-camels  (of the Prophet), I also snatched thirty Burda (i.e. garments) from them. Then the Prophet  and the other people came there, and I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! I have stopped the  people (of Ghatafan) from taking water and they are thirsty now. So send (some people)  after them now.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Akwa&#8217;! You have  over-powered them, so forgive them.&#8221; Then we all came back and Allah&#8217;s Apostle seated  me behind him on his she-camel till we entered Medina. </font></p>

Nothing was  brought but Sawiq which the Prophet ordered to be moistened with water, and then he ate it  and we also ate it. Then he got up to offer the Maghrib prayer. He washed his mouth, and  we too washed our mouths, and then he offered the prayer without repeating his abulution. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salama bin Al-Akwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We went out to Khaibar in the company of the Prophet. While  we were proceeding at night, a man from the group said to &#8216;Amir, &#8220;O &#8216;Amir! Won&#8217;t you  let us hear your poetry?&#8221; &#8216;Amir was a poet, so he got down and started reciting for  the people poetry that kept pace with the camels&#8217; footsteps, saying:&#8211; &#8220;O Allah!  Without You we Would not have been guided On the right path Neither would be have given In  charity, nor would We have prayed. So please forgive us, what we have committed (i.e. our  defects); let all of us Be sacrificed for Your Cause And send Sakina (i.e. calmness) Upon  us to make our feet firm When we meet our enemy, and If they will call us towards An  unjust thing, We will refuse. The infidels have made a hue and Cry to ask others&#8217; help  Against us.&#8221; The Prophet on that, asked, &#8220;Who is that (camel) driver (reciting  poetry)?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;He is &#8216;Amir bin Al-Akwa&#8217;.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on  him.&#8221; A man amongst the people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! has (martyrdom) been  granted to him. Would that you let us enjoy his company longer.&#8221; Then we reached and  besieged Khaibar till we were afflicted with severe hunger. Then Allah helped the Muslims  conquer it (i.e. Khaibar). In the evening of the day of the conquest of the city, the  Muslims made huge fires. The Prophet said, &#8220;What are these fires? For cooking what,  are you making the fire?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;(For cooking) meat.&#8221; He  asked, &#8220;What kind of meat?&#8221; They (i.e. people) said, &#8220;The meat of  donkeys.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Throw away the meat and break the pots!&#8221; Some  man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we throw away the meat and wash the pots  instead?&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Yes, you can do) that too.&#8221; So when the army files  were arranged in rows (for the clash), &#8216;Amir&#8217;s sword was short and he aimed at the leg of  a Jew to strike it, but the sharp blade of the sword returned to him and injured his own  knee, and that caused him to die. When they returned from the battle, Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw  me (in a sad mood). He took my hand and said, &#8220;What is bothering you?&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you! The people say that the  deeds of &#8216;Amir are lost.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever says so, is mistaken, for  &#8216;Amir has got a double reward.&#8221; The Prophet raised two fingers and added, &#8220;He  (i.e. Amir) was a persevering struggler in the Cause of Allah and there are few &#8216;Arabs who  achieved the like of (good deeds) &#8216;Amir had done.&#8221; </font></p>

When it was morning, the Jews came out with their spades and baskets, and when  they saw him(i.e. the Prophet ), they said, &#8220;Muhammad! By Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle (and his army) encountered the pagans and  the two armies.,, fought and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned to his army camps and the  others (i.e. the enemy) returned to their army camps. Amongst the companions of the  Prophet there was a man who could not help pursuing any single isolated pagan to strike  him with his sword. Somebody said, &#8220;None has benefited the Muslims today more than  so-and-so.&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;He is from the people of the  Hell-Fire certainly.&#8221; A man amongst the people (i.e. Muslims) said, &#8220;I will  accompany him (to know the fact).&#8221; So he went along with him, and whenever he stopped  he stopped with him, and whenever he hastened, he hastened with him. The (brave) man then  got wounded severely, and seeking to die at once, he planted his sword into the ground and  put its point against his chest in between his breasts, and then threw himself on it and  committed suicide. On that the person (who was accompanying the deceased all the time)  came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;I testify that you are the Apostle of Allah.&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;Why is that (what makes you say so)?&#8221; He said &#8220;It is  concerning the man whom you have already mentioned as one of the dwellers of the  Hell-Fire. The people were surprised by your statement, and I said to them, &#8220;I will  try to find out the truth about him for you.&#8221; So I went out after him and he was then  inflicted with a severe wound and because of that, he hurried to bring death upon himself  by planting the handle of his sword into the ground and directing its tip towards his  chest between his breasts, and then he threw himself over it and committed suicide.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;A man may do what seem to the people as the deeds of the  dwellers of Paradise but he is from the dwellers of the Hell-Fire and another may do what  seem to the people as the deeds of the dwellers of the Hell-Fire, but he is from the  dwellers of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

Some of the people were about to  doubt (the Prophet&#8217;s statement), but the man, feeling the pain of his wounds, put his hand  into his quiver and took out of it, some arrows with which he slaughtered himself (i.e.  committed suicide).

Allah has made your statement true so-and-so has committed suicide.  &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;O so-and-so! Get up and make an announcement that none but a  believer will enter Paradise and that Allah may support the religion with an unchaste  (evil) wicked man. </font></p>

What is this wound?&#8221; He said, &#8220;This was inflicted on me on  the day of Khaibar and the people said, &#8216;Salama has been wounded.&#8217; Then I went to the  Prophet and he puffed his saliva in it (i.e. the wound) thrice., and since then I have not  had any pain in it till this hour.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>During one of his Ghazawat, the Prophet encountered the  pagans, and the two armies fought, and then each of them returned to their army camps.  Amongst the (army of the) Muslims there was a man who would follow every pagan separated  from the army and strike him with his sword. It was said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! None  has fought so satisfactorily as so-and-so (namely, that brave Muslim). &#8220;The Prophet  said, &#8220;He is from the dwellers of the Hell-Fire.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;Who  amongst us will be of the dwellers of Paradise if this (man) is from the dwellers of the  Hell-Fire?&#8221; Then a man from amongst the people said, &#8220;I will follow him and  accompany him in his fast and slow movements.&#8221; The (brave) man got wounded, and  wanting to die at once, he put the handle of his sword on the ground and its tip in  between his breasts, and then threw himself over it, committing suicide. Then the man (who  had watched the deceased) returned to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I testify that you are  Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; The man told him the  whole story. The Prophet said, &#8220;A man may do what may seem to the people as the deeds  of the dwellers of Paradise, but he is of the dwellers of the Hell-Fire and a man may do  what may seem to the people as the deeds of the dwellers of the Hell-Fire, but he is from  the dwellers of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

So when he slept on the night of the conquest  of Khaibar, the Prophet said, &#8220;I will give the flag tomorrow, or tomorrow the flag  will be taken by a man who is loved by Allah and His Apostle , and (Khaibar) will be  conquered through him, (with Allah&#8217;s help)&#8221; While every one of us was hopeful to have  the flag, it was said, &#8220;Here is &#8216;Ali&#8221; and the Prophet gave him the flag and  Khaibar was conquered through him (with Allah&#8217;s Help). </font></p>

He loves  Allah and His Apostle, and he is loved by Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; The people remained  that night, wondering as to who would be given it. In the morning the people went to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and everyone of them was hopeful to receive it (i.e. the flag). The  Prophet said, &#8220;Where is Ali bin Abi Talib?&#8221; It was said, &#8220;He is suffering  from eye trouble O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Send for him.&#8221; &#8216;Ali was  brought and Allah&#8217;s Apostle spat in his eye and invoked good upon him. So &#8216;Ali was cured  as if he never had any trouble. Then the Prophet gave him the flag. &#8216;Ali said &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will fight with them till they become like us.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;Proceed and do not hurry. When you enter their territory, call them to embrace  Islam and inform them of Allah&#8217;s Rights which they should observe, for by Allah, even if a  single man is led on the right path (of Islam) by Allah through you, then that will be  better for you than the nice red camels. </font></p>

The Prophet selected her for  himself, and set out with her, and when we reached a place called Sidd-as-Sahba,&#8217; Safiya  became clean from her menses then Allah&#8217;s Apostle married her. Hais (i.e. an &#8216;Arabian  dish) was prepared on a small leather mat. Then the Prophet said to me, &#8220;I invite the  people around you.&#8221; So that was the marriage banquet of the Prophet and Safiya. Then  we proceeded towards Medina, and I saw the Prophet, making for her a kind of cushion with  his cloak behind him (on his camel). He then sat beside his camel and put his knee for  Safiya to put her foot on, in order to ride (on the camel). </font></p>

The Muslims said amongst  themselves, &#8220;Will she (i.e. Safiya) be one of the mothers of the believers, (i.e. one  of the wives of the Prophet ) or just (a lady captive) of what his right-hand  possesses&#8221; Some of them said, &#8220;If the Prophet makes her observe the veil, then  she will be one of the mothers of the believers (i.e. one of the Prophet&#8217;s wives), and if  he does not make her observe the veil, then she will be his lady slave.&#8221; So when he  departed, he made a place for her behind him (on his and made her observe the veil. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The news of the migration of the Prophet (from Mecca to  Medina) reached us while we were in Yemen. So we set out as emigrants towards him. We were  (three) I and my two brothers. I was the youngest of them, and one of the two was Abu  Burda, and the other, Abu Ruhm, and our total number was either 53 or 52 men from my  people. We got on board a boat and our boat took us to Negus in Ethiopia. There we met  Ja&#8217;far bin Abi Talib and stayed with him. Then we all came (to Medina) and met the Prophet  at the time of the conquest of Khaibar. Some of the people used to say to us, namely the  people of the ship, &#8220;We have migrated before you.&#8221; Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais who was one  of those who had come with us, came as a visitor to Hafsa, the wife the Prophet . She had  migrated along with those other Muslims who migrated to Negus. &#8216;Umar came to Hafsa while  Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais was with her. &#8216;Umar, on seeing Asma,&#8217; said, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; She  said, &#8220;Asma&#8217; bint &#8216;Umais,&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Is she the Ethiopian? Is she the  sea-faring lady?&#8221; Asma&#8217; replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;We have migrated  before you (people of the boat), so we have got more right than you over Allah&#8217;s Apostle  &#8221; On that Asma&#8217; became angry and said, &#8220;No, by Allah, while you were with  Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was feeding the hungry ones amongst you, and advised the ignorant ones  amongst you, we were in the far-off hated land of Ethiopia, and all that was for the sake  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . By Allah, I will neither eat any food nor drink anything till I  inform Allah&#8217;s Apostle of all that you have said. There we were harmed and frightened. I  will mention this to the Prophet and will not tell a lie or curtail your saying or add  something to it.&#8221; So when the Prophet came, she said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet &#8216;Umar  has said so-and-so.&#8221; He said (to Asma&#8217;), &#8220;What did you say to him?&#8221; Asma&#8217;s  aid, &#8220;I told him so-and-so.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He (i.e. &#8216;Umar) has not got  more right than you people over me, as he and his companions have (the reward of) only one  migration, and you, the people of the boat, have (the reward of) two migrations.&#8221;  Asma&#8217; later on said, &#8220;I saw Abu Musa and the other people of the boat coming to me in  successive groups, asking me about this narration,, and to them nothing in the world was  more cheerful and greater than what the Prophet had said about them.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Burda: Asma&#8217; said, &#8220;I saw Abu Musa  requesting me to repeat this narration again and again.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Burda: Abu Musa said, &#8220;The Prophet said,  &#8220;I recognize the voice of the group of Al-Ashariyun, when they recite the Qur&#8217;an,  when they enter their homes at night, and I recognize their houses by (listening) to their  voices when they are reciting the Qur&#8217;an at night although I have not seen their houses  when they came to them during the day time. Amongst them is Hakim who, on meeting the  cavalry or the enemy, used to say to them (i.e. the enemy). My companions order you to  wait for them.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Fatima the daughter of the Prophet sent someone to Abu Bakr  (when he was a caliph), asking for her inheritance of what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had left of the  property bestowed on him by Allah from the Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting) in  Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus of the Khaibar booty. On that, Abu Bakr  said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Our property is not inherited. Whatever we leave,  is Sadaqa, but the family of (the Prophet) Muhammad can eat of this property.&#8217; By Allah, I  will not make any change in the state of the Sadaqa of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and will leave it  as it was during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and will dispose of it as Allah&#8217;s  Apostle used to do.&#8221; So Abu Bakr refused to give anything of that to Fatima. So she  became angry with Abu Bakr and kept away from him, and did not task to him till she died.  She remained alive for six months after the death of the Prophet. When she died, her  husband &#8216;Ali, buried her at night without informing Abu Bakr and he said the funeral  prayer by himself. When Fatima was alive, the people used to respect &#8216;Ali much, but after  her death, &#8216;Ali noticed a change in the people&#8217;s attitude towards him. So Ali sought  reconciliation with Abu Bakr and gave him an oath of allegiance. &#8216;Ali had not given the  oath of allegiance during those months (i.e. the period between the Prophet&#8217;s death and  Fatima&#8217;s death). &#8216;Ali sent someone to Abu Bakr saying, &#8220;Come to us, but let nobody  come with you,&#8221; as he disliked that &#8216;Umar should come, &#8216;Umar said (to Abu Bakr),  &#8220;No, by Allah, you shall not enter upon them alone &#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;What  do you think they will do to me? By Allah, I will go to them&#8217; So Abu Bakr entered upon  them, and then &#8216;Ali uttered Tashah-hud and said (to Abu Bakr), &#8220;We know well your  superiority and what Allah has given you, and we are not jealous of the good what Allah  has bestowed upon you, but you did not consult us in the question of the rule and we  thought that we have got a right in it because of our near relationship to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  .&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Thereupon Abu Bakr&#8217;s eyes flowed with tears. And when Abu  Bakr spoke, he said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is to keep good relations with the  relatives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle is dearer to me than to keep good relations with my own  relatives. But as for the trouble which arose between me and you about his property, I  will do my best to spend it according to what is good, and will not leave any rule or  regulation which I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle following, in disposing of it, but I will  follow.&#8221; On that &#8216;Ali said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;I promise to give you the oath of  allegiance in this after noon.&#8221; So when Abu Bakr had offered the Zuhr prayer, he  ascended the pulpit and uttered the Tashah-hud and then mentioned the story of &#8216;Ali and  his failure to give the oath of allegiance, and excused him, accepting what excuses he had  offered; Then &#8216;Ali (got up) and praying (to Allah) for forgiveness, he uttered Tashah-hud,  praised Abu Bakr&#8217;s right, and said, that he had not done what he had done because of  jealousy of Abu Bakr or as a protest of that Allah had favored him with. &#8216;Ali added,  &#8220;But we used to consider that we too had some right in this affair (of rulership) and  that he (i.e. Abu Bakr) did not consult us in this matter, and therefore caused us to feel  sorry.&#8221; On that all the Muslims became happy and said, &#8220;You have done the right  thing.&#8221; The Muslims then became friendly with &#8216;Ali as he returned to what the people  had done (i.e. giving the oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr). </font></p>

But we take one Sa of these (dates of good quality)  for two or three Sa&#8217;s of other dates (of inferior quality).&#8221; On that, Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;Do not do so, but first sell the inferior quality dates for money and then  with that money, buy Janib.&#8221; Abu Said and Abu Huraira said, &#8220;The Prophet made  the brother of Bani Adi from the Ansar as the ruler of Khaibar. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet went out for the &#8216;Umra in the month of  Dhal-Qa&#8217;da, the people of Mecca did not allow him to enter Mecca till he agreed to  conclude a peace treaty with them by virtue of which he would stay in Mecca for three days  only (in the following year). When the agreement was being written, the Muslims wrote:  &#8220;This is the peace treaty, which Muhammad, Apostle of Allah has concluded.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The infidels said (to the Prophet), &#8220;We do not agree  with you on this, for if we knew that you are Apostle of Allah we would not have prevented  you for anything (i.e. entering Mecca, etc.), but you are Muhammad, the son of  &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; Then he said to &#8216;Ali, &#8220;Erase (the name of) &#8216;Apostle of Allah&#8217;.&#8221;  &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;No, by Allah, I will never erase you (i.e. your name).&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle took the writing sheet&#8230;and he did not know a better writing..and he wrote or got  it the following written! &#8220;This is the peace treaty which Muhammad, the son of  &#8216;Abdullah, has concluded: &#8220;Muhammad should not bring arms into Mecca except sheathed  swords, and should not take with him any person of the people of Mecca even if such a  person wanted to follow him, and if any of his companions wants to stay in Mecca, he  should not forbid him.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(In the next year) when the Prophet entered Mecca and the  allowed period of stay elapsed, the infidels came to Ali and said &#8220;Tell your  companion (Muhammad) to go out, as the allowed period of his stay has finished.&#8221; So  the Prophet departed (from Mecca) and the daughter of Hamza followed him shouting &#8220;O  Uncle, O Uncle!&#8221; Ali took her by the hand and said to Fatima, &#8220;Take the daughter  of your uncle.&#8221; So she made her ride (on her horse). (When they reached Medina) &#8216;Ali,  Zaid and Ja&#8217;far quarreled about her. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I took her for she is the daughter  of my uncle.&#8221; Ja&#8217;far said, &#8220;She is the daughter of my uncle and her aunt is my  wife.&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;She is the daughter of my brother.&#8221; On that, the Prophet  gave her to her aunt and said, &#8220;The aunt is of the same status as the mother.&#8221;  He then said to &#8216;Ali, &#8220;You are from me, and I am from you,&#8221; and said to Ja&#8217;far,  &#8220;You resemble me in appearance and character,&#8221; and said to Zaid, &#8220;You are  our brother and our freed slave.&#8221; &#8216;Ali said to the Prophet &#8216;Won&#8217;t you marry the  daughter of Hamza?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;She is the daughter of my foster  brother.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out with the intention of performing  &#8216;Umra, but the infidels of Quraish intervened between him and the Ka&#8217;ba, so the Prophet  slaughtered his Hadi (i.e. sacrificing animals and shaved his head at Al-Hudaibiya and  concluded a peace treaty with them (i.e. the infidels) on condition that he would perform  the &#8216;Umra the next year and that he would not carry arms against them except swords, and  would not stay (in Mecca) more than what they would allow. So the Prophet performed the  &#8216;Umra in the following year and according to the peace treaty, he entered Mecca, and when  he had stayed there for three days, the infidels ordered him to leave, and he left. </font></p>

Don&#8217;t you hear what Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman is saying? He is saying that the  Prophet performed four &#8216;Umra, one of which was in Rajab.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;The  Prophet did not perform any &#8216;Umra but he (i.e. Ibn &#8216;Umar) witnessed it. And he (the  Prophet ) never did any &#8216;Umra in (the month of) Rajab.&#8221; </font></p>

The only cause  which prevented the Prophet from ordering them to do Ramal in all the rounds of Tawaf, was  that he pitied them. </font></p>

A man came to him and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The women of  Ja&#8217;far are crying.&#8217; Thereupon the Prophet told him to forbid them to do so. So the man  went away and returned saying, &#8220;I forbade them but they did not listen to me.&#8221;  The Prophet ordered him again to go (and forbid them). He went again and came saying, &#8216;By  Allah, they overpowered me (i.e. did not listen to me).&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said (to him), &#8220;Go and throw dust into their mouths.&#8221; Aisha added,  &#8220;I said, May Allah put your nose in the dust!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent me, Az-Zubair and Al-Miqdad saying,  &#8220;Proceed till you reach Rawdat Khakh where there is a lady carrying a letter, and  take that (letter) from her.&#8221; So we proceeded on our way with our horses galloping  till we reached the Rawda, and there we found the lady and said to her, &#8220;Take out the  letter.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have no letter.&#8221; We said, &#8220;Take out the letter,  or else we will take off your clothes.&#8221; So she took it out of her braid, and we  brought the letter to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . The letter was addressed from Hatib, bin Abi  Balta&#8217;a to some pagans of Mecca, telling them about what Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to do.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Hatib! What is this?&#8221; Hatib replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Do not make a hasty decision about me. I was a person not belonging to Quraish  but I was an ally to them from outside and had no blood relation with them, and all the  Emigrants who were with you, have got their kinsmen (in Mecca) who can protect their  families and properties. So I liked to do them a favor so that they might protect my  relatives as I have no blood relation with them. I did not do this to renegade from my  religion (i.e. Islam) nor did I do it to choose Heathenism after Islam.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said to his companions.&#8221; As regards him, he (i.e. Hatib) has told you the  truth.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop off the head of this  hypocrite!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He (i.e. Hatib) has witnessed the Badr battle  (i.e. fought in it) and what could tell you, perhaps Allah looked at those who witnessed  Badr and said, &#8220;O the people of Badr (i.e. Badr Muslim warriors), do what you like,  for I have forgiven you. &#8220;Then Allah revealed the Sura:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;O you who believe! Take not my enemies And your  enemies as friends offering them (Your) love even though they have disbelieved in that  Truth (i.e. Allah, Prophet Muhammad and this Quran) which has come to you &#8230;.(to the end  of Verse)&#8230;.(And whosoever of you (Muslims) does that, then indeed he has gone (far)  astray (away) from the Straight Path.&#8221; (60.1 </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hisham&#8217;s father: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out (towards Mecca) during the  year of the Conquest (of Mecca) and this news reached (the infidels of Quraish), Abu  Sufyan, Hakim bin Hizam and Budail bin Warqa came out to gather information about Allah&#8217;s  Apostle , They proceeded on their way till they reached a place called Marr-az-Zahran  (which is near Mecca). Behold! There they saw many fires as if they were the fires of  Arafat. Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;What is this? It looked like the fires of Arafat.&#8221;  Budail bin Warqa&#8217; said, &#8220;Banu &#8216;Amr are less in number than that.&#8221; Some of the  guards of Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw them and took them over, caught them and brought them to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Abu Sufyan embraced Islam. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet proceeded, he said to Al-Abbas, &#8220;Keep  Abu Sufyan standing at the top of the mountain so that he would look at the Muslims. So  Al-&#8216;Abbas kept him standing (at that place) and the tribes with the Prophet started  passing in front of Abu Sufyan in military batches. A batch passed and Abu Sufyan said,  &#8220;O &#8216;Abbas Who are these?&#8221; &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;They are (Banu) Ghifar.&#8221; Abu  Sufyan said, I have got nothing to do with Ghifar.&#8221; Then (a batch of the tribe of)  Juhaina passed by and he said similarly as above. Then (a batch of the tribe of) Sad bin  Huzaim passed by and he said similarly as above. then (Banu) Sulaim passed by and he said  similarly as above. Then came a batch, the like of which Abu Sufyan had not seen. He said,  &#8220;Who are these?&#8221; Abbas said, &#8220;They are the Ansar headed by Sad bin Ubada,  the one holding the flag.&#8221; Sad bin Ubada said, &#8220;O Abu Sufyan! Today is the day  of a great battle and today (what is prohibited in) the Ka&#8217;ba will be permissible.&#8221;  Abu Sufyan said., &#8220;O &#8216;Abbas! How excellent the day of destruction is! &#8220;Then came  another batch (of warriors) which was the smallest of all the batches, and in it there was  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions and the flag of the Prophet was carried by Az-Zubair  bin Al Awwam. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle passed by Abu Sufyan, the latter said, (to the  Prophet), &#8220;Do you know what Sad bin &#8216;Ubada said?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What  did he say?&#8221; Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;He said so-and-so.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Sad told a lie, but today Allah will give superiority to the Ka&#8217;ba and today the  Ka&#8217;ba will be covered with a (cloth) covering.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that his flag  be fixed at Al-Hajun. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa: Nafi bin Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im said, &#8220;I  heard Al-Abbas saying to Az-Zubair bin Al-&#8216;Awwam, &#8216;O Abu &#8216;Abdullah ! Did Allah&#8217;s Apostle  order you to fix the flag here?&#8217; &#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered Khalid bin Al-Walid to  enter Mecca from its upper part from Ka&#8217;da while the Prophet himself entered from Kuda.  Two men from the cavalry of Khalid bin Al-Wahd named Hubaish bin Al-Ash&#8217;ar and Kurz bin  Jabir Al-Fihri were martyred on that day. </font></p>

Allow me to tell you a statement which  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said on the second day of the Conquest of Mecca. My two ears heard it and  my heart remembered it and my two eyes saw him when he said it. He (i.e. the Prophet)  praised Allah and then said, &#8216;Mecca has been made a sanctuary by Allah and not by the  people, so it is not lawful for a person, who believes in Allah and the Last Day to shed  blood in it, or to cut its trees and if someone asks the permission to fight in Mecca  because Allah&#8217;s Apostle was allowed to fight in it, say to him; Allah permitted His  Apostle and did not allow you, and even he (i.e. the Apostle) was allowed for a short  period of the day, and today its (Mecca&#8217;s sanctity has become the same as it was before  (of old) so those who are present should inform those who are absent (this Hadith).&#8221;  Then Abu Shuraih, was asked, &#8220;What did &#8216;Amr say to you?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were at a place which was a thoroughfare for the people,  and the caravans used to pass by us and we would ask them, &#8220;What is wrong with the  people? What is wrong with the people? Who is that man?. They would say, &#8220;That man  claims that Allah has sent him (as an Apostle), that he has been divinely inspired, that  Allah has revealed to him such-and-such.&#8221; I used to memorize that (Divine) Talk, and  feel as if it was inculcated in my chest (i.e. mind) And the &#8216;Arabs (other than Quraish)  delayed their conversion to Islam till the Conquest (of Mecca). They used to say.&#8221;  &#8220;Leave him (i.e. Muhammad) and his people Quraish: if he overpowers them then he is a  true Prophet. So, when Mecca was conquered, then every tribe rushed to embrace Islam, and  my father hurried to embrace Islam before (the other members of) my tribe. When my father  returned (from the Prophet) to his tribe, he said, &#8220;By Allah, I have come to you from  the Prophet for sure!&#8221; The Prophet afterwards said to them, &#8216;Offer such-and-such  prayer at such-and-such time, and when the time for the prayer becomes due, then one of  you should pronounce the Adhan (for the prayer), and let the one amongst you who knows  Qur&#8217;an most should, lead the prayer.&#8221; So they looked for such a person and found none  who knew more Qur&#8217;an than I because of the Quranic material which I used to learn from the  caravans. They therefore made me their Imam ((to lead the prayer) and at that time I was a  boy of six or seven years, wearing a Burda (i.e. a black square garment) proved to be very  short for me (and my body became partly naked). A lady from the tribe said, &#8220;Won&#8217;t  you cover the anus of your reciter for us?&#8221; So they bought (a piece of cloth) and  made a shirt for me. I had never been so happy with anything before as I was with that  shirt. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Utba bin Abi Waqqas authorized his brother Sad to take the  son of the slave-girl of Zam&#8217;a into his custody. &#8216;Utba said (to him). &#8220;He is my  son.&#8221; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived in Mecca during the Conquest (of Mecca), Sad bin  Abi Waqqas took the son of the slave-girl of Zam&#8217;a and took him to the Prophet &#8216;Abd bin  Zam&#8217;a too came along with him. Sad said. &#8220;This is the son of my brother and the  latter has informed me that he is his son.&#8221; &#8216;Abd bin Zam&#8217;a said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! This is my brother who is the son of the slave-girl of Zam&#8217;a and was born on his  (i.e. Zam&#8217;as) bed.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at the son of the slave-girl of Zam&#8217;a and  noticed that he, of all the people had the greatest resemblance to &#8216;Utba bin Abi Waqqas.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said (to &#8216;Abd), &#8221; He is yours; he is your brother, O &#8216;Abd bin  Zam&#8217;a, he was born on the bed (of your father).&#8221; (At the same time) Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said (to his wife Sauda), &#8220;Veil yourself before him (i.e. the son of the slave-girl)  O Sauda,&#8221; because of the resemblance he noticed between him and Utba bin Abi Waqqas.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;The boy is for the bed (i.e. for the owner of the bed where  he was born), and stone is for the adulterer.&#8221; (Ibn Shihab said, &#8220;Abu Huraira  used to say that (i.e. the last statement of the Prophet in the above Hadith 596,  publicly.&#8221;) </font></p>

Her folk went to Usama bin  Zaid to intercede for her (with the Prophet). When Usama interceded for her with Allah&#8217;s  Apostle, the color of the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle changed and he said, &#8220;Do you  intercede with me in a matter involving one of the legal punishments prescribed by  Allah?&#8221; Usama said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for me.&#8221; So  in the afternoon, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and addressed the people. He praised Allah as He  deserved and then said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du ! The nations prior to you were destroyed because  if a noble amongst them stole, they used to excuse him, and if a poor person amongst them  stole, they would apply (Allah&#8217;s) Legal Punishment to him. By Him in Whose Hand Muhammad&#8217;s  soul is, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad stole, I would cut her hand.&#8221; Then  Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave his order in the case of that woman and her hand was cut off.  Afterwards her repentance proved sincere and she got married. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;That lady  used to visit me and I used to convey her demands to Allah&#8217;s Apostle </font></p>

The people of  Hawazin were good archers, and when we attacked them, they fled. But rushing towards the  booty, we were confronted by the arrows (of the enemy).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the delegate of Hawazin came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  declaring their conversion to Islam and asked him to return their properties and captives,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and said to them, &#8220;There Is involved in this matter, the  people whom you see with me, and the most beloved talk to me, is the true one. So choose  one of two alternatives: Either the captives or the properties. I have been waiting for  you (i.e. have not distributed the booty).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle had delayed the  distribution of their booty over ten nights after his return from Ta&#8217;if. So when they came  to know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was not going to return to them but one of the two, they  said, &#8220;We prefer to have our captives.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up amongst the  Muslims, and praising Allah as He deserved, said, &#8220;To proceed! Your brothers have  come to you with repentance and I see (it logical) to return their captives. So, whoever  of you likes to do that as a favor then he can do it. And whoever of you likes to stick to  his share till we give him from the very first booty which Allah will give us, then he can  do so.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;We do that (i.e. return the captives) willingly as a  favor, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We do not know which of you  have agreed to it and which have not; so go back and let your chiefs forward us your  decision.&#8221; They went back and their chief&#8217;s spoke to them, and they (i.e. the chiefs)  returned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him that all of them had agreed (to give up their  captives) with pleasure, and had given their permission (i.e. that the captives be  returned to their people).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We set out along with the Prophet during the year of (the  battle of) Hunain, and when we faced the enemy, the Muslims (with the exception of the  Prophet and some of his companions) retreated (before the enemy). I saw one of the pagans  over-powering one of the Muslims, so I struck the pagan from behind his neck causing his  armor to be cut off. The pagan headed towards me and pressed me so forcibly that I felt as  if I was dying. Then death took him over and he released me. Afterwards I followed &#8216;Umar  and said to him, &#8220;What is wrong with the people?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is the Order  of Allah.&#8221; Then the Muslims returned (to the battle after the flight) and (after  overcoming the enemy) the Prophet sat and said, &#8220;Whoever had killed an Infidel and  has an evidence to this issue, will have the Salb (i.e. the belonging of the deceased e.g.  clothes, arms, horse, etc).&#8221; I (stood up) and said, &#8220;Who will be my  witness?&#8221; and then sat down. Then the Prophet repeated his question. Then the Prophet  said the same (for the third time). I got up and said, &#8220;Who will be my witness?&#8221;  and then sat down. The Prophet asked his former question again. So I got up. The Prophet  said, What is the matter, O Abu Qatada?&#8221; So I narrated the whole story; A man said,  &#8220;Abu Qatada has spoken the truth, and the Salb of the deceased is with me, so please  compensate Abu Qatada on my behalf.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;No! By Allah, it will never  happen that the Prophet will leave a Lion of Allah who fights for the Sake of Allah and  His Apostle and give his spoils to you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Abu Bakr has spoken  the truth. Give it (the spoils) back to him (O man)!&#8221; So he gave it to me and I  bought a garden in (the land of) Banu Salama with it (i.e. the spoils) and that was the  first property I got after embracing Islam. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When it was the day of (the battle of) Hunain, I saw a  Muslim man fighting with one of the pagans and another pagan was hiding himself behind the  Muslim in order to kill him. So I hurried towards the pagan who was hiding behind the  Muslim to kill him, and he raised his hand to hit me but I hit his hand and cut it off.  That man got hold of me and pressed me so hard that I was afraid (that I would die), then  he knelt down and his grip became loose and I pushed him and killed him. The Muslims  (excepting the Prophet and some of his companions) started fleeing and I too, fled with  them. Suddenly I met &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab amongst the people and I asked him, &#8220;What  is wrong with the people?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is the order of Allah&#8221; Then the  people returned to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (after defeating the enemy). Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Whoever produces a proof that he has killed an infidel, will have the spoils of the  killed man.&#8221; So I got up to look for an evidence to prove that I had killed an  infidel, but I could not find anyone to bear witness for me, so I sat down. Then it came  to my mind (that I should speak of it) and I mentioned the case to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. A man  from the persons who were sitting with him (i.e. the Prophet), said, &#8220;The arms of the  deceased one whom he ( i.e. Abu Qatada) has mentioned, are with me, so please compensate  him for it (i.e. the spoils),&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;No, Allah&#8217;s Apostle will not give  it (i.e. the spoils) to a weak humble person from Quraish and leave one of Allah&#8217;s Lions  who fights on behalf of Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then got up and gave  that (spoils) to me, and I bought with it, a garden which was the first property I got  after embracing Islam. </font></p>

The Prophet sent me with Abu  &#8216;Amir. Abu Amir was shot at his knee with an arrow which a man from Jushm had shot and  fixed into his knee. I went to him and said, &#8220;O Uncle! Who shot you?&#8221; He pointed  me out (his killer) saying, &#8220;That is my killer who shot me (with an arrow).&#8221; So  I headed towards him and overtook him, and when he saw me, he fled, and I followed him and  started saying to him, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you be ashamed? Won&#8217;t you stop?&#8221; So that person  stopped, and we exchanged two hits with the swords and I killed him. Then I said to Abu  &#8216;Amir. &#8220;Allah has killed your killer.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Take out this arrow&#8221;  So I removed it, and water oozed out of the wound. He then said, &#8220;O son of my  brother! Convey my compliments to the Prophet and request him to ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness  for me.&#8221; Abu Amir made me his successor in commanding the people (i.e. troops). He  survived for a short while and then died. (Later) I returned and entered upon the Prophet  at his house, and found him lying in a bed made of stalks of date-palm leaves knitted with  ropes, and on it there was bedding. The strings of the bed had their traces over his back  and sides. Then I told the Prophet about our and Abu Amir&#8217;s news and how he had said  &#8220;Tell him to ask for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for me.&#8221; The Prophet asked for water,  performed ablution and then raised hands, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Forgive &#8216;Ubaid, Abu  Amir.&#8221; At that time I saw the whiteness of the Prophet&#8217;s armpits. The Prophet then  said, &#8220;O Allah, make him (i.e. Abu Amir) on the Day of Resurrection, superior to many  of Your human creatures.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Will you ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for  me?&#8221; (On that) the Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah, forgive the sins of &#8216;Abdullah bin  Qais and admit him to a nice entrance (i.e. paradise) on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;  Abu Burda said, &#8220;One of the prayers was for Abu &#8216;Amir and the other was for Abu Musa  (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais).&#8221; </font></p>

The Ansar said, &#8220;When there is a difficulty, we are  called, but the booty is given to other than us.&#8221; The news reached the Prophet and he  gathered them in a leather tent and said, &#8220;What is this news reaching me from you, O  the group of Ansar?&#8221; They kept silent, He added,&#8221; O the group of Ansar! Won&#8217;t  you be happy that the people take the worldly things and you take Allah&#8217;s Apostle to your  homes reserving him for yourself?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then the Prophet said,  &#8220;If the people took their way through a valley, and the Ansar took their way through  a mountain pass, surely, I would take the Ansar&#8217;s mountain pass.&#8221; Hisham said,  &#8220;O Abu Hamza (i.e. Anas)!

Saba&#8217;na (i.e. we have come out of one religion to another).&#8221; Khalid kept on killing  (some of) them and taking (some of) them as captives and gave every one of us his Captive.  When there came the day then Khalid ordered that each man (i.e. Muslim soldier) should  kill his captive, I said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not kill my captive, and none of my  companions will kill his captive.&#8221; When we reached the Prophet, we mentioned to him  the whole story.

He said, &#8220;Make a  fire.&#8221; When they made it, he said, &#8220;Enter it (i.e. the fire).&#8221; So they  intended to do that and started holding each other and saying, &#8220;We run towards (i.e.  take refuge with) the Prophet from the fire.&#8221; They kept on saying that till the fire  was extinguished and the anger of the commander abated. When that news reached the Prophet  he said, &#8220;If they had entered it (i.e. the fire), they would not have come out of it  till the Day of Resurrection.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent Abu Musa and Muadh bin Jabal to Yemen.  He sent each of them to administer a province as Yemen consisted of two provinces. The  Prophet said (to them), &#8220;Facilitate things for the people and do not make things  difficult for them (Be kind and lenient (both of you) with the people, and do not be hard  on them) and give the people good tidings and do not repulse them. So each of them went to  carry on his job. So when any one of them toured his province and happened to come near  (the border of the province of) his companion, he would visit him and greet him. Once  Mu&#8217;adh toured that part of his state which was near (the border of the province of) his  companion Abu Musa. Mu&#8217;adh came riding his mule till he reached Abu Musa and saw him  sitting, and the people had gathered around him. Behold! There was a man tied with his  hands behind his neck. Mu&#8217;adh said to Abu Musa, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais! What is  this?&#8221; Abu Musa replied. &#8220;This man has reverted to Heathenism after embracing  Islam.&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said, &#8220;I will not dismount till he is killed.&#8221; Abu Musa  replied, &#8220;He has been brought for this purpose, so come down.&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said,  &#8220;I will not dismount till he is killed.&#8221; So Abu Musa ordered that he be killed,  and he was killed. Then Mu&#8217;adh dismounted and said, &#8220;O Abdullah (bin Qais)! How do  you recite the Qur&#8217;an ?&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;I recite the Qur&#8217;an regularly at  intervals and piecemeal. How do you recite it O Mu&#8217;adh?&#8221; Mu&#8217;adh said, &#8220;I sleep  in the first part of the night and then get up after having slept for the time devoted for  my sleep and then recite as much as Allah has written for me.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib sent a piece of gold not yet taken out  of its ore, in a tanned leather container to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . Allah&#8217;s Apostle distributed  that amongst four Persons: &#8216;Uyaina bin Badr, Aqra bin Habis, Zaid Al-Khail and the fourth  was either Alqama or Amir bin At Tufail. On that, one of his companions said, &#8220;We are  more deserving of this (gold) than these (persons).&#8221; When that news reached the  Prophet , he said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you trust me though I am the truth worthy man of the One in  the Heavens, and I receive the news of Heaven (i.e. Divine Inspiration) both in the  morning and in the evening?&#8221; There got up a man with sunken eyes, raised cheek bones,  raised forehead, a thick beard, a shaven head and a waist sheet that was tucked up and he  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Be afraid of Allah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to  you! Am I not of all the people of the earth the most entitled to fear Allah?&#8221; Then  that man went away. Khalid bin Al-Wahd said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I chop his  neck off?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No, for he may offer prayers.&#8221; Khalid said,  &#8220;Numerous are those who offer prayers and say by their tongues (i.e. mouths) what is  not in their hearts.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I have not been ordered (by Allah)  to search the hearts of the people or cut open their bellies.&#8221; Then the Prophet  looked at him (i.e. that man) while the latter was going away and said, &#8220;From the  offspring of this (man there will come out (people) who will recite the Qur&#8217;an  continuously and elegantly but it will not exceed their throats. (They will neither  understand it nor act upon it). They would go out of the religion (i.e. Islam) as an arrow  goes through a game&#8217;s body.&#8221; I think he also said, &#8220;If I should be present at  their time I would kill them as the nations a Thamud were killed.&#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;With what intention have you assumed  the Ihram, for your wife is with us?&#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I assumed the lhram with the  same intention as that of the Prophet .&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Keep on the state of  lhram, as we have got the Hadi.&#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet said to  me, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you relieve me from Dhu-l-Khalasa?&#8221; So I set out with  one-hundred-and-fifty riders, and we dismantled it and killed whoever was present there.  Then I came to the Prophet and informed him, and he invoked good upon us and Al-Ahmas  (tribe) . </font></p>

I proceeded with one-hundred and-fifty cavalry  from Ahmas (tribe) who were horse riders. I used not to sit firm on horses, so the Prophet  stroke me over my chest till I saw the mark of his fingers over my chest, and then he  said, &#8216;O Allah! Make him (i.e. Jarir) firm and one who guides others and is guided on the  right path.&#8221; So Jarir proceeded to it dismantled and burnt it, and then sent a  messenger to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The messenger of Jarir said (to the Prophet), &#8220;By Him  Who sent you with the Truth, I did not leave that place till it was like a scabby  camel.&#8221; The Prophet blessed the horses of Ahmas and their men five times. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jarir said &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;Won&#8217;t  you relieve me from Dhul-Khalasa?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes, (I will relieve you).&#8221;  So I proceeded along with one-hundred and fifty cavalry from Ahmas tribe who were skillful  in riding horses. I used not to sit firm over horses, so I informed the Prophet of that,  and he stroke my chest with his hand till I saw the marks of his hand over my chest and he  said, O Allah! Make him firm and one who guides others and is guided (on the right path).&#8217;  Since then I have never fallen from a horse. Dhul-l&#8211;Khulasa was a house in Yemen  belonging to the tribe of Khatham and Bajaila, and in it there were idols which were  worshipped, and it was called Al-Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Jarir went there, burnt it with fire and  dismantled it. When Jarir reached Yemen, there was a man who used to foretell and give  good omens by casting arrows of divination. Someone said to him. &#8220;The messenger of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle is present here and if he should get hold of you, he would chop off your  neck.&#8221; One day while he was using them (i.e. arrows of divination), Jarir stopped  there and said to him, &#8220;Break them (i.e. the arrows) and testify that None has the  right to be worshipped except Allah, or else I will chop off your neck.&#8221; So the man  broke those arrows and testified that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah.  Then Jarir sent a man called Abu Artata from the tribe of Ahmas to the Prophet to convey  the good news (of destroying Dhu-l-Khalasa). So when the messenger reached the Prophet, he  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I did not leave it till  it was like a scabby camel.&#8221; Then the Prophet blessed the horses of Ahmas and their  men five times. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was at Yemen, I met two men from Yemen called Dhu  Kala and Dhu Amr, and I started telling them about Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Dhu Amr said to me,  &#8220;If what you are saying about your friend (i.e. the Prophet) is true, then he has  died three days ago.&#8221; Then both of them accompanied me to Medina, and when we had  covered some distance on the way to Medina, we saw some riders coming from Medina. We  asked them and they said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has died and Abu Bakr has been appointed  as the Caliph and the people are in a good state.&#8217; Then they said, &#8220;Tell your friend  (Abu Bakr) that we have come (to visit him), and if Allah will, we will come again.&#8221;  So they both returned to Yemen. When I told Abu Bakr their statement, he said to me,  &#8220;I wish you had brought them (to me).&#8221; Afterwards I met Dhu Amr, and he said to  me, &#8220;O Jarir! You have done a favor to me and I am going to tell you something, i.e.  you, the nation of &#8216;Arabs, will remain prosperous as long as you choose and appoint  another chief whenever a former one is dead. But if authority is obtained by the power of  the sword, then the rulers will become kings who will get angry, as kings get angry, and  will be delighted as kings get delighted.&#8221; </font></p>

We set out, and we had covered some distance on the way, when our journey food  ran short. So Abu &#8216;Ubaida ordered that all the food present with the troops be collected,  and it was collected. Our journey food was dates, and Abu Ubaida kept on giving us our  daily ration from it little by little (piecemeal) till it decreased to such an extent that  we did not receive except a date each.&#8221; I asked (Jabir), &#8220;How could one date  benefit you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;We came to know its value when even that finished.&#8221;  Jabir added, &#8220;Then we reached the sea (coast) where we found a fish like a small  mountain. The people (i.e. troops) ate of it for 18 nights (i.e. days). Then Abu &#8216;Ubaida  ordered that two of its ribs be fixed on the ground (in the form of an arch) and that a  she-camel be ridden and passed under them. So it passed under them without touching  them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent us who were three-hundred riders under  the command of Abu Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah in order to watch the caravan of the Quraish  pagans. We stayed at the seashore for half a month and were struck with such severe hunger  that we ate even the Khabt (i.e. the leaves of the Salam, a thorny desert tree), and  because of that, the army was known as Jaish-ul-Khabt. Then the sea threw out, an animal  (i.e. a fish) called Al-&#8216;Anbar and we ate of that for half a month, and rubbed its fat on  our bodies till our bodies returned to their original state (i.e. became strong and  healthy). Abu Ubaida took one of its ribs, fixed it on the ground; then he went to the  tallest man of his companions (to let him pass under the rib). Once Sufyan said, &#8220;He  took a rib from its parts and fixed it, and then took a man and camel and they passed from  underneath it (without touching it). &#8221; Jabir added: There was a man amongst the  people who slaughtered three camels and then slaughtered another three camels and then  slaughtered other three camels, and then Abu &#8216;Ubaida forbade him to do so. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Salih: Qais bin Sad said to his father.  &#8220;I was present in the army and the people were struck with severe hunger.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;You should have slaughtered (camels) (for them).&#8221; Qais said, &#8220;I did  slaughter camels but they were hungry again. He said, &#8220;You should have slaughtered  (camels) again.&#8221; Qais said, &#8220;I did slaughter (camels) again but the people felt  hungry again.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You should have slaughtered (camels) again.&#8221; Qais  said, &#8220;I did slaughter (camels) again, but the people again felt hungry.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;You should have slaughtered (camels) again.&#8221; Qais said, &#8220;But I was  forbidden (by Abu &#8216;Ubaida this time).&#8221; </font></p>

Abu Ubaida took (and fixed) one of its bones and a rider passed underneath  it (without touching it). (Jabir added:) Abu &#8216;Ubaida said (to us), &#8220;Eat (of that  fish).&#8221; When we arrived at Medina, we informed the Prophet about that, and he said,  &#8220;Eat, for it is food Allah has brought out for you, and feed us if you have some of  it.&#8221; So some of them gave him (of that fish) and he ate it. </font></p>

That is to testify that  None has the right to be worshipped except Allah: (I order you also to offer prayers  perfectly to pay Zakat; and to fast the month of Ramadan and to give the Khumus (i.e.  one-fifth of the booty) (for Allah&#8217;s Sake).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Kuraib, the freed slave of Ibn Abbas told him that Ibn  Abbas, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama sent him to &#8216;Aisha saying,  &#8220;Pay her our greetings and ask her about our offering of the two-Rak&#8217;at after &#8216;Asr  Prayer, and tell her that we have been informed that you offer these two Rakat while we  have heard that the Prophet had forbidden their offering.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;I  and &#8216;Umar used to beat the people for their offering them.&#8221; Kuraib added, &#8220;I  entered upon her and delivered their message to her.&#8217; She said, &#8216;Ask Um Salama.&#8217; So, I  informed them (of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s answer) and they sent me to Um Salama for the same purpose as  they sent me to &#8216;Aisha. Um Salama replied, &#8216;I heard the Prophet forbidding the offering of  these two Rakat. Once the Prophet offered the &#8216;Asr prayer, and then came to me. And at  that time some Ansari women from the Tribe of Banu Haram were with me. Then (the Prophet )  offered those two Rakat, and I sent my (lady) servant to him, saying, &#8216;Stand beside him  and say (to him): Um Salama says, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Didn&#8217;t I hear you forbidding the  offering of these two Rakat (after the Asr prayer yet I see you offering them?&#8217; And if he  beckons to you with his hand, then wait behind.&#8217; So the lady slave did that and the  Prophet beckoned her with his hand, and she stayed behind, and when the Prophet finished  his prayer, he said, &#8216;O the daughter of Abu Umaiya (i.e. Um Salama), You were asking me  about these two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer. In fact, some people from the tribe of &#8216;Abdul  Qais came to me to embrace Islam and busied me so much that I did not offer the two Rakat  which were offered after Zuhr compulsory prayer, and these two Rakat (you have seen me  offering) make up for those.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent some cavalry towards Najd and they brought  a man from the tribe of Banu Hanifa who was called Thumama bin Uthal. They fastened him to  one of the pillars of the Mosque. The Prophet went to him and said, &#8220;What have you  got, O Thumama?&#8221; He replied,&#8221; I have got a good thought, O Muhammad! If you  should kill me, you would kill a person who has already killed somebody, and if you should  set me free, you would do a favor to one who is grateful, and if you want property, then  ask me whatever wealth you want.&#8221; He was left till the next day when the Prophet said  to him, &#8220;What have you got, Thumama? He said, &#8220;What I told you, i.e. if you set  me free, you would do a favor to one who is grateful.&#8221; The Prophet left him till the  day after, when he said, &#8220;What have you got, O Thumama?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have  got what I told you. &#8220;On that the Prophet said, &#8220;Release Thumama.&#8221; So he  (i.e. Thumama) went to a garden of date-palm trees near to the Mosque, took a bath and  then entered the Mosque and said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped  except Allah, and also testify that Muhammad is His Apostle! By Allah, O Muhammad! There  was no face on the surface of the earth most disliked by me than yours, but now your face  has become the most beloved face to me. By Allah, there was no religion most disliked by  me than yours, but now it is the most beloved religion to me. By Allah, there was no town  most disliked by me than your town, but now it is the most beloved town to me. Your  cavalry arrested me (at the time) when I was intending to perform the &#8216;Umra. And now what  do you think?&#8221; The Prophet gave him good tidings (congratulated him) and ordered him  to perform the &#8216;Umra. So when he came to Mecca, someone said to him, &#8220;You have become  a Sabian?&#8221; Thumama replied, &#8220;No! By Allah, I have embraced Islam with Muhammad,  Apostle of Allah. No, by Allah! Not a single grain of wheat will come to you from Jamaica  unless the Prophet gives his permission.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Musailima Al-Kadhdhab came during the lifetime of the  Prophet and started saying, &#8220;If Muhammad gives me the rule after him, I will follow  him.&#8221; And he came to Medina with a great number of the people of his tribe. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle went to him in the company of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas, and at that time,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had a stick of a date-palm tree in his hand. When he (i.e. the Prophet )  stopped near Musailima while the latter was amidst his companions, he said to him,  &#8220;If you ask me for this piece (of stick), I will not give it to you, and Allah&#8217;s  Order you cannot avoid, (but you will be destroyed), and if you turn your back from this  religion, then Allah will destroy you. And I think you are the same person who was shown  to me in my dream, and this is Thabit bin Qais who will answer your questions on my  behalf.&#8221; Then the Prophet went away from him. I asked about the statement of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle : &#8220;You seem to be the same person who was shown to me in my dream,&#8221; and  Abu Huraira informed me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When I was sleeping, I saw (in a  dream) two bangles of gold on my hands and that worried me. And then I was inspired  Divinely in the dream that I should blow on them, so I blew on them and both the bangles  flew away. And I interpreted it that two liars (who would claim to be prophets) would  appear after me. One of them has proved to be Al Ansi and the other, Musailima.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to worship stones, and when we found a better stone  than the first one, we would throw the first one and take the latter, but if we could not  get a stone then we would collect some earth (i.e. soil) and then bring a sheep and milk  that sheep over it, and perform the Tawaf around it. When the month of Rajab came, we used  (to stop the military actions), calling this month the iron remover, for we used to remove  and throw away the iron parts of every spear and arrow in the month of Rajab. Abu Raja&#8217;  added: When the Prophet sent with (Allah&#8217;s) Message, I was a boy working as a shepherd of  my family camels. When we heard the news about the appearance of the Prophet, we ran to  the fire, i.e. to Musailima al-Kadhdhab. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were informed that Musailima Al-Kadhdhab had arrived in  Medina and stayed in the house of the daughter of Al-Harith. The daughter of Al-Harith bin  Kuraiz was his wife and she was the mother of &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amir. There came to him  Allah&#8217;s Apostle accompanied by Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas who was called the orator of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle had a stick in his hand then. The Prophet stopped before  Musailima and spoke to him. Musailima said to him, &#8220;If you wish, we would not  interfere between you and the rule, on condition that the rule will be ours after you&#8230;  The Prophet said, &#8220;If you asked me for this stick, I would not give it to you. I  think you are the same person who was shown to me in a dream. And this is Thabit bin  Al-Qais who will answer you on my behalf.&#8221; The Prophet then went away. I asked Ibn  Abbas about the dream Allah&#8217;s Apostle had mentioned. Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;Someone told me  that the Prophet said, &#8220;When I was sleeping, I saw in a dream that two gold bangles  were put in my hands, and that frightened me and made me dislike them. Then I was allowed  to blow on them, and when I blew at them, both of them flew. Then I interpreted them as  two liars who would appear.&#8217; One of them was Al-&#8216;Ansi who was killed by Fairuz in Yemen  and the other was Musailima Al-Kadhdbab.&#8221; </font></p>

But the revenue of Al-Bahrain did not come till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had  died. When the revenue came during the rule of Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr ordered an announcer to  announce, &#8220;Whoever had any debt or promise due upon the Prophet, should present  himself to me (i.e. Abu Bakr). I came to Abu Bakr and informed him that the Prophet had  said (to me), &#8220;If the revenue of Al-Bahrain should come, I will give you so-much and  so much,&#8221; repeating &#8220;so much&#8221; thrice. So Abu Bakr gave me (in another  narration Jaibir said,). I met Abu Bakr after that and asked him (to give me what the  Prophet had promised me) but he did not give me. I again went to him but he did not give  me. I again went to him (for the third time) but he did not give me; On that I said to  him, &#8220;I came to you but you did not give me, then I came to you and you did not give  me, and then again I came to you, but you did not give me; so you should either give me or  else you are like a miserly to me, on that, Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Do you say, &#8216;You are like  a miserly to me?&#8217; There is no worse disease than miserliness.&#8221; Abu Bakr said it  thrice and added, &#8220;Whenever I refused to give you, I had the intention of giving  you.&#8221; (In another narration) Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;I went to Abu Bakr (and  he gave me a handful of money) and told me to count it, I counted and found it  five-hundred, and then Abu Bakr said (to me), &#8220;Take the same amount twice.&#8221; </font></p>

We, a group  of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin people went to the Prophet and asked him to give us something to ride,  but the Prophet refused. Then we asked him for the second time to give us something to  ride, but the Prophet took an oath that he would not give us anything to ride. After a  while, some camels of booty were brought to the Prophet and he ordered that five camels be  given to us. When we took those camels we said, &#8220;We have made the Prophet forget his  oath, and we will not be successful after that.&#8221; So I went to the Prophet and said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217; Apostle ! You took an oath that you would not give us anything to ride, but  you have given us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, for if I take an oath and later I see a  better solution than that, I act on the later (and gave the expiation of that oaths&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I came to the Prophet at a place called Al-Batha&#8217;. The  Prophet said, &#8220;Did you assume the Ihram for Hajj?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; He  said, &#8220;How did you express your intention (for performing Hajj)? &#8221; I said,  &#8220;Labbaik (i.e. I am ready) to assume the Ihram with the same intention as that of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba and  between Safa and Marwa, and then finish your Ihram.&#8221; So I performed the Tawaf around  the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and then I came to a woman from the tribe of Qais who  removed the lice from my head. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) in the year of the Conquest  (of Mecca) while Usama was riding behind him on (his she-camel)&#8217;. Al-Qaswa.&#8217; Bilal and  &#8216;Uthman bin Talha were accompanying him. When he made his she-camel kneel down near the  Ka&#8217;ba, he said to &#8216;Uthman, &#8220;Get us the key (of the Ka&#8217;ba). He brought the key to him  and opened the gate (of the Ka&#8217;ba), for him. The Prophet, Usama, Bilal and &#8216;Uthman (bin  Talha) entered the Ka&#8217;ba and then closed the gate behind them (from inside). The Prophet  stayed there for a long period and then came out. The people rushed to get in, but I went  in before them and found Bilal standing behind the gate, and I said to him, &#8220;Where  did the Prophet pray?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He prayed between those two front  pillars.&#8221; The Ka&#8217;ba was built on six pillars, arranged in two rows, and he prayed  between the two pillars of the front row leaving the gate of the Ka&#8217;ba at his back and  facing (in prayer) the wall which faces one when one enters the Ka&#8217;ba. Between him and  that wall (was the distance of about three cubits). But I forgot to ask Bilal about the  number of Rakat the Prophet had prayed. There was a red piece of marble at the place where  he (i.e. the Prophet) had offered the prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were talking about Hajjat-ul-Wada, while the Prophet was  amongst us. We did not know what Hajjat-ul-Wada&#8217; signified. The Prophet praised Allah and  then mentioned Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal and described him extensively, saying, &#8220;Allah did  not send any prophet but that prophet warned his nation of Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal. Noah and  the prophets following him warned (their people) of him. He will appear amongst you (O  Muhammad&#8217;s followers), and if it happens that some of his qualities may be hidden from  you, but your Lord&#8217;s State is clear to you and not hidden from you. The Prophet said it  thrice. Verily, your Lord is not blind in one eye, while he (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) is blind in  the right eye which looks like a grape bulging out (of its cluster). No doubt,! Allah has  made your blood and your properties sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of  yours, in this town of yours, in this month of yours.&#8221; The Prophet added: No doubt!  Haven&#8217;t I conveyed Allah&#8217;s Message to you? &#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes,&#8221; The  Prophet said thrice, &#8220;O Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Bakra: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Time has taken its original shape  which it had when Allah created the Heavens and the Earth. The year is of twelve months,  four of which are sacred, and out of these (four) three are in succession, i.e.  Dhul-Qa&#8217;da, Dhul-Hijja and Al-Muharram, and the fourth is Rajab which is named after the  Mudar tribe, between (the month of) Jumaida (ath-thania) and Sha&#8217;ban.&#8221; Then the  Prophet asked, &#8220;Which is this month?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know  better.&#8221; On that the Prophet kept quiet so long that we thought that he might name it  with another name. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the month of Dhul-Hijja?&#8221; We  replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Which town is this?&#8221; &#8220;We replied,  &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; On that he kept quiet so long that we  thought that he might name it with another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the town of  Mecca?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes, &#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Which day is today?&#8221;  We replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; He kept quiet so long that we  thought that he might name it with another name. Then he said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it the day of  An-Nahr (i.e. sacrifice)?&#8221; We replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;So your blood,  your properties, (The sub-narrator Muhammad said, &#8216;I think the Prophet also said: And your  honor..) are sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours, in this city of  yours, in this month of yours; and surely, you will meet your Lord, and He will ask you  about your deeds. Beware! Do not become infidels after me, cutting the throats of one  another. It is incumbent on those who are present to convey this message (of mine) to  those who are absent. May be that some of those to whom it will be conveyed will  understand it better than those who have actually heard it.&#8221; (The sub-narrator,  Muhammad, on remembering that narration, used to say, &#8220;Muhammad spoke the  truth!&#8221;) He (i.e. Prophet) then added twice, &#8220;No doubt! Haven&#8217;t I conveyed  (Allah&#8217;s Message) to you?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet visited me during Hajjat ul-Wada&#8217; while I was  suffering from a disease which brought me to the verge of death. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! My ailment has reached such a (bad) state as you see, and I have much wealth, but  I have no-one to inherit from me except my only daughter. Shall I give 2/3 of my property  as alms (in charity)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No,&#8221; I said, &#8220;Shall I give  half of my property as alms?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;(Shall I give)  1/3 of it? &#8221; He replied, &#8221; 1/3, and even 1/3 is too much. It is better for you  to leave your inheritors wealthy rather than to leave them poor, begging people (for their  sustenance); and whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s Sake, you will get reward for it even for  the morsel of food which you put in your wives mouth.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Should I remain (in Mecca) behind my companions (who are going with you to  Medina)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you remain behind, any good deed which you will  do for Allah&#8217;s Sake, will upgrade and elevate you. May be you will live longer so that  some people may benefit by you and some other (i.e. infidels) may get harmed by you.&#8221;  The Prophet then added, &#8220;O Allah! Complete the Migration of my companions and do not  turn them on their heels. But the poor Sad bin Khaula (not the above mentioned Sad) (died  in Mecca) .&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle pitied Sad for he died in Mecca. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My Companions sent me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to ask him for  some animals to ride on as they were accompanying him in the army of Al-Usra, and that was  the Ghazwa (Battle) of Tabuk, I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! My companions have sent me  to you to provide them with means of transportation.&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Allah! I will  not make you ride anything.&#8221; It happened that when I reached him, he was in an angry  mood, and I didn&#8217;t notice it. So I returned in a sad mood because of the refusal the  Prophet and for the fear that the Prophet might have become &#8216;angry with me. So I returned  to my companions and informed them of what the Prophet had said. Only a short while had  passed when I heard Bilal calling, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin Qais!&#8221; I replied to his  call. Bilal said, &#8220;Respond to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who is calling you.&#8221; When I went  to him (i.e. the Prophet), he said, &#8220;Take these two camels tied together and also  these two camels tied together,&#8221;&#8216; referring to six camels he had brought them from  Sad at that time. The Prophet added, &#8220;Take them to your companions and say, &#8216;Allah  (or Allah&#8217;s Apostle ) allows you to ride on these,&#8217; so ride on them.&#8221; So I took those  camels to them and said, &#8220;The Prophet allows you to ride on these (camels) but by  Allah, I will not leave you till some of you proceed with me to somebody who heard the  statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Do not think that I narrate to you a thing which Allah&#8217;s  Apostle has not said.&#8221; They said to me, &#8220;We consider you truthful, and we will  do what you like.&#8221; The sub-narrator added: So Abu Musa proceeded along with some of  them till they came to those who have heard the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle wherein he  denied them (some animals to ride on) and (his statement) whereby he gave them the same.  So these people told them the same information as Abu Musa had told them. </font></p>

So we came to the Prophet and he considered the biter&#8217;s claim as invalid (i.e.  the biter did not get a recompense for his broken incisor). The Prophet said, &#8220;Should  he leave his hand in your mouth so that you might snap it as if it were in the mouth of a  male camel to snap it?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Kab bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Who, from among Kab&#8217;s sons, was the guide of Kab when he  became blind: I heard Kab bin Malik narrating the story of (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk in which  he failed to take part. Kab said, &#8220;I did not remain behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any  Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed to take part in the Ghazwa  of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, for in fact,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them  (i.e. the Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of  Al-&#8216;Aqaba (pledge) with Allah&#8217;s Apostle when we pledged for Islam, and I would not  exchange it for the Badr battle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the  people than it (i.e. Al-&#8216;Aqaba pledge). As for my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had  never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind the Prophet in that  Ghazwa. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then  at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to  hide his intention by apparently referring to different Ghazwa till it was the time of  that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought in severe heat, facing, a long  journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet announced to the Muslims  clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he  informed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was accompanied  by a large number of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.&#8221;  Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;Any man who intended to be absent would think that the matter would  remain hidden unless Allah revealed it through Divine Revelation. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle  fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had ripened and the shade looked pleasant.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions prepared for the battle and I started to go out in  order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. I would  say to myself, &#8216;I can do that.&#8217; So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the  people got ready and Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had  not prepared anything for my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure)  one or two days after him, and then join them.&#8217; In the morning following their departure,  I went out to get myself ready but returned having done nothing. Then again in the next  morning, I went out to get ready but returned without doing anything. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Such was the case with me till they hurried away and the  battle was missed (by me). Even then I intended to depart to take them over. I wish I had  done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the departure of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, whenever I  went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining persons), it grieved me that I  could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those weak men whom Allah  had excused. Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. So while he was  sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, &#8216;What did Ka&#8217;b do?&#8217; A man from Banu Salama  said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his  looking at his own flanks with pride.&#8217; Then Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal said, &#8216;What a bad thing you  have said! By Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle kept silent.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b bin Malik added, &#8220;When I heard that he (i.e. the  Prophet ) was on his way back to Medina. I got dipped in my concern, and began to think of  false excuses, saying to myself, &#8216;How can I avoid his anger tomorrow?&#8217; And I took the  advice of wise member of my family in this matter. When it was said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle,  had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my mind and I knew well that I  could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I decided firmly  to speak the truth. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned  from a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer  therein and then sit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who  had failed to join the battle (of Tabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and  taking oaths before him. They were something over eighty men; Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted the  excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of allegiance asked for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness  for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to judge. Then I came to him, and  when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, &#8216;Come on.&#8217; So I  came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, &#8216;What stopped you from joining us. Had  you not purchased an animal For carrying you?&#8217; I answered, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  But by Allah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other  than you, I would have avoided his anger with an excuse. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking  fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I knew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek  your favor, Allah would surely make you angry with me in the near future, but if I tell  you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness.  Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or  wealthier than I was when I remained behind you.&#8217; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;As regards  this man, he has surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.&#8217; I got up,  and many men of Banu Salama followed me and said to me. &#8216;By Allah, we never witnessed you  doing any sin before this. Surely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah&#8217;s Apostle as the  others who did not join him, have offered. The prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Allah to  forgive you would have been sufficient for you.&#8217; By Allah, they continued blaming me so  much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of having told a lie,  but I said to them, &#8216;Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?&#8217; They  replied, &#8216;Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of  them was given the same order as given to you.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Who are they?&#8217; They replied,  Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al-Amri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.&#8217; By that they mentioned to me  two pious men who had attended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an  example for me. So I did not change my mind when they mentioned them to me. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the three aforesaid persons out of all  those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away from the people and they  changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared strange to  me as if I did not know it. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards  my two fellows, they remained in their houses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest  of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go out and witness the prayers along with  the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would talk to me, and I would come to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering after the prayer, and  I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips in return to my greetings or not.  Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with  my prayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would  turn his face away from me. When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked  till I scaled the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to  me, and I offered my greetings to him. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said,  &#8216;O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you know that I love Allah and His Apostle?&#8217; He  kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, but he remained silent. Then I  asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know it  better.&#8217; Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the  wall.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw  a Nabati (i.e. a Christian farmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in  Medina, saying, &#8216;Who will lead me to Kab bin Malik?&#8217; The people began to point (me) out  for him till he came to me and handed me a letter from the king of Ghassan in which the  following was written: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;To proceed, I have been informed that your friend  (i.e. the Prophet ) has treated you harshly. Anyhow, Allah does not let you live at a  place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join us, and we will console  you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I read it, I said to myself, &#8216;This is also a sort of a  test.&#8217; Then I took the letter to the oven and made a fire therein by burning it. When  forty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to me the messenger of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and said, &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle orders you to keep away from your wife,&#8217; I said,  &#8216;Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, only keep aloof from her  and do not cohabit her.&#8217; The Prophet sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said  to my wife. &#8216;Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this  matter.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, &#8216;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Hilal bin Umaiya is a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on  him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? &#8216; He said, &#8216;No (you can serve him) but he  should not come near you.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah, he has no desire for anything. By, Allah,  he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On that, some of my family members said to me, &#8216;Will you  also ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle to permit your wife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife  of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Allah, I will not ask the permission of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle regarding her, for I do not know What Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say if I asked  him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.&#8217; Then I remained in that state for  ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the  time when Allah&#8217;s Apostle prohibited the people from talking to us. When I had offered the  Fajr prayer on the 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting  in the condition which Allah described (in the Quran) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened  to me and even the earth seemed narrow to me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the  voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala&#8217; calling with his loudest voice, &#8216;O Kab  bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).&#8217; I fell down in prostration before Allah,  realizing that relief has come. Allah&#8217;s Apostle had announced the acceptance of our  repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out to  congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman  came to me in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and  his voice was swifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came  to me conveying the good tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by  Allah, I owned no other garments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and  wore them and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people started receiving me in batches, congratulating  me on Allah&#8217;s Acceptance of my repentance, saying, &#8216;We congratulate you on Allah&#8217;s  Acceptance of your repentance.&#8221; Kab further said, &#8220;When I entered the Mosque. I  saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle sitting with the people around him. Talha bin Ubaidullah swiftly came  to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the Muhajirin (i.e.  Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for  Talha.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;When I greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle he, his face being bright  with joy, said &#8220;Be happy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother  delivered you.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;I said to the Prophet &#8216;Is this forgiveness from you  or from Allah?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, it is from Allah.&#8217; Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle became happy,  his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew that characteristic of  him. When I sat before him, I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Because of the acceptance of my  repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;So I will keep my share from Khaibar with me,&#8217; and added, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has  saved me for telling the truth; so it is a part of my repentance not to tell but the truth  as long as I am alive. By Allah, I do not know anyone of the Muslims whom Allah has helped  fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save me (from  telling lies) the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin  (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with those who are true (in word and  deed).&#8221; (9.117-119) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His  guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing than the fact that I did not tell a lie to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle which would have caused me to perish as those who have told a lie perished, for  Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to  anybody else. Allah said:&#8211; &#8220;They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you  when you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the  rebellious people&#8211;&#8221; (9.95-96) Kab added, &#8220;We, the three persons, differed  altogether from those whose excuses Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted when they swore to him. He  took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to forgive them, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle left  our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for that Allah said):&#8211; And to  the three (He did for give also) who remained behind.&#8221; (9.118) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>What Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our  failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to the deferment of making a decision by  the Prophet about our case in contrast to the case of those who had taken an oath before  him and he excused them by accepting their excuses. </font></p>

Al-Mughira  added. &#8220;The Prophet washed his face, and when he wanted to wash his forearms, the  sleeves of his cloak became tight over them, so he took them out from underneath the cloak  and then he washed them (i.e. his forearms) and passed wet hands over his Khuffs.&#8221; </font></p>

Some  said, &#8220;What is wrong with him ? (Do you think ) he is delirious (seriously ill)? Ask  him ( to understand his state ).&#8221; So they went to the Prophet and asked him again.  The Prophet said, &#8220;Leave me, for my present state is better than what you call me  for.&#8221; Then he ordered them to do three things. He said, &#8220;Turn the pagans out of  the &#8216;Arabian Peninsula; respect and give gifts to the foreign delegations as you have seen  me dealing with them.&#8221; (Said bin Jubair, the sub-narrator said that Ibn Abbas kept  quiet as rewards the third order, or he said, &#8220;I forgot it.&#8221;) (See Hadith No.  116 Vol. 1) </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Book is  sufficient for us.&#8217; So the people in the house differed and started disputing.

So when their talk and  differences increased, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Get up.&#8221; Ibn Abbas used to say,  &#8220;No doubt, it was very unfortunate (a great disaster) that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  prevented from writing for them that writing because of their differences and noise.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) &#8220;When the ailment of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle became aggravated, he requested his wives to permit him to be (treated) nursed in  my house, and they gave him permission. He came out (to my house), walking between two men  with his feet dragging on the ground, between &#8216;Abbas bin &#8216;Abdul&#8211;Muttalib and another  man&#8221; &#8216;Ubaidullah said, &#8220;I told &#8216;Abdullah of what &#8216;Aisha had said, &#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Abbas said to me, &#8216;Do you know who is the other man whom &#8216;Aisha did not name?&#8217; I said,  &#8216;No.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;It was &#8216;Ali bin Abu Talib.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet  used to narrate saying, &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered my house and his disease became  aggravated, he said, &#8221; Pour on me the water of seven water skins, the mouths of which  have not been untied, so that I may give advice to the people.&#8217; So we let him sit in a big  basin belonging to Hafsa, the wife of the Prophet and then started to pour water on him  from these water skins till he started pointing to us with his hands intending to say,  &#8216;You have done your job.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;Then he went out to the people and led  them in prayer and preached to them.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha and &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas said,  &#8220;When Allah&#8217;s Apostle became ill seriously, he started covering his face with his  woolen sheet, and when he felt short of breath, he removed it from hi; face and said,  &#8216;That is so! Allah&#8217;s (curse be on the Jews and the Christians, as they took the graves of  their prophets as (places of worship),&#8217; intending to warn (the Muslims ) of what they had  done.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;I argued with Allah&#8217;s Apostle repeatedly about that matter  (i.e. his order that Abu Bakr should lead the people in prayer in his place when he was  ill), and what made me argue so much, was, that it never occurred to my mind that after  the Prophet, the people would ever love a man who had taken his place, and I felt that  anybody standing in his place, would be a bad omen to the people, so I wanted Allah&#8217;s  Apostle to give up the idea of choosing Abu Bakr (to lead the people in prayer).&#8221; </font></p>

So let us go to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and ask him who will take over the Caliphate. If it is given to us we will know as  to it, and if it is given to somebody else, we will inform him so that he may tell the new  ruler to take care of us.&#8221; &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;By Allah, if we asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle for  it (i.e. the Caliphate) and he denied it us, the people will never give it to us after  that. And by Allah, I will not ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle for it.&#8221; </font></p>

Abu Bakr retreated to join the row, thinking that Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to come  out for the prayer. The Muslims were about to be put to trial in their prayer (i.e. were  about to give up praying) because of being overjoyed at seeing Allah&#8217;s Apostle. But  Allah&#8217;s Apostle beckoned them with his hand to complete their prayer and then entered the  dwelling and let fall the curtain. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It was one of the favors of Allah towards me that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle expired in my house on the day of my turn while he was leaning against my chest  and Allah made my saliva mix with his saliva at his death. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman entered upon me  with a Siwak in his hand and I was supporting (the back of) Allah&#8217;s Apostle (against my  chest ). I saw the Prophet looking at it (i.e. Siwak) and I knew that he loved the Siwak,  so I said ( to him ), &#8220;Shall I take it for you ? &#8221; He nodded in agreement. So I  took it and it was too stiff for him to use, so I said, &#8220;Shall I soften it for you  ?&#8221; He nodded his approval. So I softened it and he cleaned his teeth with it. In  front of him there was a jug or a tin, (The sub-narrator, &#8216;Umar is in doubt as to which  was right) containing water. He started dipping his hand in the water and rubbing his face  with it, he said, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped except Allah. Death has its  agonies.&#8221; He then lifted his hands (towards the sky) and started saying, &#8220;With  the highest companion,&#8221; till he expired and his hand dropped down. </font></p>

So he stayed at &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s house  till he expired while he was with her.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;The Prophet expired on  the day of my turn in my house and he was taken unto Allah while his head was against my  chest and his saliva mixed with my saliva.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu  Bakr came in, carrying a Siwak he was cleaning his teeth with. Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at  it and I said to him, &#8216;O &#8216;AbdurRahman! Give me this Siwak.&#8217; So he gave it to me and I cut  it, chewed it (it&#8217;s end) and gave it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who cleaned his teeth with it  while he was resting against my chest.&#8221; </font></p>

One of us (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s wives ) used to recite a prayer  asking Allah to protect him from all evils when he became sick.

He raised his head towards the sky  and said, &#8220;With the highest companions, with the highest companions.&#8221;  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr passed carrying a fresh leaf-stalk of a date-palm and the  Prophet looked at it and I thought that the Prophet was in need of it (for cleaning his  teeth ). So I took it (from &#8216;Abdur Rahman) and chewed its head and shook it and gave it to  the Prophet who cleaned his teeth with it, in the best way he had ever cleaned his teeth,  and then he gave it to me, and suddenly his hand dropped down or it fell from his hand  (i.e. he expired). So Allah made my saliva mix with his saliva on his last day on earth  and his first day in the Hereafter. </font></p>

He  dismounted and entered the Mosque, but did not speak to the people till he entered upon  &#8216;Aisha and went straight to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was covered with Hibra cloth (i.e. a kind  of Yemenite cloth). He then uncovered the Prophet&#8217;s face and bowed over him and kissed him  and wept, saying, &#8220;Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you. By Allah, Allah  will never cause you to die twice. As for the death which was written for you, has come  upon you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: Abu Bakr went out while Umar bin  Al-Khattab was talking to the people. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Sit down, O &#8216;Umar!&#8221; But  &#8216;Umar refused to sit down. So the people came to Abu Bakr and left Umar. Abu Bakr said,  &#8220;To proceed, if anyone amongst you used to worship Muhammad , then Muhammad is dead,  but if (anyone of) you used to worship Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die.  Allah said:&#8211;&#8220;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle, and indeed (many) apostles have  passed away before him..(till the end of the Verse )&#8230;&#8230;Allah will reward to those who  are thankful.&#8221; (3.144) By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that Allah had  revealed this Verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and all the people received it from  him, and I heard everybody reciting it (then). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent troops appointed Usama bin Zaid as  their commander. The people criticized his leadership. Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and said,  &#8220;If you (people) are criticizing his (i.e. Usama&#8217;s) leadership you used to criticize  the leadership of his father before. By Allah, he (i.e. Zaid) deserved the leadership  indeed, and he used to be one of the most beloved persons to me, and now this (i.e. his  son, Usama) is one of the most beloved persons to me after him.&#8221; </font></p>

The rider said:  We buried the Prophet five days ago.&#8221; I asked (As-Sanabihi), &#8216;Did you hear anything  about the night of Qadr?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Bilal, the Mu&#8217;adhdhin of the Prophet informed me  that it is on one of the seven nights of the last ten days (of Ramadan).&#8221; </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Prophetic Commentary on the Qur&#8217;an(Tafseer of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam))</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="006.060.001"></a>Volume 6, Book 60, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said bin Al-Mu&#8217;alla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was praying in the Mosque, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called me but I did not respond to him. Later I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I was praying.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Allah say&#8217;&#8211;&#8220;Give your response to Allah (by obeying Him) and to His Apostle when he calls you.&#8221; (8.24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said to me, &#8220;I will teach you a Sura which is the greatest Sura in the Qur&#8217;an, before you leave the Mosque.&#8221; Then he got hold of my hand, and when he intended to leave (the Mosque), I said to him, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say to me, &#8216;I will teach you a Sura which is the greatest Sura in the Quran?&#8217; He said, &#8220;Al-Hamdu-Lillah Rabbi-l-Alamin (i.e. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds) which is Al-Sab&#8217;a Al-Mathani (i.e. seven repeatedly recited Verses) and the Grand Qur&#8217;an which has been given to me.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When the Imam says: &#8216;Ghair-il-Maghdubi &#8216;Alaihim Walad-Dallin (i.e. not the path of those who earn Your Anger, nor the path of those who went astray (1.7)), then you must say, &#8216;Ameen&#8217;, for if one&#8217;s utterance of &#8216;Ameen&#8217; coincides with that of the angels, then his past sins will be forgiven.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;On the Day of Resurrection the Believers will assemble and say, &#8216;Let us ask somebody to intercede for us with our Lord.&#8217; So they will go to Adam and say, &#8216;You are the father of all the people, and Allah created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate to you, and taught you the names of all things; so please intercede for us with your Lord, so that He may relieve us from this place of ours.&#8217; Adam will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this (i.e. intercession for you).&#8217; Then Adam will remember his sin and feel ashamed thereof. He will say, &#8216;Go to Noah, for he was the first Apostle, Allah sent to the inhabitants of the earth.&#8217; They will go to him and Noah will say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking.&#8217; He will remember his appeal to his Lord to do what he had no knowledge of, then he will feel ashamed thereof and will say, &#8216;Go to the Khalil&#8211;r-Rahman (i.e. Abraham).&#8217; They will go to him and he will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking. Go to Moses, the slave to whom Allah spoke (directly) and gave him the Torah .&#8217; So they will go to him and he will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking.&#8217; and he will mention (his) killing a person who was not a killer, and so he will feel ashamed thereof before his Lord, and he will say, &#8216;Go to Jesus, Allah&#8217;s Slave, His Apostle and Allah&#8217;s Word and a Spirit coming from Him. Jesus will say, &#8216;I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muhammad the Slave of Allah whose past and future sins were forgiven by Allah.&#8217; So they will come to me and I will proceed till I will ask my Lord&#8217;s Permission and I will be given permission. When I see my Lord, I will fall down in Prostration and He will let me remain in that state as long as He wishes and then I will be addressed.&#8217; (Muhammad!) Raise your head. Ask, and your request will be granted; say, and your saying will be listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.&#8217; I will raise my head and praise Allah with a saying (i.e. invocation) He will teach me, and then I will intercede. He will fix a limit for me (to intercede for) whom I will admit into Paradise. Then I will come back again to Allah, and when I see my Lord, the same thing will happen to me. And then I will intercede and Allah will fix a limit for me to intercede whom I will let into Paradise, then I will come back for the third time; and then I will come back for the fourth time, and will say, &#8216;None remains in Hell but those whom the Quran has imprisoned (in Hell) and who have been destined to an eternal stay in Hell.&#8217; &#8221; (The compiler) Abu &#8216;Abdullah said: &#8216;But those whom the Qur&#8217;an has imprisoned in Hell,&#8217; refers to the Statement of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They will dwell therein forever.&#8221; (16.29)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet, &#8220;What is the greatest sin in the Sight of Allah?&#8221; He said, &#8220;That you set up a rival unto Allah though He Alone created you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;That is indeed a great sin.&#8221; Then asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To kill your son lest he should share your food with you.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next?&#8221; He said, &#8220;To commit illegal sexual intercourse with the wife of your neighbor.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The Kam&#8217;a (i.e. a kind of edible fungus) is like the Manna (in that it is obtained without effort) and its water is a (medicine) cure for eye trouble.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;It was said to the children of Israel, &#8216;Enter the gate (of the town), prostrate (in humility) and say: Hittatun (i.e. repentance) i.e. O Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Forgive our sins.&#8217; But they entered by dragging themselves on their buttocks, so they did something different (from what they had been ordered to do) and said, &#8216;Hittatun,&#8217; but added, &#8220;A grain in a hair.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin Salam heard the news of the arrival of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (at Medina) while he was on a farm collecting its fruits. So he came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;I will ask you about three things which nobody knows unless he be a prophet. Firstly, what is the first portent of the Hour? What is the first meal of the people of Paradise? And what makes a baby look like its father or mother?&#8217;. The Prophet said, &#8220;Just now Gabriel has informed me about that.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;Gabriel?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;He, among the angels is the enemy of the Jews.&#8221; On that the Prophet recited this Holy Verse:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel (let him die in his fury!) for he has brought it (i.e. Qur&#8217;an) down to your heart by Allah&#8217;s permission.&#8221; (2.97) Then he added, &#8220;As for the first portent of the Hour, it will be a fire that will collect the people from the East to West. And as for the first meal of the people of Paradise, it will be the caudite (i.e. extra) lobe of the fish liver. And if a man&#8217;s discharge proceeded that of the woman, then the child resembles the father, and if the woman&#8217;s discharge proceeded that of the man, then the child resembles the mother.&#8221; On hearing that, &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that you are the Apostle of Allah, O, Allah&#8217;s Apostle; the Jews are liars, and if they should come to know that I have embraced Islam, they would accuse me of being a liar.&#8221; In the meantime some Jews came (to the Prophet) and he asked them, &#8220;What is &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s status amongst you?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;He is the best amongst us, and he is our chief and the son of our chief.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What would you think if &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam embraced Islam?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;May Allah protect him from this!&#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah came out and said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The Jews then said, &#8220;Abdullah is the worst of us and the son of the worst of us,&#8221; and disparaged him. On that &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is what I was afraid of!&#8221;</p>

Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.&#8217; So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. I came to know that the Prophet had blamed some of his wives so I entered upon them and said, &#8216;You should either stop (troubling the Prophet ) or else Allah will give His Apostle better wives than you.&#8217; When I came to one of his wives, she said to me, &#8216;O &#8216;Umar! Does Allah&#8217;s Apostle haven&#8217;t what he could advise his wives with, that you try to advise them?&#8217; &#8221; Thereupon Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>

Why don&#8217;t you rebuild it on Abraham&#8217;s foundations?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Were your people not so close to (the period of Heathenism, i.e. the Period between their being Muslims and being infidels), I would do so.&#8221; The sub-narrator, &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Aisha had surely heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying that, for I do not think that Allah&#8217;s Apostle left touching the two corners of the Ka&#8217;ba facing Al-Hijr except because the Ka&#8217;ba was not built on all Abraham&#8217;s foundations.&#8221;</p>

(So Allah Revealed (2.144) and he offered &#8216;Asr prayers(in his Mosque facing Ka&#8217;ba at Mecca) and some people prayed with him. A man from among those who had prayed with him, went out and passed by some people offering prayer in another mosque, and they were in the state of bowing. He said, &#8220;I, (swearing by Allah,) testify that I have prayed with the Prophet facing Mecca.&#8221; Hearing that, they turned their faces to the Ka&#8217;ba while they were still bowing. Some men had died before the Qibla was changed towards the Ka&#8217;ba. They had been killed and we did not know what to say about them (i.e. whether their prayers towards Jerusalem were accepted or not). So Allah revealed:&#8211; &#8220;And Allah would never make your faith (i.e. prayer) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered (towards Jerusalem).

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, Safa and Marwa (i.e. two mountains at Mecca) are among the Symbols of Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not harmful of those who perform the Hajj to the House of Allah) or perform the Umra, to ambulate (Tawaf) between them.

When Islam came, they asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it, whereupon Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>

The law of Al-Qisas (i.e. equality in punishment) is prescribed for you in cases of murder: The free for the free, the slave for the slave, and the female for the female.

Anas bin Al-Nadr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will the incisor tooth of Ar-Rubai be broken? No, by Him Who sent you with the Truth, her incisor tooth will not be broken.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Anas!

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the affliction of Ibn Az-Zubair, two men came to Ibn &#8216;Umar and said, &#8220;The people are lost, and you are the son of &#8216;Umar, and the companion of the Prophet, so what forbids you from coming out?&#8221; He said, &#8220;What forbids me is that Allah has prohibited the shedding of my brother&#8217;s blood.&#8221; They both said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Allah say, &#8216;And fight then until there is no more affliction?&#8221; He said &#8220;We fought until there was no more affliction and the worship is for Allah (Alone while you want to fight until there is affliction and until the worship become for other than Allah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi (through another group of sub-narrators): A man came to Ibn &#8216;Umar and said, &#8220;O Abu Abdur Rahman! What made you perform Hajj in one year and Umra in another year and leave the Jihad for Allah&#8217; Cause though you know how much Allah recommends it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;O son of my brother! Islam is founded on five principles, i.e. believe in Allah and His Apostle, the five compulsory prayers, the fasting of the month of Ramadan, the payment of Zakat, and the Hajj to the House (of Allah).&#8221; The man said, &#8220;O Abu Abdur Rahman! Won&#8217;t you listen to why Allah has mentioned in His Book: &#8216;If two groups of believers fight each other, then make peace between them, but if one of then transgresses beyond bounds against the other, then you all fight against the one that transgresses. (49.9) and:&#8211;&#8220;And fight them till there is no more affliction (i.e. no more worshiping of others along with Allah).&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;We did it, during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle when Islam had only a few followers. A man would be put to trial because of his religion; he would either be killed or tortured. But when the Muslims increased, there was no more afflictions or oppressions.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;What is your opinion about &#8216;Uthman and &#8216;Ali?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;As for &#8216;Uthman, it seems that Allah has forgiven him, but you people dislike that he should be forgiven. And as for &#8216;Ali, he is the cousin of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his son-in-law.&#8221; Then he pointed with his hand and said, &#8220;That is his house which you see.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 41:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Wail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa said, &#8220;The Verse:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And spend (of your wealth) in the Cause of Allah and do not throw yourselves in destruction,&#8221; (2.195) was revealed concerning spending in Allah&#8217;s Cause (i.e. Jihad).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 42:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Maqal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat with Ka&#8217;b bin Ujra in this mosque, i.e. Kufa Mosque, and asked him about the meaning of:&#8211;&#8220;Pay a ransom (i.e. Fidya) of either fasting or &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; &#8211; (2.196) He said, &#8220;I was taken to the Prophet while lice were falling on my face. The Prophet said, &#8216;I did not think that your trouble reached to such an extent. Can you afford to slaughter a sheep (as a ransom for shaving your head)?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Then fast for three days, or feed six poor persons by giving half a Sa of food for each and shave your head.&#8217; So the above Verse was revealed especially for me and generally for all of you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 43:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran bin Husain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Verse of Hajj-at-Tamatu was revealed in Allah&#8217;s Book, so we performed it with Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and nothing was revealed in Qur&#8217;an to make it illegal, nor did the Prophet prohibit it till he died. But the man (who regarded it illegal) just expressed what his own mind suggested.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 44:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ukaz, Mijanna and Dhul-Majaz were markets during the Pre-islamic Period. They (i.e. Muslims) considered it a sin to trade there during the Hajj time (i.e. season), so this Verse was revealed:&#8211; &#8220;There is no harm for you if you seek of the Bounty of your Lord during the Hajj season.&#8221; (2.198)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 45:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Quraish people and those who embraced their religion, used to stay at Muzdalifa and used to call themselves Al-Hums, while the rest of the Arabs used to stay at &#8216;Arafat. When Islam came, Allah ordered His Prophet to go to &#8216;Arafat and stay at it, and then pass on from there, and that is what is meant by the Statement of Allah:&#8211;&#8220;Then depart from the place whence all the people depart&#8230;&#8230;&#8221; (2.199)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 46:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man who wants to perform the Hajj (from Mecca) can perform the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba as long as he is not in the state of Ihram till he assumes the Ihram for Hajj. Then, if he rides and proceeds to &#8216;Arafat, he should take a Hadi (i.e. animal for sacrifice), either a camel or a cow or a sheep, whatever he can afford; but if he cannot afford it, he should fast for three days during the Hajj before the day of &#8216;Arafat, but if the third day of his fasting happens to be the day of &#8216;Arafat (i.e. 9th of Dhul-Hijja) then it is no sin for him (to fast on it). Then he should proceed to &#8216;Arafat and stay there from the time of the &#8216;Asr prayer till darkness falls. Then the pilgrims should proceed from &#8216;Arafat, and when they have departed from it, they reach Jam&#8217; (i.e. Al-Muzdalifa) where they ask Allah to help them to be righteous and dutiful to Him, and there they remember Allah greatly or say Takbir (i.e. Allah is Greater) and Tahlil (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah) repeatedly before dawn breaks. Then, after offering the morning (Fajr) prayer you should pass on (to Mina) for the people used to do so and Allah said:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then depart from the place whence all the people depart. And ask for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness. Truly! Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (2.199) Then you should go on doing so till you throw pebbles over the Jamra.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 47:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to say, &#8220;O Allah! Our Lord! Give us in this world that, which is good and in the Hereafter that, which is good and save us from the torment of the Fire.&#8221; (2.201)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 48:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The most hated man in the Sight of Allah is the one who is the most quarrelsome.&#8221; Narrated &#8216;Aisha: The Prophet said, &#8220;Or do you think that you shall enter Paradise without such (trials) as came to those who passed away before you?&#8221; (2.214)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 49:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abu Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited: &#8220;(Respite will be granted) until when the Apostles gave up hope (of their people) and thought that they were denied (by their people). There came to them Our Help &#8230;.&#8221; (12.110) reading Kudhibu without doubling the sound &#8216;dh&#8217;, and that was what he understood of the Verse. Then he went on reciting: &#8220;..even the Apostle and those who believed along with him said: When (will come) Allah&#8217;s Help? Yes, verily, Allah&#8217;s Help is near.&#8221; (2.214)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I met &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair and I mentioned that to him. He said, &#8220;Aisha said, &#8216;Allah forbid! By Allah, Allah never promised His Apostle anything but he knew that it would certainly happen before he died. But trials were continuously presented before the Apostles till they were afraid that their followers would accuse them of telling lies. So I used to recite:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Till they (come to) think that they were treated as liars.&#8221; reading &#8216;Kudh-dhibu with double &#8216;dh.&#8217;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 50:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Ibn &#8216;Umar recited the Qur&#8217;an, he would not speak to anyone till he had finished his recitation. Once I held the Qur&#8217;an and he recited Surat-al-Baqara from his memory and then stopped at a certain Verse and said, &#8220;Do you know in what connection this Verse was revealed? &#8221; I replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was revealed in such-and-such connection.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then resumed his recitation. Nafi added regarding the Verse:&#8211;&#8220;So go to your tilth when or how you will&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It means one should approach his wife in ..&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 51:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jews used to say: &#8220;If one has sexual intercourse with his wife from the back, then she will deliver a squint-eyed child.&#8221; So this Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Your wives are a tilth unto you; so go to your tilth when or how you will.&#8221; (2.223)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 52:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Hasan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sister of Ma&#8217;qal bin Yasar was divorced by her husband who left her till she had fulfilled her term of &#8216;Iddat (i.e. the period which should elapse before she can Remarry) and then he wanted to remarry her but Maqal refused, so this Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not prevent them from marrying their (former) husbands.&#8221; (2.232)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 53:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Az-Zubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to &#8216;Uthman bin &#8216;Affan (while he was collecting the Qur&#8217;an) regarding the Verse:&#8211; &#8220;Those of you who die and leave wives &#8230;&#8221; (2.240) &#8220;This Verse was abrogated by an other Verse. So why should you write it? (Or leave it in the Qur&#8217;an)?&#8221; &#8216;Uthman said. &#8220;O son of my brother! I will not shift anything of it from its place.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 54:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mujahi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(regarding the Verse):&#8211; &#8220;Those of you who die and leave wives behind. They &#8211; (their wives) &#8212; shall wait (as regards their marriage ) for four months and ten days).&#8221; (2.234)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The widow, according to this Verse, was to spend this period of waiting with her husband&#8217;s family, so Allah revealed: &#8220;Those of you who die and leave wives (i.e. widows) should bequeath for their wives, a year&#8217;s maintenance and residences without turning them out, but if they leave (their residence), there is no blame on you for what they do with themselves provided it is honorable.&#8217; (i.e. lawful marriage) (2.240).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah entitled the widow to be bequeathed extra maintenance for seven months and twenty nights, and that is the completion of one year. If she wished she could stay (in her husband&#8217;s home) according to the will, and she could leave it if she wished, as Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;..without turning them out, but if they leave (the residence), there is no blame on you.&#8221; So the &#8216;Idda (i.e. four months and ten days as it) is obligatory for her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ata said: Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;This Verse, i.e. the Statement of Allah: &#8220;..without turning them out..&#8221; cancelled the obligation of staying for the waiting period in her dead husband&#8217;s house, and she can complete this period wherever she likes.&#8221; &#8216;Ata&#8217;s aid: If she wished, she could complete her &#8216;Idda by staying in her dead husband&#8217;s residence according to the will or leave it according to Allah&#8217;s Statement:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is no blame on you for what they do with themselves.&#8221; &#8216;Ata&#8217; added: Later the regulations of inheritance came and abrogated the order of the dwelling of the widow (in her dead husband&#8217;s house), so she could complete the &#8216;Idda wherever she likes. And it was no longer necessary to provide her with a residence. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;This Verse abrogated her (i.e. widow&#8217;s) dwelling in her dead husband&#8217;s house and she could complete the &#8216;Idda (i.e. four months and ten days) wherever she liked, as Allah&#8217;s Statement says:&#8211;&#8220;&#8230;without turning them out&#8230;&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin Sirin:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat in a gathering in which the chiefs of the Ansar were present, and Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Laila was amongst them. I mentioned the narration of &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Utba regarding the question of Subai&#8217;a bint Al-Harith. Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;But &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s uncle used not to say so.&#8221; I said, &#8220;I am too brave if I tell a lie concerning a person who is now in Al-Kufa,&#8221; and I raised my voice. Then I went out and met Malik bin &#8216;Amir or Malik bin &#8216;Auf, and said, &#8220;What was the verdict of Ibn Mas&#8217;ud about the pregnant widow whose husband had died?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Ibn Mas&#8217;ud said, &#8216;Why do you impose on her the hard order and don&#8217;t let her make use of the leave? The shorter Sura of women (i.e. Surat-at-Talaq) was revealed after the longer Sura (i.e. Surat-al-Baqara).&#8221; (i.e. Her &#8216;Idda is up till she delivers.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Arqam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to speak while in prayer. One of us used to speak to his brother (while in prayer) about his need, till the Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Guard strictly the (five obligatory) prayers, especially the middle (the Best) (Asr) Prayer and stand before Allah with obedience (and not to speak to others during the prayers).&#8221; Then we were ordered not to speak in the prayers.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 59:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar was asked about Salat-al-Khauf (i.e. prayer of fear) he said, &#8220;The Imam comes forward with a group of people and leads them in a one Rak&#8217;a prayer while another group from them who has not prayed yet, stay between the praying group and the enemy. When those who are with the Imam have finished their one Rak&#8217;a, they retreat and take the positions of those who have not prayed but they will not finish their prayers with Taslim. Those who have not prayed, come forward to offer a Rak&#8217;a with the Imam (while the first group covers them from the enemy). Then the Imam, having offered two Rakat, finishes his prayer. Then each member of the two groups offer the second Rak&#8217;a alone after the Imam has finished his prayer. Thus each one of the two groups will have offered two Rakat. But if the fear is too great, they can pray standing on their feet or riding on their mounts, facing the Qibla or not.&#8221; Nafi added: I do not think that &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar narrated this except from Allah&#8217;s Apostle (See Hadith No. 451, Vol 5 to know exactly &#8220;The Fear Prayer.&#8221;)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin Masud said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Whoever takes an oath when asked to do so, in which he may deprive a Muslim of his property unlawfully, will meet Allah Who will be angry with him.&#8217; So Allah revealed in confirmation of this statement:&#8211;&#8220;Verily! Those who Purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s Covenant and oaths, they shall have no portion in the Hereafter&#8230;&#8221; (3.77) Then entered Al-Ash&#8217;ath bin Qais and said, &#8220;What is Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman narrating to you?&#8221; We replied, &#8216;So-and-so.&#8221; Al-Ash&#8217;ath said, &#8220;This Verse was revealed in my connection. I had a well in the land of my cousin (and he denied my, possessing it). On that the Prophet said to me, &#8216;Either you bring forward a proof or he (i.e. your cousin) takes an oath (to confirm his claim)&#8217; I said, &#8216;I am sure he would take a (false) oath, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; He said, &#8216;If somebody takes an oath when asked to do so through which he may deprive a Muslim of his property (unlawfully) and he is a liar in his oath, he will meet Allah Who will be angry with him.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Two women were stitching shoes in a house or a room. Then one of them came out with an awl driven into her hand, and she sued the other for it. The case was brought before Ibn &#8216;Abbas, Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;If people were to be given what they claim (without proving their claim) the life and property of the nation would be lost.&#8217; Will you remind her (i.e. the defendant), of Allah and recite before her:&#8211;&#8220;Verily! Those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s Covenant and their oaths&#8230;&#8221;(3.77)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they reminded her and she confessed. Ibn &#8216;Abbas then said, &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8216;The oath is to be taken by the defendant (in the absence of any proof against him).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 75:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sufyan narrated to me personally, saying, &#8220;I set out during the Truce that had been concluded between me and Allah&#8217;s Apostle. While I was in Sham, a letter sent by the Prophet was brought to Heraclius. Dihya Al-Kalbi had brought and given it to the governor of Busra, and the latter forwarded it to Heraclius. Heraclius said, &#8216;Is there anyone from the people of this man who claims to be a prophet?&#8217; The people replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So I along with some of Quraishi men were called and we entered upon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he said, &#8216;Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a prophet?&#8217; So they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me. Then he called upon his translator and said (to him). &#8216;Tell them ( i.e. Abu Sufyan&#8217;s companions) that I am going to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a prophet. So, if he tell me a lie, they should contradict him (instantly).&#8217; By Allah, had I not been afraid that my companions would consider me a liar, I would have told lies. Heraclius then said to his translator, &#8216;Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s) family status amongst you? I said, &#8216;He belongs to a noble family amongst us.&#8221; Heraclius said, &#8216;Was any of his ancestors a king?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has said?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?&#8217; I said, &#8216;It is the poor who followed him.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Is the number of his follower increasing or decreasing?&#8217; I said, &#8216;The are increasing.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Did you fight with him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He said, &#8216;How was your fighting with him?&#8217; I said, &#8216;The fighting between us was undecided and victory was shared by him and us by turns. He inflicts casualties upon us and we inflict casualties upon him.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Did he ever betray?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No, but now we are away from him in this truce and we do not know what he will do in it&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allah, I was not able to insert in my speech a word (against him) except that. Heraclius said, &#8216;Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claimed the same (i.e. Islam) before him? I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu Sufyan), &#8216;I asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes from a noble family amongst you Verily, all Apostles come from the noblest family among their people. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you denied that. Thereupon I thought that had one of his fore-fathers been a king, I would have said that he (i.e. Muhammad) was seeking to rule the kingdom of his fore-fathers. Then I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the poor among the people, and you said that they were only the poor (who follow him). In fact, such are the followers of the Apostles. Then I asked you whether you have ever accused him of telling lies before saying what he said, and your reply was in the negative. Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about others, could ever tell a lie about Allah. Then I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And such is Faith when it mixes with the cheerfulness of the hearts. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing You claimed that they were increasing. That is the way of true faith till it is complete. Then I asked you whether you had ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with him and the battle between you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in turns; he inflicted casual ties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with the Apostles; they are out to test and the final victory is for them. Then I asked you whether he had ever betrayed; you claimed that he had never betrayed. I need, Apostles never betray. Then I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before him; and you denied that. Thereupon I thought if somebody had said that statement before him, then I would have said that he was but a man copying some sayings said before him.&#8221; Abu Safyan said, &#8220;Heraclius then asked me, &#8216;What does he order you to do?&#8217; I said, &#8216;He orders us (to offer) prayers and (to pay) Zakat and to keep good relationship with the Kith and kin and to be chaste.&#8217; Then Heraclius said, &#8216;If whatever you have said, is true, he is really a prophet, and I knew that he ( i.e. the Prophet ) was going to appear, but I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If I were certain that I can reach him, I would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; and his kingdom will expand (surely to what is under my feet.&#8217; Then Heraclius asked for the letter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and read it wherein was written:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. This letter is) from Muhammad, Apostle of Allah, to Heraclius, the sovereign of Byzantine&#8230;&#8230;.. Peace be upon him who follows the Right Path. Now then, I call you to embrace Islam. Embrace Islam and you will be saved (from Allah&#8217;s Punishment); embrace Islam, and Allah will give you a double reward, but if you reject this, you will be responsible for the sins of all the people of your kingdom (Allah&#8217;s Statement):&#8211;&#8220;O the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Come to a word common to you and us that we worship None but Allah&#8230;.bear witness that we are Muslims.&#8217; (3.64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he finished reading the letter, voices grew louder near him and there was a great hue and cry, and we were ordered to go out.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;While coming out, I said to my companions, &#8216;The situation of Ibn Abu Kabsha (i.e. Muhammad) has become strong; even the king of Banu Al-Asfar is afraid of him.&#8217; So I continued to believe that Allah&#8217;s Apostle would be victorious, till Allah made me embrace Islam.&#8221; Az-Zuhri said, &#8220;Heraclius then invited all the chiefs of the Byzantines and had them assembled in his house and said, &#8216;O group of Byzantines! Do you wish to have a permanent success and guidance and that your kingdom should remain with you?&#8217; (Immediately after hearing that), they rushed towards the gate like onagers, but they found them closed. Heraclius then said, &#8216;Bring them back to me.&#8217; So he called them and said, &#8216;I just wanted to test the strength of your adherence to your religion. Now I have observed of you that which I like.&#8217; Then the people fell in prostration before him and became pleased with him.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 6,Vol 1)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Out of all the Ansar, living in Medina, Abu Talha had the largest number of (date palm trees) gardens, and the most beloved of his property to him was Bairuha garden which was standing opposite the Mosque (of the Prophet). Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to enter it and drink of its good water. When the Verse:&#8211;&#8220;By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love.&#8221; (3.92) Abu Talha got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, Allah says:&#8211;&#8220;By no means shall you attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love.&#8221; (3.92) and the most beloved of my property to me is the Bairuha garden, so I give it (as a charitable gift) in Allah&#8217;s Cause and hope to receive good out of it, and to have it stored for me with Allah. So, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Dispose it of (i.e. utilize it) in the way Allah orders you (to dispose it of).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Bravo! That is a fruitful property! That is a fruitful property! I have heard what you have said and I think that you should distribute that (garden) amongst your relatives.&#8221; The Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his cousins.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews brought to the Prophet a man and a woman from among them who had committed illegal sexual intercourse. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;How do you usually punish the one amongst you who has committed illegal sexual intercourse?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We blacken their faces with coal and beat them,&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you find the order of Ar-Rajm (i.e. stoning to death) in the Torah?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We do not find anything in it.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam (after hearing this conversation) said to them. &#8220;You have told a lie! Bring here the Torah and recite it if you are truthful.&#8221; (So the Jews brought the Torah). And the religious teacher who was teaching it to them, put his hand over the Verse of Ar-Rajm and started reading what was written above and below the place hidden with his hand, but he did not read the Verse of Ar-Rajm. &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam removed his (i.e. the teacher&#8217;s) hand from the Verse of Ar-Rajm and said, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; So when the Jews saw that Verse, they said, &#8220;This is the Verse of Ar-Rajm.&#8221; So the Prophet ordered the two adulterers to be stoned to death, and they were stoned to death near the place where biers used to be placed near the Mosque. I saw her companion (i.e. the adulterer) bowing over her so as to protect her from the stones.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 89:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode a donkey, equipped with a thick cloth-covering made in Fadak and was riding behind him. He was going to pay visit to Sad bin Ubada in Banu Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj; and this incident happened before the battle of Badr. The Prophet passed by a gathering in which &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul was present, and that was before &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai embraced Islam. Behold in that gathering there were people of different religions: there were Muslims, pagans, idol-worshippers and Jews, and in that gathering &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha was also present. When a cloud of dust raised by the donkey reached that gathering, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai covered his nose with his garment and then said, &#8220;Do not cover us with dust.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle greeted them and stopped and dismounted and invited them to Allah (i.e. to embrace Islam) and recited to them the Holy Qur&#8217;an. On that, &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Saluil said, &#8220;O man ! There is nothing better than that what you say. If it is the truth, then do not trouble us with it in our gatherings. Return to your mount (or residence) and if somebody comes to you, relate (your tales) to him.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha said, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Bring it (i.e. what you want to say) to us in our gathering, for we love that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslims, the pagans and the Jews started abusing one another till they were on the point of fighting with one another. The Prophet kept on quietening them till they became quiet, whereupon the Prophet rode his animal (mount) and proceeded till he entered upon Sad bin Ubada. The Prophet said to Sad, &#8220;Did you not hear what &#8216;Abu Hub-b said?&#8221; He meant &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai. &#8220;He said so-and-so.&#8221; On that Sad bin Ubada said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Excuse and forgive him, for by Him Who revealed the Book to you, Allah brought the Truth which was sent to you at the time when the people of this town (i.e. Medina) had decided unanimously to crown him and tie a turban on his head (electing him as chief). But when Allah opposed that (decision) through the Truth which Allah gave to you, he (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai) was grieved with jealously. and that caused him to do what you have seen.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle excused him, for the Prophet and his companions used to forgive the pagans and the people of Scripture as Allah had ordered them, and they used to put up with their mischief with patience. Allah said: &#8220;And you shall certainly hear much that will grieve you from those who received the Scripture before you and from the pagans&#8230;&#8230;..'(3.186) And Allah also said:&#8211;&#8220;Many of the people of the Scripture wish if they could turn you away as disbelievers after you have believed, from selfish envy..&#8221; (2.109)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet used to stick to the principle of forgiveness for them as long as Allah ordered him to do so till Allah permitted fighting them. So when Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought the battle of Badr and Allah killed the nobles of Quraish infidels through him, Ibn Ubai bin Salul and the pagans and idolaters who were with him, said, &#8220;This matter (i.e. Islam) has appeared (i.e. became victorious).&#8221; So they gave the pledge of allegiance (for embracing Islam) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and became Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">During the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, some men among the hypocrites used to remain behind him (i.e. did not accompany him) when he went out for a Ghazwa and they would be pleased to stay at home behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle When Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned (from the battle) they would put forward (false) excuses and take oaths, wishing to be praised for what they had not done. So there was revealed:&#8211;</p>

It was only that the Prophet called the Jews and asked them about something, and they hid the truth and told him something else, and showed him that they deserved praise for the favor of telling him the answer to his question, and they became happy with what they had concealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Ibn Abbas recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;(And remember) when Allah took a Covenant from those who were given the Scripture..and those who rejoice in what they have done and love to be praised for what they have not done.&#8217; &#8221; (3.187-188)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he stood up, performed ablution, brushed his teeth with a Siwak, and then prayed eleven Rakat. Then Bilal pronounced the Adhan (i.e. call for the Fajr prayer). The Prophet then offered two Rakat (Sunna) prayer and went out (to the Mosque) and offered the (compulsory congregational) Fajr prayer.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">There was an orphan (girl) under the care of a man. He married her and she owned a date palm (garden). He married her just because of that and not because he loved her.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls&#8230;&#8221; (4.3) She said, &#8220;O son of my sister! An Orphan girl used to be under the care of a guardian with whom she shared property. Her guardian, being attracted by her wealth and beauty, would intend to marry her without giving her a just Mahr, i.e. the same Mahr as any other person might give her (in case he married her). So such guardians were forbidden to do that unless they did justice to their female wards and gave them the highest Mahr their peers might get. They were ordered (by Allah, to marry women of their choice other than those orphan girls.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added,&#8221; The people asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle his instructions after the revelation of this Divine Verse whereupon Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They ask your instruction regarding women &#8221; (4.127) &#8216;Aisha further said, &#8220;And the Statement of Allah: &#8220;And yet whom you desire to marry.&#8221; (4.127) as anyone of you refrains from marrying an orphan girl (under his guardianship) when she is lacking in property and beauty.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;So they were forbidden to marry those orphan girls for whose wealth and beauty they had a desire unless with justice, and that was because they would refrain from marrying them if they were lacking in property and beauty.&#8221;</p>

If the guardian is poor, he can take from the property of the orphan, what is just and reasonable according to his work and the time he spends on managing it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and Abu Bakr came on foot to pay me a visit (during my illness) at Banu Salama&#8217;s (dwellings). The Prophet found me unconscious, so he asked for water and performed the ablution from it and sprinkled some water over it. I came to my senses and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do you order me to do as regards my wealth?&#8221; So there was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah commands you as regards your children&#8217;s (inheritance):&#8221; (4.11)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 102:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(In the Pre-Islamic Period ) the children used to inherit all the property but the parents used to inherit only through a will. So Allah cancelled that which He liked to cancel and put decreed that the share of a son was to be twice the share of a daughter, and for the parents one-sixth for each one of them, or one third, and for the wife one-eighth or one-fourth, and for the husband one-half, or one-fourth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 103:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">regarding the Divine Verse: &#8220;O you who believe! You are forbidden to inherit women against their will, and you should not treat them with harshness that you may take back part of the (Mahr) dower you have given them.&#8221; (4.19) (Before this revelation) if a man died, his relatives used to have the right to inherit his wife, and one of them could marry her if he would, or they would give her in marriage if they wished, or, if they wished, they would not give her in marriage at all, and they would be more entitled to dispose her, than her own relatives. So the above Verse was revealed in this connection.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 104:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Verse: &#8220;To everyone, We have appointed heirs.&#8221; (4.33) &#8216;Mawali&#8217; means heirs. And regarding:&#8211; &#8220;And those to whom your right hands have pledged.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Emigrants came to Medina, an Emigrant used to be the heir of an Ansari with the exclusion of the latter&#8217;s relatives, and that was because of the bond of brotherhood which the Prophet had established between them (i.e. the Emigrants and the Ansar). So when the Verses:&#8211; &#8220;To everyone We have appointed heirs.&#8221; was revealed, (the inheritance through bond of brotherhood) was cancelled. Ibn Abbas then said: &#8220;And those to whom your right hands have pledged.&#8221; is concerned with the covenant of helping and advising each other. So allies are no longer to be the heir of each other, but they can bequeath each other some of their property by means of a will.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the lifetime of the Prophet some people said, : O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall we see our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes; do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun at midday when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you have any difficulty in seeing the moon on a full moon night when it is bright and there is no cloud in the sky?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;(Similarly) you will have no difficulty in seeing Allah on the Day of Resurrection as you have no difficulty in seeing either of them. On the Day of Resurrection, a call-maker will announce, &#8220;Let every nation follow that which they used to worship.&#8221; Then none of those who used to worship anything other than Allah like idols and other deities but will fall in Hell (Fire), till there will remain none but those who used to worship Allah, both those who were obedient (i.e. good) and those who were disobedient (i.e. bad) and the remaining party of the people of the Scripture. Then the Jews will be called upon and it will be said to them, &#8216;Who do you use to worship?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We used to worship Ezra, the son of Allah.&#8217; It will be said to them, &#8216;You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son. What do you want now?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;O our Lord! We are thirsty, so give us something to drink.&#8217; They will be directed and addressed thus, &#8216;Will you drink,&#8217; whereupon they will be gathered unto Hell (Fire) which will look like a mirage whose different sides will be destroying each other. Then they will fall into the Fire. Afterwards the Christians will be called upon and it will be said to them, &#8216;Who do you use to worship?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;We used to worship Jesus, the son of Allah.&#8217; It will be said to them, &#8216;You are liars, for Allah has never taken anyone as a wife or a son,&#8217; Then it will be said to them, &#8216;What do you want?&#8217; They will say what the former people have said. Then, when there remain (in the gathering) none but those who used to worship Allah (Alone, the real Lord of the Worlds) whether they were obedient or disobedient. Then (Allah) the Lord of the worlds will come to them in a shape nearest to the picture they had in their minds about Him. It will be said, &#8216;What are you waiting for?&#8217; Every nation have followed what they used to worship.&#8217; They will reply, &#8216;We left the people in the world when we were in great need of them and we did not take them as friends. Now we are waiting for our Lord Whom we used to worship.&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;I am your Lord.&#8217; They will say twice or thrice, &#8216;We do not worship any besides Allah.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the water till it fills the land up to the walls and then let it flow to your neighbor.&#8221; So the Prophet enabled Az-Zubair to take his full right after the Ansari provoked his anger. The Prophet had previously given a order that was in favor of both of them Az-Zubair said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think but the Verse was revealed in this connection: &#8220;But no, by your Lord, they can have no faith, until they make you judge in all disputes between them.&#8221; (4.6)</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle stayed there to look for it, and so did the people along with him. Neither were they at a place of water, nor did they have any water with them. So the people went to Abu Bakr As-Siddiq and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see what &#8216;Aisha has done? She has made Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people, stay where there is no water and they have no water with them.&#8221; Abu Bakr came while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh. He said (to me), &#8220;You have detained Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people where there is no water, and they have no water with them.&#8221; So he admonished me and said what Allah wished him to say, and he hit me on my flanks with his hand. Nothing prevented me from moving (because of pain! but the position of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my thigh. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up when dawn broke and there was no water, so Allah revealed the Verse of Tayammum. Usaid bin Hudair said, &#8220;It is not the first blessing of yours, O the family of Abu Bakr.&#8221; Then we made the camel on which I was riding, got up, and found the necklace under it.</p>

Then the Prophet woke up and it was the time for the morning (prayer). Water was sought, but in vain; so the following Verse was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe! When you intend to offer prayer..&#8221; (5.6) Usaid bin Hudair said, &#8220;Allah has blessed the people for your sake, O the family of Abu Bakr. You are but a blessing for them.&#8221;</p>

So take them out and drink of their milk and urine.&#8217; So they took them and set out and drank of their urine and milk, and having recovered, they attacked the shepherd, killed him and drove away the camels.&#8217; Why should there be any delay in punishing them as they murdered (a person) and waged war against Allah and His Apostle and frightened Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; Anbasa said, &#8220;I testify the uniqueness of Allah!&#8221; Abu Qilaba said, &#8220;Do you suspect me?&#8221; &#8216;Anbasa said, &#8220;No, Anas narrated that (Hadith) to us.&#8221; Then &#8216;Anbasa added, &#8220;O the people of such-and-such (country), you will remain in good state as long as Allah keeps this (man) and the like of this (man) amongst you.&#8221;</p>

People (in the Pre-lslamic periods of ignorance) used to let that she camel loose for their idols if it gave birth to two she-camels successively without giving birth to a male camel in between. &#8216;Ham&#8217; was the male camel which was used for copulation. When it had finished the number of copulations assigned for it, they would let it loose for their idols and excuse it from burdens so that nothing would be carried on it, and they called it the &#8216;Hami.&#8217; Abu Huraira said, &#8220;I heard the Prophet saying so.&#8221;</p>

While I was passing by the Jews, I heard him saying, &#8216;By Him Who selected Moses above the human beings,&#8217; I said, &#8216;Even above Muhammad?&#8217; I became furious and slapped him on the face.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not give me superiority over the other prophets, for on the Day of Resurrection the people will become unconscious and I will be the first to regain consciousness. Then I will see Moses holding one of the legs of the Throne. I will not know whether he has come to his senses before me or that the shock he had received at the Mountain, (during his worldly life) was sufficient for him.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a dispute between Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, and Abu Bakr made Umar angry. So &#8216;Umar left angrily. Abu Bakr followed him, requesting him to ask forgiveness (of Allah) for him, but &#8216;Umar refused to do so and closed his door in Abu Bakr&#8217;s face. So Abu Bakr went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while we were with him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;This friend of yours must have quarrelled (with somebody).&#8221; In the meantime &#8216;Umar repented and felt sorry for what he had done, so he came, greeted (those who were present) and sat with the Prophet and related the story to him. Allah&#8217;s Apostle became angry and Abu Bakr started saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah, I was more at fault (than Umar).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Are you (people) leaving for me my companion? (Abu Bakr), Are you (people) leaving for me my companion? When I said, &#8216;O people I am sent to you all as the Apostle of Allah,&#8217; you said, &#8216;You tell a lie.&#8217; while Abu Bakr said, &#8216;You have spoken the truth .&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Uyaina bin Hisn bin Hudhaifa came and stayed with his nephew Al-Hurr bin Qais who was one of those whom &#8216;Umar used to keep near him, as the Qurra&#8217; (learned men knowing Qur&#8217;an by heart) were the people of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s meetings and his advisors whether they were old or young. &#8216;Uyaina said to his nephew, &#8220;O son of my brother! You have an approach to this chief, so get for me the permission to see him.&#8221; Al-Hurr said, &#8220;I will get the permission for you to see him.&#8221; So Al-Hurr asked the permission for &#8216;Uyaina and &#8216;Umar admitted him. When &#8216;Uyaina entered upon him, he said, &#8220;Beware! O the son of Al-Khattab! By Allah, you neither give us sufficient provision nor judge among us with justice.&#8221; Thereupon &#8216;Umar became so furious that he intended to harm him, but Al-Hurr said, &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Allah said to His Prophet: &#8220;Hold to forgiveness; command what is right; and leave (don&#8217;t punish) the foolish.&#8221; (7.199) and this (i.e. &#8216;Uyaina) is one of the foolish.&#8221; By Allah, &#8216;Umar did not overlook that Verse when Al-Hurr recited it before him; he observed (the orders of) Allah&#8217;s Book strictly.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Verse:&#8211; &#8220;If there are twenty steadfast amongst you, they will overcome two hundred.&#8221; (8.65) was revealed, then it became obligatory for the Muslims that one (Muslim) should not flee from ten (non-Muslims). Sufyan (the sub-narrator) once said, &#8220;Twenty (Muslims) should not flee before two hundred (non Muslims).&#8221; Then there was revealed: &#8216;But now Allah has lightened your (task)..&#8217; (8.66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it became obligatory that one-hundred (Muslims) should not flee before two hundred (non-muslims). (Once Sufyan said extra, &#8220;The Verse: &#8216;Urge the believers to the fight. If there are twenty steadfast amongst you (Muslims) ..&#8217; was revealed.)

So (Allah) lightened the order by revealing:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;(But) now Allah has lightened your (task) for He knows that there is weakness in you. So if there are of you one-hundred steadfast, they will overcome (two-hundred (non-Muslims).&#8217; (8.66) So when Allah reduced the number of enemies which Muslims should withstand, their patience and perseverance against the enemy decreased as much as their task was lightened for them.</p>

Allah ordained that Ibn Zubair and Bani Umaiya would permit (fighting in Mecca), but by Allah, I will never regard it as permissible.&#8221; Ibn Abbas added. &#8220;The people asked me to take the oath of allegiance to Ibn AzZubair. I said, &#8216;He is really entitled to assume authority for his father, Az-Zubair was the helper of the Prophet, his (maternal) grandfather, Abu Bakr was (the Prophet&#8217;s) companion in the cave, his mother, Asma&#8217; was &#8216;Dhatun-Nitaq&#8217;, his aunt, &#8216;Aisha was the mother of the Believers, his paternal aunt, Khadija was the wife of the Prophet , and the paternal aunt of the Prophet was his grandmother.

So I said, &#8220;I never expected that he would refuse my offer to support him, and I don&#8217;t think he intends to do me any good, therefore, if my cousins should inevitably be my rulers, it will be better for me to be ruled by them than by some others.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Umar bin Al-Khattab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul died, Allah&#8217;s Apostle was called in order to offer the funeral prayer for him. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up (to offer the prayer) I jumped towards him and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you offer the prayer for Ibn Ubai although he said so-and-so on such-and-such-a day?&#8221; I went on mentioning his sayings. Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled and said, &#8220;Keep away from me, O &#8216;Umar!&#8221; But when I spoke too much to him, he said, &#8220;I have been given the choice, and I have chosen (this) ; and if I knew that if I asked forgiveness for him more than seventy times, he would be for given, I would ask it for more times than that.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the funeral prayer for him and then left, but he did not stay long before the two Verses of Surat-Bara&#8217;a were revealed, i.e.:&#8211; &#8216;And never (O Muhammad) pray for anyone of them that dies&#8230;. and died in a state of rebellion.&#8217; (9.84) Later I was astonished at my daring to speak like that to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Allah and His Apostle know best.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin Ubai died, his son &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abdullah came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who gave his shirt to him and ordered him to shroud his father in it. Then he stood up to offer the funeral prayer for the deceased, but &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab took hold of his garment and said, &#8220;Do you offer the funeral prayer for him though he was a hypocrite and Allah has forbidden you to ask forgiveness for hypocrites?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah has given me the choice (or Allah has informed me) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whether you, O Muhammad, ask forgiveness for them, or do not ask forgiveness for them, even if you ask forgiveness for them seventy times, Allah will not forgive them,&#8221; (9.80) The he added, &#8220;I will (appeal to Allah for his sake) more than seventy times.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the funeral prayer for him and we too, offered the prayer along with him. Then Allah revealed: &#8220;And never, O Muhammad, pray (funeral prayer) for anyone of them that dies, nor stand at his grave. Certainly they disbelieved in Allah and His Apostle and died in a state of rebellion.&#8221; (9.84)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Tonight two (visitors) came to me (in my dream) and took me to a town built with gold bricks and silver bricks. There we met men who, half of their bodies, look like the most-handsome human beings you have ever seen, and the other half, the ugliest human beings you have ever seen. Those two visitors said to those men, &#8216;Go and dip yourselves in that river. So they dipped themselves therein and then came to us, their ugliness having disappeared and they were in the most-handsome shape. The visitors said, &#8216;The first is the Garden of Eden and that is your dwelling place.&#8217; Then they added, &#8216;As for those people who were half ugly and half handsome, they were those who mixed good deeds and bad deeds, but Allah forgave them.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abu Talib&#8217;s death approached, the Prophet went to him while Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya were present with him. The Prophet said, &#8220;O uncle, say: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, so that I may argue for your case with it before Allah.&#8221; On that, Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Umaiya said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! Do you want to renounce &#8216;Abdul Muttalib&#8217;s religion?&#8221; Then the Prophet said, &#8220;I will keep on asking (Allah for) forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so.&#8221; Then there was revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the Fire.&#8217; (9.113)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 199:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Kab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Ka&#8217;b bin Malik who was one of the three who were forgiven, saying that he had never remained behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any Ghazwa which he had fought except two Ghazwat Ghazwat-al&#8217;Usra (Tabuk) and Ghazwat-Badr. He added. &#8220;I decided to tell the truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the forenoon, and scarcely did he return from a journey he made, except in the forenoon, he would go first to the mosque and offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer. The Prophet forbade others to speak to me or to my two companions, but he did not prohibit speaking to any of those who had remained behind excepting us. So the people avoided speaking to us, and I stayed in that state till I could no longer bear it, and the only thing that worried me was that I might die and the Prophet would not offer the funeral prayer for me, or Allah&#8217;s Apostle might die and I would be left in that social status among the people that nobody would speak to me or offer the funeral prayer for me. But Allah revealed His Forgiveness for us to the Prophet in the last third of the night while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was with Um Salama. Um Salama sympathized with me and helped me in my disaster. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;O Um Salama! Ka&#8217;b has been forgiven!&#8217; She said, &#8216;Shall I send someone to him to give him the good tidings?&#8217; He said, &#8216;If you did so, the people would not let you sleep the rest of the night.&#8217; So when the Prophet had offered the Fajr prayer, he announced Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for us. His face used to look as bright as a piece of the (full) moon whenever he was pleased. When Allah revealed His Forgiveness for us, we were the three whose case had been deferred while the excuse presented by those who had apologized had been accepted. But when there were mentioned those who had told the Prophet lies and remained behind (the battle of Tabuk) and had given false excuses, they were described with the worse description one may be described with. Allah said: &#8216;They will present their excuses to you (Muslims) when you return to them. Say: Present no excuses; we shall not believe you. Allah has already informed us of the true state of matters concerning you. Allah and His Apostle will observe your actions.&#8221; (9.94)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Ka&#8217;b bin Malik talking about the story of the battle of Tabuk when he remained behind, &#8220;By Allah, I do not know anyone whom Allah has helped for telling the truth more than me since I mentioned that truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. And Allah revealed to His Apostle: &#8220;Verily! Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; and be with those who are true (in words and deeds).&#8221; (9.117-119) (See Hadith No. 702 Vol 5).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 201:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit Al-Ansari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">who was one of those who used to write the Divine Revelation: Abu Bakr sent for me after the (heavy) casualties among the warriors (of the battle) of Yamama (where a great number of Qurra&#8217; were killed). &#8216;Umar was present with Abu Bakr who said, &#8216;Umar has come to me and said, The people have suffered heavy casualties on the day of (the battle of) Yamama, and I am afraid that there will be more casualties among the Qurra&#8217; (those who know the Qur&#8217;an by heart) at other battle-fields, whereby a large part of the Qur&#8217;an may be lost, unless you collect it. And I am of the opinion that you should collect the Qur&#8217;an.&#8221; Abu Bakr added, &#8220;I said to &#8216;Umar, &#8216;How can I do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle has not done?&#8217; &#8216;Umar said (to me), &#8216;By Allah, it is (really) a good thing.&#8217; So &#8216;Umar kept on pressing, trying to persuade me to accept his proposal, till Allah opened my bosom for it and I had the same opinion as &#8216;Umar.&#8221; (Zaid bin Thabit added:) Umar was sitting with him (Abu Bakr) and was not speaking. me). &#8220;You are a wise young man and we do not suspect you (of telling lies or of forgetfulness): and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Therefore, look for the Qur&#8217;an and collect it (in one manuscript). &#8221; By Allah, if he (Abu Bakr) had ordered me to shift one of the mountains (from its place) it would not have been harder for me than what he had ordered me concerning the collection of the Qur&#8217;an. I said to both of them, &#8220;How dare you do a thing which the Prophet has not done?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah, it is (really) a good thing. So I kept on arguing with him about it till Allah opened my bosom for that which He had opened the bosoms of Abu Bakr and Umar. So I started locating Quranic material and collecting it from parchments, scapula, leaf-stalks of date palms and from the memories of men (who knew it by heart). I found with Khuzaima two Verses of Surat-at-Tauba which I had not found with anybody else, (and they were):&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily there has come to you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty He (Muhammad) is ardently anxious over you (to be rightly guided)&#8221; (9.128)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The manuscript on which the Quran was collected, remained with Abu Bakr till Allah took him unto Him, and then with &#8216;Umar till Allah took him unto Him, and finally it remained with Hafsa, Umar&#8217;s daughter.</p>

Its leaves do not fall and it does not, and does not, and does not, and it gives its fruits every now and then.&#8221; It came to my mind that such a tree must be the date palm, but seeing Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar saying nothing, I disliked to speak. So when they did not say anything, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It is the date-palm tree.&#8221; When we got up (from that place), I said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;O my father! By Allah, it came to my mind that it must be the date palm tree.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;What prevented you from speaking&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I did not see you speaking, so I misliked to speak or say anything.&#8221; Umar then said, &#8220;If you had said it, it would have been dearer to me than so-and-so.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;When Allah has ordained some affair in the Heaven, the angels beat with their wings in obedience to His statement, which sounds like a chain dragged over a rock.&#8221; (&#8216;Ali and other sub-narrators said, &#8220;The sound reaches them.&#8221;) &#8220;Until when fear is banished from their (angels) hearts, they (angels) say, &#8216;What was it that your Lord said? They say, &#8216;The truth; And He is the Most High, the Most Great.&#8217; (34.23) Then those who gain a hearing by stealing (i.e. devils) will hear Allah&#8217;s Statement:&#8211; &#8216;Those who gain a hearing by stealing, (stand one over the other like this).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Sufyan, to illustrate this, spread the fingers of his right hand and placed them one over the other horizontally.) A flame may overtake and burn the eavesdropper before conveying the news to the one below him; or it may not overtake him till he has conveyed it to the one below him, who in his turn, conveys it to the one below him, and so on till they convey the news to the earth. (Or probably Sufyan said, &#8220;Till the news reaches the earth.&#8221;) Then the news is inspired to a sorcerer who would add a hundred lies to it. His prophecy will prove true (as far as the heavenly news is concerned). The people will say. &#8216;Didn&#8217;t he tell us that on such-and-such a day, such-and-such a thing will happen? We have found that is true because of the true news heard from heaven.&#8221;</p>

He ate a morsel of it and said, &#8220;I will be the chief of all the people on the Day of Resurrection. Do you know the reason for it? Allah will gather all the human being of early generations as well as late generation on one plain so that the announcer will be able to make them all-hear his voice and the watcher will be able to see all of them. The sun will come so close to the people that they will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to bear or stand. Then the people will say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you see to what state you have reached? Won&#8217;t you look for someone who can intercede for you with your Lord&#8217; Some people will say to some others, &#8216;Go to Adam.&#8217; So they will go to Adam and say to him. &#8216;You are the father of mankind; Allah created you with His Own Hand, and breathed into you of His Spirit (meaning the spirit which he created for you); and ordered the angels to prostrate before you; so (please) intercede for us with your Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are? Don&#8217;t you see what condition we have reached?&#8217; Adam will say, &#8216;Today my Lord has become angry as He has never become before, nor will ever become thereafter. He forbade me (to eat of the fruit of) the tree, but I disobeyed Him . Myself! Myself! Myself! (has more need for intercession).

Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are?&#8217; He will say.&#8217; Today my Lord has become angry as He has never become nor will ever become thereafter. I had (in the world) the right to make one definitely accepted invocation, and I made it against my nation. Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Abraham.&#8217; They will go to Abraham and say, &#8216;O Abraham! You are Allah&#8217;s Apostle and His Khalil from among the people of the earth; so please intercede for us with your Lord.

You are Allah&#8217;s Apostle and His Word which He sent to Mary, and a superior soul created by Him, and you talked to the people while still young in the cradle. Please intercede for us with your Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are?&#8217; Jesus will say. &#8216;My Lord has today become angry as He has never become before nor will ever become thereafter. Jesus will not mention any sin, but will say, &#8216;Myself! Myself! Myself! Go to someone else; go to Muhammad.&#8217; So they will come to me and say, &#8216;O Muhammad ! You are Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the last of the prophets, and Allah forgave your early and late sins. (Please) intercede for us with your Lord. Don&#8217;t you see in what state we are?&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then I will go beneath Allah&#8217;s Throne and fall in prostration before my Lord. And then Allah will guide me to such praises and glorification to Him as He has never guided anybody else before me. Then it will be said, &#8216;O Muhammad Raise your head. Ask, and it will be granted. Intercede It (your intercession) will be accepted.&#8217; So I will raise my head and Say, &#8216;My followers, O my Lord! My followers, O my Lord&#8217;. It will be said, &#8216;O Muhammad! Let those of your followers who have no accounts, enter through such a gate of the gates of Paradise as lies on the right; and they will share the other gates with the people.&#8221; The Prophet further said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, the distance between every two gate-posts of Paradise is like the distance between Mecca and Busra (in Sham).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;Nauf Al-Bikali claims that Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir was not the Moses of the children of Israel&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;The enemy of Allah (Nauf) told a lie.&#8221; Narrated Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b that he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Moses got up to deliver a speech before the children of Israel and he was asked, Who is the most learned person among the people?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;I (am the most learned).&#8217; Allah admonished him for he did not ascribe knowledge to Allah alone. So Allah revealed to him: &#8216;At the junction of the two seas there is a slave of Ours who is more learned than you.&#8217; Moses asked, &#8216;O my Lord, how can I meet him?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Take a fish and put it in a basket (and set out), and where you, will lose the fish, you will find him.&#8217; So Moses (took a fish and put it in a basket and) set out, along with his boy-servant Yusha&#8217; bin Nun, till they reached a rock (on which) they both lay their heads and slept. The fish moved vigorously in the basket and got out of it and fell into the sea and there it took its way through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel). (18.61) Allah stopped the current of water on both sides of the way created by the fish, and so that way was like a tunnel. When Moses got up, his companion forgot to tell him about the fish, and so they carried on their journey during the rest of the day and the whole night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next morning Moses asked his boy-servant &#8216;Bring us our early meal; no doubt, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.&#8217; (18.62) Moses did not get tired till he had passed the place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy-servant then said to him,&#8217; &#8216;Do you remember when we be-took ourselves to the rock I indeed forgot the fish, none but Satan made me forget to remember it. It took its course into the sea in a marvelous way.&#8217; (18.63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a tunnel for the fish and for Moses and his boy-servant there was astonishment. Moses said, &#8216;That is what we have been seeking&#8217;. So they went back retracing their footsteps. (18.64) They both returned, retracing their steps till they reached the rock. Behold ! There they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. Al-Khadir said astonishingly. &#8216;Is there such a greeting in your land?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Are you the Moses of the children of Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I have come to you so that you may teach me of what you have been taught.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khadir said, &#8216;You will not be able to have patience with me. (18.66) O Moses! I have some of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He has bestowed upon me but you do not know it; and you too, have some of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He has bestowed upon you, but I do not know it.&#8221; Moses said, &#8220;Allah willing, you will find me patient, and I will not disobey you in anything.&#8217; (18.6) Al-Khadir said to him. &#8216;If you then follow me, do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.&#8217; (18.70), After that both of them proceeded along the sea coast, till a boat passed by and they requested the crew to let them go on board. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and allowed them to get on board free of charge. When they got on board suddenly Moses saw that Al-Khadir had pulled out one of the planks of the boat with an adze. Moses said to him.&#8217; These people gave us a free lift, yet you have scuttled their boat so as to drown its people! Truly, you have done a dreadful thing.&#8217; (18.71)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I say that you can have no patience with me ?&#8217; (18.72) Moses said, &#8216;Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you.)&#8221; (18.73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The first excuse given by Moses, was that he had forgotten. Then a sparrow came and sat over the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once in the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, &#8216;My knowledge and your knowledge, compared to Allah&#8217;s knowledge is like what this sparrow has taken out of the sea.&#8217; Then they both got out of the boat, and while they were walking on the sea shore, Al-Khadir saw a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir got hold of the head of that boy and pulled it out with his hands and killed him. Moses said, &#8216;Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed nobody! Truly, you have done an illegal thing.&#8217; (18.74) He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you that you can have no patience with me?&#8217; (18.75) (The sub narrator said, the second blame was stronger than the first one.) Moses said, &#8216;If I ask you about anything after this, keep me not in your company, you have received an excuse from me.&#8217; (18.76)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they both proceeded until they came to the inhabitants of a town. They asked them food but they refused to entertain them. (In that town) they found there a wall on the point of falling down. (18.77) Al-Khadir set it up straight with his own hands. Moses said, &#8216;These are people to whom we came, but they neither fed us nor received us as guests. If you had wished, you could surely have exacted some recompense for it. Al-Khadir said, &#8216;This is the parting between me and you ..that is the interpretation of (those things) over which you were unable to hold patience.&#8217; (18.78-82)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that Allah might have described to us more about their story.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 250:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Juraij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ya&#8217;la bin Muslim and &#8216;Amr bin Dinar and some others narrated the narration of Said bin Jubair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said: While we were at the house of Ibn &#8216;Abbas, Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Ask me (any question)&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Abu Abbas! May Allah let me be sacrificed for you ! There is a man at Kufa who is a story-teller called Nauf; who claims that he (Al-Khadir&#8217;s companion) is not Moses of Bani Israel.&#8221; As for &#8216;Amr, he said to me, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;(Nauf) the enemy of Allah told a lie.&#8221; But Ya&#8217;la said to me, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Once Moses, Allah&#8217;s Apostle, preached to the people till their eyes shed tears and their hearts became tender, whereupon he finished his sermon. Then a man came to Moses and asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is there anyone on the earth who is more learned than you?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; So Allah admonished him (Moses), for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah. It was said, (on behalf of Allah), &#8216;Yes, (there is a slave of ours who knows more than you ).&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord! Where is he?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;At the junction of the two seas.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord ! Tell I me of a sign whereby I will recognize the place.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Amr said to me, Allah said, &#8220;That place will be where the fish will leave you.&#8221; Ya&#8217;la said to me, &#8220;Allah said (to Moses), &#8216;Take a dead fish (and your goal will be) the place where it will become alive.&#8217; &#8221; So Moses took a fish and put it in a basket and said to his boy-servant &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to trouble you, except that you should inform me as soon as this fish leaves you.&#8221; He said (to Moses).&#8221; You have not demanded too much.&#8221; And that is as mentioned by Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And (remember) when Moses said to his attendant &#8230;. &#8216; (18.60) Yusha&#8217; bin Nun. (Said did not state that). The Prophet said, &#8220;While the attendant was in the shade of the rock at a wet place, the fish slipped out (alive) while Moses was sleeping. His attend an said (to himself), &#8220;I will not wake him, but when he woke up, he forgot to tell him The fish slipped out and entered the sea. Allah stopped the flow of the sea. where the fish was, so that its trace looked as if it was made on a rock. &#8216;Amr forming a hole with his two thumbs an index fingers, said to me, &#8220;Like this, as in its trace was made on a rock.&#8221; Moses said &#8220;We have suffered much fatigue on this journey of ours.&#8221; (This was not narrate by Said). Then they returned back and found Al-Khadir. &#8216;Uthman bin Abi Sulaiman said to me, (they found him) on a green carpet in the middle of the sea. Al-Khadir was covered with his garment with one end under his feet and the other end under his head. When Moses greeted, he uncovered his face and said astonishingly, &#8216;Is there such a greeting in my land? Who are you?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Are you the Moses of Bani Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8220;What do you want?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216; I came to you so that you may teach me of the truth which you were taught.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Is it not sufficient for you that the Torah is in your hands and the Divine Inspiration comes to you, O Moses? Verily, I have a knowledge that you ought not learn, and you have a knowledge which I ought not learn.&#8217; At that time a bird took with its beak (some water) from the sea: Al-Khadir then said, &#8216;By Allah, my knowledge and your knowledge besides Allah&#8217;s Knowledge is like what this bird has taken with its beak from the sea.&#8217; Until, when they went on board the boat (18.71). They found a small boat which used to carry the people from this sea-side to the other sea-side. The crew recognized Al-Khadir and said, &#8216;The pious slave of Allah.&#8217; (We said to Said &#8220;Was that Khadir?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;) The boat men said, &#8216;We will not get him on board with fare.&#8217; Al-Khadir scuttled the boat and then plugged the hole with a piece o wood. Moses said, &#8216;Have you scuttle it in order to drown these people surely, you have done a dreadful thing. (18.71) (Mujahid said. &#8220;Moses said so protestingly.&#8221;) Al-Khadir said, didn&#8217;t I say that you can have no patience with me?&#8217; (18.72) The first inquiry of Moses was done because of forget fullness, the second caused him to be bound with a stipulation, and the third was done he intentionally. Moses said, &#8216;Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for my affair (with you).&#8217; (18.73)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Then) they found a boy and Al-Khadir killed him. Ya&#8217;la- said: Said said &#8216;They found boys playing and Al-Khadir got hold of a handsome infidel boy laid him down and then slew him with knife. Moses said, &#8216;Have you killed a innocent soul who has killed nobody&#8217; (18.74) Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the point of falling down, and Al-Khadir set it up straight Said moved his hand thus and said &#8216;Al-Khadir raised his hand and the wall became straight. Ya&#8217;la said, &#8216;I think Said said, &#8216;Al-Khadir touched the wall with his hand and it became straight (Moses said to Al-Khadir), &#8216;If you had wished, you could have taken wages for it. Said said, &#8216;Wages that we might had eaten.&#8217; And there was a king in furor (ahead) of them&#8221; (18.79) And there was in front of them. Ibn &#8216;Abbas recited: &#8216;In front of them (was) a king.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said on the authority of somebody other than Said that the king was Hudad bin Budad. They say that the boy was called Haisur. &#8216;A king who seized every ship by force. (18.79) So I wished that if that boat passed by him, he would leave it because of its defect and when they have passed they would repair it and get benefit from it. Some people said that they closed that hole with a bottle, and some said with tar. &#8216;His parents were believers, and he (the boy) was a non-believer and we(Khadir) feared lest he would oppress them by obstinate rebellion and disbelief.&#8217; (18.80) (i.e. that their love for him would urge them to follow him in his religion, &#8216;so we (Khadir) desired that their Lord should change him for them for one better in righteousness and near to mercy&#8217; (18:81). This was in reply to Moses&#8217; saying: Have you killed an innocent soul.&#8217;? (18.74). &#8216;Near to mercy&#8221; means they will be more merciful to him than they were to the former whom Khadir had killed. Other than Sa&#8217;id, said that they were compensated with a girl. Dawud bin Abi &#8216;Asim said on the authority of more than one that this next child was a girl.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 251:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;Nauf-al-Bakali &#8221; claims that Moses of Bani Israel was not Moses, the companion of Al-Khadir.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s enemy tells a lie! Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b narrated to us that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Moses got up to deliver a sermon before Bani Israel and he was asked, &#8216;Who is the most learned person among the people?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;I (am the most learned).&#8217; Allah then admonished Moses for he did not ascribe all knowledge to Allah only (Then) came the Divine Inspiration:&#8211; &#8216;Yes, one of Our slaves at the junction of the two seas is more learned than you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord ! How can meet him?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Take a fish in a basket and wherever the fish is lost, follow it (you will find him at that place). So Moses set out along with his attendant Yusha&#8217; bin Nun, and they carried with them a fish till they reached a rock and rested there. Moses put his head down and slept. (Sufyan, a sub-narrator said that somebody other than &#8216;Amr said) &#8216;At the rock there was a water spring called &#8216;Al-Hayat&#8217; and none came in touch with its water but became alive. So some of the water of that spring fell over that fish, so it moved and slipped out of the basket and entered the sea. When Moses woke up, he asked his attendant, &#8216;Bring our early meal&#8217; (18.62).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narrator added: Moses did not suffer from fatigue except after he had passed the place he had been ordered to observe. His attendant Yusha bin Nun said to him, &#8216;Do you remember (what happened) when we betook ourselves to the rock? I did indeed forget (about) the fish &#8230;&#8217; (18.63) The narrator added: So they came back, retracing their steps and then they found in the sea, the way of the fish looking like a tunnel. So there was an astonishing event for his attendant, and there was tunnel for the fish. When they reached the rock, they found a man covered with a garment. Moses greeted him. The man said astonishingly, &#8216;Is there any such greeting in your land?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; The man said, &#8216;Moses of Bani Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Yes,&#8217; and added, &#8216;may I follow you so that you teach me something of the Knowledge which you have been taught?&#8217; (18.66). Al-Khadir said to him, &#8216;O Moses! You have something of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which Allah has taught you and which I do not know; and I have something of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which Allah has taught me and which you do not know.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;But I will follow you.&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;Then if you follow me, ask me no question about anything until I myself speak to you concerning it.&#8217; (18.70). After that both of them proceeded along the seashore. There passed by them a boat whose crew recognized Al-Khadir and received them on board free of charge. So they both got on board. A sparrow came and sat on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak unto the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses. &#8216;My knowledge and your knowledge and all the creation&#8217;s knowledge compared to Allah&#8217;s knowledge is not more than the water taken by this sparrow&#8217;s beak.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Moses was startled by Al-Khadir&#8217;s action of taking an adze and scuttling the boat with it. Moses said to him, &#8216;These people gave us a free lift, but you intentionally scuttled their boat so as to drown them. Surely you have&#8230;&#8217; (18.71) Then they both proceeded and found a boy playing with other boys. Al-Khadir took hold of him by the head and cut it off. Moses said to him, &#8216;Have you killed an innocent soul who has killed nobody? Surely you have done an illegal thing! &#8216; (18.74) He said, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you that you will not be able to have patient with me up to ..but they refused to entertain them as their guests. There they found a wall therein at the point of collapsing.&#8217; (18.75-77) Al-Khadir moved his hand thus and set it upright (repaired it). Moses said to him, &#8216;When we entered this town, they neither gave us hospitality nor fed us; if you had wished, you could have taken wages for it,&#8217; Al-Khadir said, &#8216;This is the parting between you and me I will tell you the interpretation of (those things) about which you were unable to hold patience.&#8217;&#8230;(18.78)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;We wished that Moses could have been more patient so that He (Allah) could have described to us more about their story.&#8217; Ibn &#8216;Abbas used to recite:&#8211; &#8216;And in front (ahead) of them there was a king who used to seize every (serviceable) boat by force. (18.79) &#8230;and as for the boy he was a disbeliever. &#8220;</p>

Then it (that ram) will be slaughtered and the caller will say, &#8216;O people of Paradise! Eternity for you and no death O people of Hell! Eternity for you and no death.&#8221;&#8216; Then the Prophet, recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;And warn them of the Day of distress when the case has been decided, while (now) they are in a state of carelessness (i.e. the people of the world) and they do not believe.&#8217; (19.39)</p>

Who are the mission for the (Hell) Fire?&#8217; Allah will say, &#8216;Out of each thousand, take out 999.&#8217; At that time every pregnant female shall drop her load (have a miscarriage) and a child will have grey hair. And you shall see mankind as in a drunken state, yet not drunk, but severe will be the torment of Allah.&#8221; (22.2) (When the Prophet mentioned this), the people were so distressed (and afraid) that their faces got changed (in color) whereupon the Prophet said, &#8220;From Gog and Magog nine-hundred ninety-nine will be taken out and one from you. You Muslims (compared to the large number of other people) will be like a black hair on the side of a white ox, or a white hair on the side of a black ox, and I hope that you will be one-fourth of the people of Paradise.&#8221; On that, we said, &#8220;Allahu-Akbar!&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;I hope that you will be) one-third of the people of Paradise.&#8221; We again said, &#8220;Allahu-Akbar!&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;(I hope that you will be) one-half of the people of Paradise.&#8221; So we said, Allahu Akbar.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Uwaimir came to &#8216;Asim bin &#8216;Adi who was the chief of Bani Ajlan and said, &#8220;What do you say about a man who has found another man with his wife? Should he kill him whereupon you would kill him (i.e. the husband), or what should he do? Please ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about this matter on my behalf.&#8221; Asim then went to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (And asked him that question) but Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked the question,&#8221; When &#8216;Uwaimir asked &#8216;Asim (about the Prophet&#8217;s answer) &#8216;Asim replied that Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked such questions and considered it shameful. &#8220;Uwaimir then said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not give up asking unless I ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it.&#8221; Uwaimir came (to the Prophet ) and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! A man has found another man with his wife! Should he kill him whereupon you would kill him (the husband, in Qisas) or what should he do?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has revealed regarding you and your wife&#8217;s case in the Qur&#8217;an &#8220;So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered them to perform the measures of Mula&#8217;ana according to what Allah had mentioned in His Book. So &#8216;Uwaimir did Mula&#8217;ana with her and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I kept her I would oppress her.&#8221; So &#8216;Uwaimir divorced her and so divorce became a tradition after them for those who happened to be involved in a case of Mula&#8217;ana. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;Look! If she (Uwaimir&#8217;s wife) delivers a black child with deep black large eyes, big hips and fat legs, then I will be of the opinion that &#8216;Uwaimir has spoken the truth; but if she delivers a red child looking like a Wahra then we will consider that &#8216;Uwaimir has told a lie against her.&#8221; Later on she delivered a child carrying the qualities which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had mentioned as a proof for &#8216;Uwaimir&#8217;s claim; therefore the child was ascribed to its mother henceforth.</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to the man, &#8220;The matter between you and your wife has been decided.&#8221; So they did Mula&#8217;ana in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I was present there, and then the man divorced his wife. So it became a tradition to dissolve the marriage of those spouses who were involved in a case of Mula&#8217;ana. The woman was pregnant and the husband denied that he was the cause of her pregnancy, so the son was (later) ascribed to her. Then it became a tradition that such a son would be the heir of his mother, and she would inherit of him what Allah prescribed for her.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hilal bin Umaiya accused his wife of committing illegal sexual intercourse with Sharik bin Sahma&#8217; and filed the case before the Prophet. The Prophet said (to Hilal), &#8220;Either you bring forth a proof (four witnesses) or you will receive the legal punishment (lashes) on your back.&#8221; Hilal said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If anyone of us saw a man over his wife, would he go to seek after witnesses?&#8221; The Prophet kept on saying, &#8220;Either you bring forth the witnesses or you will receive the legal punishment (lashes) on your back.&#8221; Hilal then said, &#8220;By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I am telling the truth and Allah will reveal to you what will save my back from legal punishment.&#8221; Then Gabriel came down and revealed to him:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;As for those who accuse their wives&#8230;&#8217; (24.6-9) The Prophet recited it till he reached: &#8216;&#8230; (her accuser) is telling the truth.&#8217; Then the Prophet left and sent for the woman, and Hilal went (and brought) her and then took the oaths (confirming the claim). The Prophet was saying, &#8220;Allah knows that one of you is a liar, so will any of you repent?&#8221; Then the woman got up and took the oaths and when she was going to take the fifth one, the people stopped her and said, &#8220;It (the fifth oath) will definitely bring Allah&#8217;s curse on you (if you are guilty).&#8221; So she hesitated and recoiled (from taking the oath) so much that we thought that she would withdraw her denial. But then she said, &#8220;I will not dishonor my family all through these days,&#8221; and carried on (the process of taking oaths). The Prophet then said, &#8220;Watch her; if she delivers a black-eyed child with big hips and fat shins then it is Sharik bin Sahma&#8217;s child.&#8221; Later she delivered a child of that description. So the Prophet said, &#8220;If the case was not settled by Allah&#8217;s Law, I would punish her severely.&#8221;</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 274:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The wife of the Prophet) Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to go on a journey, he used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot had fallen. Once he drew lots when he wanted to carry out a Ghazwa, and the lot came upon me. So I proceeded with Allah&#8217;s Apostle after Allah&#8217;s order of veiling (the women) had been revealed and thus I was carried in my howdah (on a camel) and dismounted while still in it. We carried on our journey, and when Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished his Ghazwa and returned and we approached Medina, Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered to proceed at night. When the army was ordered to resume the homeward journey, I got up and walked on till I left the army (camp) behind. When I had answered the call of nature, I went towards my howdah, but behold ! A necklace of mine made of Jaz Azfar (a kind of black bead) was broken and I looked for it and my search for it detained me. The group of people who used to carry me, came and carried my howdah on to the back of my camel on which I was riding, considering that I was therein. At that time women were light in weight and were not fleshy for they used to eat little (food), so those people did not feel the lightness of the howdah while raising it up, and I was still a young lady. They drove away the camel and proceeded. Then I found my necklace after the army had gone. I came to their camp but found nobody therein so I went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would miss me and come back in my search. While I was sitting at my place, I felt sleepy and slept. Safwan bin Al-Mu&#8217;attil As-Sulami Adh-Dhakw-ani was behind the army. He had started in the last part of the night and reached my stationing place in the morning and saw the figure of a sleeping person. He came to me and recognized me on seeing me for he used to see me before veiling. I got up because of his saying: &#8220;Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,&#8221; which he uttered on recognizing me. I covered my face with my garment, and by Allah, he did not say to me a single word except, &#8220;Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi rajiun,&#8221; till he made his she-camel kneel down whereupon he trod on its forelegs and I mounted it. Then Safwan set out, leading the she-camel that was carrying me, till we met the army while they were resting during the hot midday. Then whoever was meant for destruction, fell in destruction, and the leader of the Ifk (forged statement) was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After this we arrived at Medina and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged statements of the people of the Ifk, and I was not aware of anything thereof. But what aroused my doubt while I was sick, was that I was no longer receiving from Allah&#8217;s Apostle the same kindness as I used to receive when I fell sick. Allah&#8217;s Apostle would enter upon me, say a greeting and add, &#8220;How is that (lady)?&#8221; and then depart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That aroused my suspicion but I was not aware of the propagated evil till I recovered from my ailment. I went out with Um Mistah to answer the call of nature towards Al-Manasi, the place where we used to relieve ourselves, and used not to go out for this purpose except from night to night, and that was before we had lavatories close to our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old &#8216;Arabs (in the deserts or in the tents) concerning the evacuation of the bowels, for we considered it troublesome and harmful to take lavatories in the houses. So I went out with Um Mistah who was the daughter of Abi Ruhm bin Abd Manaf, and her mother was daughter of Sakhr bin Amir who was the aunt of Abi Bakr As-Siddiq, and her son was Mistah bin Uthatha. When we had finished our affair, Um Mistah and I came back towards my house. Um Mistah stumbled over her robe whereupon she said, &#8220;Let Mistah be ruined ! &#8221; I said to her, &#8220;What a bad word you have said! Do you abuse a man who has taken part in the Battle of Badr?&#8217; She said, &#8220;O you there! Didn&#8217;t you hear what he has said?&#8221; I said, &#8220;And what did he say?&#8221; She then told me the statement of the people of the Ifk (forged statement) which added to my ailment. When I returned home, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me, and after greeting, he said, &#8220;How is that (lady)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Will you allow me to go to my parents?&#8221; At that time I intended to be sure of the news through them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me and I went to my parents and asked my mother, &#8220;O my mother! What are the people talking about?&#8221; My mother said, &#8220;O my daughter! Take it easy, for by Allah, there is no charming lady who is loved by her husband who has other wives as well, but that those wives would find fault with her.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! Did the people really talk about that?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That night I kept on weeping the whole night till the morning. My tears never stopped, nor did I sleep, and morning broke while I was still weeping, Allah&#8217;s Apostle called &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib and Usama bin Zaid when the Divine Inspiration delayed, in order to consult them as to the idea of divorcing his wife. Usama bin Zaid told Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what he knew about the innocence of his wife and of his affection he kept for her. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! She is your wife, and we do not know anything about her except good.&#8221; But &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah does not impose restrictions on you; and there are plenty of women other than her. If you however, ask (her) slave girl, she will tell you the truth.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added: So Allah&#8217;s Apostle called for Barira and said, &#8220;O Barira! Did you ever see anything which might have aroused your suspicion? (as regards Aisha). Barira said, &#8220;By Allah Who has sent you with the truth, I have never seen anything regarding Aisha which I would blame her for except that she is a girl of immature age who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough of her family unprotected so that the domestic goats come and eat it.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up (and addressed) the people an asked for somebody who would take revenge on &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul then. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, while on the pulpit, said, &#8220;O Muslims! Who will help me against a man who has hurt me by slandering my family? By Allah, I know nothing except good about my family, and people have blamed a man of whom I know nothing except good, and he never used to visit my family except with me,&#8221; Sad bin Muadh Al-Ansari got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah, I will relieve you from him. If he be from the tribe of (Bani) Al-Aus, then I will chop his head off; and if he be from our brethren, the Khazraj, then you give us your order and we will obey it.&#8221; On that, Sad bin &#8216;Ubada got up, and he was the chief of the Khazraj, and before this incident he had been a pious man but he was incited by his zeal for his tribe. He said to Sad (bin Muadh), &#8220;By Allah the Eternal, you have told a lie! You shall not kill him and you will never be able to kill him!&#8221; On that, Usaid bin Hudair, the cousin of Sad (bin Muadh) got up and said to Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, &#8220;You are a liar! By Allah the Eternal, we will surely kill him; and you are a hypocrite defending the hypocrites!&#8221; So the two tribes of Al-Aus and Al-Khazraj got excited till they were on the point of fighting with each other while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was standing on the pulpit. Allah&#8217;s Apostle continued quietening them till they became silent whereupon he became silent too. On that day I kept on weeping so much that neither did my tears stop, nor could I sleep. In the morning my parents were with me, and I had wept for two nights and a day without sleeping and with incessant tears till they thought that my liver would burst with weeping. While they were with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked permission to see me. I admitted her and she sat and started weeping with me. While I was in that state, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to us, greeted, and sat down,. He had never sat with me since the day what was said, was said. He had stayed a month without receiving any Divine Inspiration concerning my case. Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited the Tashahhud after he had sat down, and then said, &#8220;Thereafter, O &#8216;Aisha! I have been informed such and-such a thing about you; and if you are innocent, Allah will reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin, then ask for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness and repent to Him, for when a slave confesses his sin and then repents to Allah, Allah accepts his repentance.&#8221; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished his speech, my tears ceased completely so that I no longer felt even a drop thereof. Then I said to my father, &#8220;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf as to what he said.&#8221; He said, &#8220;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Then I said to my mother, &#8220;Reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Still a young girl as I was and though I had little knowledge of Quran, I said, &#8220;By Allah, I know that you heard this story (of the Ifk) so much so that it has been planted in your minds and you have believed it. So now, if I tell you that I am innocent, and Allah knows that I am innocent, you will not believe me; and if I confess something, and Allah knows that I am innocent of it, you will believe me. By Allah, I cannot find of you an example except that of Joseph&#8217;s father: &#8220;So (for me) patience is most fitting against that which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) Whose help can be sought. Then I turned away and lay on my bed, and at that time I knew that I was innocent and that Allah would reveal my innocence. But by Allah, I never thought that Allah would sent down about my affair, Divine Inspiration that would be recited (forever), as I considered myself too unworthy to be talked of by Allah with something that was to be recited: but I hoped that Allah&#8217;s Apostle might have a vision in which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not left his seat and nobody had left the house when the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . So there overtook him the same hard condition which used to overtake him (when he was Divinely Inspired) so that the drops of his sweat were running down, like pearls, though it was a (cold) winter day, and that was because of the heaviness of the Statement which was revealed to him. When that state of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was over, and he was smiling when he was relieved, the first word he said was, &#8220;Aisha, Allah has declared your innocence.&#8221; My mother said to me, &#8220;Get up and go to him.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not go to him and I will not thank anybody but Allah.&#8221; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily! They who spread the Slander are a gang among you. Think it not&#8230;.&#8221; (24.11-20).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah revealed this to confirm my innocence, Abu Bakr As-Siddiq who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha because of the latter&#8217;s kinship to him and his poverty, said, &#8220;By Allah, I will never provide for Mistah anything after what he has said about Aisha&#8221;. So Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Let not those among you who are good and are wealthy swear not to give (help) to their kinsmen, those in need, and those who have left their homes for Allah&#8217;s Cause. Let them Pardon and forgive (i.e. do not punish them). Do you not love that should forgive you? Verily Allah is Oft-forgiving. Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Yes, by Allah, I wish that Allah should forgive me.&#8221; So he resumed giving Mistah the aid he used to give him before and said, &#8220;By Allah, I will never withold it from him at all.&#8221; Aisha further said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh about my case. He said, &#8220;O Zainab! What have you seen?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I protect my hearing and my sight (by refraining from telling lies). I know nothing but good (about Aisha).&#8221; Of all the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, it was Zainab who aspired to receive from him the same favor as I used to receive, yet, Allah saved her (from telling lies) because of her piety. But her sister, Hamna, kept on fighting on her behalf so she was destroyed as were those who invented and spread the slander.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">She said, &#8220;What punishment is worse than blindness?&#8221; She added, &#8220;And he used to defend Allah&#8217;s Apostle against the pagans (in his poetry).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 281:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When there was said about me what was said which I myself was unaware of, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and addressed the people. He recited Tashah-hud, and after glorifying and praising Allah as He deserved, he said, &#8220;To proceed: O people Give me your opinion regarding those people who made a forged story against my wife. By Allah, I do not know anything bad about her. By Allah, they accused her of being with a man about whom I have never known anything bad, and he never entered my house unless I was present there, and whenever I went on a journey, he went with me.&#8221; Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle Allow me to chop their heads off&#8221; Then a man from the Al-Khazraj (Sa&#8217;d bin &#8216;Ubada) to whom the mother of (the poet) Hassan bin Thabit was a relative, got up and said (to Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh), &#8220;You have told a lie! By Allah, if those persons were from the Aus Tribe, you would not like to chop their heads off.&#8221; It was probable that some evil would take place between the Aus and the Khazraj in the mosque, and I was unaware of all that. In the evening of that day, I went out for some of my needs (i.e. to relieve myself), and Um Mistah was accompanying me. On our return, Um Mistah stumbled and said, &#8220;Let Mistah. be ruined&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;O mother Why do you abuse your Son&#8221; On that Um Mistah became silent for a while, and stumbling again, she said, &#8220;Let Mistah be ruined&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;Why do you abuse your son?&#8221; She stumbled for the third time and said, &#8220;Let Mistah be ruined&#8221; whereupon I rebuked her for that. She said, &#8220;By Allah, I do not abuse him except because of you.&#8221; I asked her, &#8220;Concerning what of my affairs?&#8221; So she disclosed the whole story to me. I said, &#8220;Has this really happened?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Yes, by Allah.&#8221; I returned to my house, astonished (and distressed) that I did not know for what purpose I had gone out. Then I became sick (fever) and said to Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Send me to my father&#8217;s house.&#8221; So he sent a slave with me, and when I entered the house, I found Um Rum-an (my mother) downstairs while (my father) Abu Bakr was reciting something upstairs. My mother asked, &#8220;What has brought you, O (my) daughter?&#8221; I informed her and mentioned to her the whole story, but she did not feel it as I did. She said, &#8220;O my daughter! Take it easy, for there is never a charming lady loved by her husband who has other wives but that they feel jealous of her and speak badly of her.&#8221; But she did not feel the news as I did. I asked (her), &#8220;Does my father know about it?&#8221; She said, &#8220;yes&#8221; I asked, Does Allah&#8217;s Apostle know about it too?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, Allah&#8217;s Apostle does too.&#8221; So the tears filled my eyes and I wept. Abu Bakr, who was reading upstairs heard my voice and came down and asked my mother, &#8220;What is the matter with her? &#8221; She said, &#8220;She has heard what has been said about her (as regards the story of Al-lfk).&#8221; On that Abu- Bakr wept and said, &#8220;I beseech you by Allah, O my daughter, to go back to your home&#8221; I went back to my home and Allah&#8217;s Apostle had come to my house and asked my maid-servant about me (my character). The maid-servant said, &#8220;By Allah, I do not know of any defect in her character except that she sleeps and let the sheep enter (her house) and eat her dough.&#8221; On that, some of the Prophet&#8217;s companions spoke harshly to her and said, &#8220;Tell the truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Finally they told her of the affair (of the slander). She said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! By Allah, I know nothing against her except what goldsmith knows about a piece of pure gold.&#8221; Then this news reached the man who was accused, and he said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! By Allah, I have never uncovered the private parts of any woman.&#8221; Later that man was martyred in Allah&#8217;s Cause. Next morning my parents came to pay me a visit and they stayed with me till Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me after he had offered the Asr prayer. He came to me while my parents were sitting around me on my right and my left. He praised and glorified Allah and said, &#8220;Now then O &#8216;Aisha! If you have committed a bad deed or you have wronged (yourself), then repent to Allah as Allah accepts the repentance from his slaves.&#8221; An Al-Ansari woman had come and was sitting near the gate. I said (to the Prophet). &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it improper that you speak in such a way in the presence of this lady? Allah&#8217;s Apostle then gave a piece of advice and I turned to my father and requested him to answer him (on my behalf). My father said, &#8220;What should I say?&#8221; Then I turned to my mother and asked her to answer him. She said, &#8220;What should I say?&#8221; When my parents did not give a reply to the Prophet, I said, &#8220;I testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle!&#8221; And after praising and glorifying Allah as He deserves, I said, &#8220;Now then, by Allah, if I were to tell you that I have not done (this evil action) and Allah is a witness that I am telling the truth, that would not be of any use to me on your part because you (people) have spoken about it and your hearts have absorbed it; and if I were to tell you that I have done this sin and Allah knows that I have not done it, then you will say, &#8216;She has confessed herself guilty.&#8221; By Allah, &#8216;I do not see a suitable example for me and you but the example of (I tried to remember Jacob&#8217;s name but couldn&#8217;t) Joseph&#8217;s father when he said; So (for me) &#8220;Patience is most fitting against that which you assert. It is Allah (alone) whose help can be sought.&#8217; At that very hour the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and we remained silent. Then the Inspiration was over and I noticed the signs of happiness on his face while he was removing (the sweat) from his forehead and saying, &#8220;Have the good tidings O &#8216; &#8220;Aisha! Allah has revealed your innocence.&#8221; At that time I was extremely angry. My parents said to me. &#8220;Get up and go to him.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not do it and will not thank him nor thank either of you, but I will thank Allah Who has revealed my innocence. You have heard this story but neither did not deny it nor change it (to defend me),&#8221; (Aisha used to say:) &#8220;But as regards Zainab bint Jahsh, (the Prophet&#8217;s wife), Allah protected her because of her piety, so she did not say anything except good (about me), but her sister, Hamna, was ruined among those who were ruined. Those who used to speak evil about me were Mistah, Hassan bin Thabit, and the hypocrite, Abdullah bin Ubai, who used to spread that news and tempt others to speak of it, and it was he and Hamna who had the greater share therein. Abu Bakr took an oath that he would never do any favor to Mistah at all. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Let not those among you who are good and wealthy (i.e. Abu Bakr) swear not to give (any sort of help) to their kinsmen, and those in need, (i.e. Mistah) &#8230;Do you not love that Allah should forgive you? And Allah if Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On that, Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Yes, by Allah, O our Lord! We wish that You should forgive us.&#8221; So Abu Bakr again started giving to Mistah the expenditure which he used to give him before.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;.. this reward is Hell Fire.&#8217; (4.93) He said, &#8220;No repentance is accepted from him (i.e. the murderer of a believer).&#8221; I asked him regarding the saying of Allah:</p>

Abu Lahab and other people from Quraish came and the Prophet then said, &#8220;Suppose I told you that there is an (enemy) cavalry in the valley intending to attack you, would you believe me?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes, for we have not found you telling anything other than the truth.&#8221; He then said, &#8220;I am a warner to you in face of a terrific punishment.&#8221; Abu Lahab said (to the Prophet) &#8220;May your hands perish all this day.

Say: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, a sentence with which I will defend you before Allah.&#8221; On that Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya said to Abu Talib, &#8220;Will you now leave the religion of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on inviting him to say that sentence while the other two kept on repeating their sentence before him till Abu Talib said as the last thing he said to them, &#8220;I am on the religion of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib,&#8221; and refused to say: None has the right to be worshipped except Allah. On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Allah, I will keep on asking Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden (by Allah) to do so.&#8221; So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans.&#8217; (9.113) And then Allah revealed especially about Abu Talib:&#8211;&#8216;Verily!

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Masruq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While a man was delivering a speech in the tribe of Kinda, he said, &#8220;Smoke will prevail on the Day of Resurrection and will deprive the hypocrites their faculties of hearing and seeing. The believers will be afflicted with something like cold only thereof.&#8221; That news scared us, so I went to (Abdullah) Ibn Mas&#8217;ud while he was reclining (and told him the story) whereupon he became angry, sat up and said, &#8220;He who knows a thing can say, it, but if he does not know, he should say, &#8216;Allah knows best,&#8217; for it is an aspect of knowledge to say, &#8216;I do not know,&#8217; if you do not know a certain thing. Allah said to His prophet. &#8216;Say (O Muhammad): No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur&#8217;an), nor I am one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist.)&#8217; (38.86)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;aish delayed in embracing Islam for a period, so the Prophet invoked evil on them, saying, &#8216;O Allah! Help me against them by sending seven years of (famine) like those of Joseph.&#8217; So they were afflicted with such a severe year of famine that they were destroyed therein and ate dead animals and bones. They started seeing something like smoke between the sky and the earth (because of severe hunger). Abu Sufyan then came (to the Prophet) and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! You came to order us for to keep good relations with Kith and kin, and your kinsmen have now perished, so please invoke Allah (to relieve them).&#8217; Then Ibn Mas&#8217;ud recited:&#8211; &#8216;Then watch you for the day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible&#8230;.but truly you will return! (to disbelief) (44.10-15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ud added, Then the punishment was stopped, but truly, they reverted to heathenism (their old way). So Allah (threatened them thus): &#8216;On the day when we shall seize you with a mighty grasp.&#8217; (44.16) And that was the day of the Battle of Badr. Allah&#8217;s saying- &#8220;Lizama&#8221; (the punishment) refers to the day of Badr Allah&#8217;s Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Alif-Lam-Mim, the Romans have been defeated, and they, after their defeat, will be victorious,&#8217; (30.1-3) (This verse): Indicates that the defeat of Byzantine has already passed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">One day while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting with the people, a man came to him walking and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle. What is Belief?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Belief is to believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Apostles, and the meeting with Him, and to believe in the Resurrection.&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle What is Islam?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Islam is to worship Allah and not worship anything besides Him, to offer prayers perfectly, to pay the (compulsory) charity i.e. Zakat and to fast the month of Ramadan.&#8221; The man again asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle What is Ihsan (i.e. perfection or Benevolence)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Ihsan is to worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you do not achieve this state of devotion, then (take it for granted that) Allah sees you.&#8221; The man further asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle When will the Hour be established?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet replied, &#8220;The one who is asked about it does not know more than the questioner does, but I will describe to you its portents. When the lady slave gives birth to her mistress, that will be of its portents; when the bare-footed naked people become the chiefs of the people, that will be of its portents. The Hour is one of five things which nobody knows except Allah. Verily, the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah (alone). He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs.&#8221; (31.34) Then the man left. The Prophet said, &#8220;Call him back to me.&#8221; They went to call him back but could not see him. The Prophet said, &#8220;That was Gabriel who came to teach the people their religion.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 47 Vol 1)</p>

All that is reserved, besides which, all that you have seen, is nothing.&#8221; Then he recited:&#8211;</p>

Recite if you wish: &#8216;The Prophet is closer to the believers than their own selves.&#8217; (33.6) so if a believer (dies) leaves some property then his relatives will inherit that property; but if he is in debt or he leaves poor children, let those (creditors and children) come to me (that I may pay the debt and provide for the children), for them I am his sponsor (surely).</p>

Then the Prophet (showed them) as if he is ready to get up, yet they did not get up. When he noticed that (there was no response to his movement), he got up, and the others too, got up except three persons who kept on sitting. The Prophet came back in order to enter his house, but he went away again. Then they left, whereupon I set out and went to the Prophet to tell him that they had departed, so he came and entered his house. I wanted to enter along with him, but he put a screen between me and him. Then Allah revealed:</p>

When Allah&#8217;s Apostle married Zainab bint Jahsh she was with him in the house and he prepared a meal and invited the people (to it). They sat down (after finishing their meal) and started chatting. So the Prophet went out and then returned several times while they were still sitting and talking. So Allah revealed the Verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet&#8217;s houses until leave is given to you for a meal, (and then) not (so early as) to wait for its preparation &#8230;..ask them from behind a screen.&#8217; (33.53) So the screen was set up and the people went away.</p>

I was sent to invite the people (to the banquet), and so the people started coming (in groups); They would eat and then leave. Another batch would come, eat and leave. So I kept on inviting the people till I found nobody to invite. Then I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! I do not find anybody to invite.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Carry away the remaining food.&#8221; Then a batch of three persons stayed in the house chatting. The Prophet left and went towards the dwelling place of Aisha and said, &#8220;Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy be on you, O the people of the house!&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Peace and the mercy of Allah be on you too. How did you find your wife? May Allah bless you. Then he went to the dwelling places of all his other wives and said to them the same as he said to Aisha and they said to him the same as Aisha had said to him. Then the Prophet returned and found a group of three persons still in the house chatting. The Prophet was a very shy person, so he went out (for the second time) and went towards the dwelling place of &#8216;Aisha. I do not remember whether I informed him that the people have gone away. So he returned and as soon as he entered the gate, he drew the curtain between me and him, and then the Verse of Al-Hijab was revealed.</p>

Then he went out to the dwelling places of the mothers of the believers (his wives), as he used to do in the morning of his marriage. He would greet them and invoke good on them, and they (too) would return his greeting and invoke good on him. When he returned to his house, he found two men talking to each other; and when he saw them, he went out of his house again. When those two men saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle: going out of his house, they quickly got up (and departed).

She was a fat huge lady, and everybody who knew her before could recognize her. So &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, &#8220;O Sauda! By Allah, you cannot hide yourself from us, so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out. Sauda returned while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in my house taking his supper and a bone covered with meat was in his hand. She entered and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I went out to answer the call of nature and &#8216;Umar said to me so-and-so.&#8221; Then Allah inspired him (the Prophet) and when the state of inspiration was over and the bone was still in his hand as he had not put in down, he said (to Sauda), &#8220;You (women) have been allowed to go out for your needs.&#8221;</p>

I said, &#8220;I will not permit him unless I take permission of the Prophet about him for it was not the brother of Abi Al-Qu&#8217;ais but the wife of Abi Al-Qu&#8217;ais that nursed me.&#8221; The Prophet entered upon me, and I said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah, the brother of Abi Al-Qu&#8217;ais asked permission to visit me but I refused to permit him unless I took your permission.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;What stopped you from permitting him? He is your uncle.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The man was not the person who had nursed me, but the woman, the wife of Abi Al-Qu&#8217;ais had nursed me.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, for he is your uncle. Taribat Yaminuki (may your right hand be saved)&#8221; &#8216;Urwa, the sub-narrator added: For that &#8216;Aisha used to say, &#8220;Consider those things which are illegal because of blood relations as illegal because of the corresponding foster relations.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Prophet said, &#8220;When Allah decrees some order in the heaven, the angels flutter their wings indicating complete surrender to His saying which sounds like chains being dragged on rock. And when the state of fear disappears, they ask each other, &#8220;What has your Lord ordered? They say that He has said that which is true and just, and He is the Most High, the Most Great.&#8221; (34.23). Then the stealthy listeners (devils) hear this order, and these stealthy listeners are like this, one over the other.&#8221; (Sufyan, a sub-narrator demonstrated that by holding his hand upright and separating the fingers.) A stealthy listener hears a word which he will convey to that which is below him and the second will convey it to that which is below him till the last of them will convey it to the wizard or foreteller. Sometimes a flame (fire) may strike the devil before he can convey it, and sometimes he may convey it before the flame (fire) strikes him, whereupon the wizard adds to that word a hundred lies. The people will then say, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t he (i.e. magician) tell such-and-such a thing on such-and-such date?&#8217; So that magician is said to have told the truth because of the Statement which has been heard from the heavens.&#8221;</p>

Those are they whom Allah had guided. So follow their guidance.&#8217; (6.90) So David was the one of those prophets whom Prophet (Muhammad) was ordered to follow.

I intended to tie him to one of the pillars of the mosque till the morning so that all of you could see him, but then I remembered the Statement of my brother Solomon:&#8211;&#8216;My Lord! Forgive me and bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.&#8217; (38.35) The narrator added: Then he (the Prophet) dismissed him, rejected. &#8216;Nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist).&#8217; (38.86)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We came upon &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud and he said &#8220;O people! If somebody knows something, he can say it, but if he does not know it, he should say, &#8220;Allah knows better,&#8217; for it is a sign of having knowledge to say about something which one does not know, &#8216;Allah knows better.&#8217; Allah said to His Prophet: &#8216;Say (O Muhammad ! ) No wage do I ask of You for this (Quran) nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist).&#8217; (38.86) Now I will tell you about Ad-Dukhan (the smoke), Allah&#8217;s Apostle invited the Quraish to embrace Islam, but they delayed their response. So he said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by sending on them seven years of famine similar to the seven years of famine of Joseph.&#8221; So the famine year overtook them and everything was destroyed till they ate dead animals and skins. People started imagining to see smoke between them and the sky because of severe hunger. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people. . . This is painful torment.&#8217; (44.10-11) (So they invoked Allah) &#8220;Our Lord! Remove the punishment from us really we are believers.&#8221; How can there be an (effectual) reminder for them when an Apostle, explaining things clearly, has already come to them? Then they had turned away from him and said: &#8216;One taught (by a human being), a madman?&#8217; &#8216;We shall indeed remove punishment for a while, but truly, you will revert (to disbelief).&#8217; (44.12-15) Will the punishment be removed on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added, &#8220;The punishment was removed from them for a while but they reverted to disbelief, so Allah destroyed them on the Day of Badr. Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;The day We shall seize you with a mighty grasp. We will indeed (then) exact retribution.&#8221; (44.16)</p>

Whatever you say and invite people to, is good: but we wish if you could inform us whether we can make an expiration for our (past evil) deeds.&#8221; So the Divine Verses came: &#8216;Those who invoke not with Allah any other god, not kill such life as Allah has forbidden except for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse.&#8217; (25.68) And there was also revealed:&#8211; &#8216;Say: O My slaves who have transgressed against their souls! Despair not of the Mercy of Allah.&#8217; (39.53)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A (Jewish) Rabbi came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he said, &#8220;O Muhammad! We learn that Allah will put all the heavens on one finger, and the earths on one finger, and the trees on one finger, and the water and the dust on one finger, and all the other created beings on one finger. Then He will say, &#8216;I am the King.&#8217; Thereupon the Prophet smiled so that his pre-molar teeth became visible, and that was the confirmation of the Rabbi. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited:</p>

Abu Bakr came and seized &#8216;Uqba&#8217;s shoulder and threw him away from Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;Would you kill a man because he says: &#8216;My Lord is Allah,&#8217; and has come to you with clear Signs from your Lord?&#8221; (40.28)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Five things have passed, i.e. the smoke, the defeat of the Romans, the splitting of the moon, Al-Batsha (the defeat of the infidels in the battle of Badr) and Al-Lizam (the punishment)&#8217;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 346:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It (i.e., the imagined smoke) was because, when the Quraish refused to obey the Prophet, he asked Allah to afflict them with years of famine similar to those of (Prophet) Joseph. So they were stricken with famine and fatigue, so much so that they ate even bones. A man would look towards the sky and imagine seeing something like smoke between him and the sky because of extreme fatigue. So Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people; this is a painfull of torment.&#8217; (44.10-11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then someone (Abu Sufyan) came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to send rain for the tribes of Mudar for they are on the verge of destruction.&#8221; On that the Prophet said (astonishingly) &#8220;Shall I invoke Allah) for the tribes of Mudar? Verily, you are a brave man!&#8221; But the Prophet prayed for rain and it rained for them. Then the Verse was revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;But truly you will return (to disbelief).&#8217; (44.15) (When the famine was over and) they restored prosperity and welfare, they reverted to their ways (of heathenism) whereupon Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;On the Day when We shall seize you with a Mighty Grasp. We will indeed (then) exact retribution.&#8217; (44.16) The narrator said, &#8220;That was the day of the Battle of Badr.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a sign of having knowledge that, when you do not know something, you say: &#8216;Allah knows better.&#8217; Allah said to his Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Say: No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur&#8217;an), nor am I one of the pretenders (a person who pretends things which do not exist)&#8217; (38.86) When the Quraish troubled and stood against the Prophet he said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine like the seven years of Joseph.&#8221; So they were stricken with a year of famine during which they ate bones and dead animals because of too much suffering, and one of them would see something like smoke between him and the sky because of hunger. Then they said: Our Lord! Remove the torment from us, really we are believers. (44.12) And then it was said to the Prophet (by Allah), &#8220;If we remove it from them. they will revert to their ways (of heathenism).&#8221; So the Prophet invoked his Lord, who removed the punishment from them, but later they reverted (to heathenism), whereupon Allah punished them on the day of the Battle of Badr, and that is what Allah&#8217;s Statement indicates:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch for the day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible&#8230;we will indeed (then) exact retribution.&#8217; (44.10).</p>

So he (the Prophet) said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine similar to the seven years of Joseph.&#8217; So they were stricken with a year of drought that destroyed everything, and they started eating dead animals, and if one of them got up he would see something like smoke between him and the sky from the severe fatigue and hunger.&#8221; Abdullah then recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible, covering the people. This is a painful torment&#8230; (till he reached) &#8230;&#8230;.. We shall indeed remove the punishment for a while, but truly you will revert (to heathenism): (44.10-15) &#8216;Abdullah added: &#8220;Will the punishment be removed from them on the Day of Resurrection?&#8221; He added,&#8221; The severe grasp&#8221; was the Day of the Battle of Badr.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Say, No wage do I ask of you for this (Qur&#8217;an) nor am I one of the pretenders (i.e. a person who pretends things which do not exist). (38.68) When Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw Quraish standing against him, he said, &#8220;O Allah! Help me against them by afflicting them with seven years of famine similar to the seven years (of famine) of Joseph. So they were afflicted with a year of drought that destroyed everything, and they ate bones and hides. (One of them said), &#8220;And they ate hides and dead animals, and (it seemed to them that) something like smoke was coming out of the earth. So Abu Sufyan came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Muhammad! Your people are on the verge of destruction! Please invoke Allah to relieve them.&#8221; So the Prophet invoked Allah for them (and the famine disappeared). He said to them. &#8220;You will revert (to heathenism) after that.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah then recited:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Then watch you for the Day that the sky will bring forth a kind of smoke plainly visible&#8230;&#8230;.but truly you will revert (to disbelief).&#8217; He added, &#8220;Will the punishment be removed from them in the Hereafter? The smoke and the grasp and the Al-Lizam have all passed.&#8221; One of the sub-narrater said, &#8220;The splitting of the moon.&#8221; And another said, &#8220;The defeat of the Romans (has passed).&#8221;</p>

And whenever he saw clouds or winds, signs of deep concern would appear on his face. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! When people see clouds they usually feel happy, hoping that it would rain, while I see that when you see clouds, one could notice signs of dissatisfaction on your face.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha! What is the guarantee for me that there will be no punishment in it, since some people were punished with a wind?

You are my slave and My Apostle, and I have named you Al-Mutawakkil (one who depends upon Allah). You are neither hard-hearted nor of fierce character, nor one who shouts in the markets.

Won&#8217;t our killed persons go to Paradise, and theirs in the Fire?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Umar further said, &#8220;Then why should we let our religion be degraded and return before Allah has settled the matter between us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Khattab! No doubt, I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Allah will never neglect me.&#8221; So Umar left the place angrily and he was so impatient that he went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Aren&#8217;t we on the right (path) and they (pagans) on the wrong?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O the son of Al-Khattab! He is Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and Allah will never neglect him.&#8221; Then Sura Al-Fath (The Victory) was revealed.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 368:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abi Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two righteous persons were about to be ruined. They were Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar who raised their voices in the presence of the Prophet when a mission from Bani Tamim came to him. One of the two recommended Al-Aqra&#8217; bin Habeas, the brother of Bani Mujashi (to be their governor) while the other recommended somebody else. (Nafi&#8217;, the sub-narrator said, I do not remember his name). Abu Bakr said to Umar, &#8220;You wanted nothing but to oppose me!&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I did not intend to oppose you.&#8221; Their voices grew loud in that argument, so Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the Prophet.&#8217; (49.2) Ibn Az-Zubair said, &#8220;Since the revelation of this Verse, &#8216;Umar used to speak in such a low tone that the Prophet had to ask him to repeat his statements.&#8221; But Ibn Az-Zubair did not mention the same about his (maternal) grandfather (i.e. Abu Bakr).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet missed Thabit bin Qais for a period (So he inquired about him). A man said. &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will bring you his news.&#8221; So he went to Thabit and found him sitting in his house and bowing his head. The man said to Thabit, &#8221; &#8216;What is the matter with you?&#8221; Thabit replied that it was an evil affair, for he used to raise his voice above the voice of the Prophet and so all his good deeds had been annulled, and he considered himself as one of the people of the Fire. Then the man returned to the Prophet and told him that Thabit had said, so-and-so. (Musa bin Anas) said: The man returned to Thabit with great glad tidings. The Prophet said to the man. &#8220;Go back to him and say to him: &#8220;You are not from the people of the Hell Fire, but from the people of Paradise.&#8221;</p>

Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Appoint Al-Qaqa bin Mabad.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;Appoint Al-Aqra&#8217; bin Habeas.&#8221; On that Abu Bakr said (to &#8216;Umar). &#8220;You did not want but to oppose me!&#8221; &#8216;Umar replied &#8220;I did not intend to oppose you!&#8221; So both of them argued till their voices grew loud. So the following Verse was revealed:</p>

Why do only the weak and the humble among the people enter me?&#8217; On that, Allah said to Paradise. &#8216;You are My Mercy which I bestow on whoever I wish of my servants.&#8217; Then Allah said to the (Hell) Fire, &#8216;You are my (means of) punishment by which I punish whoever I wish of my slaves. And each of you will have its fill.&#8217; As for the Fire (Hell), it will not be filled till Allah puts His Foot over it whereupon it will say, &#8216;Qati! Qati!&#8217; At that time it will be filled, and its different parts will come closer to each other; and Allah will not wrong any of His created beings. As regards Paradise, Allah will create a new creation to fill it with.&#8221;</p>

I am suffering from fatigue and hunger.&#8221; The Prophet sent (somebody) to his wives (to get something), but the messenger found nothing with them. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to his companions). &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there anybody who can entertain this man tonight so that Allah may be merciful to him?&#8221; An Ansari man got up and said, &#8220;I (will, entertain him), O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; So he went to his wife and said to her, &#8220;This is the guest of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, so do not keep anything away from him.&#8221; She said. &#8220;By Allah, I have nothing but the children&#8217;s food.&#8221; He said, &#8220;When the children ask for their dinner, put them to bed and put out the light; we shall not take our meals tonight,&#8221; She did so. In the morning the Ansari man went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who said, &#8220;Allah was pleased with (or He bestowed His Mercy) on so-and-so and his wife (because of their good deed).&#8221; Then Allah revealed:</p>

She has a letter. Take the letter from her.&#8221; So we set out, and our horses ran at full pace till we reached Raudat Khakh, and behold, we saw the lady and said (to her), &#8220;Take out the letter!&#8221; She said, &#8220;I have no letter with me.&#8221; We said, &#8220;Either you take out the letter or we will strip you of your clothes.&#8221; So she took the letter out of her hair braid. We brought the letter to the Prophet and behold, it was addressed by Hatib bin Abi Balta&#8217;a to some pagans at Mecca, informing them of some of the affairs of the Prophet. The Prophet said, &#8220;What is this, O Hatib?&#8221; Hatib replied, &#8220;Do not be hasty with me, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am an Ansari man and do not belong to them (Quraish infidels) while the emigrants who were with you had their relatives who used to protect their families and properties at Mecca. So, to compensate for not having blood relation with them.&#8217; I intended to do them some favor so that they might protect my relatives (at Mecca), and I did not do this out of disbelief or an inclination to desert my religion.&#8221; The Prophet then said (to his companions), &#8220;He (Hatib) has told you the truth.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off?&#8221; The Apostle said, &#8220;He is one of those who witnessed (fought in) the Battle of Badr, and what do you know, perhaps Allah looked upon the people of Badr (Badr warriors) and said, &#8216;Do what you want as I have forgiven you.&#8217; &#8221; (Amr, a sub-narrator, said,: This Verse was revealed about him (Hatib):</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the whole year I had the desire to ask &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab regarding the explanation of a Verse (in Surat Al-Tahrim) but I could not ask him because I respected him very much. When he went to perform the Hajj, I too went along with him. On our return, while we were still on the way home. &#8216;Umar went aside to answer the call of nature by the Arak trees. I waited till he finished and then I proceeded with him and asked him. &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Who were the two wives of the Prophet who aided one another against him?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They were Hafsa and &#8216;Aisha.&#8221; Then I said to him, &#8220;By Allah, I wanted to ask you about this a year ago, but I could not do so owing to my respect for you.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Do not refrain from asking me. If you think that I have knowledge (about a certain matter), ask me; and if I know (something about it), I will tell you.&#8221; Then Umar added, &#8220;By Allah, in the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance we did not pay attention to women until Allah revealed regarding them what He revealed regarding them and assigned for them what He has assigned. Once while I was thinking over a certain matter, my wife said, &#8220;I recommend that you do so-and-so.&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;What have you got to do with the is matter? Why do you poke your nose in a matter which I want to see fulfilled.?&#8221; She said, How strange you are, O son of Al-Khattab! You don&#8217;t want to be argued with whereas your daughter, Hafsa surely, argues with Allah&#8217;s Apostle so much that he remains angry for a full day!&#8221; &#8216;Umar then reported; how he at once put on his outer garment and went to Hafsa and said to her, &#8220;O my daughter! Do you argue with Allah&#8217;s Apostle so that he remains angry the whole day?&#8221; H. afsa said, &#8220;By Allah, we argue with him.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Know that I warn you of Allah&#8217;s punishment and the anger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . . . O my daughter! Don&#8217;t be betrayed by the one who is proud of her beauty because of the love of Allah&#8217;s Apostle for her (i.e. &#8216;Aisha).&#8221; &#8216;Umar addled, &#8220;Then I went out to Um Salama&#8217;s house who was one of my relatives, and I talked to her. She said, O son of Al-Khattab! It is rather astonishing that you interfere in everything; you even want to interfere between Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his wives!&#8217; By Allah, by her talk she influenced me so much that I lost some of my anger. I left her (and went home). At that time I had a friend from the Ansar who used to bring news (from the Prophet) in case of my absence, and I used to bring him the news if he was absent. In those days we were afraid of one of the kings of Ghassan tribe. We heard that he intended to move and attack us, so fear filled our hearts because of that. (One day) my Ansari friend unexpectedly knocked at my door, and said, &#8220;Open Open!&#8217; I said, &#8216;Has the king of Ghassan come?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, but something worse; Allah&#8217;s Apostle has isolated himself from his wives.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Let the nose of &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa be stuck to dust (i.e. humiliated)!&#8217; Then I put on my clothes and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;s residence, and behold, he was staying in an upper room of his to which he ascended by a ladder, and a black slave of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was (sitting) on the first step. I said to him, &#8216;Say (to the Prophet ) &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab is here.&#8217; Then the Prophet admitted me and I narrated the story to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. When I reached the story of Um Salama, Allah&#8217;s Apostle smiled while he was lying on a mat made of palm tree leaves with nothing between him and the mat. Underneath his head there was a leather pillow stuffed with palm fibres, and leaves of a saut tree were piled at his feet, and above his head hung a few water skins. On seeing the marks of the mat imprinted on his side, I wept. He said.&#8217; &#8216;Why are you weeping?&#8217; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Caesar and Khosrau are leading the life (i.e. Luxurious life) while you, Allah&#8217;s Apostle though you are, is living in destitute&#8221;. The Prophet then replied. &#8216;Won&#8217;t you be satisfied that they enjoy this world and we the Hereafter?&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I intended to ask &#8216;Umar so I said, &#8220;Who were those two ladies who tried to back each other against the Prophet?&#8221; I hardly finished my speech when he said, They were &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I intended to ask &#8216;Umar about those two ladies who back each other against &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle . For one year I was seeking the opportunity to ask this question, but in vain, until once when I accompanied him for Hajj. While we were in Zahran, &#8216;Umar went to answer the call of nature and told me to follow him with some water for ablution. So I followed him with a container of water and started pouring water for him. I found it a good opportunity to ask him, so I said, &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Who were those two ladies who had backed each other (against the Prophet)?&#8221; Before I could complete my question, he replied, &#8220;They were &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 438:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wives of the Prophet out of their jealousy, backed each other against the Prophet, so I said to them, &#8220;It may be, if he divorced you all, that Allah will give him, instead of you wives better than you.&#8221; So this Verse was revealed. (66.5)</p>

They are all those violent, arrogant and stubborn people.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;Allah will bring forth the severest Hour, and then all the Believers, men and women, will prostrate themselves before Him, but there will remain those who used to prostrate in the world for showing off and for gaining good reputation. Such people will try to prostrate (on the Day of Judgment) but their back swill be as stiff as if it is one bone (a single vertebra).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 442:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the idols which were worshipped by the people of Noah were worshipped by the Arabs later on. As for the idol Wadd, it was worshipped by the tribe of Kalb at Daumat-al-Jandal; Suwa&#8217; was the idol of (the tribe of) Murad and then by Ban, Ghutaif at Al-Jurf near Saba; Yauq was the idol of Hamdan, and Nasr was the idol of Himyr, the branch of Dhi-al-Kala.&#8217; The names (of the idols) formerly belonged to some pious men of the people of Noah, and when they died Satan inspired their people to (prepare and place idols at the places where they used to sit, and to call those idols by their names. The people did so, but the idols were not worshipped till those people (who initiated them) had died and the origin of the idols had become obscure, whereupon people began worshipping them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 443:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out along with a group of his companions towards &#8216;Ukaz Market. At that time something intervened between the devils and the news of the Heaven, and flames were sent down upon them, so the devils returned. Their fellow-devils said, &#8220;What is wrong with you? &#8221; They said, &#8220;Something has intervened between us and the news of the Heaven, and fires (flames) have been shot at us.&#8221; Their fellow-devils said, &#8220;Nothing has intervened between you and the news of the Heaven, but an important event has happened. Therefore, travel all over the world, east and west, and try to find out what has happened.&#8221; And so they set out and travelled all over the world, east and west, looking for that thing which intervened between them and the news of the Heaven. Those of the devils who had set out towards Tihama, went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle at Nakhla (a place between Mecca and Taif) while he was on his way to Ukaz Market. (They met him) while he was offering the Fajr prayer with his companions. When they heard the Holy Qur&#8217;an being recited (by Allah&#8217;s Apostle), they listened to it and said (to each other). This is the thing which has intervened between you and the news of the Heavens.&#8221; Then they returned to their people and said, &#8220;O our people! We have really heard a wonderful recital (Qur&#8217;an). It gives guidance to the right, and we have believed therein. We shall not join in worship, anybody with our Lord.&#8221; (See 72.1-2) Then Allah revealed to His Prophet (Surat al-Jinn):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Say: It has been revealed to me that a group (3 to 9) of Jinns listened (to the Qur&#8217;an).&#8217; (72.1) The statement of the Jinns was revealed to him .</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Yahya bin Abi Kathir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Aba Salama bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman about the first Sura revealed of the Qur&#8217;an. He replied &#8220;O you, wrapped-up (i.e. Al Muddaththir).&#8221; I said, &#8220;They say it was, &#8216;Read, in the Name of your Lord Who created,&#8217; (i.e. Surat Al-&#8216;Alaq (the Clot).&#8221; On that, Abu Salama said, &#8220;I asked Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah about that, saying the same as you have said, whereupon he said, &#8216;I will not tell you except what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had told us. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I was in seclusion in the cave of Hiram&#8217;, and after I completed the limited period of my seclusion. I came down (from the cave) and heard a voice calling me. I looked to my right, but saw nothing. Then I looked up and saw something. So I went to Khadija (the Prophet&#8217;s wife) and told her to wrap me up and pour cold water on me. So they wrapped me up and poured cold water on me.&#8221; Then, &#8216;O you, (Muhammad) wrapped up! Arise and warn,&#8217; (Surat Al Muddaththir) was revealed.&#8221; (74.1)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet describing the period of pause of the Divine Inspiration. He said in his talk, &#8220;While I was walking, I heard voices from the sky. I looked up, and behold ! I saw the same Angel who came to me in the cave of Hira&#8217; sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I was too much afraid of him (so I returned to my house) and said, &#8216;Fold me up in garments!&#8217; They wrapped me up. Then Allah revealed: &#8216;O you wrapped&#8230;and desert the idols before the prayer became compulsory.&#8217; Rujz means idols.</p>

I looked up towards the sky, and behold! I saw the same Angel who came to me in the Cave of Hira&#8217;, sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I was so terrified by him that I fell down on the ground. Then I went to my wife and said, &#8216;Wrap me in garments! Wrap me in garments!&#8217; They wrapped me, and then Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you, (Muhammad) wrapped-up! Arise and warn&#8230;and desert the idols.&#8221; (74.1-5) Abu Salama said&#8230;.Rujz means idols.&#8221; After that, the Divine Inspiration started coming more frequently and regularly.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 449:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to move his tongue when the divine Inspiration was being revealed to him. (Sufyan, a subnarrator, demonstrated (how the Prophet used to move his lips) and added. &#8220;In order to memorize it.&#8221; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith.&#8221; (75.16)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 450:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Musa bin Abi Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That he asked Said bin Jubair regarding (the statement of Allah). &#8216;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith.&#8217; He said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that the Prophet used to move his lips when the Divine Inspiration was being revealed to him. So the Prophet was ordered not to move his tongue, which he used to do, lest some words should escape his memory. &#8216;It is for Us to collect it&#8217; means, We will collect it in your chest;&#8217; and its recitation&#8217; means, We will make you recite it. &#8216;But when We recite it (i.e. when it is revealed to you), follow its recital; it is for Us to explain it and make it clear,&#8217; (i.e. We will explain it through your tongue).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 451:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(as regards) Allah&#8217;s Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith.&#8221; (75.16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Gabriel revealed the Divine Inspiration in Allah&#8217;s Apostle , he (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) moved his tongue and lips, and that state used to be very hard for him, and that movement indicated that revelation was taking place. So Allah revealed in Surat Al-Qiyama which begins:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;I do swear by the Day of Resurrection&#8230;&#8217; (75) the Verses:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste therewith. It is for Us to collect it (Quran) in your mind, and give you the ability to recite it by heart. (75.16-17) Ibn Abbas added: It is for Us to collect it (Qur&#8217;an) (in your mind), and give you the ability to recite it by heart means, &#8220;When We reveal it, listen. Then it is for Us to explain it,&#8221; means, &#8216;It is for us to explain it through your tongue.&#8217; So whenever Gabriel came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8216; he would keep quiet (and listen), and when the Angel left, the Prophet would recite that revelation as Allah promised him.</p>

Abu Huraira added. &#8220;Then (after this period) Allah will send water from the sky and then the dead bodies will grow like vegetation grows, There is nothing of the human body that does not decay except one bone; that is the little bone at the end of the coccyx of which the human body will be recreated on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 338)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to Sham with a group of the companions of &#8216;Abdullah (bin Mas&#8217;ud). Abu Ad-Darda&#8217; heard of our arrival so he came to us and said, &#8220;Is there anybody among you who can recite (Qur&#8217;an)&#8221; We replied in the affirmative. Then he asked, &#8220;Who is the best reciter?&#8221; They pointed at me. Then he told me to recite, so I recited the verse:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;By the night as it envelops &#8216;By the day as it appears in brightness; By (Him Who created) male and the female.&#8217; (92.1-3) Abu Ad-Darda&#8217; then said to me, &#8220;Did you hear it (like this) from the mouth of your friend (&#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I too, heard it (like this) from the mouth of the Prophet, but these people do not consider this recitation as the correct one.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 478:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) The commencement (of the Divine Inspiration) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in the form of true dreams in his sleep, for he never had a dream but it turned out to be true and clear as the bright daylight. Then he began to like seclusions, so he used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship Allah continuously for many nights before going back to his family to take the necessary provision (of food) for the stay. He come back to (his wife) Khadija again to take his provision (of food) likewise, till one day he received the Guidance while he was in the cave of Hira. An Angel came to him and asked him to read. Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;I do not know how to read.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then the Angel held me (forcibly) and pressed me so hard that I felt distressed. Then he released me and again asked me to read, and I replied, &#8216;I do not know how to read.&#8217; Thereupon he held me again and pressed me for the second time till I felt distressed. He then released me and asked me to read, but again I replied. &#8216;I do not know how to read.&#8217; Thereupon he held me for the third time and pressed me till I got distressed, and then he released me and said, &#8216;Read, in the Name of your Lord Who has created (all that exists), has created man out of a clot, Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous. Who has taught (the writing) by the pen, has taught man that which he knew not.&#8221; (96.1-5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned with that experience; and the muscles between his neck and shoulders were trembling till he came upon Khadija (his wife) and said, &#8220;Cover me!&#8221; They covered him, and when the state of fear was over, he said to Khadija, &#8220;O Khadija! What is wrong with me? I was afraid that something bad might happen to me.&#8221; Then he told her the story. Khadija said, &#8220;Nay! But receive the good tidings! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you, for by Allah, you keep good relations with your Kith and kin, speak the truth, help the poor and the destitute, entertain your guests generously and assist those who are stricken with calamities.&#8221; Khadija then took him to Waraqa bin Naufil, the son of Khadija&#8217;s paternal uncle. Waraqa had been converted to Christianity in the Pre-lslamic Period and used to write Arabic and write of the Gospel in Arabic as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his eyesight. Khadija said (to Waraqa), &#8220;O my cousin! Listen to what your nephew is going to say.&#8221; Waraqa said, &#8220;O my nephew! What have you seen?&#8221; The Prophet then described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, &#8220;This is the same Angel (Gabriel) who was sent to Moses. I wish I were young.&#8221; He added some other statement. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Will these people drive me out?&#8221; Waraqa said, &#8220;Yes, for nobody brought the like of what you have brought, but was treated with hostility. If I were to remain alive till your day (when you start preaching). then I would support you strongly.&#8221; But a short while later Waraqa died and the Divine Inspiration was paused (stopped) for a while so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was very much grieved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: While Allah&#8217;s Apostle was talking about the period of pause in revelation. he said in his narration. &#8220;Once while I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and saw to my surprise, the same Angel as had visited me in the cave of Hira.&#8217; He was sitting on a chair between the sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, Wrap me! Wrap me!&#8221; So they covered him and then Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O you, wrapped up! Arise and warn and your Lord magnify, and your garments purify and dessert the idols.&#8217; (74.1-5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Salama said, &#8220;(Rijz) are the idols which the people of the Pre-lslamic period used to worship.&#8221; After this the revelation started coming frequently and regularly.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8221; Horses are kept for one of three purposes: A man may keep them (for Allah&#8217;s Cause) to receive a reward in the Hereafter; another may keep them as a means of protection; and a third may keep them to be a burden for him. As for the man for whom the horse is a source of reward, he is the one who ties it for Allah&#8217;s Cause, and he ties it with a long rope in a pasture or a garden, then, whatever it eats or drinks in that pasture or garden will be added to his good deeds. And if it breaks its rope and jumps over one or two hills, then, for all its footsteps and its manure, good deeds will be written for him. And if it passes by a river and drinks of its water though its owner had no intention to water it from that river, even then he will have good deeds written for him. So that horse will be (a source of) reward for such a man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a man ties a horse for earning his livelihood and abstaining from asking others for help and he does not forget Allah&#8217;s right, i.e. pays its Zakat and gives it to be used in Allah&#8217;s Cause, then that horse will be a means of protection for him. But if a man ties it out of pride and to show off and to excite others, then that horse will be a burden (of sins) for him.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked regarding donkeys. He replied, &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to me except this comprehensive Verse which includes everything:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) shall see it; and whoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a smallest ant) shall see it.&#8217; (99.7-8)</p>

If I inform you that cavalrymen are proceeding up the side of this mountain, will you believe me?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We have never heard you telling a lie.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;I am a plain warner to you of a coming severe punishment.&#8221; Abu Lahab said, &#8220;May you perish! You gathered us only for this reason? &#8221; Then Abu Lahab went away. So the &#8220;Surat:&#8211;ul&#8211;LAHAB&#8221; &#8216;Perish the hands of Abu Lahab!&#8217; (111.1) was revealed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet went out towards Al-Batha&#8217; and ascended the mountain and shouted, &#8220;O Sabahah!&#8221; So the Quraish people gathered around him. He said, &#8220;Do you see? If I tell you that an enemy is going to attack you in the morning or in the evening, will you believe me?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then I am a plain warner to you of a coming severe punishment.&#8221; Abu Lahab said, &#8220;Is it for this reason that you have gathered us? May you perish ! &#8221; Then Allah revealed: &#8216;Perish the hands of Abu Lahab!&#8217;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 498:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah said: &#8216;The son of Adam tells a lie against Me,, though he hasn&#8217;t the right to do so. He abuses me though he hasn&#8217;t the right to do so. As for his telling a lie against Me, it is his saying that I will not recreate him as I created him for the first time. In fact, the first creation was not easier for Me than new creation. As for his abusing Me, it is his saying that Allah has begotten children, while I am the One, the Self-Sufficient Master Whom all creatures need, I beget not, nor was I begotten, and there is none like unto Me.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 500:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zirr bin Hubaish:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b regarding the two Muwwidhat (Surats of taking refuge with Allah). He said, &#8220;I asked the Prophet about them, He said, &#8216;These two Surats have been recited to me and I have recited them (and are present in the Quran).&#8217; So, we say as Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (i.e., they are part of the Quran&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 60, Number 501:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zirr bin Hubaish:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b, &#8220;O Abu AlMundhir! Your brother, Ibn Mas&#8217;ud said so-and-so (i.e., the two Mu&#8217;awwidh-at do not belong to the Quran).&#8221; Ubai said, &#8220;I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about them, and he said, &#8216;They have been revealed to me, and I have recited them (as a part of the Quran),&#8221; So Ubai added, &#8220;So we say as Allah&#8217;s Apostle has said.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.053.324">Volume 4, Book 53, Number 324: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ali: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I got a she-camel in my share of the war booty on the day  (of the battle) of Badr, and the Prophet had given me a she-camel from the Khumus. When I  intended to marry Fatima, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I had an appointment with a  goldsmith from the tribe of Bani Qainuqa&#8217; to go with me to bring Idhkhir (i.e. grass of  pleasant smell) and sell it to the goldsmiths and spend its price on my wedding party. I  was collecting for my she-camels equipment of saddles, sacks and ropes while my two  she-camels were kneeling down beside the room of an Ansari man. I returned after  collecting whatever I collected, to see the humps of my two she-camels cut off and their  flanks cut open and some portion of their livers was taken out. When I saw that state of  my two she-camels, I could not help weeping. I asked, &#8220;Who has done this?&#8221; The  people replied, &#8220;Hamza bin Abdul Muttalib who is staying with some Ansari drunks in  this house.&#8221; I went away till I reached the Prophet and Zaid bin Haritha was with  him. The Prophet noticed on my face the effect of what I had suffered, so the Prophet  asked. &#8220;What is wrong with you.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have  never seen such a day as today. Hamza attacked my two she-camels, cut off their humps, and  ripped open their flanks, and he is sitting there in a house in the company of some  drunks.&#8221; The Prophet then asked for his covering sheet, put it on, and set out  walking followed by me and Zaid bin Haritha till he came to the house where Hamza was. He  asked permission to enter, and they allowed him, and they were drunk. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  started rebuking Hamza for what he had done, but Hamza was drunk and his eyes were red.  Hamza looked at Allah&#8217;s Apostle and then he raised his eyes, looking at his knees, then he  raised up his eyes looking at his umbilicus, and again he raised up his eyes look in at  his face. Hamza then said, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you but the slaves of my father?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle realized that he was drunk, so Allah&#8217;s Apostle retreated, and we went out with  him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 53, Number 325: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(mother of the believers) After the death of Allah &#8216;s  Apostle Fatima the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her  share of inheritance from what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had left of the Fai (i.e. booty gained  without fighting) which Allah had given him. Abu Bakr said to her, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8216;Our property will not be inherited, whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to  be used for charity).&#8221; Fatima, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle got angry and stopped  speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died. Fatima remained  alive for six months after the death of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>She used to ask Abu Bakr for her share from the property of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle which he left at Khaibar, and Fadak, and his property at Medina (devoted  for charity). Abu Bakr refused to give her that property and said, &#8220;I will not leave  anything Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, because I am afraid that if I left something from the  Prophet&#8217;s tradition, then I would go astray.&#8221; (Later on) Umar gave the Prophet&#8217;s  property (of Sadaqa) at Medina to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas, but he withheld the properties of  Khaibar and Fadak in his custody and said, &#8220;These two properties are the Sadaqa which  Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to use for his expenditures and urgent needs. Now their management is  to be entrusted to the ruler.&#8221; (Az-Zuhrl said, &#8220;They have been managed in this  way till today.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 53, Number 326: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Malik bin Aus: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was at home, the sun rose high and it got hot.  Suddenly the messenger of &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab came to me and said, &#8220;The chief of the  believers has sent for you.&#8221; So, I went along with him till I entered the place where  &#8216;Umar was sitting on a bedstead made of date-palm leaves and covered with no mattress, and  he was leaning over a leather pillow. I greeted him and sat down. He said, &#8220;O Malik!  Some persons of your people who have families came to me and I have ordered that a gift  should be given to them, so take it and distribute it among them.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O  chief of the believers! I wish that you order someone else to do it.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;O man! Take it.&#8221; While I was sitting there with him, his doorman Yarfa&#8217; came  saying, &#8220;&#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf, Az-Zubair and Sad bin Abi Waqqas are asking  your permission (to see you); may I admit them?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;, So they  were admitted and they came in, greeted him, and sat down. After a while Yarfa&#8217; came again  and said, &#8220;May I admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;yes.&#8221; So, they  were admitted and they came in and greeted (him) and sat down. Then &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;O  chief of the believers! Judge between me and this (i.e. &#8216;Ali).&#8221; They had a dispute  regarding the property of Bani An-Nadir which Allah had given to His Apostle as Fai. The  group (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and his companions) said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Judge  between them and relieve both of them front each other.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Be  patient! I beseech you by Allah by Whose Permission the Heaven and the Earth exist, do you  know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Our (i.e. prophets&#8217;) property will not be inherited, and  whatever we leave, is Sadaqa (to be used for charity),&#8217; and Allah&#8217;s Apostle meant himself  (by saying &#8220;we&#8221;)?&#8221; The group said, &#8220;He said so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then turned to  &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you by Allah, do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said so?&#8221; They replied, &#8221; He said so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then said, &#8220;So, I will  talk to you about this matter. Allah bestowed on His Apostle with a special favor of  something of this Fai (booty) which he gave to nobody else.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then recited the  Holy Verses: &#8220;What Allah bestowed as (Fai) Booty on his Apostle (Muhammad) from them  &#8212; for this you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry: But Allah gives power  to His Apostles over whomever He will &#8216;And Allah is able to do all things.&#8221; 9:6) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Umar added &#8220;So this property was especially given to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle, but, by Allah, neither did he take possession of it and leave your, nor  did he favor himself with it to your exclusion, but he gave it to all of you and  distributed it amongst you till this property remained out of it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to  spend the yearly expenses of his family out of this property and used to keep the rest of  its revenue to be spent on Allah &#8216;s Cause. Allah &#8216;s Apostle kept on doing this during all  his lifetime. I ask you by Allah do you know this?&#8221; They replies in the affirmative.  &#8216;Umar then said to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas. &#8220;I ask you by Allah, do you know this?&#8221;  &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;When Allah had taken His Prophet unto Him, &#8216;Abu Bakr said, &#8216;I am the  successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle so, Abu Bakr took over that property and managed it in the  same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and Allah knows that he was true, pious and  rightly-guided, and he was a follower of what was right. Then Allah took Abu Bakr unto Him  and I became Abu Bakr&#8217;s successor, and I kept that property in my possession for the first  two years of my Caliphate, managing it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do and  as Abu Bakr used to do, and Allah knows that I have been true, pious, rightly guided, and  a follower of what is right. Now you both (i.e. &#8216;Ah and &#8216;Abbas) came to talk to me,  bearing the same claim and presenting the same case; you, &#8216;Abbas, came to me asking for  your share from your nephew&#8217;s property, and this man, i.e. &#8216;Ali, came to me asking for his  wife&#8217;s share from her father&#8217;s property. I told you both that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Our  (prophets&#8217;) properties are not to be inherited, but what we leave is Sadaqa (to be used  for charity).&#8217; When I thought it right that I should hand over this property to you, I  said to you, &#8216;I am ready to hand over this property to you if you wish, on the condition  that you would take Allah&#8217;s Pledge and Convention that you would manage it in the same way  as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to, and as Abu Bakr used to do, and as I have done since I was in  charge of it.&#8217; So, both of you said (to me), &#8216;Hand it over to us,&#8217; and on that condition I  handed it over to you. So, I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on this  condition?&#8221; The group aid, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar faced &#8216;Ali and Abbas saying,  &#8220;I ask you by Allah, did I hand it over to you on this condition?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Yes. &#8221; He said, &#8221; Do you want now to give a different decision? By Allah,  by Whose Leave both the Heaven and the Earth exist, I will never give any decision other  than that (I have already given). And if you are unable to manage it, then return it to  me, and I will do the job on your behalf.&#8221; </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Fatima is from me, and I am afraid she will be subjected to trials in her religion  (because of jealousy).&#8221; The Prophet then mentioned one of his son-in-law who was from  the tribe of &#8216;Abu Shams, and he praised him as a good son-in-law, saying, &#8220;Whatever  he said was the truth, and he promised me and fulfilled his promise. I do not make a legal  thing illegal, nor do I make an illegal thing legal, but by Allah, the daughter of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and the daughter of the enemy of Allah, (i.e. Abu Jahl) can never get together (as  the wives of one man) (See Hadith No. 76, Vo. 5). </font></p>

The Prophet came to our house when we had gone to our beds. (On seeing the Prophet) we  were going to get up, but he said, &#8216;Keep at your places,&#8217; I felt the coolness of the  Prophet&#8217;s feet on my chest.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A prophet amongst the prophets  carried out a holy military expedition, so he said to his followers, &#8216;Anyone who has  married a woman and wants to consummate the marriage, and has not done so yet, should not  accompany me; nor should a man who has built a house but has not completed its roof; nor a  man who has sheep or shecamels and is waiting for the birth of their young ones.&#8217; So, the  prophet carried out the expedition and when he reached that town at the time or nearly at  the time of the &#8216;Asr prayer, he said to the sun, &#8216;O sun! You are under Allah&#8217;s Order and I  am under Allah&#8217;s Order O Allah! Stop it (i.e. the sun) from setting.&#8217; It was stopped till  Allah made him victorious. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then he collected the booty and the fire came to burn it,  but it did not burn it. He said (to his men), &#8216;Some of you have stolen something from the  booty. So one man from every tribe should give me a pledge of allegiance by shaking hands  with me.&#8217; (They did so and) the hand of a man got stuck over the hand of their prophet.  Then that prophet said (to the man), &#8216;The theft has been committed by your people. So all  the persons of your tribe should give me the pledge of allegiance by shaking hands with  me.&#8217; The hands of two or three men got stuck over the hand of their prophet and he said,  &#8220;You have committed the theft.&#8217; Then they brought a head of gold like the head of a  cow and put it there, and the fire came and consumed the booty. The Prophet added: Then  Allah saw our weakness and disability, so he made booty legal for us.&#8221; </font></p>

I have kept this aside for you! O Abu-al  Miswar! I have kept this aside for you!&#8221; Makhrama was a bad-tempered man. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Az-Zubair got up during the battle of Al-Jamal, he  called me and I stood up beside him, and he said to me, &#8220;O my son! Today one will be  killed either as an oppressor or as an oppressed one. I see that I will be killed as an  oppressed one. My biggest worry is my debts. Do you think, if we pay the debts, there will  be something left for us from our money?&#8221; Az-Zubair added, &#8220;O my son! Sell our  property and pay my debts.&#8221; Az-Zubair then willed one-third of his property and  willed one-third of that portion to his sons; namely, &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s sons. He said,  &#8220;One-third of the one third. If any property is left after the payment of the debts,  one-third (of the one-third of what is left) is to be given to your sons.&#8221; (Hisham, a  sub-narrator added, &#8220;Some of the sons of &#8216;Abdullah were equal in age to the sons of  Az-Zubair e.g. Khubaib and &#8216;Abbas. &#8216;Abdullah had nine sons and nine daughters at that  time.&#8221; (The narrator &#8216;Abdullah added:) My father (Az-Zubair) went on drawing my  attention to his debts saying, &#8220;If you should fail to pay part of the debts, appeal  to my Master to help you.&#8221; By Allah! I could not understand what he meant till I  asked, &#8220;O father! Who is your Master?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Allah (is my  Master).&#8221; By Allah, whenever I had any difficulty regarding his debts, I would say,  &#8220;Master of Az-Zubair! Pay his debts on his behalf .&#8221; and Allah would (help me  to) pay it. Az-Zubair was martyred leaving no Dinar or Dirham but two pieces of land, one  of which was (called) Al-Ghaba, and eleven houses in Medina, two in Basra, one in Kufa and  one in Egypt. In fact, the source of the debt which he owed was, that if somebody brought  some money to deposit with him. Az Zubair would say, &#8220;No, (i won&#8217;t keep it as a  trust), but I take it as a debt, for I am afraid it might be lost.&#8221; Az-Zubair was  never appointed governor or collector of the tax of Kharaj or any other similar thing, but  he collected his wealth (from the war booty he gained) during the holy battles he took  part in, in the company of the Prophet, Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar, and &#8216;Uthman. (&#8216;Abdullah bin  Az-Zubair added:) When I counted his debt, it turned to be two million and two hundred  thousand. (The sub-narrator added:) Hakim bin Hizam met Abdullah bin Zubair and asked,  &#8220;O my nephew! How much is the debt of my brother?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah kept it as a secret  and said, &#8220;One hundred thousand,&#8221; Hakim said, &#8220;By Allah! I don&#8217;t think your  property will cover it.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah said to him, &#8220;What if it is two  million and two hundred thousand?&#8221; Hakim said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you can pay it; so  if you are unable to pay all of it, I will help you.&#8221; Az-Zubair had already bought  Al-Ghaba for one hundred and seventy thousand. &#8216;Abdullah sold it for one million and six  hundred thousand. Then he called the people saying, &#8220;Any person who has any money  claim on Az-Zubair should come to us in Al-Ghaba.&#8221; There came to him &#8216;Abdullah bin  Ja&#8217;far whom Az-Zubair owed four hundred thousand. He said to &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair,  &#8220;If you wish I will forgive you the debt.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah (bin Az-Zubair) said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; Then Ibn Ja&#8217;far said, &#8220;If you wish you can defer the payment if you  should defer the payment of any debt.&#8221; Ibn Az-Zubair said, &#8220;No.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah  bin Ja&#8217;far said, &#8220;Give me a piece of the land.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair said (to  him), &#8220;Yours is the land extending from this place to this place.&#8221; So, &#8216;Abdullah  bin Az-Zubair sold some of the property (including the houses) and paid his debt  perfectly, retaining four and a half shares from the land (i.e. Al-Ghaba). He then went to  Mu&#8217;awlya while &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Uthman, Al-Mundhir bin Az-Zubair and Ibn Zam&#8217;a were sitting with  him. Mu&#8217;awiya asked, &#8220;At what price have you appraised Al-Ghaba?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;One hundred thousand for each share,&#8221; Muawiya asked, &#8220;How many shares have  been left?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;Four and a half shares.&#8221; Al-Mundhir bin  Az-Zubair said, &#8220;I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.&#8221; &#8216;Amr  bin &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.&#8221; Ibn  Zam&#8217;a said, &#8220;I would like to buy one share for one hundred thousand.&#8221; Muawiya  said, &#8220;How much is left now?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;One share and a  half.&#8221; Muawiya said, &#8220;I would like to buy it for one hundred and fifty  thousand.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah also sold his part to Muawiya six hundred thousand. When Ibn  AzZubair had paid all the debts. Az-Zubair&#8217;s sons said to him, &#8220;Distribute our  inheritance among us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, by Allah, I will not distribute it among  you till I announce in four successive Hajj seasons, &#8216;Would those who have money claims on  Az-Zubair come so that we may pay them their debt.&#8221; So, he started to announce that  in public in every Hajj season, and when four years had elapsed, he distributed the  inheritance among the inheritors. Az-Zubair had four wives, and after the one-third of his  property was excluded (according to the will), each of his wives received one million and  two hundred thousand. So the total amount of his property was fifty million and two  hundred thousand. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Hawazin delegation came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle after  they had embraced Islam and requested him to return their properties and war prisoners to  them, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;To me the best talk is the truest, so you may choose  either of two things; the war prisoners or the wealth, for I have delayed their  distribution.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle had waited for them for over ten days when he returned  from Ta&#8217;if. So, when those people came to know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was not going to  return to them except one of the two things the said, &#8220;We choose our war Prisoners  &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up amongst the Muslims, and after glorifying Allah as He deserved,  he said, &#8220;Now then, these brothers of yours have come to us with repentance, and I  see it logical that I should return their captives to them, so whoever of you likes to do  that as a favor then he can do it, and whoever amongst you likes to stick to his share,  let him give up his prisoners and we will compensate him from the very first Fai&#8217; (i.e.  war booty received without fight) which Allah will give us.&#8221; On that, all the people  said. &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostles We have agreed willingly to do so (return the captives)&#8221;  Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them &#8220;I do not know who amongst you has agreed to this  and who has not. You should return and let your leaders inform me of your agreement.&#8221;  The people returned and their leaders spoke to them, and then came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and  said, &#8220;All the people have agreed willingly to do so and have given the permission to  return the war prisoners (without Compensation)&#8221; (Az-Zuhri, the sub-narrator states)  This is what has been related to us about the captives of Hawazin. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once we were in the house of Abu Musa who presented a meal  containing cooked chicken. A man from the tribe of Bani Taim Allah with red complexion as  if he were from the Byzantine war prisoners, was present. Abu Musa invited him to share  the meal but he (apologised) saying. &#8220;I saw chickens eating dirty things and so I  have had a strong aversion to eating them, and have taken an oath that I will not eat  chickens.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come along, I will tell you about this matter (i.e.  how to cancel one&#8217;s oat ). I went to the Prophet in the company of a group of  Al-Ashariyin, asked him to provide us with means of conveyance. He said, &#8216;By Allah, I will  not provide you with any means of conveyance and I have nothing to make you ride on.&#8217; Then  some camels as booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he asked for us saying. &#8216;Where  are the group of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyun?&#8217; Then he ordered that we should be given five camels with  white humps. When we set out we said, &#8216;What have we done? We will never be blessed (with  what we have been given).&#8217; So, we returned to the Prophet and said, &#8216;We asked you to  provide us with means of conveyance, but you took an oath that you would not provide us  with any means of conveyance. Did you forget (your oath when you gave us the camels)? He  replied. &#8216;I have not provided you with means of conveyance, but Allah has provided you  with it, and by Allah, Allah willing, if ever I take an oath to do something, and later on  I find that it is more beneficial to do something different, I will do the thing which is  better, and give expiation for my oath.&#8221; </font></p>

We got on board a ship which took  us to An-Najashi in Ethiopia, and there we found Ja&#8217;far bin Abu Talib and his companions  with An-Najaishi. Ja&#8217;far said (to us), &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has sent us here and ordered  us to stay here, so you too, stay with us.&#8221; We stayed with him till we all left  (Ethiopia) and met the Prophet at the time when he had conquered Khaibar. He gave us a  share from its booty (or gave us from its booty). He gave only to those who had taken part  in the Ghazwa with him. but he did not give any share to any person who had not  participated in Khaibar&#8217;s conquest except the people of our ship, besides Ja&#8217;far and his  companions, whom he gave a share as he did them (i.e. the people of the ship). </font></p>

Abu Bakr  ordered somebody to announce, &#8220;Any person who has money claim on Allah&#8217;s Apostle or  whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle had promised something, should come to us.&#8221; So, I went to him  and said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had promised to give me so much an so much.&#8221; Abu Bakr  scooped up money with both hands thrice for me.&#8221; (The sub-narrator Sufyan illustrated  this action by scooping up with both hands and said, &#8220;Ibn Munkadir, another  sub-narrator, used to illustrate it in this way.&#8221;) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: Once I went to Abu Bakr and asked for the  money but he did not give me, and I went to him again, but he did not give me, so I went  to him for the third time and said, &#8220;I asked you, but you did not give me; then I  asked you (for the second time) and you did not give me; then I asked you (for the third  time) but you did not give me. You should either give me or allow yourself to be  considered a miser regarding my case.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;You tell me that I am a  miser with regard to you. But really, whenever I rejected your request, I had the  inclination to give you.&#8221; </font></p>

Do you  know Abu Jahl?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes, What do you want from him, O my nephew?&#8221; He  said, &#8220;I have been informed that he abuses Allah&#8217;s Apostle. By Him in Whose Hands my  life is, if I should see him, then my body will not leave his body till either of us meet  his fate.&#8221; I was astonished at that talk. Then the other boy called my attention  saying the same as the other had said. After a while I saw Abu Jahl walking amongst the  people. I said (to the boys), &#8220;Look! This is the man you asked me about.&#8221; So,  both of them attacked him with their swords and struck him to death and returned to  Allah&#8217;S Apostle to inform him of that. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Which of you has  killed him?&#8221; Each of them said, &#8220;I Have killed him.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked,  &#8220;Have you cleaned your swords?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No. &#8221; He then looked at  their swords and said, &#8220;No doubt, you both have killed him and the spoils of the  deceased will be given to Muadh bin Amr bin Al-Jamuh.&#8221; The two boys were Muadh bin  &#8216;Afra and Muadh bin Amr bin Al-Jamuh. </font></p>

The Prophet again said, &#8220;Anyone who has killed an enemy  and has proof of that, will possess his spoils.&#8221; I (again) got up and said, &#8220;Who  will be a witness for me?&#8221; and sat down. Then the Prophet said the same for the third  time. I again got up, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O Abu Qatada! What is your  story?&#8221; Then I narrated the whole story to him. A man (got up and) said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He is speaking the truth, and the spoils of the killed man are with me.  So please compensate him on my behalf.&#8221; On that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, &#8220;No, by  Allah, he (i.e. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ) will not agree to give you the spoils gained by one of  Allah&#8217;s Lions who fights on the behalf of Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Abu Bakr has spoken the truth.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the spoils to me. I  sold that armor (i.e. the spoils) and with its price I bought a garden at Bani Salima, and  this was my first property which I gained after my conversion to Islam. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Hakim bin Hizam said, &#8220;I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle for  something, and he gave me. I asked him again, and he gave me, and said to me. &#8216;O Hakim!  This wealth is like green sweet (i.e. fruit), and if one takes it without greed, then one  is blessed in it, and if one takes it with greediness, then one is not blessed in it, and  will be like the one who eats without satisfaction. And an upper (i.e. giving) hand is  better than a lower (i.e. taking) hand,&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Him Who has sent  you with the Truth. I will not ask anyone for anything after you till I leave this  world.&#8221; So, when Abu Bakr during his Caliphate, called Hakim to give him (some  money), Hakim refused to accept anything from him. Once &#8216;Umar called him (during his  Caliphate) in order to give him something, but Hakim refused to accept it, whereupon &#8216;Umar  said, &#8220;O Muslims! I give him (i.e. Haklm) his right which Allah has assigned to him)  from this Fai &#8216;(booty), but he refuses to take it.&#8221; So Haklm never took anything from  anybody after the Prophet till he died. </font></p>

When Allah&#8217;s Apostle freed the captives of  Hunain without ransom, they came out walking in the streets. &#8216;Umar said (to his son),  &#8220;O Abdullah! See what is the matter.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle  has freed the captives without ransom.&#8221; He said (to him), &#8220;Go and set free those  two slave girls.&#8221; (Nafi added:) Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not perform the &#8216;Umra from  Al-Jarana, and if he had performed the &#8216;Umra, it would not have been hidden from  &#8216;Abdullah. </font></p>

He is giving to (men of) Quraish and leaves us, in spite of the  fact that our swords are still dropping blood (of the infidels)&#8221; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle  was informed of what they had said, he called the Ansar and gathered them in a leather  tent and did not call anybody else along, with them. When they gathered, Allah&#8217;s Apostle  came to them and said, &#8220;What is the statement which, I have been informed, and that  which you have said?&#8221; The learned ones among them replied,&#8221; O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  The wise ones amongst us did not say anything, but the youngsters amongst us said, &#8216;May  Allah forgive His Apostle; he gives the Quarish and leaves the Ansar, in spite of the fact  that our swords are still dribbling (wet) with the blood of the infidels.&#8217; &#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle replied, I give to such people as are still close to the period of Infidelity  (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam and Faith is still weak in their hearts). Won&#8217;t  you be pleased to see people go with fortune, while you return with Allah&#8217;s Apostle to  your houses? By Allah, what you will return with, is better than what they are returning  with.&#8221; The Ansar replied, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, we are satisfied&#8217; Then the  Prophet said to them.&#8221; You will find after me, others being preferred to you. Then be  patient till you meet Allah and meet His Apostle at Al-Kauthar (i.e. a fount in  Paradise).&#8221; (Anas added:) But we did not remain patient. </font></p>

The head stands for Khosrau, and  one wing stands for Caesar and the other wing stands for Faris. So, order the Muslims to  go towards Khosrau.&#8221; So, &#8216;Umar sent us (to Khosrau) appointing An-Numan bin Muqrin as  our commander.

While we were in this state, the Lord of the Heavens and the Earths,  Elevated is His Remembrance and Majestic is His Highness, sent to us from among ourselves  a Prophet whose father and mother are known to us. Our Prophet, the Messenger of our Lord,  has ordered us to fight you till you worship Allah Alone or give Jizya (i.e. tribute); and  our Prophet has informed us that our Lord says:&#8211; &#8220;Whoever amongst us is killed (i.e.  martyred), shall go to Paradise to lead such a luxurious life as he has never seen, and  whoever amongst us remain alive, shall become your master.&#8221; (Al-Mughira, then blamed  An-Numan for delaying the attack and) An-Nu&#8217; man said to Al-Mughira, &#8220;If you had  participated in a similar battle, in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle he would not have  blamed you for waiting, nor would he have disgraced you. But I accompanied Allah&#8217;s Apostle  in many battles and it was his custom that if he did not fight early by daytime, he would  wait till the wind had started blowing and the time for the prayer was due (i.e. after  midday).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were in the Mosque, the Prophet came out and said,  &#8220;Let us go to the Jews&#8221; We went out till we reached Bait-ul-Midras. He said to  them, &#8220;If you embrace Islam, you will be safe. You should know that the earth belongs  to Allah and His Apostle, and I want to expel you from this land. So, if anyone amongst  you owns some property, he is permitted to sell it, otherwise you should know that the  Earth belongs to Allah and His Apostle.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he heard Ibn &#8216;Abbas saying, &#8220;Thursday! And you  know not what Thursday is? After that Ibn &#8216;Abbas wept till the stones on the ground were  soaked with his tears. On that I asked Ibn &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;What is (about) Thursday?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;When the condition (i.e. health) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle deteriorated, he said,  &#8216;Bring me a bone of scapula, so that I may write something for you after which you will  never go astray.&#8217;The people differed in their opinions although it was improper to differ  in front of a prophet, They said, &#8216;What is wrong with him? Do you think he is delirious?  Ask him (to understand). The Prophet replied, &#8216;Leave me as I am in a better state than  what you are asking me to do.&#8217; Then the Prophet ordered them to do three things saying,  &#8216;Turn out all the pagans from the Arabian Peninsula, show respect to all foreign delegates  by giving them gifts as I used to do.&#8217; &#8221; The sub-narrator added, &#8220;The third  order was something beneficial which either Ibn &#8216;Abbas did not mention or he mentioned but  I forgot.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Khaibar was conquered, a roasted poisoned sheep was  presented to the Prophets as a gift (by the Jews). The Prophet ordered, &#8220;Let all the  Jews who have been here, be assembled before me.&#8221; The Jews were collected and the  Prophet said (to them), &#8220;I am going to ask you a question. Will you tell the truth?&#8221;  They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8217; The Prophet asked, &#8220;Who is your father?&#8221; They replied,  &#8220;So-and-so.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You have told a ie; your father is so-and-so.&#8221;  They said, &#8220;You are right.&#8221; He siad, &#8220;Will you now tell me the truth, if I  ask you about something?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, O AbuAl-Qasim; and if we should  tell a lie, you can realize our lie as you have done regarding our father.&#8221; On that  he asked, &#8220;Who are the people of the (Hell) Fire?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We shall  remain in the (Hell) Fire for a short period, and after that you will replace us.&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;You may be cursed and humiliated in it! By Allah, we shall never  replace you in it.&#8221; Then he asked, &#8220;Will you now tell me the truth if I ask you a  question?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes, O Ab Li-AI-Qasim.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;Have you  poisoned this sheep?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What made you do  so?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We wanted to know if you were a liar in which case we would get  rid of you, and if you are a prophet then the poison would not harm you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Anas about the Qunut (i.e. invocation in the  prayer). Anas said, &#8220;It should be recited before bowing.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;So-and-so claims that you say that it should be recited after bowing.&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;He is mistaken.&#8221; Then Anas narrated to us that the Prophet invoked  evil on the tribe of Bani-Sulaim for one month after bowing. &#8216; Anas Further said,  &#8220;The Prophet had sent 40 or 70 Qaris (i.e. men well versed in the knowledge of the  Qur&#8217;an) to some pagans, but the latter struggled with them and martyred them, although  there was a peace pact between them and the Prophet I had never seen the Prophet so sorry  and worried about anybody as he was about them (i.e. the Qaris).&#8221; </font></p>

I greeted him and he asked, &#8220;Who is that?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I, Um  Hani bint Abi Talib.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Welcome, O Um Hani.&#8221; When he had finished  his bath, he stood up and offered eight Rakat while dressed in one garment. I said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! My brother &#8216;Ali has declared that he will kill a man to whom I  have granted asylum. The man is so and-so bin Hubaira.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Um Hani!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Ali delivered a sermon saying, &#8220;We have no book to  read except the Book of Allah and what is written in this paper which contains verdicts  regarding (retaliation for) wounds, the ages of the camels (given as Zakat or as blood  money) and the fact that Medina is a sanctuary in between Air mountain to so-and-so  (mountain). So, whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin or gives shelter in it,  to such an innovator will incur the Curse of Allah, the angels and all the people, and  none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted. And whoever  (freed slave) takes as his master (i.e. befriends) other than his real masters will incur  the same (Curse). And the asylum granted by any Muslim is to be secured by all the other  Muslims, and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect will incur the same (Curse).&#8221; </font></p>

They parted and later on Muhaiyisa came upon &#8216;Abdullah bin Sah! and found him murdered  agitating in his blood. He buried him and returned to Medina. &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Sahl,  Muhaiyisa and Huwaiuisa, the sons of Mas&#8217;ud came to the Prophet and &#8216;Abdur Rahman intended  to talk, but the Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Let the eldest of you speak.&#8221; as  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman was the youngest:. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman kept silent and the other two spoke. The  Prophet said, &#8220;If you swear as to who has committed the murder, you will have the  right to take your right from the murderer.&#8221; They said, &#8220;How should we swear if  we did not witness the murder or see the murderer?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Then the  Jews can clear themselves from the charge by taking Alaska (an oath taken by men that it  was not they who committed the murder).&#8221; The!y said, &#8220;How should we believe in  the oaths of infidels?&#8221; So, the Prophet himself paid the blood money (of &#8216;Abdullah).

We were with the Prophet on the day of Hudaibiya, and if  we had been called to fight, we would have fought. But &#8216;Umar bin Al Khatab came and said,  &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Aren&#8217;t we in the right and our opponents in the wrongs&#8217; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Aren&#8217;t our killed persons in Paradise and their&#8217;s in  Hell?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Then why should we accept hard terms in matters  concerning our religion?

They stipulated that  he would not stay for more than three days and would not enter it except with sheathed  arms and would not preach (Islam) to any of them. So Ali bin Abi-Talib started writing the  treaty between them. He wrote, &#8220;This is what Muhammad, Apostle of Allah has agreed  to.&#8221; The (Meccans) said, &#8220;If we knew that you (Muhammad) are the Apostle of  Allah, then we would not have prevented you and would have followed you. But write, &#8216;This  is what Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdullah has agreed to..&#8217; &#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;By Allah, I am Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdullah, and, by Allah, I am Apostle of &#8216;Allah.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle used not to write; so he asked &#8216;Ali to erase the expression of Apostle of  Allah. On that &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;By Allah I will never erase it.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said  (to &#8216;Ali), &#8220;Let me see the paper.&#8221; When &#8216;Ali showed him the paper, the Prophet  erased the expression with his own hand. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had entered Mecca and three  days had elapsed, the Meccans came to &#8216;Ali and said, &#8220;Let your friend (i.e. the  Prophet) quit Mecca.&#8221; Ali informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it and Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and then he departed. </font></p>

The Prophet did not  raise his head from prostration till Fatima (i.e. his daughter) came and removed those  intestines from his back, and invoked evil on whoever had done (the evil deed).

So, it is a sanctuary by  Allah&#8217;s Decree till the Day of Resurrection. Fighting in it was not legal for anyone  before me, and it was made legal for me only for an hour by daytime. So, it (i.e. Mecca)  is a sanctuary by Allah&#8217;s Decree till the Day of Resurrection. Its thorny bushes should  not be cut, and its game should not be chased, its fallen property (i.e. Luqata) should  not be picked up except by one who will announce it publicly; and its grass should not be  uprooted,&#8221; On that Al-&#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Except the Idhkhir,  because it is used by the goldsmiths and by the people for their houses.&#8221; On that the  Prophet said, &#8220;Except the Idhkhir.&#8221; </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Divorce</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.063.178"></a>Volume 7, Book 63, Number 178:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he had divorced his wife while she was menstruating during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Order him (your son) to take her back and keep her till she is clean and then to wait till she gets her next period and becomes clean again, whereupon, if he wishes to keep her, he can do so, and if he wishes to divorce her he can divorce her before having sexual intercourse with her; and that is the prescribed period which Allah has fixed for the women meant to be divorced.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 179:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Sirin:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar said: &#8220;I divorced my wife while she was menstruating. &#8216;Umar mentioned that to the Prophet . The Prophet said, (to my father), &#8220;Let your son take her back.&#8221; I asked (Ibn &#8216;Umar), &#8220;Is such a divorce counted (i.e. as one legal divorce)?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Of course.&#8221; Narrated Yunus bin Jubair: Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet said to &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Order him (Ibn &#8216;Umar) to take her back.&#8217; &#8221; I asked, &#8220;Is such a divorce counted (as one legal divorce)?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;What do you think if someone becomes helpless and foolish?&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 180:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Divorcing my wife during her menses) was counted as one legal divorce.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 181:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Awza:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Az-Zuhri, &#8220;Which of the wives of the Prophet sought refuge with Allah from him?&#8221; He said &#8220;I was told by &#8216;Ursa that &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;When the daughter of Al-Jaun was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (as his bride) and he went near her, she said, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You have sought refuge with The Great; return to your family.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 182:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Usaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with the Prophet to a garden called Ash-Shaut till we reached two walls between which we sat down. The Prophet said, &#8220;Sit here,&#8221; and went in (the garden). The Jauniyya (a lady from Bani Jaun) had been brought and lodged in a house in a date-palm garden in the home of Umaima bint An-Nu&#8217;man bin Sharahil, and her wet nurse was with her. When the Prophet entered upon her, he said to her, &#8220;Give me yourself (in marriage) as a gift.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Can a princess give herself in marriage to an ordinary man?&#8221; The Prophet raised his hand to pat her so that she might become tranquil. She said, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from you.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You have sought refuge with One Who gives refuge. Then the Prophet came out to us and said, &#8220;O Abu Usaid! Give her two white linen dresses to wear and let her go back to her family.&#8221; Narrated Sahl and Abu Usaid: The Prophet married Umaima bint Sharahil, and when she was brought to him, he stretched his hand towards her. It seemed that she disliked that, whereupon the Prophet ordered Abu Usaid to prepare her and to provide her with two white linen dresses. (See Hadith No. 541).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 183:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">similarly as above (182).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 184:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abi Ghallab Yunus bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Ibn &#8216;Umar,&#8221;(What is said regarding) a man divorces his wife during her period?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Do you know Ibn &#8216;Umar? Ibn &#8216;Umar divorced his wife while she was menstruating. &#8216;Umar then went to the Prophet and mentioned that to him. The Prophet ordered him to take her back and when she became clean, he could divorce her if he wanted.&#8221; I asked (Ibn &#8216;Umar), &#8220;Was that divorce counted as one legal divorce?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If one becomes helpless and foolish (will he be excused? Of course not). &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 185:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa&#8217;idi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Uwaimir Al-&#8216;Ajlani came to &#8216;Asim bin Adi Al-Ansari and asked, &#8220;O &#8216;Asim! Tell me, if a man sees his wife with another man, should he kill him, whereupon you would kill him in Qisas, or what should he do? O &#8216;Asim! Please ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that.&#8221; &#8216;Asim asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that. Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked that question and considered it disgraceful. What &#8216;Asim heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle was hard on him. When he returned to his family, &#8216;Uwaimir came to him and said &#8220;O &#8216;Asim! What did Allah&#8217;s Apostle say to you?&#8221; &#8216;Asim said, &#8220;You never bring me any good. Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked to hear the problem which I asked him about.&#8221; &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not leave the matter till I ask him about it.&#8221; So &#8216;Uwaimir proceeded till he came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was in the midst of the people and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If a man finds with his wife another man, should he kill him, whereupon you would kill him (in Qisas): or otherwise, what should he do?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has revealed something concerning the question of you and your wife. Go and bring her here.&#8221; So they both carried out the judgment of Lian, while I was present among the people (as a witness). When both of them had finished, &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I should now keep my wife with me, then I have told a lie&#8221;. Then he pronounced his decision to divorce her thrice before Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to do so. (Ibn Shihab said, &#8220;That was the tradition for all those who are involved in a case of Lian.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 186:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wife of Rifa&#8217;a Al-Qurazi came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Rifa&#8217;a divorced me irrevocably. After him I married &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Az-Zubair Al-Qurazi who proved to be impotent.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to her, &#8220;Perhaps you want to return to Rifa&#8217;a? Nay (you cannot return to Rifa&#8217;a) until you and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman consummate your marriage.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 187:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man divorced his wife thrice (by expressing his decision to divorce her thrice), then she married another man who also divorced her. The Prophet was asked if she could legally marry the first husband (or not). The Prophet replied, &#8220;No, she cannot marry the first husband unless the second husband consummates his marriage with her, just as the first husband had done.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 188:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave us the option (to remain with him or to be divorced) and we selected Allah and His Apostle . So, giving us that option was not regarded as divorce.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 189:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Musruq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha about the option: She said, &#8220;The Prophet gave us the option. Do you think that option was considered as a divorce?&#8221; I said, &#8220;It matters little to me if I give my wife the option once or a hundred times after she has chosen me.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 190:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man divorced his wife and she married another man who proved to be impotent and divorced her. She could not get her satisfaction from him, and after a while he divorced her. Then she came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! My first husband divorced me and then I married another man who entered upon me to consummate his marriage but he proved to be impotent and did not approach me except once during which he benefited nothing from me. Can I remarry my first husband in this case?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It is unlawful to marry your first husband till the other husband consummates his marriage with you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 191:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he heard Ibn &#8216;Abbas saying, &#8220;If a man makes his wife unlawful for him, it does not mean that she is divorced.&#8221; He added, &#8220;Indeed in the Apostle of Allah , you have a good example to follow.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 192:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ubaid bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard &#8216;Aisha saying, &#8220;The Prophet used to stay for a long while with Zanab bint Jahsh and drink honey at her house. So Hafsa and I decided that if the Prophet came to anyone of us, she should say him, &#8220;I detect the smell of Maghafir (a nasty smelling gum) in you. Have you eaten Maghafir?&#8217; &#8221; So the Prophet visited one of them and she said to him similarly. The Prophet said, &#8220;Never mind, I have taken some honey at the house of Zainab bint Jahsh, but I shall never drink of it anymore.&#8221; So there was revealed: &#8216;O Prophet ! Why do you ban (for you) that which Allah has made lawful for you . . . If you two (wives of Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah,&#8217; (66.1-4) addressing Aisha and Hafsa. &#8216;When the Prophet disclosed a matter in confidence to some of his wives.&#8217; (66.3) namely his saying: But I have taken some honey.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle was fond of honey and sweet edible things and (it was his habit) that after finishing the &#8216;Asr prayer he would visit his wives and stay with one of them at that time. Once he went to Hafsa, the daughter of &#8216;Umar and stayed with her more than usual. I got jealous and asked the reason for that. I was told that a lady of her folk had given her a skin filled with honey as a present, and that she made a syrup from it and gave it to the Prophet to drink (and that was the reason for the delay). I said, &#8220;By Allah we will play a trick on him (to prevent him from doing so).&#8221; So I said to Sada bint Zam&#8217;a &#8220;The Prophet will approach you, and when he comes near you, say: &#8216;Have you taken Maghafir (a bad-smelling gum)?&#8217; He will say, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then say to him: &#8216;Then what is this bad smell which i smell from you?&#8217; He will say to you, &#8216;Hafsa made me drink honey syrup.&#8217; Then say: Perhaps the bees of that honey had sucked the juice of the tree of Al-&#8216;Urfut.&#8217; I shall also say the same. O you, Safiyya, say the same.&#8221; Later Sada said, &#8220;By Allah, as soon as he (the Prophet ) stood at the door, I was about to say to him what you had ordered me to say because I was afraid of you.&#8221; So when the Prophet came near Sada, she said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Have you taken Maghafir?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; She said. &#8220;Then what is this bad smell which I detect on you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Hafsa made me drink honey syrup.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Perhaps its bees had sucked the juice of Al-&#8216;Urfut tree.&#8221; When he came to me, I also said the same, and when he went to Safiyya, she also said the same. And when the Prophet again went to Hafsa, she said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I give you more of that drink?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am not in need of it.&#8221; Sada said, &#8220;By Allah, we deprived him (of it).&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;Keep quiet.&#8221; &#8216;</p>

The Prophet turned his face (from him) to the other side again. The man moved again (and repeated his statement) for the fourth time. So when the man had given witness four times against himself, the Prophet called him and said, &#8220;Are you insane?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The Prophet then said (to his companions), &#8220;Go and stone him to death.&#8221; The man was a married one. Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah Al-Ansari said: I was one of those who stoned him. We stoned him at the Musalla (&#8216;Id praying place) in Medina.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 210:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pagans were of two kinds as regards their relationship to the Prophet and the Believers. Some of them were those with whom the Prophet was at war and used to fight against, and they used to fight him; the others were those with whom the Prophet made a treaty, and neither did the Prophet fight them, nor did they fight him. If a lady from the first group of pagans emigrated towards the Muslims, her hand would not be asked in marriage unless she got the menses and then became clean. When she became clean, it would be lawful for her to get married, and if her husband emigrated too before she got married, then she would be returned to him. If any slave or female slave emigrated from them to the Muslims, then they would be considered free persons (not slaves) and they would have the same rights as given to other emigrants. The narrator then mentioned about the pagans involved with the Muslims in a treaty, the same as occurs in Mujahid&#8217;s narration. If a male slave or a female slave emigrated from such pagans as had made a treaty with the Muslims, they would not be returned, but their prices would be paid (to the pagans). Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: Qariba, the daughter of Abi Umaiyya, was the wife of &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. &#8216;Umar divorced her and then Mu&#8217;awiyya bin Abi Sufyan married her. Similarly, Um Al-Hakam, the daughter of Abi Sufyan was the wife of &#8216;Iyad bin Ghanm Al-Fihri. He divorced her and then &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Uthman Al-Thaqafi married her.</p>

When believing women come to you as emigrants, examine them . . .&#8217; (60.10) So if anyone of those believing women accepted the above mentioned conditions, she accepted the conditions of faith. When they agreed on those conditions and confessed that with their tongues, Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say to them, &#8220;Go, I have accepted your oath of allegiance (for Islam). By Allah, and hand of Allah&#8217;s Apostle never touched the hand of any woman, but he only used to take their pledge of allegiance orally. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not take the pledge of allegiance of the women except in accordance with what Allah had ordered him. When he accepted their pledge of allegiance he would say to them, &#8220;I have accepted your oath of allegiance.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Uwaimir Al-Ajlani came to &#8216;Asim bin Ad Al-Ansari and said to him, &#8220;O &#8216;Asim! Suppose a man saw another man with his wife, would he kill him whereupon you would kill him; or what should he do? Please, O &#8216;Asim, ask about this on my behalf.&#8221; &#8216;Asim asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, disliked that question and considered it disgraceful. What &#8216;Asim heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle was hard on him. When &#8216;Asim returned to his family, &#8216;Uwaimir came to him and said, &#8220;O &#8216;Asim! What did Allah&#8217;s Apostle. say to you?&#8221; &#8216;Asim said to &#8216;Uwaimir, &#8220;You never bring me any good. Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked the problem which I asked him about.&#8221; &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;By Allah, I will not give up this matter until I ask the Prophet about it.&#8221; So &#8216;Uwaimir proceeded till he came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the midst of people, and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If a man sees another man with his wife, would he kill him, whereupon you would kill him, or what should he do?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah has revealed some decree as regards you and your wives case. Go and bring her.&#8221; So they carried out the process of Lian while I was present among the people with Allah&#8217;s Apostle. When they had finished their Lian, &#8216;Uwaimir said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I should now keep her with me as a wife, then I have told a lie.&#8221; So he divorced her thrice before Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him. (Ibn Shihab said: So divorce was the tradition for all those who were involved in a case of Lian.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Juraij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Shihab informed me of Lian and the tradition related to it, referring to the narration of Sahl bin Sad, the brother of Bani Sa&#8217;idi He said, &#8220;An Ansari man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If a man saw another man with his wife, should he kill him, or what should he do?&#8217; So Allah revealed concerning his affair what is mentioned in the Holy Quran about the affair of those involved in a case of Lian. The Prophet said, &#8216;Allah has given His verdict regarding you and your wife.&#8217; So they carried out Lian in the mosque while I was present there. When they had finished, the man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! If I should now keep her with me as a wife then I have told a lie about her. Then he divorced her thrice before Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him, when they had finished the Lian process. So he divorced her in front of the Prophet .&#8221; Ibn Shihab added, &#8220;After their case, it became a tradition that a couple involved in a case of Lian should be separated by divorce. That lady was pregnant then, and later on her son was called by his mother&#8217;s name. The tradition concerning their inheritance was that she would be his heir and he would inherit of her property the share Allah had prescribed for him.&#8221; Ibn Shihab said that Sahl bin Sad As&#8217;Saidi said that the Prophet said (in the above narration), &#8220;If that lady delivers a small red child like a lizard, then the lady has spoken the truth and the man was a liar, but if she delivers a child with black eyes and huge lips, then her husband has spoken the truth.&#8221; Then she delivered it in the shape one would dislike (as it proved her guilty).</p>

Then a man from his tribe came to him, complaining that he had found a man width his wife. &#8216;Asim said, &#8216;I have not been put to task except for my statement (about Lian).&#8217; &#8216;Asim took the man to the Prophet and the man told him of the state in which he had found his wife. The man was pale, thin, and of lank hair, while the other man whom he claimed he had seen with his wife, was brown, fat and had much flesh on his calves. The Prophet invoked, saying, &#8216;O Allah! Reveal the truth.&#8217; So that lady delivered a child resembling the man whom her husband had mentioned he had found her with. The Prophet then made them carry out Lian.&#8221; Then a man from that gathering asked Ibn &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;Was she the same lady regarding which the Prophet had said, &#8216;If I were to stone to death someone without witness, I would have stoned this lady&#8217;?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;No, that was another lady who, though being a Muslim, used to arouse suspicion by her outright misbehavior. &#8220;</p>

Um ,Habiba asked for a perfume which contained yellow scent (Khaluq) or some other scent, and she first perfumed one of the girls with it and then rubbed her cheeks with it and said, &#8220;By Allah, I am not in need of perfume, but I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;It is not lawful for a lady who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for a dead person for more than three days unless he is her husband for whom she should mourn for four months and ten days.&#8217; &#8221; Zainab further said: I want to Zainab bint Jahsh when her brother died. She asked for perfume and used some of it and said, &#8220;By Allah, I am not in need of perfume, but I have heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying on the pulpit, &#8216;It is not lawful for a lady who believes in Allah and the last day to mourn for more than three days except for her husband for whom she should mourn for four months and ten days.&#8217; &#8221; Zainab further said, &#8220;I heard my mother, Um Salama saying that a woman came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The husband of my daughter has died and she is suffering from an eye disease, can she apply kohl to her eye?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;No,&#8221; twice or thrice. (Every time she repeated her question) he said, &#8220;No.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;It is just a matter of four months and ten days. In the Pre-Islamic Period of ignorance a widow among you should throw a globe of dung when one year has elapsed.&#8221; I said to Zainab, &#8220;What does &#8216;throwing a globe of dung when one year had elapsed&#8217; mean?&#8221; Zainab said, &#8220;When a lady was bereaved of her husband, she would live in a wretched small room and put on the worst clothes she had and would not touch any scent till one year had elapsed. Then she would bring an animal, e.g. a donkey, a sheep or a bird and rub her body against it. The animal against which she would rub her body would scarcely survive. Only then she would come out of her room, whereupon she would be given a globe of dung which she would throw away and then she would use the scent she liked or the like.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(regarding the Verse): &#8216;If any of you dies and leaves wives behind,&#8217; That was the period of the &#8216;Iddah which the widow was obliged to spend in the house of the late husband. Then Allah revealed: And those of you who die and leave wives should bequeath for their wives a year&#8217;s maintenance and residence without turning them out, but if they leave, there is no blame on you for what they do of themselves, provided it is honorable (i.e. lawful marriage) (2.240) Mujahid said: Allah has ordered that a widow has the right to stay for seven months and twenty days with her husband&#8217;s relatives through her husband&#8217;s will and testament so that she will complete the period of one year (of &#8216;Iddah). But the widow has the right to stay that extra period or go out of her husband&#8217;s house as is indicated by the statement of Allah: &#8216;But if they leave there is no blame on you,&#8230; &#8216; (2.240) Ibn &#8216;Abbas said: The above Verse has cancelled the order of spending the period of the &#8216;Iddah at her late husband&#8217;s house, and so she could spend her period of the &#8216;Iddah wherever she likes. And Allah says: &#8216;Without turning them out.&#8217; &#8216;Ata said: If she would, she could spend her period of the &#8216;Iddah at her husband&#8217;s house, and live there according to her (husband&#8217;s) will and testament, and if she would, she could go out (of her husband&#8217;s house) as Allah says: &#8216;There is no blame on you for what they do of themselves.&#8217; (2.240) &#8216;Ata added: Then the Verses of inheritance were revealed and the order of residence (for the widow) was cancelled, and she could spend her period of the &#8216;Iddah wherever she would like, and she was no longer entitled to be accommodated by her husband&#8217;s family.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 257:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zainab bint Um Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Um Habiba bint Abi Sufyan was informed of her father&#8217;s death, she asked for perfume and rubbed it over her arms and said, &#8220;I am not in need of perfume, but I have heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;It is not lawful for a lady who believes in Allah and the Last Day to mourn for more than three days except for her husband for whom the (mourning) period is four months and ten days.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 258:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Mas&#8217;ud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet prohibited taking the price of a dog, the earnings of a soothsayer and the money earned by prostitution.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 259:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Juhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet cursed the lady who practices tattooing and the one who gets herself tattooed, and one who eats (takes) Riba&#8217; (usury) and the one who gives it. And he prohibited taking the price of a dog, and the money earned by prostitution, and cursed the makers of pictures.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 260:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet forbade taking the earnings of a slave girl by prostitution.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 261:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Jubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to Ibn &#8216;Umar, &#8220;If a man accuses his wife of illegal sexual intercourse (what is the judgment)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Prophet separated the couple of Bani &#8216;Ajlan (when the husband accused his wife for an illegal sexual intercourse). The Prophet said, &#8216;Allah knows that one of you two IS a liar; so will one of you repent?&#8217; But they refused. He then again said, &#8216;Allah knows that one of you two is a liar; so will one of you repent?&#8217; But they refused, whereupon he separated them by divorce.&#8221; Aiyub (a sub-narrator) said: &#8216;Amr bin Dinar said to me, &#8220;In the narration there is something which I do not see you mentioning, i.e. the husband said, &#8220;What about my money (Mahr)?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8220;You are not entitled to take back money, for if you told the truth you have already entered upon her (and consummated your marriage with her) and if you are a liar then you are less entitled to take it back.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 63, Number 262:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said to those who were involved in a case of Lian, &#8220;Your accounts are with Allah. One of you two is a liar. You (husband) have right on her (wife).&#8221; The husband said, &#8220;My money, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">said, &#8220;You are not entitled to take back any money. If you have told the truth, the Mahr that you paid, was for having sexual relations with her lawfully; and if you are a liar, then you are less entitled to get it back.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rabi bin Hirash: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amr said to Hudhaifa, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you relate to  us of what you have heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I heard him saying,  &#8220;When Al-Dajjal appears, he will have fire and water along with him. What the people  will consider as cold water, will be fire that will burn (things). So, if anyone of you  comes across this, he should fall in the thing which will appear to him as fire, for in  reality, it will be fresh cold water.&#8221; Hudhaifa added, &#8220;I also heard him saying,  &#8216;From among the people preceding your generation, there was a man whom the angel of death  visited to capture his soul. (So his soul was captured) and he was asked if he had done  any good deed.&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I don&#8217;t remember any good deed.&#8217; He was asked to think it  over. He said, &#8216;I do not remember, except that I used to trade with the people in the  world and I used to give a respite to the rich and forgive the poor (among my debtors). So  Allah made him enter Paradise.&#8221; Hudhaifa further said, &#8220;I also heard him saying,  &#8216;Once there was a man on his death-bed, who, losing every hope of surviving said to his  family: When I die, gather for me a large heap of wood and make a fire (to burn me). When  the fire eats my meat and reaches my bones, and when the bones burn, take and crush them  into powder and wait for a windy day to throw it (i.e. the powder) over the sea. They did  so, but Allah collected his particles and asked him: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Why did you do so? He replied: For fear of You. So Allah  forgave him.&#8221; &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amr said, &#8220;I heard him saying that the Israeli used to  dig the grave of the dead (to steal their shrouds).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha and Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On his death-bed Allah&#8217;s Apostle put a sheet over his-face  and when he felt hot, he would remove it from his face. When in that state (of putting and  removing the sheet) he said, &#8220;May Allah&#8217;s Curse be on the Jews and the Christians for  they build places of worship at the graves of their prophets.&#8221; (By that) he intended  to warn (the Muslim) from what they (i.e. Jews and Christians) had done. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 661: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The Israelis used to be ruled and  guided by prophets: Whenever a prophet died, another would take over his place. There will  be no prophet after me, but there will be Caliphs who will increase in number.&#8221; The  people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do you order us (to do)?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Obey the one who will be given the pledge of allegiance first. Fulfil their (i.e.  the Caliphs) rights, for Allah will ask them about (any shortcoming) in ruling those Allah  has put under their guardianship.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 662: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;You will follow the wrong ways, of  your predecessors so completely and literally that if they should go into the hole of a  mastigure, you too will go there.&#8221; We said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you mean the  Jews and the Christians?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Whom else?&#8221; (Meaning, of course, the  Jews and the Christians.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 663: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people mentioned the fire and the bell (as means  proposed for announcing the time of prayer) and by such a suggestion they referred to the  Jews and the Christians. But Bilal was ordered, &#8220;Pronounce the words of the Adhan  (i.e. call for the prayer) twice and the Iqama once only.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That she used to hate that one should keep his hands on his  flanks while praying. She said that the Jew used to do so. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 665: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Your period (i.e. the Muslims&#8217;  period) in comparison to the periods of the previous nations, is like the period between  the &#8216;Asr prayer and sunset. And your example in comparison to the Jews and the Christians  is like the example of a person who employed some laborers and asked them, &#8216;Who will work  for me till midday for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Jews worked for half a day for one Qirat each.  The person asked, &#8216;Who will do the work for me from midday to the time of the &#8216;Asr  (prayer) for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Christians worked from midday till the &#8216;Asr prayer for  one Qirat. Then the person asked, &#8216;Who will do the work for me from the &#8216;Asr till sunset  for two Qirats each?&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;It is you (i.e. Muslims) who are  doing the work from the Asr till sunset, so you will have a double reward. The Jews and  the Christians got angry and said, &#8216;We have done more work but got less wages.&#8217; Allah  said, &#8216;Have I been unjust to you as regards your rights?&#8217; They said, &#8216;No.&#8217; So Allah said,  &#8216;Then it is My Blessing which I bestow on whomever I like. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Allah willed to  test three Israelis who were a Leper, a blind man and a bald-headed man. So, he sent them  an angel who came to the leper and said, &#8216;What thing do you like most?&#8217; He replied,  &#8220;Good color and good skin, for the people have a strong aversion to me.&#8217; The angel  touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given a good color and beautiful skin.  The angel asked him, &#8216;What kind of property do you like best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Camels (or  cows).&#8217; (The narrator is in doubt, for either the leper or the bald-headed man demanded  camels and the other demanded cows.) So he (i.e. the leper) was given a pregnant  she-camei, and the angel said (to him), &#8216;May Allah bless you in it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, &#8216;What  thing do you like most?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease,  for the people feel repulsion for me.&#8217; The angel touched him and his illness was cured,  and he was given good hair. The angel asked (him), &#8216;What kind of property do you like  bests&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Cows,&#8217; The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, &#8216;May Allah bless  you in it.&#8217; The angel went to the blind man and asked, &#8216;What thing do you like best?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;(I like) that Allah may restore my eye-sight to me so that I may see the people.&#8217;  The angel touched his eyes and Allah gave him back his eye-sight. The angel asked him,  &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Sheep.&#8217; The angel gave him a  pregnant sheep. Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and  multiplied and brought forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels  filling a valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of  sheep filling a valley. Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper,  went to the leper and said, I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on  a journey. So none will satisfy my need except Allah and then you. In the Name of Him Who  has given you such nice color and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give  me a camel so that I may reach my destination. The man replied, &#8216;I have many obligations  (so I cannot give you).&#8217; The angel said, &#8216;I think I know you; were you not a leper to whom  the people had a strong aversion? Weren&#8217;t you a poor man, and then Allah gave you (all  this property).&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(This is all wrong), I got this property through inheritance  from my fore-fathers&#8217; The angel said, &#8216;If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you  as you were before. &#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a  bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he  too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said, &#8216;If you are telling a lie,  then let Allah make you as you were before.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to  the blind man and said, &#8216;I am a poor man and a traveler, whose means of livelihood have  been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help me except Allah, and after Him,  you yourself. I ask you in the Name of Him Who has given you back your eye-sight to give  me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my journey&#8217; The man said, &#8216;No doubt, I  was blind and Allah gave me back my eye-sight; I was poor and Allah made me rich; so take  anything you wish from my property. By Allah, I will not stop you for taking anything (you  need) of my property which you may take for Allah&#8217;s sake.&#8217; The angel replied, &#8216;Keep your  property with you. You (i.e 3 men) have been tested and Allah is pleased with you and is  angry with your two companions.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 671: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Once three persons (from the  previous nations) were traveling, and suddenly it started raining and they took shelter in  a cave. The entrance of the cave got closed while they were inside. They said to each  other, &#8216;O you! Nothing can save you except the truth, so each of you should ask Allah&#8217;s  Help by referring to such a deed as he thinks he did sincerely (i.e. just for gaining  Allah&#8217;s Pleasure).&#8217; So one of them said, &#8216;O Allah! You know that I had a laborer who  worked for me for one Faraq (i.e. three Sas) of rice, but he departed, leaving it (i.e.  his wages). I sowed that Faraq of rice and with its yield I bought cows (for him). Later  on when he came to me asking for his wages, I said (to him), &#8216;Go to those cows and drive  them away.&#8217; He said to me, &#8216;But you have to pay me only a Faraq of rice,&#8217; I said to him,  &#8216;Go to those cows and take them, for they are the product of that Faraq (of rice).&#8217; So he  drove them. O Allah! If you consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove  the rock.&#8217; The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. The second one said, &#8216;O  Allah, You know that I had old parents whom I used to provide with the milk of my sheep  every night. One night I was delayed and when I came, they had slept, while my wife and  children were crying with hunger. I used not to let them (i.e. my family) drink unless my  parents had drunk first. So I disliked to wake them up and also disliked that they should  sleep without drinking it, I kept on waiting (for them to wake) till it dawned. O Allah!  If You consider that I did that for fear of you, then please remove the rock.&#8217; So the rock  shifted and they could see the sky through it. The (third) one said, &#8216;O Allah! You know  that I had a cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle&#8217;s daughter) who was most beloved to me and I  sought to seduce her, but she refused, unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars (i.e. gold  pieces). So I collected the amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to sleep with  her. But when I sat between her legs, she said, &#8216;Be afraid of Allah, and do not deflower  me but legally. &#8216;I got up and left the hundred Dinars (for her). O Allah! If You consider  that I did that for fear of you than please remove the rock. So Allah saved them and they  came out (of the cave).&#8221; (This Hadith indicates that one can only ask Allah for help  directly or through his performed good deeds. But to ask Allah through dead or absent  prophets, saints, spirits, holy men, angels etc. is absolutely forbidden in Islam and it  is a kind of disbelief.) </font></p>

(After a while) they passed by a lady who was  being pulled and teased (by the people). The child&#8217;s mother said, &#8216;O Allah! Do not make my  child like her.&#8217; The child said, &#8216;O Allah! Make me like her.&#8217; Then he said, &#8216;As for the  rider, he is an infidel, while the lady is accused of illegal sexual intercourse (falsely)  and she says: Allah is sufficient for me (He knows the truth).&#8221; </font></p>

Then he set out asking (whether his  repentance could be accepted or not). He came upon a monk and asked him if his repentance  could be accepted. The monk replied in the negative and so the man killed him. He kept on  asking till a man advised to go to such and such village. (So he left for it) but death  overtook him on the way. While dying, he turned his chest towards that village (where he  had hoped his repentance would be accepted), and so the angels of mercy and the angels of  punishment quarrelled amongst themselves regarding him. Allah ordered the village (towards  which he was going) to come closer to him, and ordered the village (whence he had come),  to go far away, and then He ordered the angels to measure the distances between his body  and the two villages. So he was found to be one span closer to the village (he was going  to). So he was forgiven.&#8221; </font></p>

A cow speaks!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I believe this, and Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar  too, believe it, although neither of them was present there. While a person was amongst  his sheep, a wolf attacked and took one of the sheep. The man chased the wolf till he  saved it from the wolf, where upon the wolf said, &#8216;You have saved it from me; but who will  guard it on the day of the wild beasts when there will be no shepherd to guard them except  me (because of riots and afflictions)? &#8216; &#8221; The people said surprisingly,  &#8220;Glorified be Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A man used to do sinful deeds, and  when death came to him, he said to his sons, &#8216;After my death, burn me and then crush me,  and scatter the powder in the air, for by Allah, if Allah has control over me, He will  give me such a punishment as He has never given to anyone else.&#8217; When he died, his sons  did accordingly. Allah ordered the earth saying, &#8216;Collect what you hold of his particles.&#8217;  It did so, and behold! There he was (the man) standing. Allah asked (him), &#8216;What made you  do what you did?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;O my Lord! I was afraid of You.&#8217; So Allah forgave him.  &#8221; Another narrator said &#8220;The man said, Fear of You, O Lord!&#8221; </font></p>

It is incumbent on every  Muslim to wash his head and body on a Day (i.e. Friday) (at least) in every seven  days.&#8221; </font></p>

Az-Zuhriyun, the uncles  of the Prophet, including &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abd Yaghuth and Al-Miswar bin  Makhrama said to him, &#8220;When we ask for the permission to visit her, enter her house  along with us (without taking her leave).&#8221; He did accordingly (and she accepted their  intercession). He sent her ten slaves whom she manumitted as an expiation for (not  keeping) her vow. &#8216;Aisha manumitted more slaves for the same purpose till she manumitted  forty slaves.

A large  number of emigrants joined him and among the emigrants there was a person who used to play  jokes (or play with spears); so he (jokingly) stroked an Ansari man on the hip. The  Ans-ari got so angry that both of them called their people. The Ansari said, &#8220;Help, O  Ansar!&#8221; And the emigrant said &#8220;Help, O emigrants!&#8221; The Prophet came out and  said, &#8220;What is wrong with the people (as they are calling) this call of the period of  Ignorance? &#8220;Then he said, &#8220;What is the matter with them?&#8221; So he was told  about the stroke of the emigrant to the Ansari. The Prophet said, &#8220;Stop this (i.e.  appeal for help) for it is an evil call. &#8220;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul (a hypocrite)  said, &#8220;The emigrants have called and (gathered against us); so when we return to  Medina, surely, the more honorable people will expel therefrom the meaner,&#8221; Upon that  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Shall we not kill this evil person (i.e. Abdullah bin  Ubai bin Salul) ?&#8221; The Prophet) said, &#8220;(No), lest the people should say that  Muhammad used to kill his companions.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Bahira was an animal whose milk was spared for the idols  and other dieties, and so nobody was allowed to milk it. As-Saiba was an animal which they  (i.e infidels) used to set free in the names of their gods so that it would not be used  for carrying anything. Abu Huraira said, &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8216;I saw Amr bin &#8216;Amir bin  Luhai Al-Khuzai dragging his intestines in the (Hell) Fire, for he was the first man who  started the custom of releasing animals (for the sake of false gods).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the news of the advent of the Prophet reached Abu  Dhar, he said to his brother, &#8220;Ride to this valley and bring me the news of this man  (i.e. the Prophet ) who claims to be a Prophet receiving information from the Heaven.  Listen to him and then come to me.&#8221; His brother set out till he met the Prophet and  listened to his speech and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him, &#8220;I have seen him  exhorting people to virtues and his speech was not like poetry.&#8221; Abu Dhar said,  &#8220;You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted.&#8221; So, he took his journey-food  and a water-skin full of water and set out till he reached Mecca, where he went to the  Mosque looking for the Prophet , whom he did not know, and he would not like to ask  someone about him. So, a portion of the night had passed when &#8216;Ali saw him and realized  that he was a stranger. Abu Dhar followed him (to his house), but neither of them asked  the other about anything till it was morning, when he carried his water-skin and food and  went to the Mosque. He spent that day without being observed by the Prophet till it was  night, when he returned to his sleeping place. &#8216;Ali again passed by him and said,  &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t the man (i.e. Abu Dhar) recognized his dwelling place yet?&#8221; So, &#8216;Ali let  him get up and took him (to his house), but neither of them asked the other about  anything, till it was the third day when &#8216;Ali had the same experience with him and Abu  Dhar again stayed with him. &#8216;Ali then asked, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me what has brought you  here?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you give me a promise and a convention that you will  guide me, then I will tell you.&#8221; When &#8216;Ali did, Abu Dhar informed him (of his  purpose). &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;It is the Truth, and he (i.e. Muhammad) is the Apostle of  Allah. So when the morning comes, follow me, and if I should perceive any danger  threatening you, I will give you a hint by pretending to go to the watercloset. But if I  carried on walking, follow me till you enter the place that I will enter.&#8221; Abu Dhur  agreed and followed &#8216;Ali till he entered the place of the Prophet and Abu Dhur entered  with him. He then listened to the speech of the Prophet and embraced Islam on that very  spot. The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go back to your people and inform them (of this  religion) till you receive my (further) orders.&#8221; Abu Dhur said, &#8220;By Him in Whose  Hands my life is! I will proclaim my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e.  infidels).&#8221; He went out till he reached the Mosque and announced as loudly as  possible, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that  Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The people then got up and beat him till they  knocked him down. Al-Abbas came and threw himself over him (to protect him) saying, Woe to  you! Don&#8217;t you know that he is from Ghifar and there is the route (road) to your merchants  towards Sham (i.e. through the place where this tribe dwells)?&#8221; Thus he saved him  from them. Abu Dhar did the same on the next day and the people beat him again and  Al-&#8216;Abbas drew himself over him (to save him as before). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Jamra: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas said to us, &#8220;Shall I tell you the story of  Abu Dhar&#8217;s conversion to Islam?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Dhar  said: I was a man from the tribe of Ghifar. We heard that a man had appeared in Mecca,  claiming to be a Prophet. ! said to my brother, &#8216;Go to that man and talk to him and bring  me his news.&#8217; He set out, met him and returned. I asked him, &#8216;What is the news with you?&#8217;  He said, &#8216;By Allah, I saw a man enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.&#8217; I  said to him, &#8216;You have not satisfied me with this little information.&#8217; So, I took a  waterskin and a stick and proceeded towards Mecca. Neither did I know him (i.e. the  Prophet ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. I Kept on drinking Zam zam water and  staying in the Mosque. Then &#8216;Ali passed by me and said, &#8216;It seems you are a stranger?&#8217; I  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did he ask me  anything, nor did I tell him anything. Next morning I went to the Mosque to ask about the  Prophet but no-one told me anything about him. Ali passed by me again and asked, &#8216;Hasn&#8217;t  the man recognized his dwelling place yet&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Come along with me.&#8217; He  asked me, &#8216;What is your business? What has brought you to this town?&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;If  you keep my secret, I will tell you.&#8217; He said, &#8216;I will do,&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;We have heard  that a person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to  him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I thought of meeting  him personally.&#8217; &#8216;Ali said (to Abu Dhar), &#8216;You have reached your goal; I am going to him  just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who  may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a  warning), and you should go away then.&#8217; &#8216;Ali proceeded and I accompanied him till he  entered a place, and I entered with him to the Prophet to whom I said, &#8216;Present (the  principles of) Islam to me.&#8217; When he did, I embraced Islam &#8216;immediately. He said to me, &#8216;O  Abu Dhar! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your town; and when you hear of  our victory, return to us. &#8216; I said, &#8216;By H him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will  announce my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels),&#8217; Abu Dhar went  to the Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, &#8216;O folk of Quraish !  I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I (also) testify that  Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle.&#8217; (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, &#8216;Get at  this Sabi (i.e. Muslim) !&#8217; They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al &#8216;Abbas saw me and  threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and said, &#8216;Woe to you! You want to  kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your communications are  through the territory of Ghifar?&#8217; They therefore left me. The next morning I returned (to  the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, &#8216;Get at  this Sabi!&#8217; I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-Abbas found  me and threw himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day  before.&#8217; So, that was the conversion of Abu Dhar (may Allah be Merciful to him) to  Islam.&#8221; </font></p>

The first (of the three angels) said, &#8220;Which of them is he?&#8221;  The second said, &#8220;He is the best of them.&#8221; That was all that happened then, and  he did not see them till they came at another night and he perceived their presence with  his heart, for the eyes of the Prophet were closed when he was asleep, but his heart was  not asleep (not unconscious). This is characteristic of all the prophets: Their eyes sleep  but their hearts do not sleep. Then Gabriel took charge of the Prophet and ascended along  with him to the Heaven. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That they were with the Prophet on a journey. They  travelled the whole night, and when dawn approached, they took a rest and sleep  overwhelmed them till the sun rose high in the sky. The first to get up was Abu Bakr.  Allah&#8217;s Apostles used not to be awakened from his sleep, but he would wake up by himself.  &#8216;Umar woke up and then Abu Bakr sat by the side of the Prophet&#8217;s head and started saying:  Allahu-Akbar raising his voice till the Prophet woke up, (and after traveling for a while)  he dismounted and led us in the morning prayer. A man amongst the people failed to join us  in the prayer. When the Prophet had finished the prayer, he asked (the man), &#8220;O  so-and-so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with us?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I  am Junub,&#8221; Alllah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to perform Tayammam with clean earth. The man  then offered the prayer. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered me and a few others to go ahead of him.  We had become very thirsty. While we were on our way (looking for water), we came across a  lady (riding an animal), hanging her legs between two water-skins. We asked her,  &#8220;Where can we get water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Oh ! There is no water.&#8221; We  asked, &#8220;how far is your house from the water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;A distance of  a day and a night travel.&#8221; We said, &#8220;Come on to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;She  asked, &#8220;What is Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; So we brought her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle against  her will, and she told him what she had told us before and added that she was the mother  of orphans. So the Prophet ordered that her two water-skins be brought and he rubbed the  mouths of the water-skins. As we were thirsty, we drank till we quenched our thirst and we  were forty men. We also filled all our waterskins and other utensils with water, but we  did not water the camels. The waterskin was so full that it was almost about to burst. The  Prophet then said, &#8220;Bring what (foodstuff) you have.&#8221; So some dates and pieces  of bread were collected for the lady, and when she went to her people, she said, &#8220;I  have met either the greatest magician or a prophet as the people claim.&#8221; So Allah  guided the people of that village through that lady. She embraced Islam and they all  embraced Islam. </font></p>

He asked, &#8216;What is wrong with you?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;We have no water either for performing  ablution or for drinking except what is present in front of you.&#8217; So he placed his hand in  that pot and the water started flowing among his fingers like springs. We all drank and  performed ablution (from it).&#8221; I asked Jabir, &#8220;How many were you?&#8221; he  replied, &#8220;Even if we had been one-hundred-thousand, it would have been sufficient for  us, but we were fifteen-hundred.&#8221; </font></p>

I went carrying  it and found Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the Mosque sitting with some people. When I stood there,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Has Abu Talha sent you?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He  asked, &#8220;With some food?

Abu Talha said, &#8220;O Um  Sulaim! Allah&#8217;s Apostle is coming with the people and we have no food to feed them.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; So Abu Talha went out to receive  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came along with Abu Talha. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Um Sulaim! Bring whatever you have.&#8221; She brought the bread which Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered to be broken into pieces. Um Sulaim poured on them some butter from an oilskin.  Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited what Allah wished him to recite, and then said, &#8220;Let ten  persons come (to share the meal).&#8221; Ten persons were admitted, ate their fill and went  out.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to consider miracles as Allah&#8217;s Blessings, but you  people consider them to be a warning. Once we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on a journey, and  we ran short of water. He said, &#8220;Bring the water remaining with you.&#8221; The people  brought a utensil containing a little water. He placed his hand in it and said, &#8220;Come  to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah.&#8221; I saw the water flowing from  among the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle , and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah,  when it was being eaten (by him). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My father had died in debt. So I came to the Prophet and  said, &#8220;My father (died) leaving unpaid debts, and I have nothing except the yield of  his date palms; and their yield for many years will not cover his debts. So please come  with me, so that the creditors may not misbehave with me.&#8221; The Prophet went round one  of the heaps of dates and invoked (Allah), and then did the same with another heap and sat  on it and said, &#8220;Measure (for them).&#8221; He paid them their rights and what  remained was as much as had been paid to them. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 781: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abi Bakr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The companions of Suffa were poor people. The Prophet once  said, &#8220;Whoever has food enough for two persons, should take a third one (from among  them), and whoever has food enough for four persons, should take a fifth or a sixth (or  said something similar).&#8221; Abu Bakr brought three persons while the Prophet took ten.  And Abu Bakr with his three family member (who were I, my father and my mother) (the  sub-narrator is in doubt whether &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;My wife and my servant who was  common for both my house and Abu Bakr&#8217;s house.&#8221;) Abu Bakr took his supper with the  Prophet and stayed there till he offered the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers. He returned and stayed till  Allah&#8217;s Apostle took his supper. After a part of the night had passed, he returned to his  house. His wife said to him, &#8220;What has detained you from your guests?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Have you served supper to them?&#8221; She said, &#8220;They refused to take supper)  until you come. They (i.e. some members of the household) presented the meal to them but  they refused (to eat)&#8221; I went to hide myself and he said, &#8220;O Ghunthar!&#8221; He  invoked Allah to cause my ears to be cut and he rebuked me. He then said (to them): Please  eat!&#8221; and added, I will never eat the meal.&#8221; By Allah, whenever we took a  handful of the meal, the meal grew from underneath more than that handful till everybody  ate to his satisfaction; yet the remaining food was more than the original meal. Abu Bakr  saw that the food was as much or more than the original amount. He called his wife,  &#8220;O sister of Bani Firas!&#8221; She said, &#8220;O pleasure of my eyes. The food has  been tripled in quantity.&#8221; Abu Bakr then started eating thereof and said, &#8220;It  (i.e. my oath not to eat) was because of Sa all.&#8221; He took a handful from it, and  carried the rest to the Prophet. SO that food was with the Prophet . There was a treaty  between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed, he divided US  into twelve groups, each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the  command of each leader. Anyhow, the Prophet surely sent a leader with each group. Then all  of them ate of that meal. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the people of  Medina suffered from drought. So while the Prophet was delivering a sermon on a Friday a  man got up saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The horses and sheep have perished. Will you  invoke Allah to bless us with rain?&#8221; The Prophet lifted both his hands and invoked.  The sky at that time was as clear as glass. Suddenly a wind blew, raising clouds that  gathered together, and it started raining heavily. We came out (of the Mosque) wading  through the flowing water till we reached our homes. It went on raining till the next  Friday, when the same man or some other man stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  The houses have collapsed; please invoke Allah to withhold the rain.&#8221; On that the  Prophet smiled and said, &#8220;O Allah, (let it rain) around us and not on us.&#8221; I  then looked at the clouds to see them separating forming a sort of a crown round Medina. </font></p>

Shall we make a pulpit  for you?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you wish.&#8221; So they made a pulpit for him and when  it was Friday, he proceeded towards the pulpit (for delivering the sermon). The date-palm  cried like a child! The Prophet descended (the pulpit) and embraced it while it continued  moaning like a child being quietened. The Prophet said, &#8220;It was crying for (missing)  what it used to hear of religious knowledge given near to it.&#8221; </font></p>

Then we heard the trunk sending a sound like of a pregnant  she-camel till the Prophet came to it, and put his hand over it, then it became  quiet.&#8221; </font></p>

You need not fear those (afflictions) as there is a closed door  between you and them.&#8221; &#8216;Umar asked, &#8220;Will that door be opened or broken?&#8221;  Hudhaifa replied, &#8220;No, it will be broken.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Then it is very  likely that the door will not be closed again.&#8221; Later on the people asked Hudhaifa,  &#8220;Did &#8216;Umar know what that door meant?&#8221; He said. &#8220;Yes, &#8216;Umar knew it as  everyone knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning. I narrated to &#8216;Umar  an authentic narration, not lies.&#8221; We dared not ask Hudhaifa; therefore we requested  Masruq who asked him, &#8220;What does the door stand for?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Umar.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was in the city of the Prophet, a man came and  complained to him (the Prophet, ) of destitution and poverty. Then another man came and  complained of robbery (by highwaymen). The Prophet said, &#8220;Adi! Have you been to  Al-Hira?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been to it, but I was informed about it.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;If you should live for a long time, you will certainly see that a lady in a  Howdah traveling from Al-Hira will (safely reach Mecca and) perform the Tawaf of the  Ka&#8217;ba, fearing none but Allah.&#8221; I said to myself, &#8220;What will happen to the  robbers of the tribe of Tai who have spread evil through out the country?&#8221; The  Prophet further said. &#8220;If you should live long, the treasures of Khosrau will be  opened (and taken as spoils).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;You mean Khosrau, son of Hurmuz?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Khosrau, son of Hurmuz; and if you should live long, you will see that one  will carry a handful of gold or silver and go out looking for a person to accept it from  him, but will find none to accept it from him. And any of you, when meeting Allah, will  meet Him without needing an interpreter between him and Allah to interpret for him, and  Allah will say to him: &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I send a messenger to teach you?&#8217; He will say: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Allah  will say: &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I give you wealth and do you favors?&#8217; He will say: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then he will  look to his right and see nothing but Hell, and look to his left and see nothing but  Hell.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Adi further said: I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;Save  yourself from the (Hell) Fire even with half a date (to be given in charity) and if you do  not find a half date, then with a good pleasant word.&#8221; &#8216;Adi added: (later on) I saw a  lady in a Howdah traveling from Al-Hira till she performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, fearing  none but Allah. And I was one of those who opened (conquered) the treasures of Khosrau,  son of Hurmuz. If you should live long, you will see what the Prophet Abu-l-Qasim had  said: &#8216;A person will come out with a handful. of gold&#8230;etc. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle who was distributing  (i.e. some property), there came Dhu-l-Khuwaisira, a man from the tribe of Bani Tamim and  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do Justice.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to you! Who  could do justice if I did not? I would be a desperate loser if I did not do justice.&#8221;  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Leave him, for he has companions who pray and fast in such a way that you will  consider your fasting negligible in comparison to theirs. They recite Qur&#8217;an but it does  not go beyond their throats (i.e. they do not act on it) and they will desert Islam as an  arrow goes through a victim&#8217;s body, so that the hunter, on looking at the arrow&#8217;s blade,  would see nothing on it; he would look at its Risaf and see nothing: he would look at its  Na,di and see nothing, and he would look at its Qudhadh ( 1 ) and see nothing (neither  meat nor blood), for the arrow has been too fast even for the blood and excretions to  smear. The sign by which they will be recognized is that among them there will be a black  man, one of whose arms will resemble a woman&#8217;s breast or a lump of meat moving loosely.  Those people will appear when there will be differences amongst the people.&#8221; I  testify that I heard this narration from Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I testify that &#8216;Ali bin Abi  Talib fought with such people, and I was in his company. He ordered that the man  (described by the Prophet ) should be looked for. The man was brought and I looked at him  and noticed that he looked exactly as the Prophet had described him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I relate the traditions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle to you for I  would rather fall from the sky than attribute something to him falsely. But when I tell  you a thing which is between you and me, then no doubt, war is guile. I heard Allah&#8217;s  Apostle saying, &#8220;In the last days of this world there will appear some young foolish  people who will use (in their claim) the best speech of all people (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) and  they will abandon Islam as an arrow going through the game. Their belief will not go  beyond their throats (i.e. they will have practically no belief), so wherever you meet  them, kill them, for he who kills them shall get a reward on the Day of  Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We complained to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (of the persecution  inflicted on us by the infidels) while he was sitting in the shade of the Ka&#8217;ba, leaning  over his Burd (i.e. covering sheet). We said to him, &#8220;Would you seek help for us?  Would you pray to Allah for us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Among the nations before you a  (believing) man would be put in a ditch that was dug for him, and a saw would be put over  his head and he would be cut into two pieces; yet that (torture) would not make him give  up his religion. His body would be combed with iron combs that would remove his flesh from  the bones and nerves, yet that would not make him abandon his religion. By Allah, this  religion (i.e. Islam) will prevail till a traveler from Sana (in Yemen) to Hadrarmaut will  fear none but Allah, or a wolf as regards his sheep, but you (people) are hasty. </font></p>

I shall bring you his news.&#8221; So he went to him and saw  him sitting in his house drooping his head (sadly). He asked Thabit, &#8220;What&#8217;s the  matter?&#8221; Thabit replied, &#8220;An evil situation: A man used to raise his voice over  the voice of the Prophet and so all his good deeds have been annulled and he is from the  people of Hell.&#8221; The man went back and told the Prophet that Thabit had said  so-and-so. (The sub-narrator, Musa bin Anas said, &#8220;The man went to Thabit again with  glad tidings).&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go and say to Thabit: &#8216;You are not  from the people of Fire, but from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man recited Surat-al-Kahf (in his prayer) and in the  house there was a (riding) animal which got frightened and started jumping. The man  finished his prayer with Taslim, but behold! A mist or a cloud hovered over him. He  informed the Prophet of that and the Prophet said, &#8220;O so-and-so! Recite, for this  (mist or cloud) was a sign of peace descending for the recitation of Quran.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr came to my father who was at home and purchased a  saddle from him. He said to &#8216;Azib. &#8220;Tell your son to carry it with me.&#8221; So I  carried it with him and my father followed us so as to take the price (of the saddle). My  father said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Tell me what happened to you on your night journey with  Allah&#8217;s Apostle (during Migration).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, we travelled the whole night  and also the next day till midday. when nobody could be seen on the way ( because of the  severe heat) . Then there appeared a long rock having shade beneath it, and the sunshine  had not come to it yet. So we dismounted there and I levelled a place and covered it with  an animal hide or dry grass for the Prophet to sleep on (for a while). I then said,  &#8216;Sleep, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and I will guard you.&#8217; So he slept and I went out to guard him.  Suddenly I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep to that rock with the same intention we  had when we came to it. I asked (him). &#8216;To whom do you belong, O boy?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I  belong to a man from Medina or Mecca.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Do your sheep have milk?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;  I said, &#8216;Will you milk for us?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He caught hold of a sheep and I asked him  to clean its teat from dust, hairs and dirt. (The sub-narrator said that he saw Al-Bara&#8217;  striking one of his hands with the other, demonstrating how the shepherd removed the  dust.) The shepherd milked a little milk in a wooden container and I had a leather  container which I carried for the Prophet to drink and perform the ablution from. I went  to the Prophet, hating to wake him up, but when I reached there, the Prophet had already  awakened; so I poured water over the middle part of the milk container, till the milk was  cold. Then I said, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He drank till I was pleased. Then he asked,  &#8216;Has the time for our departure come?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So we departed after midday. Suraqa  bin Malik followed us and I said, &#8216;We have been discovered, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He said,  Don&#8217;t grieve for Allah is with us.&#8217; The Prophet invoked evil on him (i.e. Suraqa) and so  the legs of his horse sank into the earth up to its belly. (The subnarrator, Zuhair is not  sure whether Abu Bakr said, &#8220;(It sank) into solid earth.&#8221;) Suraqa said, &#8216;I see  that you have invoked evil on me. Please invoke good on me, and by Allah, I will cause  those who are seeking after you to return.&#8217; The Prophet invoked good on him and he was  saved. Then, whenever he met somebody on the way, he would say, &#8216;I have looked for him  here in vain.&#8217; So he caused whomever he met to return. Thus Suraqa fulfilled his  promise.&#8221; </font></p>

No, for  it is a fever which boils in (the body of) an old man, and will lead him to the  grave.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, then may it be as you say.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read  Surat-al-Baqara and Al-Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet.  Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows  nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the  people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out.  They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our  companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again  dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown  his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the  grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221;  They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that  the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not  done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground). </font></p>

He stood before Musailama (and his companions) and said, &#8220;If you asked me even this  piece (of a leaf), I would not give it to you. You cannot avoid the fate you are destined  to, by Allah. If you reject Islam, Allah will destroy you. I think that you are most  probably the same person whom I have seen in the dream.&#8221; Abu Huraira told me that  Allah&#8217;s Apostle; said, &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw (in a dream) two gold bracelets  round my arm, and that worried me too much. Then I was instructed divinely in my dream, to  blow them off and so I blew them off, and they flew away. I interpreted the two bracelets  as symbols of two liars who would appear after me. And so one of them was Al-Ansi and the  other was Musailama Al-Kadhdhab from Al-Yamama.&#8221; </font></p>

I thought that it was Al-Yamama or  Hajar, but it came to be Medina i.e. Yathrib. In the same dream I saw myself moving a  sword and its blade got broken. It came to symbolize the defeat which the Muslims suffered  from, on the Day of Uhud. I moved the sword again, and it became normal as before, and  that was the symbol of the victory Allah bestowed upon Muslims and their gathering  together. I saw cows in my dream, and by Allah, that was a blessing, and they symbolized  the believers on the Day of Uhud. And the blessing was the good Allah bestowed upon us and  the reward of true belief which Allah gave us after the day of Badr. </font></p>

I think this portends my death, and you will be the  first of my family to follow me.&#8217; So I started weeping.

Umaiya said to Sad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t shout at  Abi-l-Hakam (i.e. Abu Jahl), for he is chief of the valley (of Mecca).&#8221; Sad then said  (to Abu Jahl). &#8216;By Allah, if you prevent me from performing the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, I will  spoil your trade with Sham.&#8221; Umaiya kept on saying to Sad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t raise your  voice.&#8221; and kept on taking hold of him.

Muhammad never tells a lie.&#8221; So  when the infidels started to proceed for Badr (Battle) and declared war (against the  Muslims), his wife said to him, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you remember what your brother from Yathrib  told you?&#8221; Umaiya decided not to go but Abu Jahl said to him, &#8220;You are from the  nobles of the valley of Mecca), so you should accompany us for a day or two.&#8221; He went  with them and thus Allah got him killed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I got the news that Gabriel came to the Prophet while Um  Salama was present. Gabriel started talking (to the Prophet and then left. The Prophet  said to Um Salama, &#8220;(Do you know) who it was?&#8221; (or a similar question). She  said, &#8220;It was Dihya (a handsome person amongst the companions of the Prophet ).&#8221;  Later on Um Salama said, &#8220;By Allah! I thought he was none but Dihya, till I heard the  Prophet talking about Gabriel in his sermon.&#8221; (The Sub-narrator asked Abu &#8216;Uthman,  &#8220;From where have you heard this narration?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;From Usama bin  Zaid.&#8221;) </font></p>

May Allah forgive him. Then &#8216;Umar  took the bucket and in his hands it turned into a very large bucket. I had never seen  anyone amongst: the people who could draw the water as strongly as &#8216;Umar till all the  people drank their fill and watered their camels that knelt down there. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him that a man  and a woman from amongst them had committed illegal sexual intercourse. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said to them, &#8220;What do you find in the Torah (old Testament) about the legal  punishment of Ar-Rajm (stoning)?&#8221; They replied, (But) we announce their crime and  lash them.&#8221; Abdullah bin Salam said, &#8220;You are telling a lie; Torah contains the  order of Rajm.&#8221; They brought and opened the Torah and one of them solaced his hand on  the Verse of Rajm and read the verses preceding and following it. Abdullah bin Salam said  to him, &#8220;Lift your hand.&#8221; When he lifted his hand, the Verse of Rajm was written  there. They said, &#8220;Muhammad has told the truth; the Torah has the Verse of Rajm. The  Prophet then gave the order that both of them should be stoned to death. (&#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I saw the man leaning over the woman to shelter her from the  stones.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 839: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A horse may be kept for one of  three purposes: for a man it may be a source of reward; for another it may be a means of  living; and for a third it may be a burden (a source of committing sins). As for the one  for whom it is a source of reward, he is the one who keeps his horse for the sake of Jihad  in Allah&#8217;s Cause; he ties it with a long rope on a pasture or in a garden. So whatever its  rope allows it to eat, will be regarded as good rewardable deeds (for its owner). And if  it breaks off its rope and jumps over one or two hillocks, even its dung will be  considered amongst his good deeds. And if it passes by a river and drinks water from it,  that will be considered as good deeds for his benefit) even if he has had no intention of  watering it. A horse is a shelter for the one who keeps it so that he may earn his living  honestly and takes it as a refuge to keep him from following illegal ways (of gaining  money), and does not forget the rights of Allah (i.e. paying the Zakat and allowing others  to use it for Allah&#8217;s Sake). But a horse is a burden (and a source of committing sins for  him who keeps it out of pride and pretense and with the intention of harming the  Muslims.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet was asked about donkeys. He replied,  &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to be concerning them except this comprehensive Verse  (which covers everything) :&#8211;&#8216;Then whosoever has done good equal to the weight of an atom  (or a small ant), Shall see it (its reward) And whosoever has done evil equal to the  weight of an atom (or a small ) ant), Shall see it (Its punishment).&#8221; (99.7-8) </font></p>

The  Prophet raised his hands and said, &#8220;Allah is Greater! Khaibar is ruined ! If we  approach a nation, then miserable is the morning of those who are warned.&#8221; </font></p>

I hear many narrations  from you but I forget them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Spread your covering sheet.&#8221; I  spread my sheet and he moved both his hands as if scooping something and emptied them in  the sheet and said, &#8220;Wrap it.&#8221; I wrapped it round my body, and since then I have  never forgotten a single Hadith. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.057.001"></a>Volume 5, Book 57, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A time will come upon the people, when a group of people will wage a holy war and it will be said, &#8216;Is there amongst you anyone who has accompanied Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; And so victory will be bestowed on them. Then a time will come upon the people when a group of people will wage a holy war, and it will be said, &#8220;Is there amongst you a none who has accompanied the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; And so victory will be bestowed on them. Then a time will come upon the people when a group of people will wage a holy war, and it will be said, &#8220;Is there amongst you anyone who has been in the company of the companions of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; And victory will be bestowed on them.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Imran bin Husain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;The best of my followers are those living in my generation (i.e. my contemporaries). and then those who will follow the latter&#8221; &#8216;Imran added, &#8220;I do not remember whether he mentioned two or three generations after his generation, then the Prophet added, &#8216;There will come after you, people who will bear witness without being asked to do so, and will be treacherous and untrustworthy, and they will vow and never fulfill their vows, and fatness will appear among them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The best people are those living in my generation, and then those who will follow them, and then those who will follow the latter. Then there will come some people who will bear witness before taking oaths, and take oaths before bearing witness.&#8221; (Ibrahim, a sub-narrator said, &#8220;They used to beat us for witnesses and covenants when we were still children.&#8221;)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr bought a (camel) saddle from &#8216;Azib for thirteen Dirhams. Abu Bakr said to &#8216;Azib, &#8220;Tell Al-Bara&#8217; to carry the saddle for me.&#8221; &#8216;Azib said, &#8220;No, unless you relate to me what happened to you and Allah &#8216;s Apostle when you left Mecca while the pagans were in search of you.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;We left Mecca and we travel led continuously for that night and the following day till it was midday. I looked (around) searching for shade to take as shelter, and suddenly I came across a rock, and found a little shade there. So I cleaned the place and spread a bed for the Prophet in the shade and said to him, &#8216;Lie down, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; So the Prophet lay down and I went out, looking around to see if there was any person pursuing us. Suddenly I saw a shepherd driving his sheep towards the rock, seeking what we had already sought from it. I asked him, &#8216;To whom do you belong, O boy?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I belong to a man from Quraish.&#8217; He named the man and I recognized him. I asked him, &#8216;Is there any milk with your sheep?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Will you then milk (some) for us?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then I asked him to tie the legs of one of the sheep and clean its udder, and then ordered him to clean his hands from dust. Then the shepherd cleaned his hands by striking his hands against one another. After doing so, he milked a small amount of milk. I used to keep for Allah&#8217;s Apostle a leather water-container, the mouth of which was covered with a piece of cloth. I poured water on the milk container till its lower part was cold. Then I took the milk to the Prophet whom I found awake. I said to him, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; So he drank till I became pleased. Then I said, &#8216;It is time for us to move, O Allahs Apostle!&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So we set out while the people (i.e. Quraish pagans) were searching for us, but none found us except Suraiqa bin Malik bin Jushum who was riding his horse. I said, &#8216;These are our pursuers who have found us. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He said, &#8216;Do not grieve, for Allah is with us.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to the Prophet while I was in the Cave. &#8220;If any of them should look under his feet, he would see us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! What do you think of two (persons) the third of whom is Allah?&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle addressed the people saying, &#8220;Allah has given option to a slave to choose this world or what is with Him. The slave has chosen what is with Allah.&#8221; Abu Bakr wept, and we were astonished at his weeping caused by what the Prophet mentioned as to a Slave ( of Allah) who had been offered a choice, (we learned later on) that Allah&#8217;s Apostle himself was the person who was given the choice, and that Abu Bakr knew best of all of us. Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;The person who has favored me most of all both with his company and wealth, is Abu Bakr. If I were to take a Khalil other than my Lord, I would have taken Abu Bakr as such, but (what relates us) is the Islamic brotherhood and friendliness. All the gates of the Mosque should be closed except the gate of Abu Bakr.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to compare the people as to who was better during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . We used to regard Abu Bakr as the best, then &#8216;Umar, and then &#8216;Uthman .</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If I were to take a Khalil, I would have taken Abu Bakr, but he is my brother and my companion (in Islam).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aiyub:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If I were to take a Khalil, I would have taken him (i.e. Abu Bakr) as a Khalil, but the Islamic brotherhood is better.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Kufa sent a letter to Ibn Az-Zubair, asking about (the inheritance of) (paternal) grandfather. He replied that the right of the inheritance of (paternal) grandfather is the same as that of father if the father is dead) and added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216; If I were to take a Khalil from this nation, I would have taken him (i.e. Abu Bakr).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 11:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jubair bin Mutim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A woman came to the Prophet who ordered her to return to him again. She said, &#8220;What if I came and did not find you?&#8221; as if she wanted to say, &#8220;If I found you dead?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you should not find me, go to Abu Bakr.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 12:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ammar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle and there was none with him but five slaves, two women and Abu Bakr (i.e. those were the only converts to Islam then).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 13:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ad-Darda:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was sitting with the Prophet, Abu Bakr came, lifting up one corner of h is garment uncovering h is knee. The Prophet said, &#8220;Your companion has had a quarrel.&#8221; Abu Bakr greeted (the Prophet ) and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! There was something (i.e. quarrel) between me and the Son of Al-Khattab. I talked to him harshly and then regretted that, and requested him to forgive me, but he refused. This is why I have come to you.&#8221; The Prophet said thrice, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! May Allah forgive you.&#8221; In the meanwhile, &#8216;Umar regretted (his refusal of Abu Bakr&#8217;s excuse) and went to Abu Bakr&#8217;s house and asked if Abu Bakr was there. They replied in the negative. So he came to the Prophet and greeted him, but signs of displeasure appeared on the face of the Prophet till Abu Bakr pitied (&#8216;Umar), so he knelt and said twice, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Allah! I was more unjust to him (than he to me).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah sent me (as a Prophet) to you (people) but you said (to me), &#8216;You are telling a lie,&#8217; while Abu Bakr said, &#8216;He has said the truth,&#8217; and consoled me with himself and his money.&#8221; He then said twice, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you then give up harming my companion?&#8221; After that nobody harmed Abu Bakr.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 14:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Al-As:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet deputed me to read the Army of Dhat-as-Salasil. I came to him and said, &#8220;Who is the most beloved person to you?&#8221; He said, &#8221; &#8216;Aisha.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Among the men?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Her father.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Who then?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.&#8221; He then named other men.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 15:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;While a shepherd was amongst his sheep, a wolf attacked them and took away one sheep. When the shepherd chased the wolf, the wolf turned towards him and said, &#8216;Who will be its guard on the day of wild animals when nobody except I will be its shepherd. And while a man was driving a cow with a load on it, it turned towards him and spoke to him saying, &#8216;I have not been created for this purpose, but for ploughing.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;Glorified be Allah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;But I believe in it and so does Abu Bakr end &#8216;Umar.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 16:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw myself standing at a well, on it there was a bucket. I drew water from the well as much as Allah wished. Then Ibn Abi Quhafa (i.e. Abu Bakr) took the bucket from me and brought out one or two buckets (of water) and there was weakness in his drawing the water. May Allah forgive his weakness for him. Then the bucket turned into a very big one and Ibn Al-Khattab took it over and I had never seen such a mighty person amongst the people as him in performing such hard work, till the people drank to their satisfaction and watered their camels that knelt down there.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 17:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah will not look on the Day of Judgment at him who drags his robe (behind him) out of pride.&#8221; Abu Bakr said &#8220;One side of my robe slacks down unless I get very cautious about it.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;But you do not do that with a pride.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 18:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Anybody who spends a pair of something in Allah&#8217;s Cause will be called from all the gates of Paradise, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s slave! This is good.&#8217; He who is amongst those who pray will be called from the gate of the prayer (in Paradise) and he who is from the people of Jihad will be called from the gate of Jihad, and he who is from those&#8217; who give in charity (i.e. Zakat) will be called from the gate of charity, and he who is amongst those who observe fast will be called from the gate of fasting, the gate of Raiyan.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;He who is called from all those gates will need nothing,&#8221; He added, &#8220;Will anyone be called from all those gates, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, and I hope you will be among those, O Abu Bakr.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 19:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle died while Abu Bakr was at a place called As-Sunah (Al-&#8216;Aliya) &#8216;Umar stood up and said, &#8220;By Allah! Allah&#8217;s Apostle is not dead!&#8221; &#8216;Umar (later on) said, &#8220;By Allah! Nothing occurred to my mind except that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Verily! Allah will resurrect him and he will cut the hands and legs of some men.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr came and uncovered the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, kissed him and said, &#8220;Let my mother and father be sacrificed for you, (O Allah&#8217;s Apostle), you are good in life and in death. By Allah in Whose Hands my life is, Allah will never make you taste death twice.&#8221; Then he went out and said, &#8220;O oath-taker! Don&#8217;t be hasty.&#8221; When Abu Bakr spoke, &#8216;Umar sat down. Abu Bakr praised and glorified Allah and said, No doubt! Whoever worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Allah, then Allah is Alive and shall never die.&#8221; Then he recited Allah&#8217;s Statement.:&#8211; &#8220;(O Muhammad) Verily you will die, and they also will die.&#8221; (39.30) He also recited:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle; and indeed many Apostles have passed away, before him, If he dies Or is killed, will you then Turn back on your heels? And he who turns back On his heels, not the least Harm will he do to Allah And Allah will give reward to those Who are grateful.&#8221; (3.144)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people wept loudly, and the Ansar were assembled with Sad bin &#8216;Ubada in the shed of Bani Saida. They said (to the emigrants). &#8220;There should be one &#8216;Amir from us and one from you.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr, Umar bin Al-Khattab and Abu &#8216;baida bin Al-Jarrah went to them. &#8216;Umar wanted to speak but Abu Bakr stopped him. &#8216;Umar later on used to say, &#8220;By Allah, I intended only to say something that appealed to me and I was afraid that Abu Bakr would not speak so well. Then Abu Bakr spoke and his speech was very eloquent. He said in his statement, &#8220;We are the rulers and you (Ansars) are the ministers (i.e. advisers),&#8221; Hubab bin Al-Mundhir said, &#8220;No, by Allah we won&#8217;t accept this. But there must be a ruler from us and a ruler from you.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;No, we will be the rulers and you will be the ministers, for they (i.e. Quarish) are the best family amongst the &#8216;Arabs and of best origin. So you should elect either &#8216;Umar or Abu &#8216;Ubaida bin Al-Jarrah as your ruler.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said (to Abu Bakr), &#8220;No but we elect you, for you are our chief and the best amongst us and the most beloved of all of us to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar took Abu Bakr&#8217;s hand and gave the pledge of allegiance and the people too gave the pledge of allegiance to Abu Bakr. Someone said, &#8220;You have killed Sad bin Ubada.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah has killed him.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said (in another narration), (&#8220;When the Prophet was on his death-bed) he looked up and said thrice, (Amongst) the Highest Companion (See Qur&#8217;an 4.69)&#8217; Aisha said, Allah benefited the people by their two speeches. &#8216;Umar frightened the people some of whom were hypocrites whom Allah caused to abandon Islam because of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s speech. Then Abu Bakr led the people to True Guidance and acquainted them with the right path they were to follow so that they went out reciting:&#8211; &#8220;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle and indeed many Apostles have passed away before him..&#8221; (3.144)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 20:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin Al-Hanafiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked my father (&#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib), &#8220;Who are the best people after Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Bakr.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Who then?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then &#8216;Umar. &#8221; I was afraid he would say &#8220;Uthman, so I said, &#8220;Then you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am only an ordinary person.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 21:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on one of his journeys till we reached Al-Baida or Dhatul-Jaish where my necklace got broken (and lost). Allah&#8217;s Apostle stopped to search for it and the people too stopped with him. There was no water at that place and they had no water with them. So they went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see what &#8216;Aisha has done? She has made Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people stop where there is no water and they have no water with them. Abu Bakr came while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh and said, &#8220;You detained Allah Apostle and the people where there is no water and they have no water.&#8221; He then admonished me and said what Allah wished and pinched me at my flanks with his hands, but I did not move because the head of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was on my thigh .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on sleeping till be got up in the morning and found no water. Then Allah revealed the Divine Verse of Tayammum, and the people performed Tayammum. Usaid bin AlHudair said. &#8220;O family of Abu Bakr! This is not the first blessings of yours.&#8221; We urged the camel on which I was sitting to get up from its place and the necklace was found under it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 22:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not abuse my companions for if any one of you spent gold equal to Uhud (in Allah&#8217;s Cause) it would not be equal to a Mud or even a half Mud spent by one of them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 23:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I performed ablution in my house and then went out and said, &#8220;Today I shall stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and stay with him all this day of mine (in his service).&#8221; I went to the Mosque and asked about the Prophet . They said, &#8220;He had gone in this direction.&#8221; So I followed his way, asking about him till he entered a place called Bir Aris. I sat at its gate that was made of date-palm leaves till the Prophet finished answering the call of nature and performed ablution. Then I went up to him to see him sitting at the well of Aris at the middle of its edge with his legs uncovered, hanging in the well. I greeted him and went back and sat at the gate. I said, &#8220;Today I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet.&#8221; Abu Bakr came and pushed the gate. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Bakr.&#8221; I told him to wait, went in and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Bakr asks for permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; So I went out and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise&#8221; Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well and hung his legs n the well as the Prophet did and uncovered his legs. I then returned and sat (at the gate). I had left my brother performing ablution and he intended to follow me. So I said (to myself). &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so (i.e. my brother) He will bring him here.&#8221; Suddenly somebody moved the door. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.&#8221; I asked him to wait, went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, greeted him and said, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; I went to &#8220;Umar and said &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise.&#8221; So he entered and sat beside Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well on the left side and hung his legs in the well. I returned and sat (at the gate) and said, (to myself), &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so, He will bring him here.&#8221; Somebody came and moved the door. I asked &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Uthman bin Affan.&#8221; I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise, I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall him.&#8221; So I went up to him and said to him, &#8220;Come in; Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall you. &#8220;Uthman then came in and found that the built edge of the well was occupied, so he sat opposite to the Prophet on the other side. Said bin Al-Musaiyab said, &#8220;I interpret this (narration) in terms of their graves.&#8221;</p>

I always hoped that Allah will keep you with your two companions, for I often heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were (somewhere). I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar did (something). I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar set out.&#8217; So I hoped that Allah will keep you with both of them.&#8221; I turned back to see that the speaker was Ali bin Abi Talib.</p>

Abu Bakr came and pulled &#8216;Uqba away from the Prophet and said, &#8220;Do you intend to kill a man just because he says: &#8216;My Lord is Allah, and he has brought forth to you the Evident Signs from your Lord?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">When &#8216;Umar asked for the permission to enter, the women quickly put on their veils.

You have not left behind you a person whose deeds I like to imitate and meet Allah with more than I like your deeds. By Allah!

Then you were in the company of Abu Bakr and kept good relations with him and you parted with him (i.e. he died) while he was pleased with you.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abu Yaghuth said (to me), &#8220;What forbids you to talk to &#8216;Uthman about his brother Al-Walid because people have talked much about him?&#8221; So I went to &#8216;Uthman and when he went out for prayer I said (to him), &#8220;I have something to say to you and it is a piece of advice for you &#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;O man, from you.&#8221; (Umar said: I see that he said, &#8220;I seek Refuge with Allah from you.&#8221;) So I left him and went to them. Then the messenger of Uthman came and I went to him (i.e. &#8216;Uthman), &#8216;Uthman asked, &#8220;What is your advice?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth, and revealed the Divine Book (i.e. Quran) to him; and you were amongst those who followed Allah and His Apostle, and you participated in the two migrations (to Ethiopia and to Medina) and enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and saw his way. No doubt, the people are talking much about Al-Walid.&#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;Did you receive your knowledge directly from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, but his knowledge did reach me and it reached (even) to a virgin in her seclusion.&#8221; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;And then Allah sent Muhammad with the Truth and I was amongst those who followed Allah and His Apostle and I believed in what ever he (i.e. the Prophet) was sent with, and participated in two migrations, as you have said, and I enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave the pledge of allegiance him. By Allah! I never disobeyed him, nor did I cheat him till Allah took him unto Him. Then I treated Abu Bakr and then &#8216;Umar similarly and then I was made Caliph. So, don&#8217;t I have rights similar to theirs?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then what are these talks reaching me from you people? Now, concerning what you mentioned about the question of Al-Walid, Allah willing, I shall deal with him according to what is right.&#8221; Then he called &#8216;Ali and ordered him to flog him, and &#8216;Ali flogged him (i.e. Al-Walid) eighty lashes.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(the son of Muhib) An Egyptian who came and performed the Hajj to the Kaba saw some people sitting. He enquire, &#8220;Who are these people?&#8221; Somebody said, &#8220;They are the tribe of Quraish.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Who is the old man sitting amongst them?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;He is &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Ibn Umar! I want to ask you about something; please tell me about it. Do you know that &#8216;Uthman fled away on the day (of the battle) of Uhud?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The (Egyptian) man said, &#8220;Do you know that &#8216;Uthman was absent on the day (of the battle) of Badr and did not join it?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Do you know that he failed to attend the Ar Ridwan pledge and did not witness it (i.e. Hudaibiya pledge of allegiance)?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar!&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Let me explain to you (all these three things). As for his flight on the day of Uhud, I testify that Allah has excused him and forgiven him; and as for his absence from the battle of Badr, it was due to the fact that the daughter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was his wife and she was sick then. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him, &#8220;You will receive the same reward and share (of the booty) as anyone of those who participated in the battle of Badr (if you stay with her).&#8217; As for his absence from the Ar-Ridwan pledge of allegiance, had there been any person in Mecca more respectable than &#8216;Uthman (to be sent as a representative). Allah&#8217;s Apostle would have sent him instead of him. No doubt, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had sent him, and the incident of the Ar-Ridwan pledge of Allegiance happened after &#8216;Uthman had gone to Mecca. Allah&#8217;s Apostle held out his right hand saying, &#8216;This is &#8216;Uthman&#8217;s hand.&#8217; He stroke his (other) hand with it saying, &#8216;This (pledge of allegiance) is on the behalf of &#8216;Uthman.&#8217; Then Ibn &#8216;Umar said to the man, &#8216;Bear (these) excuses in mind with you.&#8217;</p>

Do you think that you have imposed more taxation on the land (of As-Swad i.e. &#8216;Iraq) than it can bear?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;We have imposed on it what it can bear because of its great yield.&#8221; &#8216;Umar again said, &#8220;Check whether you have imposed on the land what it can not bear.&#8221; They said, &#8220;No, (we haven&#8217;t).&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;If Allah should keep me alive I will let the widows of Iraq need no men to support them after me.&#8221; But only four days had elapsed when he was stabbed (to death ). The day he was stabbed, I was standing and there was nobody between me and him (i.e. Umar) except Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas.

<p style="text-align:justify;">When he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbir. He would recite Surat Yusuf or An-Nahl or the like in the first Rak&#8217;a so that the people may have the time to Join the prayer. As soon as he said Takbir, I heard him saying, &#8220;The dog has killed or eaten me,&#8221; at the time he (i.e. the murderer) stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel proceeded on carrying a double-edged knife and stabbing all the persons he passed by on the right and left (till) he stabbed thirteen persons out of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself, &#8216;Umar held the hand of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf and let him lead the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who were standing by the side of &#8216;Umar saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other parts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of &#8216;Umar and they were saying, &#8220;Subhan Allah! Subhan Allah! (i.e. Glorified be Allah).&#8221; Abdur-Rahman bin Auf led the people a short prayer. When they finished the prayer, &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Ibn &#8216;Abbas! Find out who attacked me.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas kept on looking here and there for a short time and came to say. &#8220;The slave of Al Mughira.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The craftsman?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;May Allah curse him. I did not treat him unjustly. All the Praises are for Allah Who has not caused me to die at the hand of a man who claims himself to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father (Abbas) used to love to have more non-Arab infidels in Medina.&#8221; Al-Abbas had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn &#8216;Abbas said to &#8216;Umar. &#8220;If you wish, we will do.&#8221; He meant, &#8220;If you wish we will kill them.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;You are mistaken (for you can&#8217;t kill them) after they have spoken your language, prayed towards your Qibla, and performed Hajj like yours.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Umar was carried to his house, and we went along with him, and the people were as if they had never suffered a calamity before. Some said, &#8220;Do not worry (he will be Alright soon).&#8221; Some said, &#8220;We are afraid (that he will die).&#8221; Then an infusion of dates was brought to him and he drank it but it came out (of the wound) of his belly. Then milk was brought to him and he drank it, and it also came out of his belly. The people realized that he would die. We went to him, and the people came, praising him. A young man came saying, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Receive the glad tidings from Allah to you due to your company with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and your superiority in Islam which you know. Then you became the ruler (i.e. Caliph) and you ruled with justice and finally you have been martyred.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I wish that all these privileges will counterbalance (my shortcomings) so that I will neither lose nor gain anything.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the young man turned back to leave, his clothes seemed to be touching the ground. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Call the young man back to me.&#8221; (When he came back) &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O son of my brother! Lift your clothes, for this will keep your clothes clean and save you from the Punishment of your Lord.&#8221; &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar! See how much I am in debt to others.&#8221; When the debt was checked, it amounted to approximately eighty-six thousand. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;If the property of &#8216;Umar&#8217;s family covers the debt, then pay the debt thereof; otherwise request it from Bani &#8216;Adi bin Ka&#8217;b, and if that too is not sufficient, ask for it from Quraish tribe, and do not ask for it from any one else, and pay this debt on my behalf.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar then said (to &#8216;Abdullah), &#8220;Go to &#8216;Aisha (the mother of the believers) and say: &#8220;Umar is paying his salutation to you. But don&#8217;t say: &#8216;The chief of the believers,&#8217; because today I am not the chief of the believers. And say: &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to be buried with his two companions (i.e. the Prophet, and Abu Bakr).&#8221; Abdullah greeted &#8216;Aisha and asked for the permission for entering, and then entered to her and found her sitting and weeping. He said to her, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab is paying his salutations to you, and asks the permission to be buried with his two companions.&#8221; She said, &#8220;I had the idea of having this place for myself, but today I prefer Umar to myself.&#8221; When he returned it was said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar has come.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Make me sit up.&#8221; Somebody supported him against his body and &#8216;Umar asked (&#8216;Abdullah), &#8220;What news do you have?&#8221; He said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! It is as you wish. She has given the permission.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Praise be to Allah, there was nothing more important to me than this. So when I die, take me, and greet &#8216;Aisha and say: &#8220;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission (to be buried with the Prophet ), and if she gives the permission, bury me there, and if she refuses, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Hafsa (the mother of the believers) came with many other women walking with her. When we saw her, we went away. She went in (to &#8216;Umar) and wept there for sometime. When the men asked for permission to enter, she went into another place, and we heard her weeping inside. The people said (to &#8216;Umar), &#8220;O chief of the believers! Appoint a successor.&#8221; Umar said, &#8220;I do not find anyone more suitable for the job than the following persons or group whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle had been pleased with before he died.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar mentioned &#8216;Ali, &#8216;Uthman, AzZubair, Talha, Sad and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (bin Auf) and said, &#8220;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar will be a witness to you, but he will have no share in the rule. His being a witness will compensate him for not sharing the right of ruling. If Sad becomes the ruler, it will be alright: otherwise, whoever becomes the ruler should seek his help, as I have not dismissed him because of disability or dishonesty.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;I recommend that my successor takes care of the early emigrants; to know their rights and protect their honor and sacred things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also recommend that he be kind to the Ansar who had lived in Medina before the emigrants and Belief had entered their hearts before them. I recommend that the (ruler) should accept the good of the righteous among them and excuse their wrong-doers, and I recommend that he should do good to all the people of the towns (Al-Ansar), as they are the protectors of Islam and the source of wealth and the source of annoyance to the enemy. I also recommend that nothing be taken from them except from their surplus with their consent. I also recommend that he do good to the &#8216;Arab bedouin, as they are the origin of the &#8216;Arabs and the material of Islam. He should take from what is inferior, amongst their properties and distribute that to the poor amongst them. I also recommend him concerning Allah&#8217;s and His Apostle&#8217;s protectees (i.e. Dhimmis) to fulfill their contracts and to fight for them and not to overburden them with what is beyond their ability.&#8221; So when &#8216;Umar expired, we carried him out and set out walking. &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar greeted (&#8216;Aisha) and said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks for the permission.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Bring him in.&#8221; He was brought in and buried beside his two companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he was buried, the group (recommended by &#8216;Umar) held a meeting. Then &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8221; Reduce the candidates for rulership to three of you.&#8221; Az-Zubair said, &#8220;I give up my right to Ali.&#8221; Talha said, &#8220;I give up my right to &#8216;Uthman,&#8221; Sad, &#8216;I give up my right to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman then said (to &#8216;Uthman and &#8216;Ali), &#8220;Now which of you is willing to give up his right of candidacy to that he may choose the better of the (remaining) two, bearing in mind that Allah and Islam will be his witnesses.&#8221; So both the sheiks (i.e. &#8216;Uthman and &#8216;Ali) kept silent. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;Will you both leave this matter to me, and I take Allah as my Witness that I will not choose but the better of you?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman took the hand of one of them (i.e. &#8216;Ali) and said, &#8220;You are related to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and one of the earliest Muslims as you know well. So I ask you by Allah to promise that if I select you as a ruler you will do justice, and if I select &#8216;Uthman as a ruler you will listen to him and obey him.&#8221; Then he took the other (i.e. &#8216;Uthman) aside and said the same to him. When &#8216;Abdur-Rahman secured (their agreement to) this covenant, he said, &#8220;O &#8216;Uthman! Raise your hand.&#8221; So he (i.e. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman) gave him (i.e. &#8216;Uthman) the solemn pledge, and then &#8216;Ali gave him the pledge of allegiance and then all the (Medina) people gave him the pledge of allegiance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Tomorrow I will give the flag to a man with whose leadership Allah will grant (the Muslim) victory.&#8221; So the people kept on thinking the whole night as to who would be given the flag. The next morning the people went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and every one of them hoped that he would be given the flag. The Prophet said, &#8220;Where is Ali bin Abi Talib?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;He is suffering from eye trouble, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Send for him and bring him to me.&#8221; So when &#8216;Ali came, the Prophet spat in his eyes and invoked good on him, and he became alright as if he had no ailment. The Prophet then gave him the flag. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I fight them (i.e. enemy) till they become like us?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Proceed to them steadily till you approach near to them and then invite them to Islam and inform them of their duties towards Allah which Islam prescribes for them, for by Allah, if one man is guided on the right path (i.e. converted to Islam) through you, it would be better for you than (a great number of) red camels.&#8221;</p>

Then he said, &#8220;How could I remain behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; So &#8216;Ali set out following the Prophet , When it was the eve of the day in the morning of which Allah helped (the Muslims) to conquer it, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I will give the flag (to a man), or tomorrow a man whom Allah and His Apostle love will take the flag,&#8221; or said, &#8220;A man who loves Allah and His Apostle; and Allah will grant victory under his leadership.&#8221; Suddenly came &#8216;Ali whom we did not expect. The people said, &#8220;This is &#8216;Ali.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave him the flag and Allah granted victory under his leadership.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to Sahl bin Sad and said, &#8220;This is so-and-so,&#8221; meaning the Governor of Medina, &#8220;He is calling &#8216;Ali bad names near the pulpit.&#8221; Sahl asked, &#8220;What is he saying?&#8221; He (i.e. the man) replied, &#8220;He calls him (i.e. &#8216;Ali) Abu Turab.&#8221; Sahl laughed and said, &#8220;By Allah, none but the Prophet called him by this name and no name was dearer to &#8216;Ali than this.&#8221; So I asked Sahl to tell me more, saying, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abbas! How (was this name given to &#8216;Ali)?&#8221; Sahl said, &#8220;&#8216;Ali went to Fatima and then came out and slept in the Mosque. The Prophet asked Fatima, &#8220;Where is your cousin?&#8221; She said, &#8220;In the Mosque.&#8221; The Prophet went to him and found that his (i.e. Ali&#8217;s) covering sheet had slipped of his back and dust had soiled his back. The Prophet started wiping the dust off his back and said twice, &#8220;Get up! O Abu Turab (i.e. O. man with the dust).&#8221;</p>

Ibn &#8216;Umar mentioned his good deeds and said, &#8220;It is all true, and that is his house in the midst of the houses of the Prophet. Perhaps these facts have hurt you?&#8221; The questioner said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;May Allah stick your nose in the dust (i.e. degrade you or make you do things which you hate) !

Some Captives were brought to the Prophet, she came to him but did not find him at home &#8216;Aisha was present there to whom she told (of her desire for a servant). When the Prophet came, Aisha informed him about Fatima&#8217;s visit. Ali added &#8220;So the Prophet came to us, while we had gone to our bed I wanted to get up but the Prophet said, &#8220;Remain at your place&#8221;. Then he sat down between us till I found the coolness of his feet on my chest. Then he said, &#8220;Shall I teach you a thing which is better than what you have asked me? When you go to bed, say, &#8216;Allahu-Akbar&#8217; thirty-four times, and &#8216;Subhan Allah thirty-three times, and &#8216;Alhamdu-lillah thirty-three times for that is better for you both than a servant.&#8221;</p>

I ate no leavened bread and dressed no decorated striped clothes, and never did a man or a woman serve me, and I often used to press my belly against gravel because of hunger, and I used to ask a man to recite a Quranic Verse to me although I knew it, so that he would take me to his home and feed me. And the most generous of all the people to the poor was Ja&#8217;far bin Abi Talib. He used to take us to his home and offer us what was available therein. He would even offer us an empty folded leather container (of butter) which we would split and lick whatever was in it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima sent somebody to Abu Bakr asking him to give her her inheritance from the Prophet from what Allah had given to His Apostle through Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting). She asked for the Sadaqa (i.e. wealth assigned for charitable purposes) of the Prophet at Medina, and Fadak, and what remained of the Khumus (i.e., one-fifth) of the Khaibar booty. Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;We (Prophets), our property is not inherited, and whatever we leave is Sadaqa, but Muhammad&#8217;s Family can eat from this property, i.e. Allah&#8217;s property, but they have no right to take more than the food they need.&#8217; By Allah! I will not bring any change in dealing with the Sadaqa of the Prophet (and will keep them) as they used to be observed in his (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s) life-time, and I will dispose with it as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do,&#8221; Then &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that Muhammad is His Apostle,&#8221; and added, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! We acknowledge your superiority.&#8221; Then he (i.e. &#8216;Ali) mentioned their own relationship to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and their right. Abu Bakr then spoke saying, &#8220;By Allah in Whose Hands my life is. I love to do good to the relatives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle rather than to my own relatives&#8221; Abu Bark added: Look at Muhammad through his family (i.e. if you are no good to his family you are not good to him).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ali demanded the hand of the daughter of Abu Jahl. Fatima heard of this and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Your people think that you do not become angry for the sake of your daughters as &#8216;Ali is now going to marry the daughter of Abu Jahl. &#8220;On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up and after his recitation of Tashah-hud. I heard him saying, &#8220;Then after! I married one of my daughters to Abu Al-&#8216;As bin Al-Rabi&#8217; (the husband of Zainab, the daughter of the Prophet ) before Islam and he proved truthful in whatever he said to me. No doubt, Fatima is a part of me, I hate to see her being troubled.

The Prophet said, &#8216;If a reputable man amongst the children of Bani Israel committed a theft, they used to forgive him, but if a poor man committed a theft, they would cut his hand. But I would cut even the hand of Fatima (i.e. the daughter of the Prophet) if she committed a theft.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Many amongst men attained perfection but amongst women none attained the perfection except Mary, the daughter of Imran and Asiya, the wife of Pharaoh. And the superiority of &#8216;Aisha to other women is like the superiority of Tharid (i.e. an Arabic dish) to other meals.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 114:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The superiority of &#8216;Aisha over other women is like the superiority of Tharid to other meals.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 115:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once &#8216;Aisha became sick and Ibn &#8216;Abbas went to see her and said, &#8220;O mother of the believers! You are leaving for truthful fore-runners i.e. for Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 116:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Wail:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When &#8216;Ali sent &#8216;Ammar and Al-Hasan to (the people of) Kufa to urge them to fight, &#8216;Ammar addressed them saying, &#8220;I know that she (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) is the wife of the Prophet in this world and in the Hereafter (world to come), but Allah has put you to test, whether you will follow Him (i.e. Allah) or her.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 117:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That she borrowed a necklace from Asma&#8217; and it was lost. Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent some of his companions to look for it. During their journey the time of prayer was due and they prayed without ablution. When they returned to the Prophet they complained about it. So the Divine Verse of Tayammum was revealed. Usaid bin Hudair said (to &#8216;Aisha), &#8220;May Allah reward you handsomely. By Allah, whenever you have a difficulty, Allah took you out of it and brought with it, a Blessing for the Muslims.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 118:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hisham&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in his fatal illness, he started visiting his wives and saying, &#8220;Where will I be tomorrow?&#8221; He was anxious to be in &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s home. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;So when it was my day, the Prophet became silent (no longer asked the question).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 5, Book 57, Number 119:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hisham&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people used to send presents to the Prophet on the day of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s turn. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;My companions (i.e. the other wives of the Prophet) gathered in the house of Um Salama and said, &#8220;0 Um Salama! By Allah, the people choose to send presents on the day of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s turn and we too, love the good (i.e. presents etc.) as &#8216;Aisha does. You should tell Allah&#8217;s Apostle to tell the people to send their presents to him wherever he may be, or wherever his turn may be.&#8221; Um Salama said that to the Prophet and he turned away from her, and when the Prophet returned to her (i.e. Um Salama), she repeated the same, and the Prophet again turned away, and when she told him the same for the third time, the Prophet said, &#8220;O Um Salama! Don&#8217;t trouble me by harming &#8216;Aisha, for by Allah, the Divine Inspiration never came to me while I was under the blanket of any woman amongst you except her.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ghailan bin Jarir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Anas, &#8220;Tell me about the name &#8216;Al-Ansar.; Did  you call yourselves by it or did Allah call you by it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah called  us by it.&#8221; We used to visit Anas (at Basra) and he used to narrate to us the virtues  and deeds of the Ansar, and he used to address me or a person from the tribe of Al-Azd and  say, &#8220;Your tribe did so-and-so on such-and-such a day.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 121: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The day of Bu&#8217;ath (i.e. Day of fighting between the two  tribes of the Ansar, the Aus and Khazraj) was brought about by Allah for the good of His  Apostle so that when Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached (Medina), the tribes of Medina had already  divided and their chiefs had been killed and wounded. So Allah had brought about the  battle for the good of H is Apostle in order that they (i.e. the Ansar) might embrace  Islam. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.058.122"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 122: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of the Conquest of Mecca, when the Prophet had  given (from the booty) the Quraish, the Ansar said, &#8220;By Allah, this is indeed very  strange: While our swords are still dribbling with the blood of Quraish, our war booty are  distributed amongst them.&#8221; When this news reached the Prophet he called the Ansar and  said, &#8220;What is this news that has reached me from you?&#8221; They used not to tell  lies, so they replied, &#8220;What has reached you is true.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it  please you that the people take the booty to their homes and you take Allah&#8217;s Apostle to  your homes? If the Ansar took their way through a valley or a mountain pass, I would take  the Ansar&#8217;s valley or a mountain pass.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 123: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet or Abul-Qasim said, &#8220;If the Ansar took  their way through a valley or a mountain pass, I would take Ansar&#8217;s valley. And but for  the migration, I would have been one of the Ansar.&#8221; Abu Huraira used to say,  &#8220;The Prophet is not unjust (by saying so). May my parents be sacrificed for him, for  the Ansar sheltered and helped him,&#8221; or said a similar sentence. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 124: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sa&#8217;d&#8217;s father: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the emigrants reached Medina. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  established the bond of fraternity between &#8216;Abdur-Rahman and Sad bin Ar-Rabi. Sad said to  &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, &#8220;I am the richest of all the Ansar, so I want to divide my property  (between us), and I have two wives, so see which of the two you like and tell me, so that  I may divorce her, and when she finishes her prescribed period (i.e. &#8216;Idda) of divorce,  then marry her.&#8221; Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;May Allah bless your family and property  for you; where is your market?&#8221; So they showed him the Qainuqa&#8217; market. (He went  there and) returned with a profit in the form of dried yogurt and butter. He continued  going (to the market) till one day he came, bearing the traces of yellow scent. The  Prophet asked, &#8220;What is this (scent)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I got married.&#8221;  The Prophet asked, &#8220;How much Mahr did you give her?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I gave  her a date-stone of gold or a gold piece equal to the weight of a date-stone.&#8221; (The  narrator, Ibrahim, is in doubt as to which is correct.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 125: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf came to us, Allah&#8217;s Apostle  made a bond of fraternity between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi&#8217; who was a rich man, Sad said,  &#8220;The Ansar know that I am the richest of all of them, so I will divide my property  into two parts between me and you, and I have two wives; see which of the two you like so  that I may divorce her and you can marry her after she becomes lawful to you by her  passing the prescribed period (i.e. &#8216;Idda) of divorce. &#8216;Abdur Rahman said, &#8220;May Allah  bless you your family (i.e. wives) for you.&#8221; (But &#8216;Abdur-Rahman went to the market)  and did not return on that day except with some gain of dried yogurt and butter. He went  on trading just a few days till he came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle bearing the traces of yellow  scent over his clothes. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked him, &#8220;What is this scent?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;I have married a woman from the Ansar.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked,  &#8220;How much Mahr have you given?&#8221; He said, &#8220;A date-stone weight of gold or a  golden date-stone.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Arrange a marriage banquet even with a  sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 126: </font></p>

The Prophet  came out, tying his head with a piece of the hem of a sheet. He ascended the pulpit which  he never ascended after that day.

Let my parents be sacrificed for your sake! Please  don&#8217;t raise your head and make it visible, lest an arrow of the enemy should hit you. Let  my neck and chest be wounded instead of yours.&#8221; (On that day) I saw &#8216;Aisha, the  daughter of Abu Bakr and Um Sulaim both lifting their dresses up so that I was able to see  the ornaments of their legs, and they were carrying the water skins of their arms to pour  the water into the mouths of the thirsty people and then go back and fill them and come to  pour the water into the mouths of the people again.

I narrated al I that to the Prophet  who said, &#8216;The garden is Islam, and the hand-hold is the Most Truth-worthy Hand-Hold. So  you will remain as a Muslim till you die.&#8221; The narrator added: &#8220;The man was  &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I came to Medina. I met Abdullah bin Salam. He said,  &#8220;Will you come to me so that I may serve you with Sawiq (i.e. powdered barley) and  dates, and let you enter a (blessed) house that in which the Prophet entered?&#8221; Then  he added, &#8220;You are In a country where the practice of Riba (i.e. usury) is prevalent;  so if somebody owe you something and he sends you a present of a load of chopped straw or  a load of barley or a load of provender then do not take it, as it is Riba.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle has never refused to admit me since I  embraced Islam, and whenever he saw me, he would smile. (In another narration) Jarir bin  &#8216;Abdullah narrated: There was a house called Dhul-Khalasa in the Pre-lslamic Period and it  was also called Al-Ka&#8217;ba Al-Yamaniya or Al-Ka&#8217;ba Ash-Shamiya. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me,  &#8220;Will you relieve me from Dhul-Khalasa?&#8221; So I left for it with 150 cavalrymen  from the tribe of Ahmas and then we destroyed it and killed whoever we found there. Then  we came to the Prophet and informed him about it. He invoked good upon us and upon the  tribe of Ahmas. </font></p>

Beware the ones behind  you!&#8221; So the front files attacked the back ones. Then Hudhaifa looked and saw his  father, and said loudly, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s slaves! My father! My father!&#8221; By Allah,  they did not stop till they killed him (i.e. Hudaifa&#8217;s father). Hudhaifa said, &#8220;May  Allah forgive you!&#8221; The sub-narrator said, &#8220;By Allah, because of what Hudhaifa  said, he remained in a good state till he met Allah (i.e. died).&#8221; </font></p>

When I sometimes said to him, &#8220;(You treat Khadija in  such a way) as if there is no woman on earth except Khadija,&#8221; he would say,  &#8220;Khadija was such-and-such, and from her I had children.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: Once Hala bint Khuwailid, Khadija&#8217;s  sister, asked the permission of the Prophet to enter.

Hala!&#8221; So I became jealous and said, &#8220;What makes you remember an old woman  amongst the old women of Quraish an old woman (with a teethless mouth) of red gums who  died long ago, and in whose place Allah has given you somebody better than her?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet met Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail in the bottom of  (the valley of) Baldah before any Divine Inspiration came to the Prophet. A meal was  presented to the Prophet but he refused to eat from it. (Then it was presented to Zaid)  who said, &#8220;I do not eat anything which you slaughter in the name of your stone idols.  I eat none but those things on which Allah&#8217;s Name has been mentioned at the time of  slaughtering.&#8221; Zaid bin &#8216;Amr used to criticize the way Quraish used to slaughter  their animals, and used to say, &#8220;Allah has created the sheep and He has sent the  water for it from the sky, and He has grown the grass for it from the earth; yet you  slaughter it in other than the Name of Allah. He used to say so, for he rejected that  practice and considered it as something abominable. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: Zaid bin &#8216;Amr bin Nufail went to Sham,  inquiring about a true religion to follow. He met a Jewish religious scholar and asked him  about their religion. He said, &#8220;I intend to embrace your religion, so tell me some  thing about it.&#8221; The Jew said, &#8220;You will not embrace our religion unless you  receive your share of Allah&#8217;s Anger.&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;&#8216;I do not run except from  Allah&#8217;s Anger, and I will never bear a bit of it if I have the power to avoid it. Can you  tell me of some other religion?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I do not know any other religion  except the Hanif.&#8221; Zaid enquired, &#8220;What is Hanif?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Hanif is  the religion of (the prophet) Abraham who was neither a Jew nor a Christian, and he used  to worship None but Allah (Alone)&#8221; Then Zaid went out and met a Christian religious  scholar and told him the same as before. The Christian said, &#8220;You will not embrace  our religion unless you get a share of Allah&#8217;s Curse.&#8221; Zaid replied, &#8220;I do not  run except from Allah&#8217;s Curse, and I will never bear any of Allah&#8217;s Curse and His Anger if  I have the power to avoid them. Will you tell me of some other religion?&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;I do not know any other religion except Hanif.&#8221; Zaid enquired, &#8220;What is  Hanif?&#8221; He replied, Hanif is the religion of (the prophet) Abraham who was neither a  Jew nor a Christian and he used to worship None but Allah (Alone)&#8221; When Zaid heard  their Statement about (the religion of) Abraham, he left that place, and when he came out,  he raised both his hands and said, &#8220;O Allah! I make You my Witness that I am on the  religion of Abraham.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Asma bint Abi Bakr: I saw Zaid bin Amr bin Nufail  standing with his back against the Ka&#8217;ba and saying, &#8220;O people of Quraish! By Allah,  none amongst you is on the religion of Abraham except me.&#8221; He used to preserve the  lives of little girls: If somebody wanted to kill his daughter he would say to him,  &#8220;Do not kill her for I will feed her on your behalf.&#8221; So he would take her, and  when she grew up nicely, he would say to her father, &#8220;Now if you want her, I will  give her to you, and if you wish, I will feed her on your behalf.&#8221; </font></p>

So she spoke and said, &#8220;Who are  you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;A man from the Emigrants.&#8221; She asked, &#8220;Which  Emigrants?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;From Quraish.&#8221; She asked, &#8220;From what branch  of Quraish are you?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You ask too many questions; I am Abu Bakr.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;How long shall we enjoy this good order (i.e. Islamic religion) which  Allah has brought after the period of ignorance?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You will enjoy it as  long as your Imams keep on abiding by its rules and regulations.&#8221; She asked,  &#8220;What are the Imams?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Were there not heads and chiefs of your  nation who used to order the people and they used to obey them?&#8221; She said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;So they (i.e. the Imams) are those whom I meant.&#8221; </font></p>

They (i.e. my masters) accused me of  stealing it and they tortured me to such an extent that they even looked for it in my  private parts. So, while they all were around me, and I was in my great distress, suddenly  the kite came over our heads and threw the scarf, and they took it. I said to them &#8216;This  is what you accused me of stealing, though I was innocent.&#8221; </font></p>

A man from Banu Hashim was employed by a  Quraishi man from another branch-family. The (Hashimi) laborer set out with the Quraishi  driving his camels. There passed by him another man from Banu Hashim. The leather rope of  the latter&#8217;s bag had broken so he said to the laborer, &#8220;Will you help me by giving me  a rope in order to tie the handle of my bag lest the camels should run away from me?&#8221;  The laborer gave him a rope and the latter tied his bag with it. When the caravan halted,  all the camels&#8217; legs were tied with their fetters except one camel. The employer asked the  laborer, &#8220;Why, from among all the camels has this camel not been fettered?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;There is no fetter for it.&#8221; The Quraishi asked, &#8220;Where is its  fetter?&#8221; and hit the laborer with a stick that caused his death (later on Just before  his death) a man from Yemen passed by him. The laborer asked (him), &#8220;Will you go for  the pilgrimage?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I do not think I will attend it, but perhaps I  will attend it.&#8221; The (Hashimi) laborer said, &#8220;Will you please convey a message  for me once in your life?&#8221; The other man said, &#8220;yes.&#8221; The laborer wrote:  &#8216;When you attend the pilgrimage, call the family of Quraish, and if they respond to you,  call the family of Banu Hashim, and if they respond to you, ask about Abu Talib and tell  him that so-and-so has killed me for a fetter.&#8221; Then the laborer expired. When the  employer reached (Mecca), Abu Talib visited him and asked, &#8220;What has happened to our  companion?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He became ill and I looked after him nicely (but he died)  and I buried him.&#8221; Then Abu Talib said, &#8220;The deceased deserved this from  you.&#8221; After some time, the messenger whom the laborer has asked to convey the  message, reached during the pilgrimage season. He called, &#8220;O the family of  Quraish!&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;This is Quraish.&#8221; Then he called, &#8220;O  the family of Banu Hashim!&#8221; Again the people replied, &#8220;This is Banu  Hashim.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;Who is Abu Talib?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;This is  Abu Talib.&#8221; He said, &#8220;&#8216;So-and-so has asked me to convey a message to you that  so-and-so has killed him for a fetter (of a camel).&#8221; Then Abu Talib went to the  (Quraishi) killer and said to him, &#8220;Choose one of three alternatives: (i) If you  wish, give us one-hundred camels because you have murdered our companion, (ii) or if you  wish, fifty of your men should take an oath that you have not murdered our companion, and  if you do not accept this, (iii) we will kill you in Qisas.&#8221; The killer went to his  people and they said, &#8220;We will take an oath.&#8221; Then a woman from Banu Hashim who  was married to one of them (i.e.the Quraishis) and had given birth to a child from him,  came to Abu Talib and said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! I wish that my son from among the fifty  men, should be excused from this oath, and that he should not take the oath where the  oath-taking is carried on.&#8221; Abu Talib excused him. Then another man from them came  (to Abu Talib) and said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! You want fifty persons to take an oath instead  of giving a hundred camels, and that means each man has to give two camels (in case he  does not take an oath). So there are two camels I would like you to accept from me and  excuse me from taking an oath where the oaths are taken. Abu Talib accepted them from him.  Then 48 men came and took the oath. Ibn &#8216;Abbas further said:) By Him in Whose Hand my life  is, before the end of that year, none of those 48 persons remained alive. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah caused the day of Buath to take place before Allah&#8217;s  Apostle was sent (as an Apostle) so that when Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Medina, those people  had already divided (in different groups) and their chiefs had been killed or wounded.

A saw might be put over the parting of his head  which would be split into two parts, yet all that would never make him abandon his  religion.

The Prophet did not raise his head, (till)  Fatima, came and took it off his back and cursed the one who had done the harm. The  Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Destroy the chiefs of Quraish, Abu Jahl bin Hisham, &#8216;Utba bin  Rabi&#8217;al, Shaba bin Rabi&#8217;a, Umaiya bin Khalaf or Ubai bin Khalaf.&#8221; (The sub-narrator  Shu&#8217;ba, is not sure of the last name.)

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;AbdurRahman bin Abza said, &#8220;Ask Ibn &#8216;Abbas about  these two Qur&#8217;anic Verses: &#8216;Nor kill such life as Allah has made sacred, Except for just  cause.&#8217; (25.168) &#8220;And whoever kills a believer intentionally, his recompense is Hell.  (4.93) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So I asked Ibn &#8216;Abbas who said, &#8220;When the Verse that  is in Sura-al-Furqan was revealed, the pagans of Mecca said, &#8216;But we have slain such life  as Allah has made sacred, and we have invoked other gods along with Allah, and we have  also committed fornication.&#8217; So Allah revealed:&#8211; &#8216;Except those who repent, believe, and  do good&#8211; (25.70) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So this Verse was concerned with those people. As for the  Verse in Surat-an-Nisa (4-93), it means that if a man, after understanding Islam and its  laws and obligations, murders somebody, then his punishment is to dwell in the (Hell) Fire  forever.&#8221; Then I mentioned this to Mujahid who said, &#8220;Except the one who regrets  (one&#8217;s crime) . &#8221; </font></p>

When he finished, I walked with him and asked, &#8220;What about the bone  and the animal dung?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They are of the food of Jinns. The delegate of  Jinns of (the city of) Nasibin came to me&#8211;and how nice those Jinns were&#8211;and asked me for  the remains of the human food.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abu Dhar received the news of the Advent of the  Prophet he said to his brother, &#8220;Ride to this valley (of Mecca) and try to find out  the truth of the person who claims to be a prophet who is informed of the news of Heaven.  Listen to what he says and come back to me.&#8221; So his brother set out and came to the  Prophet and listened to some of his talks, and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him.  &#8220;I have seen him enjoining virtuous behavior and saying something that is not  poetry.&#8221; Abu Dhar said, &#8220;You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted.&#8221; He  then took his journey-food and carried a water-skin of his, containing some water till be  reached Mecca. He went to the Mosque and searched for the Prophet and though he did not  know him, he hated to ask anybody about him. When a part of the night had passed away,  &#8216;Ali saw him and knew that he was a stranger. So when Abu Dhar saw &#8216;Ali, he followed him,  and none of them asked his companion about anything, and when it was dawn, Abu Dhar took  his journey food and his water-skin to the Mosque and stayed there all the day long  without being perceived by the Prophet, and when it was evening, he came back to his  retiring place. &#8216;Ali passed by him and said, &#8220;Has the man not known his dwelling  place yet?&#8221; So &#8216;Ali awakened him and took him with him and none of them spoke to the  other about anything. When it was the third day. &#8216;Ali did the same and Abu Dhar stayed  with him. Then &#8216;Ali said &#8220;Will you tell me what has brought you here?&#8221; Abu Dhar  said, &#8220;If you give me a firm promise that you will guide me, then I will tell  you.&#8221; &#8216;Ali promised him, and he informed &#8216;Ali about the matter. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;It  is true, and he is the Apostle of Allah. Next morning when you get up, accompany me, and  if I see any danger for you, I will stop as if to pass water, but if I go on, follow me  and enter the place which I will enter.&#8221; Abu Dhar did so, and followed &#8216;Ali till he  entered the place of the Prophet, and Abu Dhar went in with him, Abu Dhar listened to some  of the Prophet&#8217;s talks and embraced Islam on the spot. The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go  back to your people and inform them (about it) till you receive my order.&#8221; Abu Dhar  said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hand my life is, I will proclaim my conversion loudly amongst  them (i.e. the pagans).&#8221; So he went out, and when he reached the Mosque, he said as  loudly as possible, &#8220;I bear witness that None has the right to be worshipped except  Allah, and Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The People got up and beat him  painfully. Then Al-Abbas came and knelt over him ((to protect him) and said (to the  people), &#8220;Woe to you! Don&#8217;t you know that this man belongs to the tribe of Ghifar and  your trade to Sha&#8217;m is through their way?&#8221; So he rescued him from them. Abu Dhar  again did the same the next day. They beat him and took vengeance on him and again  Al-Abbas knelt over him (to protect him). </font></p>

Call the man  to me.&#8221; When the man was called to him, he told him of his thought.

An  (unseen) creature shouted at him, and I have never heard harsher than his voice. He was  crying, &#8216;O you bold evil-doer! A matter of success!

And if the mountain of Uhud could move from its place for the evil which you  people have done to Uthman, it would have the right to do that.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Adi bin Al-Khiyar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad  bin &#8216;Abu Yaghuth had said to him, &#8220;What prevents you from speaking to your uncle  &#8216;Uthman regarding his brother Al-Walid bin &#8216;Uqba?&#8221; The people were speaking against  the latter for what he had done. &#8216;Ubaidullah said, &#8220;So I kept waiting for &#8216;Uthman,  and when he went out for the prayer, I said to him, &#8216;I have got something to say to you as  a piece of advice.&#8217; &#8216;Uthman said, &#8216;O man! I seek Refuge with Allah from you. So I went  away. When I finished my prayer, I sat with Al-Miswar and Ibn &#8216;Abu Yaghuth and talked to  both of them of what I had said to &#8216;Uthman and what he had said to me. They said, &#8216;You  have done your duty.&#8217; So while I was sitting with them. &#8216;Uthman&#8217;s Messenger came to me.  They said, &#8216;Allah has put you to trial.&#8221; I set out and when I reached &#8216;Uthman, he  said, &#8216;What is your advice which you mentioned a while ago?&#8217; I recited Tashahhud and  added, &#8216;Allah has sent Muhammad and has revealed the Holy Book (i.e. Quran) to him. You (O  Uthman!) were amongst those who responded to the call of Allah and His Apostle and had  faith in him. And you took part in the first two migrations (to Ethiopia and to Medina),  and you enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and learned his traditions and advice. Now  the people are talking much about Al-Walid bin &#8216;Uqba and so it is your duty to impose on  him the legal punishment.&#8217; &#8216;Uthman then said to me, &#8216;O my nephew! Did you ever meet  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No, but his knowledge has reached me as it has reached the  virgin in her seclusion.&#8217; &#8216;Uthman then recited Tashahhud and said, &#8216;No doubt, Allah has  sent Muhammad with the Truth and has revealed to him His Holy Book (i.e. Quran) and I was  amongst those who responded to the call of Allah and His Apostle and I had faith in  Muhammad&#8217;s Mission, and I had performed the first two migrations as you have said, and I  enjoyed the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and gave the pledge of allegiance to him. By Allah,  I never disobeyed him and never cheated him till Allah caused him to die. Then Allah made  Abu Bakr Caliph, and by Allah, I was never disobedient to him, nor did I cheat him. Then  &#8216;Umar became Caliph, and by Allah, I was never disobedient to him, nor did I cheat him.  Then I became Caliph. Have I not then the same rights over you as they had over me?&#8217; I  replied in the affirmative. &#8216;Uthman further said, &#8216;The what are these talks which are  reaching me from you? As for what you ha mentioned about Al-Walid bin &#8216;Uqb; Allah willing,  I shall give him the leg; punishment justly. Then Uthman ordered that Al-Walid be flogged  fort lashes. He ordered &#8216;Ali to flog him an he himself flogged him as well.&#8221; </font></p>

We used to greet you in the past and you used to reply to  us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Verily The Mind is occupied and busy with more important matter  during the prayer.&#8221; (So one cannot return One&#8217;s greetings.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abu Talib was in his death bed, the Prophet went to  him while Abu Jahl was sitting beside him. The Prophet said, &#8220;O my uncle! Say: None  has the right to be worshipped except Allah, an expression I will defend your case with,  before Allah.&#8221; Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Umaya said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! Will you  leave the religion of &#8216;Abdul Muttalib?&#8221; So they kept on saying this to him so that  the last statement he said to them (before he died) was: &#8220;I am on the religion of  &#8216;Abdul Muttalib.&#8221; Then the Prophet said, &#8221; I will keep on asking for Allah&#8217;s  Forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so.&#8221; Then the following Verse was  revealed:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;It is not fitting for the Prophet and the believers  to ask Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for the pagans, even if they were their near relatives, after  it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; (9.113) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Malik bin Sasaa said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle described to them  his Night Journey saying, &#8220;While I was lying in Al-Hatim or Al-Hijr, suddenly someone  came to me and cut my body open from here to here.&#8221; I asked Al-Jarud who was by my  side, &#8220;What does he mean?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It means from his throat to his pubic  area,&#8221; or said, &#8220;From the top of the chest.&#8221; The Prophet further said,  &#8220;He then took out my heart. Then a gold tray of Belief was brought to me and my heart  was washed and was filled (with Belief) and then returned to its original place. Then a  white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to  me.&#8221; (On this Al-Jarud asked, &#8220;Was it the Buraq, O Abu Hamza?&#8221; I (i.e.  Anas) replied in the affirmative). The Prophet said, &#8220;The animal&#8217;s step (was so wide  that it) reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal&#8217;s sight. I was carried  on it, and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When he asked for the gate to be opened, it was asked, &#8216;Who  is it?&#8217; Gabriel answered, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel  replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has Muhammad been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the  affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217; The gate  was opened, and when I went over the first heaven, I saw Adam there. Gabriel said (to me).  &#8216;This is your father, Adam; pay him your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the  greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel  ascended with me till we reached the second heaven. Gabriel asked for the gate to be  opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel answered, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is  accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217;  Gabriel answered in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent  visit his is!&#8217; The gate was opened. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I went over the second heaven, there I saw Yahya (i.e.  John) and &#8216;Isa (i.e. Jesus) who were cousins of each other. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;These  are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted them and both of them returned  my greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then  Gabriel ascended with me to the third heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was  asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217;  Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the  affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is!&#8217; The gate  was opened, and when I went over the third heaven there I saw Joseph. Gabriel said (to  me), &#8216;This is Joseph; pay him your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the  greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then  Gabriel ascended with me to the fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was  asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217;  Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the  affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed, what an excel lent visit his is!&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The gate was opened, and when I went over the fourth  heaven, there I saw Idris. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;This is Idris; pay him your greetings.&#8217;  So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious  brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fifth heaven and asked  for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was  asked. &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been  called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said He is welcomed, what an  excellent visit his is! So when I went over the fifth heaven, there I saw Harun (i.e.  Aaron), Gabriel said, (to me). This is Aaron; pay him your greetings.&#8217; I greeted him and  he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious  Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be  opened. It was asked. &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is  accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217;  Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit  his is!&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I went (over the sixth heaven), there I saw Moses.  Gabriel said (to me),&#8217; This is Moses; pay him your greeting. So I greeted him and he  returned the greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious  Prophet.&#8217; When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. Someone asked him, &#8216;What makes you weep?&#8217;  Moses said, &#8216;I weep because after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose  followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended  with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is  it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked,&#8217; Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied,  &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then  it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there I saw  Abraham. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;This is your father; pay your greetings to him.&#8217; So I  greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious son  and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then I was made to ascend to Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. the Lote Tree of  the utmost boundary) Behold! Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near  Medina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, &#8216;This is the  Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and  two were visible, I asked, &#8216;What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?&#8217; He replied,&#8217;  As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the  Nile and the Euphrates.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Al-Bait-ul-Ma&#8217;mur (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to  me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were  brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, &#8216;This is the Islamic religion which you  and your followers are following.&#8217; Then the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty  prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), &#8216;What have you been  ordered to do?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.&#8217; Moses said,  &#8216;Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before  you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and  ask for reduction to lessen your followers&#8217; burden.&#8217; So I went back, and Allah reduced ten  prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said  before. Then again I went back to Allah and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back  to Moses he said the same, I went back to Allah and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a  day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice, so I went back to Allah and  was ordered to observe five prayers a day. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I came back to Moses, he said, &#8216;What have you been  ordered?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Your  followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I have got an experience of the  people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel, so go back to your  Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your follower&#8217;s burden.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I have requested so  much of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender to Allah&#8217;s  Order.&#8217; When I left, I heard a voice saying, &#8216;I have passed My Order and have lessened the  burden of My Worshipers.&#8221; </font></p>

She called me, and I went to her, not  knowing what she wanted to do to me. She caught me by the hand and made me stand at the  door of the house. I was breathless then, and when my breathing became Allright, she took  some water and rubbed my face and head with it. Then she took me into the house. There in  the house I saw some Ansari women who said, &#8220;Best wishes and Allah&#8217;s Blessing and a  good luck.&#8221; Then she entrusted me to them and they prepared me (for the marriage).  Unexpectedly Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me in the forenoon and my mother handed me over to  him, and at that time I was a girl of nine years of age. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered us to cover his head and put  some Idhkhir (i.e. a special kind of grass) on his feet. (On the other hand) some of us  have had their fruits ripened (in this world) and they are collecting them.&#8221; </font></p>

A believer used to run away with his religion to Allah and His Apostle lest he  should be put to trial because of his religion. Today Allah has made Islam triumphant, and  today a believer can worship his Lord wherever he likes. But the deeds that are still  rewardable (in place of emigration) are Jihad and good intentions.&#8221; (See Hadith No.  42 Vol. 4). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sat on the pulpit and said, &#8220;Allah has  given one of His Slaves the choice of receiving the splendor and luxury of the worldly  life whatever he likes or to accept the good (of the Hereafter) which is with Allah. So he  has chosen that good which is with Allah.&#8221; On that Abu Bakr wept and said, &#8220;Our  fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you.&#8221; We became astonished at this. The people  said, &#8220;Look at this old man! Allah&#8217;s Apostle talks about a Slave of Allah to whom He  has given the option to choose either the splendor of this worldly life or the good which  is with Him, while he says. &#8216;our fathers and mothers be sacrifice(i for you.&#8221; But it  was Allah&#8217;s Apostle who had been given option, and Abu Bakr knew it better than we.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle added, &#8220;No doubt, I am indebted to Abu Bakr more than to anybody else  regarding both his companionship and his wealth. And if I had to take a Khalil from my  followers, I would certainly have taken Abu Bakr, but the fraternity of Islam is.  sufficient. Let no door (i.e. Khoukha) of the Mosque remain open, except the door of Abu  Bakr.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="005.058.245"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 245: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) I never remembered my parents  believing in any religion other than the true religion (i.e. Islam), and (I don&#8217;t  remember) a single day passing without our being visited by Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the morning  and in the evening. When the Muslims were put to test (i.e. troubled by the pagans), Abu  Bakr set out migrating to the land of Ethiopia, and when he reached Bark-al-Ghimad, Ibn  Ad-Daghina, the chief of the tribe of Qara, met him and said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Where are  you going?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;My people have turned me out (of my country), so  I want to wander on the earth and worship my Lord.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghina said, &#8220;O Abu  Bakr! A man like you should not leave his home-land, nor should he be driven out, because  you help the destitute, earn their livings, and you keep good relations with your Kith and  kin, help the weak and poor, entertain guests generously, and help the calamity-stricken  persons. Therefore I am your protector. Go back and worship your Lord in your town.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So Abu Bakr returned and Ibn Ad-Daghina accompanied him. In  the evening Ibn Ad-Daghina visited the nobles of Quraish and said to them. &#8220;A man  like Abu Bakr should not leave his homeland, nor should he be driven out. Do you (i.e.  Quraish) drive out a man who helps the destitute, earns their living, keeps good relations  with his Kith and kin, helps the weak and poor, entertains guests generously and helps the  calamity-stricken persons?&#8221; So the people of Quraish could not refuse Ibn  Ad-Daghina&#8217;s protection, and they said to Ibn Ad-Daghina, &#8220;Let Abu Bakr worship his  Lord in his house. He can pray and recite there whatever he likes, but he should not hurt  us with it, and should not do it publicly, because we are afraid that he may affect our  women and children.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghina told Abu Bakr of all that. Abu Bakr stayed in  that state, worshipping his Lord in his house. He did not pray publicly, nor did he recite  Quran outside his house. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then a thought occurred to Abu Bakr to build a mosque in  front of his house, and there he used to pray and recite the Quran. The women and children  of the pagans began to gather around him in great number. They used to wonder at him and  look at him. Abu Bakr was a man who used to weep too much, and he could not help weeping  on reciting the Quran. That situation scared the nobles of the pagans of Quraish, so they  sent for Ibn Ad-Daghina. When he came to them, they said, &#8220;We accepted your  protection of Abu Bakr on condition that he should worship his Lord in his house, but he  has violated the conditions and he has built a mosque in front of his house where he prays  and recites the Quran publicly. We are now afraid that he may affect our women and  children unfavorably. So, prevent him from that. If he likes to confine the worship of his  Lord to his house, he may do so, but if he insists on doing that openly, ask him to  release you from your obligation to protect him, for we dislike to break our pact with  you, but we deny Abu Bakr the right to announce his act publicly.&#8221; Ibn Ad-Daghina  went to Abu- Bakr and said, (&#8220;O Abu Bakr!) You know well what contract I have made on  your behalf; now, you are either to abide by it, or else release me from my obligation of  protecting you, because I do not want the &#8216;Arabs hear that my people have dishonored a  contract I have made on behalf of another man.&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;I release you  from your pact to protect me, and am pleased with the protection from Allah.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>At that time the Prophet was in Mecca, and he said to the  Muslims, &#8220;In a dream I have been shown your migration place, a land of date palm  trees, between two mountains, the two stony tracts.&#8221; So, some people migrated to  Medina, and most of those people who had previously migrated to the land of Ethiopia,  returned to Medina. Abu Bakr also prepared to leave for Medina, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle said  to him, &#8220;Wait for a while, because I hope that I will be allowed to migrate  also.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Do you indeed expect this? Let my father be sacrificed  for you!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; So Abu Bakr did not migrate for the sake  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in order to accompany him. He fed two she-camels he possessed with the  leaves of As-Samur tree that fell on being struck by a stick for four months. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>One day, while we were sitting in Abu Bakr&#8217;s house at noon,  someone said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;This is Allah&#8217;s Apostle with his head covered coming at a  time at which he never used to visit us before.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;May my parents  be sacrificed for him. By Allah, he has not come at this hour except for a great  necessity.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and asked permission to enter, and he was allowed  to enter. When he entered, he said to Abu Bakr. &#8220;Tell everyone who is present with  you to go away.&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;There are none but your family. May my  father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;i have been  given permission to migrate.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Shall I accompany you? May my  father be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May my father be sacrificed for  you, take one of these two she-camels of mine.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;(I  will accept it) with payment.&#8221; So we prepared the baggage quickly and put some  journey food in a leather bag for them. Asma, Abu Bakr&#8217;s daughter, cut a piece from her  waist belt and tied the mouth of the leather bag with it, and for that reason she was  named Dhat-un-Nitaqain (i.e. the owner of two belts). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr reached a cave on the  mountain of Thaur and stayed there for three nights. &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Bakr who was  intelligent and a sagacious youth, used to stay (with them) aver night. He used to leave  them before day break so that in the morning he would be with Quraish as if he had spent  the night in Mecca. He would keep in mind any plot made against them, and when it became  dark he would (go and) inform them of it. &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira, the freed slave of Abu Bakr,  used to bring the milch sheep (of his master, Abu Bakr) to them a little while after  nightfall in order to rest the sheep there. So they always had fresh milk at night, the  milk of their sheep, and the milk which they warmed by throwing heated stones in it. &#8216;Amir  bin Fuhaira would then call the herd away when it was still dark (before daybreak). He did  the same in each of those three nights. Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr had hired a man from  the tribe of Bani Ad-Dail from the family of Bani Abd bin Adi as an expert guide, and he  was in alliance with the family of Al-&#8216;As bin Wail As-Sahmi and he was on the religion of  the infidels of Quraish. The Prophet and Abu Bakr trusted him and gave him their two  she-camels and took his promise to bring their two she camels to the cave of the mountain  of Thaur in the morning after three nights later. And (when they set out), &#8216;Amir bin  Fuhaira and the guide went along with them and the guide led them along the sea-shore. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The nephew of Suraqa bin Ju&#8217;sham said that his father  informed him that he heard Suraqa bin Ju&#8217;sham saying, &#8220;The messengers of the heathens  of Quraish came to us declaring that they had assigned for the persons why would kill or  arrest Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr, a reward equal to their bloodmoney. While I was  sitting in one of the gatherings of my tribe. Bani Mudlij, a man from them came to us and  stood up while we were sitting, and said, &#8220;O Suraqa! No doubt, I have just seen some  people far away on the seashore, and I think they are Muhammad and his companions.&#8221;  Suraqa added, &#8220;I too realized that it must have been they. But I said &#8216;No, it is not  they, but you have seen so-and-so, and so-and-so whom we saw set out.&#8217; I stayed in the  gathering for a while and then got up and left for my home. and ordered my slave-girl to  get my horse which was behind a hillock, and keep it ready for me. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then I took my spear and left by the back door of my house  dragging the lower end of the spear on the ground and keeping it low. Then I reached my  horse, mounted it and made it gallop. When I approached them (i.e. Muhammad and Abu Bakr),  my horse stumbled and I fell down from it, Then I stood up, got hold of my quiver and took  out the divining arrows and drew lots as to whether I should harm them (i.e. the Prophet  and Abu Bakr) or not, and the lot which I disliked came out. But I remounted my horse and  let it gallop, giving no importance to the divining arrows. When I heard the recitation of  the Quran by Allah&#8217;s Apostle who did not look hither and thither while Abu Bakr was doing  it often, suddenly the forelegs of my horse sank into the ground up to the knees, and I  fell down from it. Then I rebuked it and it got up but could hardly take out its forelegs  from the ground, and when it stood up straight again, its fore-legs caused dust to rise up  in the sky like smoke. Then again I drew lots with the divining arrows, and the lot which  I disliked, came out. So I called upon them to feel secure. They stopped, and I remounted  my horse and went to them. When I saw how I had been hampered from harming them, it came  to my mind that the cause of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (i.e. Islam) will become victorious. So I  said to him, &#8220;Your people have assigned a reward equal to the bloodmoney for your  head.&#8221; Then I told them all the plans the people of Mecca had made concerning them.  Then I offered them some journey food and goods but they refused to take anything and did  not ask for anything, but the Prophet said, &#8220;Do not tell others about us.&#8221; Then  I requested him to write for me a statement of security and peace. He ordered &#8216;Amr bin  Fuhaira who wrote it for me on a parchment, and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle proceeded on his way.  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair: Allah&#8217;s Apostle met Az-Zubair  in a caravan of Muslim merchants who were returning from Sham. Az-Zubair provided Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and Abu Bakr with white clothes to wear. When the Muslims of Medina heard the news  of the departure of Allah&#8217;s Apostle from Mecca (towards Medina), they started going to the  Harra every morning . They would wait for him till the heat of the noon forced them to  return. One day, after waiting for a long while, they returned home, and when they went  into their houses, a Jew climbed up the roof of one of the forts of his people to look for  some thing, and he saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions dressed in white clothes,  emerging out of the desert mirage. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Jew could not help shouting at the top of his voice,  &#8220;O you &#8216;Arabs! Here is your great man whom you have been waiting for!&#8221; So all  the Muslims rushed to their arms and received Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the summit of Harra. The  Prophet turned with them to the right and alighted at the quarters of Bani &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf,  and this was on Monday in the month of Rabi-ul-Awal. Abu Bakr stood up, receiving the  people while Allah&#8217;s Apostle sat down and kept silent. Some of the Ansar who came and had  not seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle before, began greeting Abu Bakr, but when the sunshine fell on  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr came forward and shaded him with his sheet only then the  people came to know Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle stayed with Bani &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf for  ten nights and established the mosque (mosque of Quba) which was founded on piety. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle prayed in it and then mounted his she-camel and proceeded on, accompanied by the  people till his she-camel knelt down at (the place of) the Mosque of Allah&#8217;s Apostle at  Medina. Some Muslims used to pray there in those days, and that place was a yard for  drying dates belonging to Suhail and Sahl, the orphan boys who were under the guardianship  of &#8216;Asad bin Zurara. When his she-camel knelt down, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;This  place, Allah willing, will be our abiding place.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then called the two  boys and told them to suggest a price for that yard so that he might take it as a mosque.  The two boys said, &#8220;No, but we will give it as a gift, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle then built a mosque there. The Prophet himself started carrying unburnt  bricks for its building and while doing so, he was saying &#8220;This load is better than  the load of Khaibar, for it is more pious in the Sight of Allah and purer and better  rewardable.&#8221; He was also saying, &#8220;O Allah! The actual reward is the reward in  the Hereafter, so bestow Your Mercy on the Ansar and the Emigrants.&#8221; Thus the Prophet  recited (by way of proverb) the poem of some Muslim poet whose name is unknown to me. </font></p>

Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle felt  thirsty and he passed by a shepherd.

The  Prophet asked for a date, chewed it, and put some of its juice in the child&#8217;s mouth. So,  the first thing that entered the child&#8217;s stomach was the saliva of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then  the Prophet rubbed the child&#8217;s palate with a date and invoked for Allah&#8217;s Blessings on  him, and he was the first child born amongst the Emigrants in the Islamic Land (i.e.  Medina). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived at Medina with Abu Bakr, riding  behind him on the same camel. Abu Bakr was an elderly man known to the people, while  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was a youth that was unknown. Thus, if a man met Abu Bakr, he would day,  &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Who is this man in front of you?&#8221; Abu Bakr would say, &#8220;This  man shows me the Way,&#8221; One would think that Abu Bakr meant the road, while in fact,  Abu Bakr meant the way of virtue and good. Then Abu Bakr looked behind and saw a  horse-rider persuing them. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! This is a horse-rider  persuing us.&#8221; The Prophet looked behind and said, &#8220;O Allah! Cause him to fall  down.&#8221; So the horse threw him down and got up neighing. After that the rider, Suraqa  said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Order me whatever you want.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Stay where you are and do not allow anybody to reach us.&#8221; So, in the first part  of the day Suraqa was an enemy of Allah&#8217;s Prophet and in the last part of it, he was a  protector. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle alighted by the side of the Al-Harra and sent a message to  the Ansar, and they came to Allah&#8217;s Prophet and Abu Bakr, and having greeted them, they  said, &#8220;Ride (your she-camels) safe and obeyed.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr  rode and the Ansar, carrying their arms, surrounded them. The news that Allah&#8217;s Prophet  had come circulated in Medina. The people came out and were eagerly looking and saying  &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Prophet has come! Allah&#8217;s Prophet has come! So the Prophet went on till he  alighted near the house of Abu Aiyub. While the Prophet was speaking with the family  members of Abu Aiyub, &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam heard the news of his arrival while he himself  was picking the dates for his family from his family garden. He hurried to the Prophet  carrying the dates which he had collected for his family from the garden. He listened to  Allah&#8217;s Prophet and then went home. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Allah&#8217;s Prophet said, &#8220;Which is the nearest of  the houses of our Kith and kin?&#8221; Abu Aiyub replied, &#8220;Mine, O Allah&#8217;s Prophet!  This is my house and this is my gate.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go and prepare a place  for our midday rest.&#8221; Abu Aiyub said, &#8220;Get up (both of you) with Allah&#8217;s  Blessings.&#8221; So when Allah&#8217;s Prophet went into the house, &#8216;Abdullah bin Salaim came  and said &#8220;I testify that you (i.e. Muhammad) are Apostle of Allah and that you have  come with the Truth. The Jews know well that I am their chief and the son of their chief  and the most learned amongst them and the son of the most learned amongst them. So send  for them (i.e. Jews) and ask them about me before they know that I have embraced Islam,  for if they know that they will say about me things which are not correct.&#8221; So  Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for them, and they came and entered. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them,  &#8220;O (the group of) Jews! Woe to you: be afraid of Allah. By Allah except Whom none has  the right to be worshipped, you people know for certain, that I am Apostle of Allah and  that I have come to you with the Truth, so embrace Islam.&#8221; The Jews replied, &#8220;We  do not know this.&#8221; So they said this to the Prophet and he repeated it thrice. Then  he said, &#8220;What sort of a man is &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam amongst you?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;He is our chief and the son of our chief and the most learned man, and the son of  the most learned amongst us.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What would you think if he should  embrace Islam?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&#8221; He  said, &#8221; What would you think if he should embrace Islam?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Allah  forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&#8221; He said, &#8220;What would you think if he should  embrace Islam?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Allah forbid! He can not embrace Islam.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;O Ibn Salaim! Come out to them.&#8221; He came out and said, &#8220;O (the group  of) Jews! 8e afraid of Allah except Whom none has the right to be worshipped. You know for  certain that he is Apostle of Allah and that he has brought a True Religion!&#8217; They said,  &#8220;You tell a lie.&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle turned them out. </font></p>

Some of us passed away without  eating anything of their rewards in this world. One of these was Mus&#8217;ab bin &#8216;Umar who was  martyred on the day of the battle of Uhud. We did not find anything to shroud his body  with except a striped cloak. When we covered his head with it, his feet remained  uncovered, and when we covered his feet with it, his head remained uncovered. So Allah&#8217;s  Apostle ordered us to cover his head with it and put some Idhkhir (i.e. a kind of grass)  over his feet. And there are some amongst us whose fruits have ripened and they are  collecting them (i.e. they have received their rewards in this world). </font></p>

Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Close observers were appointed by our  enemies to watch us. So we went out at night and travelled throughout the night and the  following day till it was noon, then we perceived a rock and went towards it, and there  was some shade under it. I spread a cloak I had with me for Allah&#8217;s Apostle and then the  Prophet layed on it. I went out to guard him and all of a sudden I saw a shepherd coming  with his sheep looking for the same, the shade of the rock as we did, I asked him, &#8216;O boy,  to whom do you belong?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I belong to so-and-so.&#8217; I asked him, &#8216;Is there some  milk in your sheep?&#8217; He replied in the affirmative. I asked him, &#8216;Will you milk?&#8217; He  replied in the affirmative. Then he got hold of one of his sheep. I said to him, &#8216;Remove  the dust from its udder.&#8217; Then he milked a little milk. I had a water-skin with me which  was tied with a piece of cloth. I had prepared the water-skin for Allah&#8217;s Apostle . So I  poured some water over the milk (container) till its bottom became cold. Then I brought  the milk to the Prophet and said, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle drank till I  became pleased. Then we departed and the pursuers were following us.&#8221; Al-Bara added:  I then went with Abu Bakr into his home (carrying that saddle) and there I saw his  daughter &#8216;Aisha Lying in a bed because of heavy fever and I saw her father Abu Bakr  kissing her cheek and saying, &#8220;How are you, little daughter?&#8221; </font></p>

The season of Hajj is the season when there comes the scum of the  people (besides the good amongst them), so I recommend that you should wait till you go  back to Medina, for it is the place of Migration and Sunna (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s tradition),  and there you will be able to refer the matter to the religious scholars and the nobles  and the people of wise opinions.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I will speak of it in Medina on  my very first sermon I will deliver there.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Um al-&#8216;Ala: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An Ansari woman who gave the pledge of allegiance to the  Prophet that the Ansar drew lots concerning the dwelling of the Emigrants. &#8216;Uthman bin  Maz&#8217;un was decided to dwell with them (i.e. Um al-&#8216;Ala&#8217;s family), &#8216;Uthman fell ill and I  nursed him till he died, and we covered him with his clothes. Then the Prophet came to us  and I (addressing the dead body) said, &#8220;O Abu As-Sa&#8217;ib, may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be on you!  I bear witness that Allah has honored you.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;How do  you know that Allah has honored him?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I do not know. May my father  and my mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! But who else is worthy of it (if  not &#8216;Uthman)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;As to him, by Allah, death has overtaken him, and I  hope the best for him. By Allah, though I am the Apostle of Allah, yet I do not know what  Allah will do to me,&#8221; By Allah, I will never assert the piety of anyone after him.  That made me sad, and when I slept I saw in a dream a flowing stream for &#8216;Uthman bin  Maz&#8217;un. I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him of it. He remarked, &#8220;That symbolizes  his (good) deeds.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The day of Bu&#8217;ath was a day (i.e. battle) which Allah  caused to take place just before the mission of His Apostle so that when Allah&#8217;s Apostle  came to Medina, they (the tribes) had divided (into hostile groups) and their nobles had  been killed; and all that facilitated their conversion to Islam. </font></p>

Abu Bakr said twice. &#8220;Musical  instrument of Satan!&#8221; But the Prophet said, &#8220;Leave them Abu Bakr, for every  nation has an &#8216;Id (i.e. festival) and this day is our &#8216;Id.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived at Medina, he alighted at the  upper part of Medina among the people called Bani &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf and he stayed with them  for fourteen nights. Then he sent for the chiefs of Bani An-Najjar, and they came,  carrying their swords. As if I am just now looking at Allah&#8217;s Apostle on his she-camel  with Abu Bakr riding behind him (on the same camel) and the chiefs of Bani An-Najjar  around him till he dismounted in the courtyard of Abu Aiyub&#8217;s home. The Prophet used to  offer the prayer wherever the prayer was due, and he would pray even in sheepfolds. Then  he ordered that the mosque be built. He sent for the chiefs of Banu An-Najjar, and when  they came, he said, &#8220;O Banu An-Najjar! Suggest to me the price of this garden of  yours.&#8221; They replied &#8220;No! By Allah, we do not demand its price except from  Allah.&#8221; In that garden there were the (following) things that I will tell you: Graves  of pagans, unleveled land with holes and pits etc., and date-palm trees. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered that the graves of the pagans be dug up and, the unleveled land be leveled and the  date-palm trees be cut down. The trunks of the trees were arranged so as to form the wall  facing the Qibla. The Stone pillars were built at the sides of its gate. The companions of  the Prophet were carrying the stones and reciting some lyrics, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle . . was  with them and they were saying, &#8220;O Allah! There is no good Excel the good of the  Hereafter, so bestow victory on the Ansar and the Emigrants. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sad bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the year of Hajjat-ul-Wada&#8217; the Prophet visited me when  I fell ill and was about to die because of that illness. I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  I am very ill as you see, and I am a rich man and have no heir except my only daughter.  Shall I give 2/3 of my property in charity?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Shall I then give one half of it in charity?&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Sad! Give 1/3  (in charity) and even 1/3 is too much. No doubt, it is better to leave your children rich  than to leave them poor, reduced to begging from others. And Allah will reward you for  whatever you spend with the intention of gaining Allah&#8217;s Pleasure even if it were a  mouthful of food you put into your wives mouth.&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Am  I to be left behind (in Mecca) after my companions have gone?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you  should be left behind, you will be upgraded and elevated for every deed you will do with a  desire to achieve Allah&#8217;s Pleasure. I hope that you will live long so that some people  will benefit by you while others will be harmed. O Allah! Please fulfill the migration of  my companions and do not make them turn back on their heels. But (we feel sorry for) the  unlucky Sad bin Khaulah.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle lamented his death in Mecca. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 274: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Auf came to Medina and the Prophet  established the bond of brotherhood between him and Sad bin Ar-Rabi-al-Ansari, Saud  suggested that &#8216;Abdur-Rahman should accept half of his property and family. &#8216;Abdur Rahman  said, &#8220;May Allah bless you in your family and property; guide me to the market.&#8221;  So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (while doing business in the market) made some profit of some condensed  dry yoghurt and butter. After a few days the Prophet saw him wearing clothes stained with  yellow perfume. The Prophet asked, &#8220;What is this, O &#8216;Abdur-Rahman?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have married an Ansar&#8217; woman.&#8221; The Prophet asked,  &#8220;What have you given her as Mahr?&#8221; He (i.e. &#8216;Abdur-Rahman) said, &#8220;A piece  of gold, about the weight of a date stone.&#8221; Then the Prophet said, Give a banquet,  even though of a sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the news of the arrival of the Prophet at Medina  reached &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam, he went to him to ask him about certain things, He said,  &#8220;I am going to ask you about three things which only a Prophet can answer: What is  the first sign of The Hour? What is the first food which the people of Paradise will eat?  Why does a child attract the similarity to his father or to his mother?&#8221; The Prophet  replied, &#8220;Gabriel has just now informed me of that.&#8221; Ibn Salam said, &#8220;He  (i.e. Gabriel) is the enemy of the Jews amongst the angels. The Prophet said, &#8220;As for  the first sign of The Hour, it will be a fire that will collect the people from the East  to the West. As for the first meal which the people of Paradise will eat, it will be the  caudate (extra) lobe of the fish-liver. As for the child, if the man&#8217;s discharge proceeds  the woman&#8217;s discharge, the child attracts the similarity to the man, and if the woman&#8217;s  discharge proceeds the man&#8217;s, then the child attracts the similarity to the woman.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On this, &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam said, &#8220;I testify that  None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and that you are the Apostle of  Allah.&#8221; and added, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Jews invent such lies as make one  astonished, so please ask them about me before they know about my conversion to I slam .  &#8221; The Jews came, and the Prophet said, &#8220;What kind of man is &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam  among you?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;The best of us and the son of the best of us and the  most superior among us, and the son of the most superior among us. &#8220;The Prophet said,  &#8220;What would you think if &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam should embrace Islam?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;May Allah protect him from that.&#8221; The Prophet repeated his question and they  gave the same answer. Then &#8216;Abdullah came out to them and said, &#8220;I testify that None  has the right to be worshipped except Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of  Allah!&#8221; On this, the Jews said, &#8220;He is the most wicked among us and the son of  the most wicked among us.&#8221; So they degraded him. On this, he (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin  Salam) said, &#8220;It is this that I was afraid of, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>

By Allah, when I sold them in the market, nobody objected to it.&#8221; Then I  asked Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib (about it) he said, &#8220;We used to make such a transaction when  the Prophet came to Medina. So he said, &#8216;There is no harm in it if it is done from hand to  hand, but it is not allowed on credit.&#8217; Go to Zaid bin Al- Arqam and ask him about it for  he was the greatest trader of all of us.&#8221; So I asked Zaid bin Al-Arqam., and he said  the same (as Al-Bara) did.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet arrived at Medina he found that the Jews  observed fast on the day of &#8216;Ashura&#8217;. They were asked the reason for the fast. They  replied, &#8220;This is the day when Allah caused Moses and the children of Israel to have  victory over Pharaoh, so we fast on this day as a sign of glorifying it.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;We are closer to Moses than you.&#8221; Then he ordered that fasting on  this day should be observed. </font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 61:</p>
<h3 align="center">Virtues of the Qur&#8217;an</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="006.061.502"></a>Volume 6, Book 61, Number 502:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha and Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet remained in Mecca for ten years, during which the Qur&#8217;an used to be revealed to him; and he stayed in Medina for ten years.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 503:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu &#8216;Uthman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was informed that Gabriel came to the Prophet while Um Salama was with him. Gabriel started talking (to the Prophet). Then the Prophet asked Um Salama, &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;He is Dihya (al-Kalbi).&#8221; When Gabriel had left, Um Salama said, &#8220;By Allah, I did not take him for anybody other than him (i.e. Dihya) till I heard the sermon of the Prophet wherein he informed about the news of Gabriel.&#8221; The subnarrator asked Abu &#8216;Uthman: From whom have you heard that? Abu &#8216;Uthman said: From Usama bin Zaid.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 504:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Every Prophet was given miracles because of which people believed, but what I have been given, is Divine Inspiration which Allah has revealed to me. So I hope that my followers will outnumber the followers of the other Prophets on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 505:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah sent down His Divine Inspiration to His Apostle continuously and abundantly during the period preceding his death till He took him unto Him. That was the period of the greatest part of revelation; and Allah&#8217;s Apostle died after that.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 506:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundub:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet fell ill and did not offer the night prayer (Tahajjud prayer) for a night or two. A woman (the wife of Abu Lahab) came to him and said, &#8220;O Muhammad ! I do not see but that your Satan has left you.&#8221; Then Allah revealed (Surat-Ad-Duha):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;By the fore-noon, and by the night when it darkens (or is still); Your Lord has not forsaken you, nor hated you.&#8217; (93)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 507:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The Caliph &#8216;Uthman ordered Zaid bin Thabit, Said bin Al-As, &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Harith bin Hisham to write the Quran in the form of a book (Mushafs) and said to them. &#8220;In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit (Al-Ansari) regarding any dialectic Arabic utterance of the Quran, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, for the Quran was revealed in this dialect.&#8221; So they did it.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 508:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin Ya&#8217;la bin Umaiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ya&#8217;la used to say, &#8220;I wish I could see Allah&#8217;s Apostle at the time he is being inspired Divinely.&#8221; When the Prophet was at Al-Ja&#8217;rana and was shaded by a garment hanging over him and some of his companions were with him, a man perfumed with scent came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is your opinion regarding a man who assumes Ihram and puts on a cloak after perfuming his body with scent?&#8221; The Prophet waited for a while, and then the Divine Inspiration descended upon him. &#8216;Umar pointed out to Ya&#8217;la, telling him to come. Ya&#8217;la came and pushed his head (underneath the screen which was covering the Prophet ) and behold! The Prophet&#8217;s face was red and he kept on breathing heavily for a while and then he was relieved. Thereupon he said, &#8220;Where is the questioner who asked me about &#8216;Umra a while ago?&#8221; The man was sought and then was brought before the Prophet who said (to him), &#8220;As regards the scent which you perfumed your body with, you must wash it off thrice, and as for your cloak, you must take it off; and then perform in your &#8216;Umra all those things which you perform in Hajj.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 509:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr As-Siddiq sent for me when the people! of Yamama had been killed (i.e., a number of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions who fought against Musailama). (I went to him) and found &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab sitting with him. Abu Bakr then said (to me), &#8220;Umar has come to me and said: &#8220;Casualties were heavy among the Qurra&#8217; of the! Qur&#8217;an (i.e. those who knew the Quran by heart) on the day of the Battle of Yalmama, and I am afraid that more heavy casualties may take place among the Qurra&#8217; on other battlefields, whereby a large part of the Qur&#8217;an may be lost. Therefore I suggest, you (Abu Bakr) order that the Qur&#8217;an be collected.&#8221; I said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;How can you do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not do?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;By Allah, that is a good project. &#8220;Umar kept on urging me to accept his proposal till Allah opened my chest for it and I began to realize the good in the idea which &#8216;Umar had realized.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr said (to me). &#8216;You are a wise young man and we do not have any suspicion about you, and you used to write the Divine Inspiration for Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So you should search for (the fragmentary scripts of) the Qur&#8217;an and collect it in one book).&#8221; By Allah If they had ordered me to shift one of the mountains, it would not have been heavier for me than this ordering me to collect the Qur&#8217;an. Then I said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;How will you do something which Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not do?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;By Allah, it is a good project.&#8221; Abu Bakr kept on urging me to accept his idea until Allah opened my chest for what He had opened the chests of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar. So I started looking for the Qur&#8217;an and collecting it from (what was written on) palmed stalks, thin white stones and also from the men who knew it by heart, till I found the last Verse of Surat At-Tauba (Repentance) with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari, and I did not find it with anybody other than him. The Verse is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty..(till the end of Surat-Baraa&#8217; (At-Tauba) (9.128-129) Then the complete manuscripts (copy) of the Qur&#8217;an remained with Abu Bakr till he died, then with &#8216;Umar till the end of his life, and then with Hafsa, the daughter of &#8216;Umar.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 510:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman came to Uthman at the time when the people of Sham and the people of Iraq were Waging war to conquer Arminya and Adharbijan. Hudhaifa was afraid of their (the people of Sham and Iraq) differences in the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an, so he said to &#8216;Uthman, &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Save this nation before they differ about the Book (Quran) as Jews and the Christians did before.&#8221; So &#8216;Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, &#8220;Send us the manuscripts of the Qur&#8217;an so that we may compile the Qur&#8217;anic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you.&#8221; Hafsa sent it to &#8216;Uthman. &#8216;Uthman then ordered Zaid bin Thabit, &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair, Said bin Al-As and &#8216;AbdurRahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. &#8216;Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, &#8220;In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Qur&#8217;an, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Qur&#8217;an was revealed in their tongue.&#8221; They did so, and when they had written many copies, &#8216;Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. &#8216;Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Qur&#8217;anic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or whole copies, be burnt. Said bin Thabit added, &#8220;A Verse from Surat Ahzab was missed by me when we copied the Qur&#8217;an and I used to hear Allah&#8217;s Apostle reciting it. So we searched for it and found it with Khuzaima bin Thabit Al-Ansari. (That Verse was): &#8216;Among the Believers are men who have been true in their covenant with Allah.&#8217; (33.23)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 511:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr sent for me and said, &#8220;You used to write the Divine Revelations for Allah&#8217;s Apostle : So you should search for (the Qur&#8217;an and collect) it.&#8221; I started searching for the Qur&#8217;an till I found the last two Verses of Surat At-Tauba with Abi Khuzaima Al-Ansari and I could not find these Verses with anybody other than him. (They were):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Verily there has come unto you an Apostle (Muhammad) from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty &#8230;&#8217; (9.128-129)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 512:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was revealed: &#8216;Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) and those who strive and fight in the Cause of Allah.&#8217; (4.95)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Call Zaid for me and let him bring the board, the inkpot and the scapula bone (or the scapula bone and the ink pot).&#8221;&#8216; Then he said, &#8220;Write: &#8216;Not equal are those Believers who sit..&#8221;, and at that time &#8216;Amr bin Um Maktum, the blind man was sitting behind the Prophet . He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is your order For me (as regards the above Verse) as I am a blind man?&#8221; So, instead of the above Verse, the following Verse was revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Not equal are those believers who sit (at home) except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame etc.) and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah.&#8217; (4.95)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 513:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Gabriel recited the Qur&#8217;an to me in one way. Then I requested him (to read it in another way), and continued asking him to recite it in other ways, and he recited it in several ways till he ultimately recited it in seven different ways.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 514:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Hisham bin Hakim reciting Surat Al-Furqan during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I listened to his recitation and noticed that he recited in several different ways which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not taught me. I was about to jump over him during his prayer, but I controlled my temper, and when he had completed his prayer, I put his upper garment around his neck and seized him by it and said, &#8220;Who taught you this Sura which I heard you reciting?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle taught it to me.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You have told a lie, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle has taught it to me in a different way from yours.&#8221; So I dragged him to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said (to Allah&#8217;s Apostle),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I heard this person reciting Surat Al-Furqan in a way which you haven&#8217;t taught me!&#8221; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Release him, (O &#8216;Umar!) Recite, O Hisham!&#8221; Then he recited in the same way as I heard him reciting. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;It was revealed in this way,&#8221; and added, &#8220;Recite, O &#8216;Umar!&#8221; I recited it as he had taught me. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;It was revealed in this way. This Qur&#8217;an has been revealed to be recited in seven different ways, so recite of it whichever (way) is easier for you (or read as much of it as may be easy for you).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 515:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Yusuf bin Mahk:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was with Aisha, the mother of the Believers, a person from Iraq came and asked, &#8220;What type of shroud is the best?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to you! What does it matter?&#8221; He said, &#8220;O mother of the Believers! Show me (the copy of) your Qur&#8217;an,&#8221; She said, &#8220;Why?&#8221; He said, &#8220;In order to compile and arrange the Qur&#8217;an according to it, for people recite it with its Suras not in proper order.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;What does it matter which part of it you read first? (Be informed) that the first thing that was revealed thereof was a Sura from Al-Mufassal, and in it was mentioned Paradise and the Fire. When the people embraced Islam, the Verses regarding legal and illegal things were revealed. If the first thing to be revealed was: &#8216;Do not drink alcoholic drinks.&#8217; people would have said, &#8216;We will never leave alcoholic drinks,&#8217; and if there had been revealed, &#8216;Do not commit illegal sexual intercourse, &#8216;they would have said, &#8216;We will never give up illegal sexual intercourse.&#8217; While I was a young girl of playing age, the following Verse was revealed in Mecca to Muhammad: &#8216;Nay! But the Hour is their appointed time (for their full recompense), and the Hour will be more grievous and more bitter.&#8217; (54.46) Sura Al-Baqara (The Cow) and Surat An-Nisa (The Women) were revealed while I was with him.&#8221; Then &#8216;Aisha took out the copy of the Qur&#8217;an for the man and dictated to him the Verses of the Suras (in their proper order) .</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 516:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surat Bani-lsrael, Al-Kahf (The Cave), Maryam, Taha, Al-Anbiya&#8217; (The prophets) are amongst my first earnings and my old property, and (in fact) they are my old property.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 517:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I learnt, &#8216;Glorify the Name of your Lord the Most High&#8217; (Surat al-A&#8217;la) No 87, before the Prophet came (to Medina) .</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 6, Book 61, Number 518:</p>

So Allah revealed the Verse which occurs in the Surah starting with &#8220;I do swear by the Day of Resurrection.&#8217; (75.1) i.e. &#8216;Move not your tongue concerning (the Qur&#8217;an) to make haste then with. It is for Us to collect it (in your mind) (O Muhammad) an give you the ability to recite it &#8216;by heart.&#8217; (75.16-17) which means: It is for us to collect it (in your mind) and give you the ability to recite it by heart. And when We have recited it to you (O Muhammad) through Gabriel then follow you its recital. (75.18) means: &#8216;When We reveal it (the Qur&#8217;an) to you, Listen to it.&#8217; for then: It is for Us to explain it and make it clear to you&#8217; (75.19) i.e. It is up to Us to explain it through your tongue. So, when Gabriel came to him, Allah&#8217;s Apostle would listen to him attentively, and as soon as Gabriel left, he would recite the Revelations, as Allah had promised him.</p>

He never comes to my bed, nor has he approached me since he married me.&#8221; When this state continued for a long period, my father told the story to the Prophet who said to my father, &#8220;Let me meet him.&#8221; Then I met him and he asked me, &#8220;How do you fast?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I fast daily,&#8221; He asked, &#8220;How long does it take you to finish the recitation of the whole Quran?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I finish it every night.&#8221; On that he said, &#8220;Fast for three days every month and recite the Qur&#8217;an (and finish it) in one month.&#8221; I said, &#8220;But I have power to do more than that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then fast for three days per week.&#8221; I said, &#8220;i have the power to do more than that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Therefore, fast the most superior type of fasting, (that is, the fasting of (prophet) David who used to fast every alternate day; and finish the recitation of the whole Qur&#8217;an In seven days.&#8221; I wish I had accepted the permission of Allah&#8217;s Apostle as I have become a weak old man. It is said that &#8216;Abdullah used to recite one-seventh of the Qur&#8217;an during the day-time to some of his family members, for he used to check his memorization of what he would recite at night during the daytime so that it would be easier for him to read at night. And whenever he wanted to gain some strength, he used to give up fasting for some days and count those days to fast for a similar period, for he disliked to leave those things which he used to do during the lifetime of the Prophet.</p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Beginning of Creation </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.054.413">Volume 4, Book 54, Number 413: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Imran bin Husain: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some people of Bani Tamim came to the Prophet and he said  (to them), &#8220;O Bani Tamim! rejoice with glad tidings.&#8221; They said, &#8220;You have  given us glad tidings, now give us something.&#8221; On hearing that the color of his face  changed then the people of Yemen came to him and he said, &#8220;O people of Yemen ! Accept  the good tidings, as Bani Tamim has refused them.&#8221; The Yemenites said, &#8220;We  accept them. Then the Prophet started taking about the beginning of creation and about  Allah&#8217;s Throne. In the mean time a man came saying, &#8220;O &#8216;Imran! Your she-camel has run  away!&#8221; (I got up and went away), but l wish I had not left that place (for I missed what  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had said). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 414: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Imran bin Husain: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went to the Prophet and tied my she-camel at the gate.  The people of Bani Tamim came to the Prophet who said &#8220;O Bani Tamim! Accept the good  tidings.&#8221; They said twice, &#8216;You have given us the good tidings, now give us  something&#8221; Then some Yemenites came to him and he said, &#8220;Accept the good  tidings, O people of Yemem, for Bani Tamim refused them.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We accept  it, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We have come to ask you about this matter (i.e. the start of  creations).&#8221; He said, &#8220;First of all, there was nothing but Allah, and (then He  created His Throne). His throne was over the water, and He wrote everything in the Book  (in the Heaven) and created the Heavens and the Earth.&#8221; Then a man shouted, &#8220;O  Ibn Husain! Your she-camel has gone away!&#8221; So, I went away and could not see the  she-camel because of the mirage. By Allah, I wished I had left that she-camel (but not  that gathering). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar: One day the Prophet stood up amongst us for  a long period and informed us about the beginning of creation (and talked about everything  in detail) till he mentioned how the people of Paradise will enter their places and the  people of Hell will enter their places. Some remembered what he had said, and some forgot  it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah the Most Superior said,  &#8220;The son of Adam slights Me, and he should not slight Me, and he disbelieves in Me,  and he ought not to do so. As for his slighting Me, it is that he says that I have a son;  and his disbelief in Me is his statement that I shall not recreate him as I have created  (him) before.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When Allah completed the  creation, He wrote in His Book which is with Him on His Throne, &#8220;My Mercy overpowers  My Anger.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Al-Harith: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>from Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman who had a dispute with  some people on a piece of land, and so he went to &#8216;Aisha and told her about it. She said,  &#8220;O Abu Salama, avoid the land, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Any person who takes even a  span of land unjustly, his neck shall be encircled with it down seven earths.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Bakra: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said. &#8220;(The division of time has turned to  its original form which was current when Allah created the Heavens and the Earths. The  year is of twelve months, out of which four months are sacred: Three are in succession  Dhul-Qa&#8217; da, Dhul-Hijja and Muharram, and (the fourth is) Rajab of (the tribe of) Mudar  which comes between Jumadi-ath-Thaniyah and Sha ban.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 420: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Zaid bin Amr bin Nufail: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Arwa sued him before Marwan for a right, which she  claimed, he had deprived her of. On that Said said, &#8220;How should I deprive her of her  right? I testify that I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;If anyone takes a span of land  unjustly, his neck will be encircled with it down seven earths on the Day of  Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Dhar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet asked me at sunset, &#8220;Do you know where the  sun goes (at the time of sunset)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know  better.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It goes (i.e. travels) till it prostrates Itself underneath  the Throne and takes the permission to rise again, and it is permitted and then (a time  will come when) it will be about to prostrate itself but its prostration will not be  accepted, and it will ask permission to go on its course but it will not be permitted, but  it will be ordered to return whence it has come and so it will rise in the west. And that  is the interpretation of the Statement of Allah: &#8220;And the sun Runs its fixed course  For a term (decreed). that is The Decree of (Allah) The Exalted in Might, The  All-Knowing.&#8221; (36.38) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse  because of someone&#8217;s death or wife (i.e. birth), but they are two signs amongst the Signs  of Allah. So, if you see them (i.e. eclipse) offer the Prayer (of eclipse).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs  amongst the Signs of Allah. They do not eclipse because of someone&#8217;s death or life. So, if  you see them (i.e. eclipse), celebrate the Praises of Allah (i.e. pray).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 425: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day of a solar eclipse, Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up (to  offer the eclipse prayer). He recited Takbir, recited a long recitation (of Holy Verses),  bowed a long bowing, and then he raised h is head saying. &#8220;Allah hears him who sends  his praises to Him.&#8221; Then he stayed standing, recited a long recitation again, but  shorter than the former, bowed a long bowing, but shorter than the first, performed a long  prostration and then performed the second Rak&#8217;a in the same way as he had done the first.  By the time he had finished his prayer with Taslim, the solar eclipse had been over. Then  he addressed the people referring to the solar and lunar eclipses saying, &#8220;These are  two signs amongst the Signs of Allah, and they do not eclipse because of anyone&#8217;s death or  life. So, if you see them, hasten for the Prayer.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 426: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Mas&#8217;ud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;the sun and the moon do not eclipse  because of the death or life of someone, but they are two signs amongst the Signs of  Allah. So, if you see them, offer the Prayer (of eclipse).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I have been made victorious with  the Saba (i.e. easterly wind) and the people of &#8216;Ad were destroyed with the Dabur (i.e.  westerly wind) .&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ata: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Aisha said If the Prophet saw a cloud In the sky, he would  walk to and fro in agitation, go out and come in, and the color of his face would change,  and if it rained, he would feel relaxed.&#8221; So &#8216;Aisha knew that state of his. So the  Prophet said, I don&#8217;t know (am afraid), it may be similar to what happened to some people  referred to in the Holy Quran in the following Verse: &#8212; &#8220;Then when they saw it as a  dense cloud coming towards their valleys, they said, &#8216;This is a cloud bringing us rain!&#8217;  Nay, but, it is that (torment) which you were asking to be hastened a wind wherein is  severe torment.&#8221; (46.24) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 429: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Malik bin Sasaa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;While I was at the House in a state  midway between sleep and wakefulness, (an angel recognized me) as the man lying between  two men. A golden tray full of wisdom and belief was brought to me and my body was cut  open from the throat to the lower part of the abdomen and then my abdomen was washed with  Zam-zam water and (my heart was) filled with wisdom and belief. Al-Buraq, a white animal,  smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me and I set out with Gabriel.  When I reached the nearest heaven. Gabriel said to the heaven gate-keeper, &#8216;Open the  gate.&#8217; The gatekeeper asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; The gate-keeper,&#8217; Who is  accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel said, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; The gate-keeper said, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217;  Gabriel said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&#8217;  Then I met Adam and greeted him and he said, &#8216;You are welcomed O son and a Prophet.&#8217; Then  we ascended to the second heaven. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel said, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It  was said, &#8216;Who is with you?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Muhammad&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been sent for?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; It was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&#8221; Then I met  Jesus and Yahya (John) who said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O brother and a Prophet.&#8217; Then we  ascended to the third heaven. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel said, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was  asked, &#8216;Who is with you? Gabriel said, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been sent for?&#8217;  &#8216;Yes,&#8217; said Gabriel. &#8216;He is welcomed. What a wonderful visit his is!&#8217; (The Prophet  added:). There I met Joseph and greeted him, and he replied, &#8216;You are welcomed, O brother  and a Prophet!&#8217; Then we ascended to the 4th heaven and again the same questions and  answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I met Idris and greeted him. He  said, &#8216;You are welcomed O brother and Prophet.&#8217; Then we ascended to the 5th heaven and  again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in previous heavens. there I met  and greeted Aaron who said, &#8216;You are welcomed O brother and a Prophet&#8221;. Then we  ascended to the 6th heaven and again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in  the previous heavens. There I met and greeted Moses who said, &#8216;You are welcomed O brother  and. a Prophet.&#8217; When I proceeded on, he started weeping and on being asked why he was  weeping, he said, &#8216;O Lord! Followers of this youth who was sent after me will enter  Paradise in greater number than my followers.&#8217; Then we ascended to the seventh heaven and  again the same questions and answers were exchanged as in the previous heavens. There I  met and greeted Abraham who said, &#8216;You are welcomed o son and a Prophet.&#8217; Then I was shown  Al-Bait-al-Ma&#8217;mur (i.e. Allah&#8217;s House). I asked Gabriel about it and he said, This is Al  Bait-ul-Ma&#8217;mur where 70,000 angels perform prayers daily and when they leave they never  return to it (but always a fresh batch comes into it daily).&#8217; Then I was shown  Sidrat-ul-Muntaha (i.e. a tree in the seventh heaven) and I saw its Nabk fruits which  resembled the clay jugs of Hajr (i.e. a town in Arabia), and its leaves were like the ears  of elephants, and four rivers originated at its root, two of them were apparent and two  were hidden. I asked Gabriel about those rivers and he said, &#8216;The two hidden rivers are in  Paradise, and the apparent ones are the Nile and the Euphrates.&#8217; Then fifty prayers were  enjoined on me. I descended till I met Moses who asked me, &#8216;What have you done?&#8217; I said,  &#8216;Fifty prayers have been enjoined on me.&#8217; He said, &#8216;I know the people better than you,  because I had the hardest experience to bring Bani Israel to obedience. Your followers  cannot put up with such obligation. So, return to your Lord and request Him (to reduce the  number of prayers.&#8217; I returned and requested Allah (for reduction) and He made it forty. I  returned and (met Moses) and had a similar discussion, and then returned again to Allah  for reduction and He made it thirty, then twenty, then ten, and then I came to Moses who  repeated the same advice. Ultimately Allah reduced it to five. When I came to Moses again,  he said, &#8216;What have you done?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Allah has made it five only.&#8217; He repeated the same  advice but I said that I surrendered (to Allah&#8217;s Final Order)'&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  addressed by Allah, &#8220;I have decreed My Obligation and have reduced the burden on My  slaves, and I shall reward a single good deed as if it were ten good deeds.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the true and truly inspired said,  &#8220;(The matter of the Creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the  mother in forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period, and  then a piece of flesh for a similar period. Then Allah sends an angel who is ordered to  write four things. He is ordered to write down his (i.e. the new creature&#8217;s) deeds, his  livelihood, his (date of) death, and whether he will be blessed or wretched (in religion).  Then the soul is breathed into him. So, a man amongst you may do (good deeds till there is  only a cubit between him and Paradise and then what has been written for him decides his  behavior and he starts doing (evil) deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire.  And similarly a man amongst you may do (evil) deeds till there is only a cubit between him  and the (Hell) Fire, and then what has been written for him decides his behavior, and he  starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

(with a blanket), cover me!&#8217; Then Allah sent the Revelation:  &#8220;O, You wrapped up (In a blanket)! (Arise and warn!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Muhammad bin Sirin: Abu Huraira said,  &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle put me in charge of the Zakat of Ramadan (i.e. Zakat-ul-Fitr).  Someone came to me and started scooping some of the foodstuff of (Zakat) with both hands.  I caught him and told him that I would take him to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Then Abu Huraira  told the whole narration and added &#8220;He (i.e. the thief) said, &#8216;Whenever you go to  your bed, recite the Verse of &#8220;Al-Kursi&#8221; (2.255) for then a guardian from Allah  will be guarding you, and Satan will not approach you till dawn.&#8217; &#8221; On that the  Prophet said, &#8220;He told you the truth, though he is a liar, and he (the thief) himself  was the Satan.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Cover your utensils and tie your  water skins, and close your doors and keep your children close to you at night, as the  Jinns spread out at such time and snatch things away. When you go to bed, put out your  lights, for the mischief-doer (i.e. the rat) may drag away the wick of the candle and burn  the dwellers of the house.&#8221; Ata said, &#8220;The devils.&#8221; (instead of the Jinns).  </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said,&#8221; It has  been saved from your evil and you have been saved from its evil.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.062.001">Volume 7, Book 62, Number 1: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A group of three men came to the houses of the wives of the  Prophet asking how the Prophet worshipped (Allah), and when they were informed about that,  they considered their worship insufficient and said, &#8220;Where are we from the Prophet  as his past and future sins have been forgiven.&#8221; Then one of them said, &#8220;I will  offer the prayer throughout the night forever.&#8221; The other said, &#8220;I will fast  throughout the year and will not break my fast.&#8221; The third said, &#8220;I will keep  away from the women and will not marry forever.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to them and  said, &#8220;Are you the same people who said so-and-so? By Allah, I am more submissive to  Allah and more afraid of Him than you; yet I fast and break my fast, I do sleep and I also  marry women. So he who does not follow my tradition in religion, is not from me (not one  of my followers).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 2: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ursa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he asked &#8216;Aisha about the Statement of Allah: &#8216;If you  fear that you shall not be able to deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry (other)  women of your choice, two or three or four; but if you fear that you shall not be able to  deal justly (with them), then only one, or (the captives) that your right hands possess.  That will be nearer to prevent you from doing injustice.&#8217; (4.3) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O my  nephew! (This Verse has been revealed in connection with) an orphan girl under the  guardianship of her guardian who is attracted by her wealth and beauty and intends to  marry her with a Mahr less than what other women of her standard deserve. So they (such  guardians) have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice to them and give them  their full Mahr, and they are ordered to marry other women instead of them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 3: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Alqama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was with Abdullah, &#8216;Uthman met him at Mina and  said, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman ! I have something to say to you.&#8221; So both of them  went aside and &#8216;Uthman said, &#8220;O Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rah. man! Shall we marry you to a virgin  who will make you remember your past days?&#8221; When &#8216;Abdullah felt that he was not in  need of that, he beckoned me (to join him) saying, &#8220;O &#8216;Alqama!&#8221; Then I heard him  saying (in reply to &#8216;Uthman), &#8220;As you have said that, (I tell you that) the Prophet  once said to us, &#8216;O young people! Whoever among you is able to marry, should marry, and  whoever is not able to marry, is recommended to fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual  power. </font></p>

Whoever among you can  marry, should marry, because it helps him lower his gaze and guard his modesty (i.e. his  private parts from committing illegal sexual intercourse etc.), and whoever is not able to  marry, should fast, as fasting diminishes his sexual power.&#8221; </font></p>

Kindly show  me the market.&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman went to the market and gained (in bargains) some  dried yoghurt and some butter.

The Muslims wondered, &#8220;Is she (Saffiyya)  considered as his wife or his slave girl?&#8221; Then they said, &#8220;If he orders her to  veil herself, she will be one of the mothers of the Believers; but if he does not order  her to veil herself, she will be a slave girl.

If you are not in need of her, then  marry her to me.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Have you got anything to offer?&#8221; The  man said, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Go  to your family and see if you have something.&#8221; The man went and returned, saying,  &#8220;No, by Allah, I have not found anything.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(Go  again) and look for something, even if it is an iron ring.&#8221; He went again and  returned, saying, &#8220;No, by Allah, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I could not find even an iron  ring, but this is my Izar (waist sheet).&#8221; He had no rida.

This Verse refers to the orphan girl who is under the guardianship of her guardian who  likes her beauty and wealth and wishes to (marry her and) curtails her Mahr. Such  guardians have been forbidden to marry them unless they do justice by giving them their  full Mahr, and they have been ordered to marry other than them. The people asked for the  verdict of Allah&#8217;s Apostle after that, so Allah revealed: &#8216;They ask your instruction  concerning the women . . . whom you desire to marry.&#8217; (4.127) So Allah revealed to them  that if the orphan girl had beauty and wealth, they desired to marry her and for her  family status. They can only marry them if they give them their full Mahr. And if they had  no desire to marry them because of their lack of wealth and beauty, they would leave them  and marry other women. So, as they used to leave them, when they had no interest, in them,  they were forbidden to marry them when they had such interest, unless they treated them  justly and gave them their full Mahr Apostle said, &#8216;If at all there is evil omen, it is in  the horse, the woman and the house.&#8221; a lady is to be warded off. And the Statement of  Allah: &#8216;Truly, among your wives and your children, there are enemies for you (i.e may stop  you from the obedience of Allah)&#8217; (64.14) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Three principles were established because of Barira: (i)  When Banra was manumitted she was given the option (to remain with her slave husband or  not). (ii) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said &#8220;The Wala of the slave) is for the one who manumits  (the slave). (iii) When Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered (the house), he saw a cooking pot on the  fire but he was given bread and meat soup from the soup of the home. The Prophet said,  &#8220;Didn&#8217;t I see the cooking pot (on the fire)?&#8221; It was said, &#8220;That is the  meat given in charity to Barira, and you do not eat the (things given in) charity.&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;It is an object of charity for Barira, and it is a present for  us.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(regarding) the Verse: &#8216;And if you fear that you shall not  be able to deal justly with the orphans&#8230;&#8217; (4.3) It is about the orphan girl who is in  the custody of a man who is her guardian, and he intends to marry her because of her  wealth, but he treats her badly and does not manage her property fairly and honestly. Such  a man should marry women of his liking other than her, two or three or four. &#8216;Prohibited  to you (for marriage) are: &#8230;your foster-mothers (who suckled you).&#8217; (4.23) Marriage is  prohibited between persons having a foster suckling relationship corresponding to a blood  relationship which renders marriage unlawful. </font></p>

I became more angry with him than with &#8216;Uthman. I waited for  a few days and then Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked for her hand, and I gave her in marriage to him.

Even if I have not married Um Salama, she would  not be lawful for me to marry, for her father is my foster brother.&#8221; &#8216;And there is no  blame on you if you make hint of betrothal or conceal it in your hearts. Allah is  Oft-Forgiving, Most Forbearing.&#8217; (2.235) Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Hint your intention of  marrying&#8217; is made by saying (to the widow) for example: &#8220;I want to marry, and I wish  that Allah will make a righteous lady available for me.&#8217; &#8221; Al-Qasim said: One may say  to the widow: &#8216;I hold all respect for you, and I am interested in you; Allah will bring  you much good, or something similar &#8216;Ata said: One should hint his intention, and should  not declare it openly. One may say: &#8216;I have some need. Have good tidings. Praise be to  Allah; you are fit to remarry.&#8217; She (the widow) may say in reply: I am listening to what  you say,&#8217; but she should not make a promise. Her guardian should not make a promise (to  somebody to get her married to him) without her knowledge. But if, while still in the  Iddat period, she makes a promise to marry somebody, and he ultimately marries her, they  are not to be separated by divorce (i.e., the marriage is valid). </font></p>

Now  you come to ask for her hand again? No, by Allah, she will never go back to you (again)!&#8217;  That man was not a bad man and his wife wanted to go back to him.

It was about the female orphan under the protection of her  guardian who was interested in her beauty and wealth and wanted to marry her with a little  or reduced Mahr. So such guardians were forbidden to marry female orphans unless they deal  with them justly and give their full Mahr; and they were ordered to marry women other than  them.&#8221;&#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;(Later) the people asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, for instructions,  and then Allah revealed: &#8216;They ask your instruction concerning the women . . . And yet  whom you desire to marry.&#8217; (4.127) So Allah revealed to them in this Verse that-if a  female orphan had wealth and beauty, they desired to marry her and were interested in her  noble descent and the reduction of her Mahr; but if she was not desired by them because of  her lack in fortune and beauty they left her and married some other woman. So, as they  used to leave her when they had no interest in her, they had no right to marry her if they  had the desire to do so, unless they deal justly with her and gave her a full amount of  Mahr.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet stayed for three days at a place between  Khaibar and Medina, and there he consummated his marriage with Safiyya bint Huyay. I  invited the Muslims to a banquet which included neither meat nor bread. The Prophet  ordered for the leather dining sheets to be spread, and then dates, dried yogurt and  butter were provided over it, and that was the Walima (banquet) of the Prophet. The  Muslims asked whether Safiyya would be considered as his wife or as a slave girl of what  his right hands possessed. Then they said, &#8220;If the Prophet screens her from the  people, then she Is the Prophet&#8217;s wife but if he does not screen her, then she is a slave  girl.&#8221; So when the Prophet proceeded, he made a place for her (on the camel) behind  him and screened her from people. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Whenever the Prophet passed by (my mother Um-Sulaim)  he used to enter her and greet her. Anas further said: Once the Prophet way a bridegroom  during his marriage with Zainab, Um Sulaim said to me, &#8220;Let us give a gift to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle .&#8221; I said to her, &#8220;Do it.&#8221; So she prepared Haisa (a sweet dish)  made from dates, butter and dried yoghurt and she sent it with me to him. I took it to him  and he said, &#8220;Put it down,&#8221; and ordered me to call some men whom he named, and  to invite whomever I would meet. I did what he ordered me to do, and when I returned, I  found the house crowded with people and saw the Prophet keeping his hand over the Haisa  and saying over it whatever Allah wished (him to say). Then he called the men in batches  of ten to eat of it, and he said to them, &#8220;Mention the Name of Allah, and each man  should eat of the dish the nearest to him.&#8221; When all of them had finished their  meals, some of them left and a few remained there talking, over which I felt unhappy. Then  the Prophet went out towards the dwelling places (of his wives) and I too, went out after  him and told him that those people had left. Then he returned and entered his dwelling  place and let the curtains fall while I was in (his) dwelling place, and he was reciting  the Verses:&#8211; &#8216;O you who believe! Enter not the Prophet&#8217;s house until leave is given you  for a meal, (and then) not (as early as) to what for its preparation. But when you are  invited, enter, and when you have taken your meals, disperse without sitting for a talk.  Verily such (behavior) annoys the Prophet; and he would be shy of (asking) you (to go),  but Allah is not shy of (telling you) the Truth.&#8217; (33-53) Abu Uthman said: Anas said,  &#8220;I served the Prophet for ten years.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was ten years old when Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived at Medina.  My mother and aunts used to urge me to serve the Prophet regularly, and I served him for  ten years. When the Prophet died I was twenty years old, and I knew about the order of  Al-Hijab (veiling of ladies) more than any other person when it was revealed. It was  revealed for the first time when Allah&#8217;s Apostle had consummated his marriage with Zainab  bint Jahsh. When the day dawned, the Prophet was a bridegroom and he invited the people to  a banquet, so they came, ate, and then all left except a few who remained with the Prophet  for a long time. The Prophet got up and went out, and I too went out with him so that  those people might leave too. The Prophet proceeded and so did I, till he came to the  threshold of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling place. Then thinking that these people have left by then,  he returned and so did I along with him till he entered upon Zainab and behold, they were  still sitting and had not gone. So the Prophet again went away and I went away along with  him. When we reached the threshold of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s dwelling place, he thought that they had  left, and so he returned and I too, returned along with him and found those people had  left. Then the Prophet drew a curtain between me and him, and the Verses of Al-Hijab were  revealed. </font></p>

Sad said to &#8216;Abdur-Rahman,  &#8220;I will divide and share my property with you and will give one of my two wives to  you.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;May Allah bless you, your wives and property (I am  not in need of that; but kindly show me the way to the market).&#8221; So &#8216;Abdur-Rahman  went to the market and traded there gaining a profit of some dried yoghurt and butter, and  married (an Ansari woman).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Eleven women sat (at a place) and promised and contracted  that they would not conceal anything of the news of their husbands. The first one said,  &#8220;My husband is like the meat of a lean weak camel which is kept on the top of a  mountain which is neither easy to climb, nor is the meat fat, so that one might put up  with the trouble of fetching it.&#8221; The second one said, &#8220;I shall not relate my  husband&#8217;s news, for I fear that I may not be able to finish his story, for if I describe  him, I will mention all his defects and bad traits.&#8221; The third one said, &#8220;My  husband is a tall man; if I describe him (and he hears of that) he will divorce me, and if  I keep quiet, he will neither divorce me nor treat me as a wife.&#8221; The fourth one  said, &#8220;My husband is a moderate person like the night of Tihama which is neither hot  nor cold. I am neither afraid of him, nor am I discontented with him.&#8221; The fifth one  said, &#8220;My husband, when entering (the house) is a leopard, and when going out, is a  lion. He does not ask about whatever is in the house.&#8221; The sixth one said, &#8220;If  my husband eats. he eats too much (leaving the dishes empty), and if he drinks he leaves  nothing, and if he sleeps he sleeps alone (away from me) covered in garments and does not  stretch his hands here and there so as to know how I fare (get along).&#8221; The seventh  one said, &#8220;My husband is a wrong-doer or weak and foolish. All the defects are  present in him. He may injure your head or your body or may do both.&#8221; The eighth one  said, &#8220;My husband is soft to touch like a rabbit and smells like a Zarnab (a kind of  good smelling grass).&#8221; The ninth one said, &#8220;My husband is a tall generous man  wearing a long strap for carrying his sword. His ashes are abundant and his house is near  to the people who would easily consult him.&#8221; The tenth one said, &#8220;My husband is  Malik, and what is Malik? Malik is greater than whatever I say about him. (He is beyond  and above all praises which can come to my mind). Most of his camels are kept at home  (ready to be slaughtered for the guests) and only a few are taken to the pastures. When  the camels hear the sound of the lute (or the tambourine) they realize that they are going  to be slaughtered for the guests.&#8221; The eleventh one said, &#8220;My husband is Abu Zar  and what is Abu Zar (i.e., what should I say about him)? He has given me many ornaments  and my ears are heavily loaded with them and my arms have become fat (i.e., I have become  fat). And he has pleased me, and I have become so happy that I feel proud of myself. He  found me with my family who were mere owners of sheep and living in poverty, and brought  me to a respected family having horses and camels and threshing and purifying grain .  Whatever I say, he does not rebuke or insult me. When I sleep, I sleep till late in the  morning, and when I drink water (or milk), I drink my fill. The mother of Abu Zar and what  may one say in praise of the mother of Abu Zar? Her saddle bags were always full of  provision and her house was spacious. As for the son of Abu Zar, what may one say of the  son of Abu Zar? His bed is as narrow as an unsheathed sword and an arm of a kid (of four  months) satisfies his hunger. As for the daughter of Abu Zar, she is obedient to her  father and to her mother. She has a fat well-built body and that arouses the jealousy of  her husband&#8217;s other wife. As for the (maid) slave girl of Abu Zar, what may one say of the  (maid) slavegirl of Abu Zar? She does not uncover our secrets but keeps them, and does not  waste our provisions and does not leave the rubbish scattered everywhere in our  house.&#8221; The eleventh lady added, &#8220;One day it so happened that Abu Zar went out  at the time when the milk was being milked from the animals, and he saw a woman who had  two sons like two leopards playing with her two breasts. (On seeing her) he divorced me  and married her. Thereafter I married a noble man who used to ride a fast tireless horse  and keep a spear in his hand. He gave me many things, and also a pair of every kind of  livestock and said, &#8216;Eat (of this), O Um Zar, and give provision to your relatives.&#8221;  She added, &#8220;Yet, all those things which my second husband gave me could not fill the  smallest utensil of Abu Zar&#8217;s.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha then said: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to me, &#8220;I  am to you as Abu Zar was to his wife Um Zar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 119: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas : </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I had been eager to ask &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab about the two  ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said &#8216;If you two (wives of  the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah, your hearts are indeed so  inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes). (66.4) till &#8216;Umar performed the Hajj and I  too, performed the Hajj along with him. (On the way) &#8216;Umar went aside to answer the call  of nature, and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler full of water, and when  &#8216;Umar had finished answering the call of nature, I poured water over his hands and he  performed the ablution. Then I said to him, &#8220;O chief of the Believers! Who were the  two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said: &#8216;If you two  (wives of the Prophet) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to  oppose what the Prophet likes)?&#8221; (66.4) He said, &#8220;I am astonished at your  question, O Ibn Abbas. They were &#8216;Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar went on narrating the  Hadith and said, &#8220;I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiyya bin Zaid who  used to live in Awali-al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turn. He used to go one day  and I another day. When I went, I would bring him the news of what had happened that day  regarding the Divine Inspiration and other things, and when he went, he used to do the  same for me. We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our wives, but  when we came to the Ansar, we found that their women had the upper hand over their men, so  our women also started learning the ways of the Ansari women. I shouted at my wife and she  retorted against me and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said to me, &#8216;Why  are you so surprised at my answering you back? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet answer  him back and some of them may leave (does not speak to) him throughout the day till the  night.&#8217; The (talk) scared me and I said to her, &#8216;Whoever has done so will be ruined!&#8217; Then  I proceeded after dressing myself, and entered upon Hafsa and said to her, &#8216;Does anyone of  you keep the Prophet angry till night?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;You are a ruined losing  person! Don&#8217;t you fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and thus  you will be ruined? So do not ask more from the Prophet and do not answer him back and do  not give up talking to him. Ask me whatever you need and do not be tempted to imitate your  neighbor (i.e., &#8216;Aisha) in her manners for she is more charming than you and more beloved  to the Prophet .&#8221; Umar added,&#8221;At that time a talk was circulating among us that  (the tribe of) Ghassan were preparing their horses to invade us. My Ansari companion, on  the day of his turn, went (to the town) and returned to us at night and knocked at my door  violently and asked if I was there. I became horrified and came out to him. He said,  &#8216;Today a great thing has happened.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;What is it? Have (the people of) Ghassan  come?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, but (What has happened) is greater and more horrifying than that:  Allah&#8217;s Apostle; has divorced his wives. &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;The Prophet kept away from his  wives and I said &#8220;Hafsa is a ruined loser.&#8217; I had already thought that most probably  this (divorce) would happen in the near future. So I dressed myself and offered the  morning prayer with the Prophet and then the Prophet; entered an upper room and stayed  there in seclusion. I entered upon Hafsa and saw her weeping. I asked, &#8216;What makes you  weep? Did I not warn you about that? Did the Prophet divorce you all?&#8217; She said, &#8216;I do not  know. There he is retired alone in the upper room.&#8217; I came out and sat near the pulpit and  saw a group of people sitting around it and some of them were weeping. I sat with them for  a while but could not endure the situation, so I went to the upper room where the Prophet;  was and said to a black slave of his, &#8216;Will you get the permission (of the Prophet ) for  &#8216;Umar (to enter)?&#8217; The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and then returned  saying, &#8216;I have spoken to the Prophet and mentioned you but he kept quiet.&#8217; Then I  returned and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit. but I could not bear  the situation and once again I said to the slave, &#8216;Will you get the permission for &#8216;Umar?&#8217;  He went in and returned saying, &#8216;I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.&#8217; So I returned  again and sat with the group of people sitting near the pulpit, but I could not bear the  situation, and so I went to the slave and said, &#8216;Will you get the permission for &#8216;Umar?&#8217;  He went in and returned to me saying, &#8216;I mentioned you to him but he kept quiet.&#8217; When I  was leaving, behold! The slave called me, saying, &#8216;The Prophet has given you permission.&#8217;  Then I entered upon Allah&#8217;s Apostle and saw him Lying on a bed made of stalks of date palm  leaves and there was no bedding between it and him. The stalks left marks on his side and  he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with date-palm fires. I greeted him and while  still standing I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Have you divorced your wives?&#8217; He looked at me  and said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Allah Akbar!&#8217; And then, while still standing, I said chatting,  &#8216;Will you heed what I say, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? We, the people of Quraish used to have power  over our women, but when we arrived at Medina we found that the men (here) were  overpowered by their women.&#8217; The Prophet smiled and then I said to him, &#8216;Will you heed  what I say, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle? I entered upon Hafsa and said to her, &#8220;Do not be  tempted to imitate your companion (&#8216;Aisha), for she is more charming than you and more  beloved to the Prophet.&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet smiled for a second time. When I saw him  smiling, I sat down. Then I looked around his house, and by Allah, I could not see  anything of importance in his house except three hides, so I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  Invoke Allah to make your followers rich, for the Persians and the Romans have been made  prosperous and they have been given (the pleasures of the world), although they do not  worship Allah.&#8217; Thereupon the Prophet sat up as he was reclining. and said, &#8216;Are you of  such an opinion, O the son of Al-Khattab? These are the people who have received the  rewards for their good deeds in this world.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Ask Allah to  forgive me.&#8217; Then the Prophet kept away from his wives for twenty-nine days because of the  story which Hafsa had disclosed to &#8216;Aisha. The Prophet had said, &#8216;I will not enter upon  them (my wives) for one month,&#8217; because of his anger towards them, when Allah had  admonished him. So, when twenty nine days had passed, the Prophet first entered upon  &#8216;Aisha. &#8216;Aisha said to him, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You had sworn that you would not enter  upon us for one month, but now only twenty-nine days have passed, for I have been counting  them one by one.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;The (present) month is of twenty nine days.&#8217; &#8216;Aisha  added, &#8216;Then Allah revealed the Verses of the option. (2) And out of all his-wives he  asked me first, and I chose him.&#8217; Then he gave option to his other wives and they said  what &#8216;Aisha had said . &#8221; (1) The Prophet, &#8216; had decided to abstain from eating a  certain kind of food because of a certain event, so Allah blamed him for doing so. Some of  his wives were the cause of him taking that decision, therefore he deserted them for one  month. See Quran: (66.4) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>During the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the sun eclipsed.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the prayer of (the) eclipse) and so did the people along with him.  He performed a long Qiyam (standing posture) during which Surat-al-Baqara could have been  recited; then he performed a pro-longed bowing, then raised his head and stood for a long  time which was slightly less than that of the first Qiyam (and recited Qur&#8217;an). Then he  performed a prolonged bowing again but the period was shorter than the period of the first  bowing, then he stood up and then prostrated. Again he stood up, but this time the period  of standing was less than the first standing. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but of  a lesser duration than the first, then he stood up again for a long time but for a lesser  duration than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but of lesser duration than  the first, and then he again stood up, and then prostrated and then finished his prayer.  By then the sun eclipse had cleared. The Prophet then said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are  two signs among the signs of Allah, and they do not eclipse because of the death or birth  of someone, so when you observe the eclipse, remember Allah (offer the eclipse  prayer).&#8221; They (the people) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We saw you stretching your  hand to take something at this place of yours, then we saw you stepping backward.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;I saw Paradise (or Paradise was shown to me), and I stretched my hand to pluck  a bunch (of grapes), and had I plucked it, you would have eaten of it as long as this  world exists. Then I saw the (Hell) Fire, and I have never before, seen such a horrible  sight as that, and I saw that the majority of its dwellers were women.&#8221; The people  asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is the reason for that?&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;Because of their ungratefulness.&#8221; It was said. &#8220;Do they disbelieve in  Allah (are they ungrateful to Allah)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;They are not thankful to  their husbands and are ungrateful for the favors done to them. Even if you do good to one  of them all your life, when she seems some harshness from you, she will say, &#8220;I have  never seen any good from you.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Az-Zubair married me, he had no real property or any  slave or anything else except a camel which drew water from the well, and his horse. I  used to feed his horse with fodder and drew water and sew the bucket for drawing it, and  prepare the dough, but I did not know how to bake bread. So our Ansari neighbors used to  bake bread for me, and they were honorable ladies. I used to carry the date stones on my  head from Zubair&#8217;s land given to him by Allah&#8217;s Apostle and this land was two third  Farsakh (about two miles) from my house. One day, while I was coming with the date stones  on my head, I met Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with some Ansari people. He called me and then,  (directing his camel to kneel down) said, &#8220;Ikh! Ikh!&#8221; so as to make me ride  behind him (on his camel). I felt shy to travel with the men and remembered Az-Zubair and  his sense of Ghira, as he was one of those people who had the greatest sense of Ghira.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle noticed that I felt shy, so he proceeded. I came to Az-Zubair and said,  &#8220;I met Allah&#8217;s Apostle while I was carrying a load of date stones on my head, and he  had some companions with him. He made his camel kneel down so that I might ride, but I  felt shy in his presence and remembered your sense of Ghira (See the glossary). On that  Az-Zubair said, &#8220;By Allah, your carrying the date stones (and you being seen by the  Prophet in such a state) is more shameful to me than your riding with him.&#8221; (I  continued serving in this way) till Abu Bakr sent me a servant to look after the horse,  whereupon I felt as if he had set me free. </font></p>

He gave the sound dish to the wife whose dish had been broken and kept the broken one at  the house where it had been broken. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;If you enter (your town) at night  (after coming from a journey), do not enter upon your family till the woman whose husband  was absent (from the house) shaves her pubic hair and the woman with unkempt hair, combs  her hair&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle further said, &#8220;(O Jabir!) Seek to have offspring, seek  to have offspring!&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 174: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were with the Prophet in Ghazwa, and when we returned  and approached Medina, I wanted to hurry while riding a slow camel. A rider overtook me  and pricked my camel with a spear which he had, whereupon my camel started running as fast  as any other fast camel you may see. I looked back, and behold, the rider was Allah&#8217;s  Apostle . I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am newly married &#8221; He asked, &#8220;Have  you got married?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;A virgin or a  matron?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;(Not a virgin) but a matron&#8221; He said, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t  you marry a young girl so that you could play with her and she with you?&#8221; When we  reached (near Medina) and were going to enter it, the Prophet said, &#8220;Wait till you  enter your home early in the night so that the lady whose hair is unkempt may comb her  hair and that the lady whose husband has been away may shave her pubic hair.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 7, Book 62, Number 175: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Hazim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people differed about the type of treatment which had  been given to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day (of the battle) of Uhud. So they asked Sahl bin  Sad As-Sa&#8217;id who was the only surviving Companion (of the Prophet) at Medina. He replied,  &#8220;Nobody Is left at Medina who knows it better than I. Fatima was washing the blood  off his face and &#8216;Ali was bringing water in his shield, and then a mat of date-palm leaves  was burnt and (the ash) was inserted into the wound.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Abis: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Ibn &#8216;Abbas answering a man who asked him, &#8220;Did  you attend the prayer of &#8216;Id al Adha or &#8216;Id-al-Fitr with Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas  replied, &#8220;Yes, and had it not been for my close relationship with him, I could not  have offered it.&#8221; (That was because of his young age). Ibn &#8216;Abbas further said,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out and offered the Id prayer and then delivered the sermon.&#8221;  Ibn &#8216;Abbas did not mention anything about the Adhan (the call for prayer) or the Iqama. He  added, &#8220;Then the Prophet went to the women and instructed them and gave them  religious advice and ordered them to give alms and I saw them reaching out (their hands  to) their ears and necks (to take off the earrings and necklaces, etc.) and throwing (it)  towards Bilal. Then the Prophet returned with Bilal to his house . &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr admonished me and poked me with his hands in the  flank, and nothing stopped me from moving at that time except the position of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle whose head was on my thigh. </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Supporting the Family</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.064.263"></a>Volume 7, Book 64, Number 263:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Mas&#8217;ud Al-Ansari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;When a Muslim spends something on his family intending to receive Allah&#8217;s reward it is regarded as Sadaqa for him.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 264:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Allah said, &#8216;O son of Adam! Spend, and I shall spend on you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 265:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The one who looks after a widow or a poor person is like a Mujahid (warrior) who fights for Allah&#8217;s Cause, or like him who performs prayers all the night and fasts all the day.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 266:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet visited me at Mecca while I was ill. I said (to him), &#8220;I have property; May I bequeath all my property in Allah&#8217;s Cause?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Half of it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;One third of it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;One-third (is alright), yet it is still too much, for you&#8217;d better leave your inheritors wealthy than leave them poor, begging of others. Whatever you spend will be considered a Sadaqa for you, even the mouthful of food you put in the mouth of your wife. Anyhow Allah may let you recover, so that some people may benefit by you and others be harmed by you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-&#8216;Amash:</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 268:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet said, &#8216;The best alms is that which is given when one is rich, and a giving hand is better than a taking one, and you should start first to support your dependents.&#8217; A wife says, &#8216;You should either provide me with food or divorce me.&#8217; A slave says, &#8216;Give me food and enjoy my service.&#8221; A son says, &#8220;Give me food; to whom do you leave me?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Abu Huraira! Did you hear that from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, it is from my own self.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 269:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The best alms is that which you give when you are rich, and you should start first to support your dependants.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 270:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to sell the dates of the garden of Bani An-Nadir and store for his family so much food as would cover their needs for a whole year.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 64, Number 271:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Malik bin Aus bin Al-Hadathan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once I set out to visit &#8216;Umar (bin Al-Khattab). (While I was sitting there with him his gate-keeper, Yarfa, came and said, &#8220;Uthman AbdurRahman (bin &#8216;Auf), Az-Zubair and Sad (bin Abi Waqqas) are seeking permission (to meet you).&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes. So he admitted them and they entered, greeted, and sat down. After a short while Yarfa came again and said to &#8216;Umar &#8216;Shall I admit &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He admitted them and when they entered, they greeted and sat down. &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between me and this (&#8216;Ali).&#8221; The group, &#8216;Uthman and his companions Sad, &#8216;O Chief of the Believers! Judge between them and relieve one from the other.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said. Wait! I beseech you by Allah, by Whose permission both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast ! Do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said. &#8216;We (Apostles) do not bequeath anything to our heirs, but whatever we leave is to be given in charity.&#8217; And by that Allah&#8217;s Apostles meant himself?&#8221; The group said, &#8220;He did say so.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then turned towards &#8216;All and &#8216;Abbas and said. &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, do you know that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said that?&#8221; They said, &#8216;Yes &#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Now, let me talk to you about this matter. Allah favored His Apostle with something of this property (war booty) which He did not give to anybody else. And Allah said:&#8211; &#8216;And what Allah has bestowed on His Apostle (as Fai Booty) from them for which you made no expedition with either cavalry or camelry . . . Allah is Able to do all things.&#8217; (59.6) So this property was especially granted to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. But by Allah he neither withheld it from you, nor did he keep it for himself and deprive you of it, but he gave it all to you and distributed it among you till only this remained out of it. And out of this property Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to provide his family with their yearly needs, and whatever remained, he would spend where Allah&#8217;s Property (the revenues of Zakat) used to be spent. Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on acting like this throughout his lifetime. Now I beseech you by Allah, do you know that?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar said to &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas, &#8220;I beseech you by Allah, do you both know that?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;When Allah had taken His Apostle unto Him, Abu Bakr said, &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So he took charge of that property and did with it the same what Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to do, and both of you knew all about it then.&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar turned towards &#8216;Ali and Abbas and said, &#8220;You both claim that Abu- Bakr was so-and-so! But Allah knows that he was honest, sincere, pious and right (in that matter). Then Allah caused Abu Bakr to die, and i said, &#8216;I am the successor of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr.&#8217; So I kept this property in my possession for the first two years of my rule, and I used to do the same with it as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr used to do. Later both of you (&#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas) came to me with the same claim and the same problem. (O &#8216;Abbas!) You came to me demanding your share from (the inheritance of) the son of your brother, and he (&#8216;Ali) came to me demanding his wives share from (the inheritance of) her father. So I said to you, &#8216;If you wish I will hand over this property to you, on condition that you both promise me before Allah that you will manage it in the same way as Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr did, and as I have done since the beginning of my rule; otherwise you should not speak to me about it.&#8217; So you both said, &#8216;Hand over this property to us on this condition.&#8217; And on this condition I handed it over to you. I beseech you by Allah, did I hand it over to them on that condition?&#8221; The group said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then faced &#8216;Ali and &#8216;Abbas and said, &#8220;I beseech you both by Allah, did I hand it over to you both on that condition?&#8221; They both said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;Do you want me now to give a decision other than that? By Him with Whose permission (order) both the Heaven and the Earth stand fast, I will never give any decision other than that till the Hour is established! But if you are unable to manage it (that property), then return it to me and I will be sufficient for it on your behalf . &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hind bint &#8216;Utba came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

<p style="text-align:justify;">Fatima went to the Prophet complaining about the bad effect of the stone hand-mill on her hand. She heard that the Prophet had received a few slave girls. But (when she came there) she did not find him, so she mentioned her problem to &#8216;Aisha. When the Prophet came, &#8216;Aisha informed him about that. &#8216;Ali added, &#8220;So the Prophet came to us when we had gone to bed. We wanted to get up (on his arrival) but he said, &#8216;Stay where you are.&#8221; Then he came and sat between me and her and I felt the coldness of his feet on my abdomen. He said, &#8220;Shall I direct you to something better than what you have requested? When you go to bed say &#8216;Subhan Allah&#8217; thirty-three times, &#8216;Alhamdulillah&#8217; thirty three times, and Allahu Akbar&#8217; thirty four times, for that is better for you than a servant.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Sacrifice on Occasion of Birth (`Aqiqa)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.066.376"></a>Volume 7, Book 66, Number 376:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A son was born to me and I took him to the Prophet who named him Ibrahim, did Tahnik for him with a date, invoked Allah to bless him and returned him to me. (The narrator added: That was Abu Musa&#8217;s eldest son.)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 377:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A boy was brought to the Prophet to do Tahnik for him, but the boy urinated on him, whereupon the Prophet had water poured on the place of urine.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 378:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217; bint Abu Bakr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I conceived &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair at Mecca and went out (of Mecca) while I was about to give birth. I came to Medina and encamped at Quba&#8217;, and gave birth at Quba&#8217;. Then I brought the child to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and placed it (on his lap). He asked for a date, chewed it, and put his saliva in the mouth of the child. So the first thing to enter its stomach was the saliva of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then he did its Tahnik with a date, and invoked Allah to bless him. It was the first child born in the Islamic era, therefore they (Muslims) were very happy with its birth, for it had been said to them that the Jews had bewitched them, and so they would not produce any offspring.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 379p:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Talha had a child who was sick. Once, while Abu Talha was out, the child died. When Abu Talha returned home, he asked, &#8220;How does my son fare?&#8221; Um Salaim (his wife) replied, &#8220;He is quieter than he has ever been.&#8221; Then she brought supper for him and he took his supper and slept with her. When he had finished, she said (to him), &#8220;Bury the child (as he&#8217;s dead).&#8221; Next morning Abu Talha came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him about that. The Prophet said (to him), &#8220;Did you sleep with your wife last night?&#8221; Abu Talha said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow your blessing on them as regards that night of theirs.&#8221; Um Sulaim gave birth to a boy. Abu Talha told me to take care of the child till it was taken to the Prophet. Then Abu Talha took the child to the Prophet and Um Sulaim sent some dates along with the child. The Prophet took the child (on his lap) and asked if there was something with him. The people replied, &#8220;Yes, a few dates.&#8221; The Prophet took a date, chewed it, took some of it out of his mouth, put it into the child&#8217;s mouth and did Tahnik for him with that, and named him &#8216;Abdullah.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 379i:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As above.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 380:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salman bin &#8216;Amir Ad-Dabbi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;&#8216;Aqiqa is to be offered for a (newly born) boy, so slaughter (an animal) for him, and relieve him of his suffering.&#8221; (Note: It has been quoted in Fateh-AL-Bari that the majority of the Religious Scholars agrees to the Hadith narrated in Sahih At-TlRMlZY that the Prophet was asked about Aqiqa and he ordered 2 sheep for a boy and one sheep for a girl and that is his tradition &#8220;SUNNA&#8221;.)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 381:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Habib bin Ash-Shahid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Sirin told me to ask Al-Hassan from whom he had heard the narration of &#8216;Aqiqa. I asked him and he said, &#8220;From Samura bin Jundab.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 382:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Neither Fara&#8217; nor &#8216;Atira (is permissible):&#8221; Al-Fara&#8217; nor &#8216;Atira (is permissible):&#8221; Al-Fara&#8217; was the first offspring (of camels or sheep) which the pagans used to offer (as a sacrifice) to their idols. And Al-&#8216;Atira was (a sheep which was to be slaughtered) during the month of Rajab.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 66, Number 383:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Neither Fara&#8217; nor &#8216;Atira) is permissible).&#8221; Al-Fara&#8217; was the first offspring (they got of camels or sheep) which they (pagans) used to offer (as a sacrifice) to their idols. &#8216;Atira was (a sheep which used to be slaughtered) during the month of Rajab.</p>
