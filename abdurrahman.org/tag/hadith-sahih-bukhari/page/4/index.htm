<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Sufyan bin Abu Zuhair, a man from Azd Shanu&#8217;a and one  of the companions of the Prophet said, &#8220;I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;If one keeps  a dog which is meant for guarding neither a farm nor cattle, one Qirat of the reward of  his good deeds is deducted daily.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Did you hear this from Allah&#8217;s  Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, by the Lord of this Mosque.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;While a man was riding a cow, it  turned towards him and said, &#8216;I have not been created for this purpose (i.e. carrying), I  have been created for sloughing.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar  believe in the story.&#8221; The Prophet went on, &#8220;A wolf caught a sheep, and when the  shepherd chased it, the wolf said, &#8216;Who will be its guard on the day of wild beasts, when  there will be no shepherd for it except me?&#8217; &#8220;After narrating it, the Prophet said,  &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar too believe it.&#8221; Abu Salama (a sub-narrator) said,  &#8220;Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were not present then.&#8221; (It has been written that a wolf  also spoke to one of the companions of the Prophet near Medina as narrated in  Fatah-al-Bari: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Unais bin &#8216;Amr: Ahban bin Aus said, &#8220;I was  amongst my sheep. Suddenly a wolf caught a sheep and I shouted at it. The wolf sat on its  tail and addressed me, saying, &#8216;Who will look after it (i.e. the sheep) when you will be  busy and not able to look after it? Do you forbid me the provision which Allah has  provided me?&#8217; &#8221; Ahban added, &#8220;I clapped my hands and said, &#8216;By Allah, I have  never seen anything more curious and wonderful than this!&#8217; On that the wolf said, &#8216;There  is something (more curious) and wonderful than this; that is, Allah&#8217;s Apostle in those  palm trees, inviting people to Allah (i.e. Islam).&#8217; &#8220;Unais bin &#8216;Amr further said,  &#8220;Then Ahban went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him what happened and embraced  Islam.)&#8221; palm trees or other trees and share the fruits with me.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 518: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Ansar said to the Prophet &#8220;Distribute the date  palm trees between us and our emigrant brothers.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The  Ansar said (to the emigrants), &#8220;Look after the trees (water and watch them) and share  the fruits with us.&#8221; The emigrants said, &#8220;We listen and obey.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 519: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet got the date palm trees of the tribe of  Bani-An-Nadir burnt and the trees cut down at a place called Al-Buwaira . Hassan bin  Thabit said in a poetic verse: &#8220;The chiefs of Bani Lu&#8217;ai found it easy to watch fire  spreading at Al-Buwaira.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 520: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi&#8217; bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We  used to rent the land at the yield of specific delimited portion of it to be given to the  landlord. Sometimes the vegetation of that portion was affected by blights etc., while the  rest remained safe and vice versa, so the Prophet forbade this practice. At that time gold  or silver were not used (for renting the land). If they provided the seeds, they would get  so-and-so much. Al-Hasan said, &#8220;There is no harm if the land belongs to one but both  spend on it and the yield is divided between them.&#8221; Az-Zuhri had the same opinion.  Al-Hasan said, &#8220;There is no harm if cotton is picked on the condition of having half  the yield.&#8221; Ibrahim, Ibn Siain, &#8216;Ata&#8217;, Al-Hakam, Az-Zuhri and Qatada said,  &#8220;There is no harm in giving the yarn to the weaver to weave into cloth on the basis  that one-third or one-fourth (or any other portion) of the cloth is given to the weaver  for his labor.&#8221; Ma&#8217;am said, &#8220;There is no harm in hiring animals for a definite  (fixed) period on the basis that one-third or one-fourth of the products carried by the  animals is given to the owner of the animals.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 521: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet concluded a contract with the people of Khaibar  to utilize the land on the condition that half the products of fruits or vegetation would  be their share. The Prophet used to give his wives one hundred Wasqs each, eighty Wasqs of  dates and twenty Wasqs of barley. (When &#8216;Umar became the Caliph) he gave the wives of the  Prophet the option of either having the land and water as their shares, or carrying on the  previous practice. Some of them chose the land and some chose the Wasqs, and &#8216;Aisha chose  the land. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 522: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet made a deal with the people of Khaibar that  they would have half the fruits and vegetation of the land they cultivated. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.039.523"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 523: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said to Tawus, &#8220;I wish you would give up Mukhabara  (Share-cropping), for the people say that the Prophet forbade it.&#8221; On that Tawus  replied, &#8220;O &#8216;Amr! I give the land to share-croppers and help them. No doubt; the most  learned man, namely Ibn &#8216;Abbas told me that the Prophet had not forbidden it but said, &#8216;It  is more beneficial for one to give his land free to one&#8217;s brother than to charge him a  fixed rental.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.039.524"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 524: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the land of Khaibar to the Jew&#8217;s on  the condition that they work on it and cultivate it, and be given half of its yield. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.039.525"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 525: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We  used to rent the land and say to the owner, &#8220;The yield of this portion is for us and  the yield of that portion is for you (as the rent).&#8221; One of those portions might  yield something and the other might not.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 526: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;While three men were walking, It  started raining and they took shelter (refuge) in a cave in a mountain. A big rock rolled  down from the mountain and closed the mouth of the cave. They said to each other,  &#8220;Think of good deeds which you did for Allah&#8217;s sake only, and invoke Allah by giving  reference to those deeds so that He may remove this rock from you.&#8221; One of them said,  &#8216;O Allah! I had old parents and small children and I used to graze the sheep for them. On  my return to them in the evening, I used to milk (the sheep) and start providing my  parents first of all before my children. One day I was delayed and came late at night and  found my parents sleeping. I milked (the sheep) as usual and stood by their heads. I hated  to wake them up and disliked to give milk to my children before them, although my children  were weeping (because of hunger) at my feet till the day dawned. O Allah! If I did this  for Your sake only, kindly remove the rock so that we could see the sky through it.&#8217; So,  Allah removed the rock a little and they saw the sky. The second man said, &#8216;O Allah! I was  in love with a cousin of mine like the deepest love a man may have for a woman. I wanted  to outrage her chastity but she refused unless I gave her one hundred Dinars. So, I  struggled to collect that amount. And when I sat between her legs, she said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  slave! Be afraid of Allah and do not deflower me except rightfully (by marriage).&#8217; So, I  got up. O Allah! If I did it for Your sake only, please remove the rock.&#8217; The rock shifted  a little more. Then the third man said, &#8216;O Allah! I employed a laborer for a Faraq of rice  and when he finished his job and demanded his right, I presented it to him, but he refused  to take it. So, I sowed the rice many time till I gathered cows and their shepherd (from  the yield). (Then after some time) He came and said to me, &#8216;Fear Allah (and give me my  right).&#8221; I said, &#8216;Go and take those cows and the shepherd.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Be afraid of  Allah! Don&#8217;t mock at me.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I am not mocking at you. Take (all that).&#8217; So, he took  all that. O Allah! If I did that for Your sake only, please remove the rest of the rock.&#8217;  So, Allah removed the rock.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;He who cultivates land that does  not belong to anybody is more rightful (to own it).&#8221; &#8216;Urwa said, &#8220;Umar gave the  same verdict in his Caliphate.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was passing the night at his place of  rest in Dhul-Hulaifa in the bottom of the valley (of Aqiq), he saw a dream and it was said  to him, &#8220;You are in a blessed valley.&#8221; Musa said, &#8220;Salim let our camels  kneel at the place where &#8216;Abdullah used to make his camel kneel, seeking the place where  Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to take a rest, which is situated below the mosque which is in the  bottom of the valley; it is midway between the mosque and the road.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was in Al-&#8216;Aqiq he said, &#8220;Someone  (meaning Gabriel) came to me from my Lord tonight (in my dream) and said, &#8216;Offer the  prayer in this blessed valley and say (I intend to perform) Umra along with Hajj  (together).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar expelled the Jews and the Christians from Hijaz. When  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had conquered Khaibar, he wanted to expel the Jews from it as its land  became the property of Allah, His Apostle, and the Muslims. Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to  expel the Jews but they requested him to let them stay there on the condition that they  would do the labor and get half of the fruits. Allah&#8217;s Apostle told them, &#8220;We will  let you stay on thus condition, as long as we wish.&#8221; So, they (i.e. Jews) kept on  living there until &#8216;Umar forced them to go towards Taima&#8217; and Ariha&#8217;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My uncle Zuhair said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade us to  do a thing which was a source of help to us.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Whatever Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said was right.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for me and asked, &#8216;What are you  doing with your farms?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;We give our farms on rent on the basis that we get the  yield produced at the banks of the water streams (rivers) for the rent, or rent it for  some Wasqs of barley and dates.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Do not do so, but cultivate (the  land) yourselves or let it be cultivated by others gratis, or keep it uncultivated.&#8217; I  said, &#8216;We hear and obey.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to rent their land for cultivation for  one-third, one-fourth or half its yield. The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has land should  cultivate it himself or give it to his (Muslim) brother gratis; otherwise keep it  uncultivated.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever  has land should cultivate it himself or give it to his (Muslim) brother gratis; otherwise  he should keep it uncultivated.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I mentioned it (i.e. the narration of Rafi &#8216;bin  Khadij: no. 532) to Tawus, he said, &#8220;It is permissible to rent the land for  cultivation, for Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;The Prophet did not forbid that, but said: One had  better give the land to one&#8217;s brother gratis rather than charge a certain amount for it.&#8217;  &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Nafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Umar used to rent his farms in the time of Abu Bakr,  &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Uthman, and in the early days of Muawiya. Then he was told the narration of Rafi  &#8216;bin Khadij that the Prophet had forbidden the renting of farms. Ibn &#8216;Umar went to Rafi&#8217;  and I accompanied him. He asked Rafi who replied that the Prophet had forbidden the  renting of farms. Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;You know that we used to rent our farms in the  life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle for the yield of the banks of the water streams (rivers) and  for certain amount of figs. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I knew that the land was  rented for cultivation in the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; Later on Ibn &#8216;Umar was  afraid that the Prophet had forbidden it, and he had no knowledge of it, so he gave up  renting his land. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hanzla bin Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Rafi bin Khadij said, &#8220;My two uncles told me that they  (i.e. the companions of the Prophet) used to rent the land in the life-time of the Prophet  for the yield on the banks of water streams (rivers) or for a portion of the yield  stipulated by the owner of the land. The Prophet forbade it.&#8221; I said to Rafi,  &#8220;What about renting the land for Dinars and Dirhams?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;There is  no harm in renting for Dinars-Dirhams. Al-Laith said, &#8220;If those who have discernment  for distinguishing what is legal from what is illegal looked into what has been forbidden  concerning this matter they would not permit it, for it is surrounded with dangers.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 538: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet was narrating (a story), while a bedouin  was sitting with him. &#8220;One of the inhabitants of Paradise will ask Allah to allow him  to cultivate the land. Allah will ask him, &#8216;Are you not living in the pleasures you like?&#8217;  He will say, &#8216;Yes, but I like to cultivate the land.&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;When  the man (will be permitted he) will sow the seeds and the plants will grow up and get  ripe, ready for reaping and so on till it will be as huge as mountains within a wink.  Allah will then say to him, &#8216;O son of Adam! Take here you are, gather (the yield); nothing  satisfies you.&#8217; &#8221; On that, the bedouin said, &#8220;The man must be either from  Quraish (i.e. an emigrant) or an Ansari, for they are farmers, whereas we are not  farmers.&#8221; The Prophet smiled (at this). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 539: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to be very happy on Friday as an old lady used to  cut some roots of the Silq, which we used to plant on the banks of our small water  streams, and cook them in a pot of her&#8217;s, adding to them, some grains of barley. (Ya&#8217;qub,  the sub-narrator said, &#8220;I think the narrator mentioned that the food did not contain  fat or melted fat (taken from meat).&#8221;) When we offered the Friday prayer we would go  to her and she would serve us with the dish. So, we used to be happy on Fridays because of  that. We used not to take our meals or the midday nap except after the Jumua prayer (i.e.  Friday prayer) . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 540: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people say that Abu Huraira narrates too many  narrations. In fact Allah knows whether I say the truth or not. They also ask, &#8220;Why  do the emigrants and the Ansar not narrate as he does?&#8221; In fact, my emigrant brethren  were busy trading in the markets, and my Ansar brethren were busy with their properties. I  was a poor man keeping the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and was satisfied with what filled  my stomach. So, I used to be present while they (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar) were  absent, and I used to remember while they forgot (the Hadith). One day the Prophet said,  &#8220;Whoever spreads his sheet till I finish this statement of mine and then gathers it  on his chest, will never forget anything of my statement.&#8221; So, I spread my covering  sheet which was the only garment I had, till the Prophet finished his statement and then I  gathered it over my chest. By Him Who had sent him (i.e. Allah&#8217;s Apostle) with the truth,  since then I did not forget even a single word of that statement of his, until this day of  mine. By Allah, but for two verses in Allah&#8217;s Book, I would never have related any  narration (from the Prophet). (These two verses are): &#8220;Verily! Those who conceal the  clear signs and the guidance which we have sent down &#8230;..(up to) the Merciful.&#8217;  (2.159-160) </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Pilgrims Prevented from Completing thePilgrimage</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.028.033"></a>Volume 3, Book 28, Number 33:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin Umar set out for Mecca intending to perform Umra, at the time of afflictions, he said, &#8220;If I should be prevented from reaching the Kaba, then I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did, so I assume the lhram for Umra as Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed the Ihram for Umra in the year of Hudaibiya.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 34:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Abdullah and Salim bin &#8216;Abdullah informed him that they told Ibn &#8216;Umar when Ibn Az-Zubair was attacked by the army, saying &#8220;There is no harm for you if you did not perform Hajj this year. We are afraid that you may be prevented from reaching the Kaba.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the non-believers of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba, and so the Prophet slaughtered his Hadi and got his head shaved.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;I make you witnesses that I have made &#8216;Umra obligatory for me. And, Allah willing, I will go and then if the way to Ka&#8217;ba is clear, I will perform the Tawaf, but if I am prevented from going to the Ka&#8217;ba then I will do the same as the Prophet did while I was in his company.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then assumed Ihram for Umra from Dhul-Hulaifa and proceeded for a while and said, &#8220;The conditions of &#8216;Umra and Hajj are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made &#8216;Umra and Hajj obligatory for myself.&#8221; So, he did not finish the Ihram till the day of Nahr (slaughtering) came, and he slaughtered his Hadi. He used to say, &#8220;I will not finish the Ihram till I perform the Tawaf, one Tawaf on the day of entering Mecca (i.e. of Safa and Marwa for both &#8216;Umra and Hajj).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 35:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi: Some of the sons of &#8216;Abdullah told him (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah) if he had sta</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 36:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle was prevented from performing (&#8216;Umra) Therefore, he shaved his head and had sexual relations with his wives and slaughtered his Hadi and performed Umra in the following year.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 37:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Abdullah) bin &#8216;Umar used to say, &#8220;Is not (the following of) the tradition of Allah&#8217;s Apostle sufficient for you? If anyone of you is prevented from performing Hajj, he should perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram and everything will become legal for him which was illegal for him (during the state of Ihram) and he can perform Hajj in a following year and he should slaughter a Hadi or fast in case he cannot afford the Hadi.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 38:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Miswar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered (the Hadi) before he had his head shaved and then he ordered his Companions to do the same.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 39:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Abdullah and Salim said to &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar, &#8220;(You should not go for Hajj this year).&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;We set out with the Prophet (to Mecca for performing &#8216;Umra) and e infidels of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba. Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered his Budn (camels for sacrifice) and got his head shaved.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 40:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar set out for Mecca with the intentions performing &#8216;Umra in the period of afflictions, he said, &#8220;If I should be prevented from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba, then I would do the same as we did while in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; So, he assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra since the Prophet had assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra in the year of Al-Hudaibiya. Then &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar thought about it and said, &#8220;The conditions for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar.&#8221; He then turned towards his companions and said, &#8220;The conditions of both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made the performance of Hajj obligatory for myself along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He then performed one Tawaf (between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) for both of them (i.e. Hajj and (&#8216;Umra) and considered that to be sufficient for him and offered a Hadi.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 41:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him (Ka&#8217;b), &#8220;Perhaps your lice have troubled you?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b replied, &#8220;Yes! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Have your head shaved and then either fast three days or feed six poor persons or slaughter one sheep as a sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 42:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Umra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood beside me at Al-Hudaibiya and the lice were falling from my head in great number. He asked me, &#8220;Have your lice troubled you?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He ordered me to get my head shaved. Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;This Holy Verse:&#8211;&#8216;And if any of you is ill, or has ailment in his scalp (2.196), etc. was revealed regarding me. &#8220;The Prophet then ordered me either to fast three days, or to feed six poor persons with one Faraq (three Sas) (of dates), or to slaughter a sheep, etc (sacrifice) whatever was available.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 43:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Ma&#8217;qal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat with Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra and asked him about the Fidya. He replied, &#8220;This revelation was revealed concerning my case especially, but it is also for you in general. I was carried to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the lice were falling in great number on my face. The Prophet said, &#8220;I have never thought that your ailment (or struggle) has reached to such an extent as I see. Can you afford a sheep?&#8221; I replied in the negative. He then said, &#8220;Fast for three days, or feed six poor persons each with half a Sa of food.&#8221; (1 Sa = 3 Kilograms approx.)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 44:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reporting the speech of Ka&#8217;b bin Umra) Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him (i.e. Ka&#8217;b) while the lice were falling on his face. He asked (him), &#8220;Have your lice troubled you?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. So, he ordered him to get his head shaved while he was at Al-Hudaibiya. At that time they were not permitted to finish their Ihram, and were still hoping to enter Mecca. So, Allah revealed the verses of Al-Fidya. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to feed six poor persons with one Faraq of food or to slaughter one sheep (as a sacrifice) or to fast for three days.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 45:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever performs Hajj to this House (Ka&#8217;ba) and does not approach his wife for sexual relations nor commits sins (while performing Hajj), he will come out as sinless as a newly-born child. (Just delivered by his mother).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 46:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever performs Hajj to this Ka&#8217;ba and does not approach his wife for sexual relations nor commit sins (while performing Hajj), he will come out as sinless as a new-born child, (just delivered by his mother).&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Actions while Praying</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.022.289"></a>Volume 2, Book 22, Number 289:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Kuraib Maula Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin Abbas said that he had passed a night in the house of Maimuna the mother of the faithful believers , who was his aunt. He said, &#8220;I slept across the bed, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with his wife slept lengthwise. Allah&#8217;s Apostle slept till mid-night or slightly before or after it. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle woke up, sat, and removed the traces of sleep by rubbing his hands over his face. Then he recited the last ten verses of Surat-Al Imran (2). Then he went towards a hanging leather water-container and performed a perfect ablution and then stood up for prayer.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Abbas added, &#8220;I got up and did the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had done and then went and stood by his side. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then put his right hand over my head and caught my right ear and twisted it. He offered two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat and then offered one Raka Witr. Then he lay down till the Muadh-dhin came and then he prayed two light Rakat and went out and offered the early morning (Fajr) prayer.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 290:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to greet the Prophet while he was praying and he used to answer our greetings. When we returned from AnNajashi (the ruler of Ethiopia), we greeted him, but he did not answer us (during the prayer) and (after finishing the prayer) he said, &#8220;In the prayer one is occupied (with a more serious matter).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 291:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the same as No. 290. from the Prophet</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 292:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Arqam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of the Prophet we used to speak while praying, and one of us would tell his needs to his companions, till the verse, &#8216;Guard strictly your prayers (2.238) was revealed. After that we were ordered to remain silent while praying.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 293:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet went out to affect a reconciliation between the tribes of Bani &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf and the time of the prayer became due; Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;The Prophet is detained. Will you lead the people in the prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;Yes, if you wish.&#8221; So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr led the prayer. In the meantime the Prophet came crossing the rows (of the praying people) till he stood in the first row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr never looked hither and thither during the prayer but when the people clapped too much, he looked back and saw the Prophet in the (first) row. The Prophet waved him to remain at his place, but Abu Bakr raised both his hands and sent praises to Allah and then retreated and the Prophet went forward and led the prayer. (See Hadith No. 295 &amp; 296)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 294:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Masud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to say the greeting, name and greet each other in the prayer. Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard it and said:&#8211;&#8220;Say, &#8216;At-tahiyyatu lil-lahi was-salawatu wat-taiyibatu . Assalamu &#8216;Alaika aiyuha-n-Nabiyu wa-rahmatu-l-lahi wa-barakatuhu. _ Assalamu alaina wa-&#8216;ala &#8216;ibadi-l-lahi as-salihin.. Ashhadu an la ilaha illa-l-lah wa ashhadu anna Muhammadan &#8216;abdu hu wa Rasuluh. (All the compliments are for Allah and all the prayers and all the good things (are for Allah). Peace be on you, O Prophet, and Allah&#8217;s mercy and blessings (are on you). And peace be on us and on the good (pious) worshipers of Allah. I testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is His slave and Apostle.) So, when you have said this, then you have surely sent the greetings to every good (pious) worship per of Allah, whether he be in the Heaven or on the Earth . &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 295:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The saying &#8216;Sub Han Allah&#8217; is for men and clapping is for women.&#8221; (If something happens in the prayer, the men can invite the attention of the Imam by saying &#8220;Sub Han Allah&#8221;. And women, by clapping their hands).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 296:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The saying &#8216;Sub Han Allah&#8217; is for men and clapping is for women.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 297:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While Abu Bakr was leading the people in the morning prayer on a Monday, the Prophet came towards them suddenly having lifted the curtain of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s house, and looked at them as they were standing in rows and smiled. Abu Bakr tried to come back thinking that Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to come out for the prayer. The attention of the Muslims was diverted from the prayer because they were delighted to see the Prophet. The Prophet waved his hand to them to complete their prayer, then he went back into the room and let down the curtain. The Prophet expired on that very day.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 297m:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A woman called her son while he was in his hermitage and said, &#8216;O Juraij&#8217; He said, &#8216;O Allah, my mother (is calling me) and (I am offering) my prayer (what shall I do)?&#8217; She again said, &#8216;O Juraij!&#8217; He said again, &#8216;O Allah ! My mother (is calling me) and (I am offering) my prayer (what shall I do)?&#8217; She again said, &#8216;O Juraij&#8217; He again said, &#8216;O Allah! My mother (is calling me) and (I am offering) my prayer. (What shall I do?)&#8217; She said, &#8216;O Allah! Do not let Juraij die till he sees the faces of prostitutes.&#8217; A shepherdess used to come by his hermitage for grazing her sheep and she gave birth to a child. She was asked whose child that was, and she replied that it was from Juraij and that he had come out from his hermitage. Juraij said, &#8216;Where is that woman who claims that her child is from me?&#8217; (When she was brought to him along with the child), Juraij asked the child, &#8216;O Babus, who is your father?&#8217; The child replied, &#8216;The shepherd.&#8217; &#8221; (See Hadith No 662. Vol 3).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 298:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mu&#8217;aiqib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet talked about a man leveling the earth on prostrating, and said, &#8220;If you have to do so, then do it once.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 299:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to pray with the Prophet in scorching heat, and if someone of us could not put his face on the earth (because of the heat) then he would spread his clothes and prostrate over them.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 300:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to stretch my legs towards the Qibla of the Prophet while he was praying; whenever he prostrated he touched me, and I would withdraw my legs, and whenever he stood up, I would restretch my legs.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 301:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, &#8220;Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, &#8216;My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.&#8217; Then Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 302:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Azraq bin Qais:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were at Al-Ahwaz fighting the AlHaruriya (tribe). While I was at the bank of a river a man was praying and the reins of his animal were in his hands and the animal was struggling and he was following the animal. (Shu&#8217;ba, a sub-narrator, said that man was Abu Barza al-Aslaml). A man from the Khawarij said, &#8220;O Allah! Be harsh to this sheik.&#8221; And when the sheik (Abu Barza) finished his prayer, he said, &#8220;I heard your remark. No doubt, I participated with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in six or seven or eight holy battles and saw his leniency, and no doubt, I would rather retain my animal than let it return to its stable, as it would cause me much trouble. &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 303:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the sun eclipsed and Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up for the prayer and recited a very long Sura and when bowed for a long while and then raised his head and started reciting another Sura. Then he bowed, and after finishing, he prostrated and did the same in the second Raka and then said, &#8220;These (lunar and solar eclipses) are two of the signs of Allah and if you see them, pray till the eclipse is over. No doubt, while standing at this place I saw everything promised to me by Allah and I saw (Paradise) and I wanted to pluck a bunch (of grapes) therefrom, at the time when you saw me stepping forward. No doubt, I saw Hell with its different parts destroying each other when you saw me retreating and in it I saw &#8216;Amr bin Luhai who started the tradition of freeing animals (set them free) in the name of idols.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 304:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn&#8217;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet saw some sputum on the wall facing the Qibla of the mosque and became furious with the people of the mosque and said, &#8220;During the prayer, Allah is in front of everyone of you and so he should not spit (or said, &#8216;He should not expectorate&#8217;).&#8221; Then he got down and scratched the sputum with his hand. Ibn &#8216;Umar said (after narrating), &#8220;If anyone of you has to spit during the prayer, he should spit to his left.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 305:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whenever anyone of you is in prayer, he is speaking in private to his Lord and so he should neither spit in front of him nor on his right side but to his left side under his left foot.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 306:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people used to offer the prayer with the Prophet with their waist-sheets tied round their necks because of the shortness of the sheets and the women were ordered not to lift their heads till the men had sat straight.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 307:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated&#8217;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to greet the Prophet while he was in prayer and he would return my greeting, but when we returned (from Ethiopia) I greeted the Prophet (while he was praying) but he did not return the greeting, and (after finishing the prayer) he said, &#8220;In the prayer one is occupied (with a more serious matter).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 308:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent me for some job and when I had finished it I returned and came to the Prophet and greeted him but he did not return my greeting. So I felt so sorry that only Allah knows it and I said to myself,, &#8216;Perhaps Allah&#8217;s Apostle is angry because I did not come quickly, then again I greeted him but he did not reply. I felt even more sorry than I did the first time. Again I greeted him and he returned the greeting and said, &#8220;The thing which prevented me from returning the greeting was that I was praying.&#8221; And at that time he was on his Rahila and his face was not towards the Qibla.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 309:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The news about the differences amongst the people of Bani &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf at Quba reached Allah&#8217;s Apostle and so he went to them along with some of his companions to affect a reconciliation. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was delayed there and the time for the prayer became due. Bilal came to Abu Bakr! and said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Allah&#8217;s Apostle is detained (there) and the time for the prayer is due. Will you lead the people in prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;Yes, if you wish.&#8221; So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr went forward and the people said Takbir. In the meantime, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came piercing through the rows till he stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr, would never look hither and thither during the prayer but when the people clapped much he looked back and saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Prophet beckoned him to carry on. Abu Bakr raised both his hands, praised Allah and retreated till he stood in the row and Allah&#8217;s Apostle went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he had finished the prayer, he addressed the people and said, &#8220;O people! Why did you start clapping when something happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is for women. Whenever one is confronted with something unusual in the prayer one should say, &#8216;Sub Han Allah&#8217;.&#8221; Then the Prophet looked towards Abu Bakr and asked, &#8220;What prevented you from leading the prayer when I beckoned you to carry on?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;It does not befit the son of Al Quhafa to lead the prayer in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Uqba bin Al-Harith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I offered the &#8216;Asr prayer with the Prophet and after finishing the prayer with Taslim he got up quickly and went to some of his wives and then came out. He noticed the signs of astonishment on the faces of the people caused by his speed. He then said, &#8220;I remembered while I was in my prayer that a piece of gold was Lying in my house and I disliked that it should remain with us throughout the night, and so I have ordered it to be distributed.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When the Adhan for the prayer is pronounced, then Satan takes to his heels passing wind so that he may not hear the Adhan and when the Muadh-dhin finishes, he comes back; and when the Iqama is pronounced he again takes to his heels and when it is finished, he again comes back and continues reminding the praying person of things that he used not to remember when not in prayer till he forgets how much he has prayed.&#8221; Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman said, &#8220;If anyone of you has such a thing (forgetting the number of Rakat he has prayed) he should perform two prostrations of Sahu (i.e. forgetfulness) while sitting.&#8221; Abu Salama narrates this from Abu Huraira.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People say that I narrate too many narrations of the Prophet; once I met a man (during the life-time of the Prophet) and asked him, &#8220;Which Sura did Allah&#8217;s Apostle s recite yesterday in the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I do not know.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Did you not attend the prayer?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, (I did).&#8221; I said, &#8220;I know. He recited such and such Sura.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Buhaina :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle once led us in a prayer and offered two Rakat and got up (for the third Raka) without sitting (after the second Raka).

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 317:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated&#8217; Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered five Rakat in the Zuhr prayer, and somebody asked him whether there was some increase in the prayer. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You have offered five Rakat.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle performed two prostrations of Sahu after Taslim.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 318:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet led us in the &#8216;Asr or the Zuhr prayer and finished it with Taslim. Dhul-Yadain said to him, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Has the prayer been reduced?&#8221; The Prophet asked his companions in the affirmative. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle I offered two more Rakat and then performed two prostrations (of Sahu). Sad said, &#8220;I saw that &#8216;Ursa bin Az-Zubair had offered two Rakat in the Maghrib prayer and finished it with Taslim. He then talked (and when he was informed about it) he completed the rest of his prayer and performed two prostrations, and said, &#8216;The Prophet prayed like this.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 319:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered two Rakat and finished his prayer. So Dhul-Yadain asked him, &#8220;Has the prayer been reduced or have you forgotten?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Has DhulYadain spoken the truth?&#8221; The people replied in the affirmative. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up and offered the remaining two Rakat and performed Taslim, and then said Takbir and performed two prostrations like his usual prostrations, or a bit longer, and then got up.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 320:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salama bin &#8216;Alqama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Muhammad (bin Sirin) whether Tashah-hud should be recited after the two prostrations of Sahu. He replied, &#8220;It is not (mentioned) in Abu Huraira&#8217;s narration . &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 321:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet offered one of the evening prayers (the sub-narrator Muhammad said, &#8220;I think that it was most probably the &#8216;Asr prayer&#8221;) and he finished it after offering two Rakat only. He then stood near a price of wood in front of the Mosque and put his hand over it. Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were amongst those who were present, but they dared not talk to him about that (because of excessive respect for him), and those who were in a hurry went out. They said, &#8220;Has the prayer been reduced?&#8221; A man who was called DhulYadain by the Prophet said (to the Prophet), &#8220;Has the prayer been reduced or have you forgotten?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Neither have I forgotten, nor has the prayer been reduced.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Certainly you have forgotten.&#8221; So the Prophet offered two more Rakat and performed Tashm and then said Takbir and performed a prostration of Sahu like his ordinary prostration or a bit longer and then raised his head and said Takbir and then put his head down and performed a prostration like his ordinary prostration or a bit longer, and then raised his head and said Takbir.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 322:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Buhaina Al-Asdi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the ally of Bani &#8216;Abdul Muttalib) Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up for the Zuhr prayer and he should have sat (after the second Raka but he stood up for the third Raka without sitting for Tashah-hud) and when he finished the prayer he performed two prostrations and said Takbir on each prostration while sitting, before ending (the prayer) with Taslim; and the people too performed the two prostrations with him instead of the sitting he forgot.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 323:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When the call for prayer is made, Satan takes to his heels passing wind so that he may not hear the Adhan and when the call is finished he comes back, and when the Iqama is pronounced, Satan again takes to his heels, and when the Iqama is finished he comes back again and tries to interfere with the person and his thoughts and say, &#8220;Remember this and that (which he has not thought of before the prayer)&#8221;, till the praying person forgets how much he has prayed. If anyone of you does not remember whether he has offered three or four Rakat then he should perform two prostrations of Sahu while sitting.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 324:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When anyone of you stands for the prayers, Satan comes and puts him in doubts till he forgets how many Rakat he has prayed. So if this happens to anyone of you, he should perform two prostrations of Sahu while sitting.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 325:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Kuraib:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was sent to Aisha by Ibn Abbas, Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar . They told me to greet her on their behalf and to ask her about the offering of the two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer and to say to her, &#8220;We were informed that you offer those two Rakat and we were told that the Prophet had forbidden offering them.&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;I along with &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab used to beat the people whenever they offered them.&#8221; I went to Aisha and told her that message. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Go and ask Um Salama about them.&#8221; So I returned and informed them about her statement. They then told me to go to Um Salama with the same question with which t sent me to &#8216;Aisha. Um Salama replied, &#8220;I heard the Prophet forbidding them. Later I saw him offering them immediately after he prayed the &#8216;Asr prayer. He then entered my house at a time when some of the Ansari women from the tribe of Bani Haram were sitting with me, so I sent my slave girl to him having said to her, &#8216;Stand beside him and tell him that Um Salama says to you, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have heard you forbidding the offering of these (two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer) but I have seen you offering them.&#8221; If he waves his hand then wait for him.&#8217; The slave girl did that. The Prophet beckoned her with his hand and she waited for him. When he had finished the prayer he said, &#8220;O daughter of Bani Umaiya! You have asked me about the two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer. The people of the tribe of &#8216;Abdul-Qais came to me and made me busy and I could not offer the two Rakat after the Zuhr prayer. These (two Rakat that I have just prayed) are for those (missed) ones.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 326:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa&#8217;idi :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The news about the differences amongst the people of Bani&#8217;Amr bin &#8216;Auf reached Allah&#8217;s Apostle and so he went to them along with some of his companions to affect a reconciliation between them. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was delayed there, and the time of the prayer was due. Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said to him, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has been delayed (there) and the time of prayer is due. So will you lead the people in prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Yes, if you wish.&#8221; Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr, went forward and said Takbir for the people. In the mean-time Allah&#8217;s Apostle came crossing the rows (of the praying people) and stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr, would never glance side-ways in his prayer but when the people clapped much he looked back and (saw) Allah&#8217;s Apostle . Allah&#8217;s Apostle beckoned him to carry on the prayer. Abu Bakr raised his hands and thanked Allah, and retreated till he reached the (first) row. Allah&#8217;s Apostle went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he completed the prayer he faced the people and said, &#8220;O people! Why did you start clapping when something unusual happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is only for women. So whoever amongst you comes across something in the prayer should say, &#8216;Subhan-Allah&#8217; for there is none who will not turn round on hearing him saying Subhan-Allah. O Ab-u Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned you to do so?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;How dare the son of Abu Quhafa lead the prayer in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 327:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to &#8216;Aisha and she was standing praying and the people, too, were standing (praying). So I said, &#8220;What is the matter with the people?&#8221; She beckoned with her head towards the sky.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;(Is there) a sign?&#8221; She nodded intending to say, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 328:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle during his illness prayed in his house sitting, whereas some people followed him standing, but the Prophet beckoned them to sit down. On completion of the prayer he said, &#8220;The Imam is to be followed. So, bow when he bows, and raise your head when he raises his head.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 657 Vol 1 for taking the verdict).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a dispute amongst the people of the tribe of Bani  &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf. The Prophet went to them along with some of his companions in order to make  peace between them. The time for the prayer became due but the Prophet did not turn up;  Bilal pronounced the Adhan (i.e. call) for the prayer but the Prophet did not turn up, so  Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;The time for the prayer is due and the Prophet i  detained, would you lead the people in the prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;Yes, you  wish.&#8221; So, Bilal pronounced the Iqama of the prayer and Abu Bakr went ahead (to lead  the prayer), but the Prophet came walking among the rows till he joined the first row. The  people started clapping and they clapped too much, and Abu Bakr used not to look hither  and thither in the prayer, but he turned round and saw the Prophet standing behind him.  The Prophet beckoned him with his hand to keep on praying where he was. Abu Bakr raised  his hand and praised Allah and then retreated till he came in the (first) row, and the  Prophet went ahead and lead the people in the prayer. When the Prophet finished the  prayer, he turned towards the people and said, &#8220;O people! When something happens to  you during the prayer, you start clapping. Really clapping is (permissible) for women  only. If something happens to one of you in his prayer, he should say: &#8216;Subhan Allah&#8217;,  (Glorified be Allah), for whoever hears him (saying so) will direct his attention towards  him. O Abu Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned  to you (to continue)?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;It did not befit the son of Abu Quhafa  to lead the prayer in front of the Prophet. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It was said to the Prophet &#8220;Would that you see  Abdullah bin Ubai.&#8221; So, the Prophet went to him, riding a donkey, and the Muslims  accompanied him, walking on salty barren land. When the Prophet reached &#8216;Abdullah bin  Ubai, the latter said, &#8220;Keep away from me! By Allah, the bad smell of your donkey has  harmed me.&#8221; On that an Ansari man said (to &#8216;Abdullah), &#8220;By Allah! The smell of  the donkey of Allah&#8217;s Apostle is better than your smell.&#8221; On that a man from  &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s tribe got angry for &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s sake, and the two men abused each other which  caused the friends of the two men to get angry, and the two groups started fighting with  sticks, shoes and hands. We were informed that the following Divine Verse was revealed (in  this concern):&#8211; &#8220;And if two groups of Believers fall to fighting then, make peace  between them.&#8221; (49.9) </font></p>

Judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;My son  was a laborer working for this man, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his  wife. The people told me that my son should be stoned to death; so, in lieu of that, I  paid a ransom of one hundred sheep and a slave girl to save my son. Then I asked the  learned scholars who said, &#8220;Your son has to be lashed one-hundred lashes and has to  be exiled for one year.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No doubt I will judge between you  according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to go back to you, and your  son will get a hundred lashes and one year exile.&#8221; He then addressed somebody,  &#8220;O Unais! go to the wife of this (man) and stone her to death&#8221; So, Unais went  and stoned her to death. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 49, Number 863: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet intended to perform &#8216;Umra in the month of  Dhul-Qada, the people of Mecca did not let him enter Mecca till he settled the matter with  them by promising to stay in it for three days only. When the document of treaty was  written, the following was mentioned: &#8216;These are the terms on which Muhammad, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle agreed (to make peace).&#8217; They said, &#8220;We will not agree to this, for if we  believed that you are Allah&#8217;s Apostle we would not prevent you, but you are Muhammad bin  &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle and also Muhammad bin  &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; Then he said to &#8216;Ali, &#8220;Rub off (the words) &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217; &#8220;,  but &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;No, by Allah, I will never rub off your name.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle took the document and wrote, &#8216;This is what Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdullah has agreed upon:  No arms will be brought into Mecca except in their cases, and nobody from the people of  Mecca will be allowed to go with him (i.e. the Prophet ) even if he wished to follow him  and he (the Prophet ) will not prevent any of his companions from staying in Mecca if the  latter wants to stay.&#8217; When the Prophet entered Mecca and the time limit passed, the  Meccans went to &#8216;Ali and said, &#8220;Tell your Friend (i.e. the Prophet ) to go out, as  the period (agreed to) has passed.&#8221; So, the Prophet went out of Mecca. The daughter  of Hamza ran after them (i.e. the Prophet and his companions), calling, &#8220;O Uncle! O  Uncle!&#8221; &#8216;Ali received her and led her by the hand and said to Fatima, &#8220;Take your  uncle&#8217;s daughter.&#8221; Zaid and Ja&#8217;far quarrel ed about her. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I have more  right to her as she is my uncle&#8217;s daughter.&#8221; Ja&#8217;far said, &#8220;She is my uncle&#8217;s  daughter, and her aunt is my wife.&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;She is my brother&#8217;s  daughter.&#8221; The Prophet judged that she should be given to her aunt, and said that the  aunt was like the mother. He then said to &#8216;All, &#8220;You are from me and I am from  you&#8221;, and said to Ja&#8217;far, &#8220;You resemble me both in character and  appearance&#8221;, and said to Zaid, &#8220;You are our brother (in faith) and our freed  slave.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out for the &#8216;Umra but the pagans of  Quraish prevented him from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba. So, he slaughtered his sacrifice and got  his head shaved at Al-Hudaibiya, and agreed with them that he would perform &#8216;Umra the  following year and would not carry weapons except swords and would not stay in Mecca  except for the period they al lowed. So, the Prophet performed the &#8216;Umra in the following  year and entered Mecca according to the treaty, and when he stayed for three days, the  pagans ordered him to depart, and he departed. </font></p>

So, they went  to the Prophet who ordered them to bring about retaliation. Anas bin An-Nadr asked,  &#8220;O Allah&#8221;; Apostle! Will the tooth of Ar-Rabi&#8217; be broken? No, by Him Who has  sent you with the Truth, her tooth will not be broken.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O  Anas! Allah&#8221;; law ordains retaliation.&#8221; Later the relatives of the girl agreed  and forgave her. The Prophet said, &#8220;There are some of Allah&#8217;s slaves who, if they  take an oath by Allah, are responded to by Allah i.e. their oath is fulfilled). Anas  added, &#8220;The people agreed and accepted the Irsh.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Hasan Al-Basri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, Al-Hasan bin Ali led large battalions like  mountains against Muawiya. Amr bin Al-As said (to Muawiya), &#8220;I surely see battalions  which will not turn back before killing their opponents.&#8221; Muawiya who was really the  best of the two men said to him, &#8220;O &#8216;Amr! If these killed those and those killed  these, who would be left with me for the jobs of the public, who would be left with me for  their women, who would be left with me for their children?&#8221; Then Muawiya sent two  Quraishi men from the tribe of &#8216;Abd-i-Shams called &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Sumura and Abdullah  bin &#8216;Amir bin Kuraiz to Al-Hasan saying to them, &#8220;Go to this man (i.e. Al-Hasan) and  negotiate peace with him and talk and appeal to him.&#8221; So, they went to Al-Hasan and  talked and appealed to him to accept peace. Al-Hasan said, &#8220;We, the offspring of  &#8216;Abdul Muttalib, have got wealth and people have indulged in killing and corruption (and  money only will appease them).&#8221; They said to Al-Hasan, &#8220;Muawiya offers you so  and so, and appeals to you and entreats you to accept peace.&#8221; Al-Hasan said to them,  &#8220;But who will be responsible for what you have said?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will  be responsible for it.&#8221; So, what-ever Al-Hasan asked they said, &#8220;We will be  responsible for it for you.&#8221; So, Al-Hasan concluded a peace treaty with Muawiya.  Al-Hasan (Al-Basri) said: I heard Abu Bakr saying, &#8220;I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the  pulpit and Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali was by his side. The Prophet was looking once at the people  and once at Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali saying, &#8216;This son of mine is a Saiyid (i.e. a noble) and may  Allah make peace between two big groups of Muslims through him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Az-Zubair told me that he quarrelled with an Ansari man who  had participated in (the battle of) Badr in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle about a water stream  which both of them used for irrigation. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to Az-Zubair, &#8220;O Zubair!  Irrigate (your garden) first, and then let the water flow to your neighbor.&#8221; The  Ansari became angry and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is it because he is your  cousin?&#8221; On that the complexion of Allah&#8217;s Apostle changed (because of anger) and  said (to Az-Zubair), &#8220;I irrigate (your garden) and then with-hold the water till it  reaches the walls (surrounding the palms).&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave Az-Zubair his  full right. Before that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had given a generous judgment beneficial for  Az-Zubair and the Ansari, but when the Ansan irritated Allah&#8217;s Apostle he gave Az-Zubair  his full right according to the evident law. Az-Zubair said, &#8220;By Allah !

I suggested that his  creditors take the fruits (i.e. dates) of my garden in lieu of the debt of my father, but  they refused the offer, as they thought that it would not cover the full debt. So, I went  to the Prophet and told him about it. He said (to me), &#8220;When you pluck the dates and  collect them in the Mirbad (i.e. a place where dates are dried), call me (Allah&#8217;s  Apostle).&#8221; Finally he came accompanied by Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar and sat on the dates and  invoked Allah to bless them. Then he said, &#8220;Call your creditors and give them their  full rights.&#8221; So, I paid all my father&#8217;s creditors in full and yet thirteen extra  Wasqs of dates remained, seven of which were &#8216;Ajwa and six were Laun or six of which were  Ajwa and seven were Laun. I met Allah&#8217;s Apostle at sunset and informed him about it. On  that he smiled and said, &#8220;Go to Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar and tell them about it.&#8221; They  said, &#8220;We perceived that was going to happen, as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did what he  did.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr came riding his horse from his dwelling place in As-Sunh. He got down from it, entered the Mosque and did not speak with anybody till he came to me and went direct to the Prophet, who was covered with a marked blanket. Abu Bakr uncovered his face. He knelt down and kissed him and then started weeping and said, &#8220;My father and my mother be sacrificed for you, O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Allah will not combine two deaths on you. You have died the death which was written for you.&#8221;</p>

Abu Bakr said, &#8220;Amma ba&#8217;du, whoever amongst you worshipped Muhammad, then Muhammad is dead, but whoever worshipped Allah, Allah is alive and will never die. Allah said: &#8216;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle and indeed (many) Apostles have passed away before him ..(up to the) grateful.&#8217; &#8221; (3.144) (The narrator added, &#8220;By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that Allah had revealed this verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and then whoever heard it, started reciting it &#8220;)</p>

I testify that Allah has honored you&#8217;. The Prophet said, &#8216;How do you know that Allah has honored him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Let my father be sacrificed for you! On whom else shall Allah bestow His honor?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;No doubt, death came to him. By Allah, I too wish him good, but by Allah, I do not know what Allah will do with me though I am Al lah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8216; By Allah, I never attested the piety of anyone after that.&#8221;</p>

Please give me your shirt to shroud him in it, offer his funeral prayer and ask for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for him.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) gave his shirt to him and said, &#8220;Inform me (When the funeral is ready) so that I may offer the funeral prayer.&#8221; So, he informed him and when the Prophet intended to offer the funeral prayer, &#8216;Umar took hold of his hand and said, &#8220;Has Allah not forbidden you to offer the funeral prayer for the hypocrites? The Prophet said, &#8220;I have been given the choice for Allah says: &#8216;(It does not avail) Whether you (O Muhammad) ask forgiveness for them (hypocrites), or do not ask for forgiveness for them. Even though you ask for their forgiveness seventy times, Allah will not forgive them. (9.80)&#8221; So the Prophet offered the funeral prayer and on that the revelation came: &#8220;And never (O Muhammad) pray (funeral prayer) for any of them (i.e. hypocrites) that dies.&#8221; (9. 84)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We emigrated with the Prophet (p.b.u.h) in Allah&#8217;s cause, and so our reward was then surely incumbent on Allah.

Mustab bin &#8216;Umar was martyred on the day of the Battle of Uhud and we could get nothing except his Burd to shroud him in. And when we covered his head his feet became bare and vice versa.

So he came out wearing it as his waist-sheet. A man praised it and said, &#8220;Will you give it to me? How nice it is!&#8221; The other people said, &#8220;You have not done the right thing as the Prophet is in need of it and you have asked for it when you know that he never turns down anybody&#8217;s request.&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;By Allah, I have not asked for it to wear it but to make it my shroud.&#8221; Later it was his shroud.</p>

The Prophet got up, and so did Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, Muadh bin Jabal, Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b, Zaid bin Thabit and some other men. The child was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle while his breath was disturbed in his chest (the sub-narrator thinks that Usama added: ) as if it was a leather water-skin. On that the eyes of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) started shedding tears. Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the daughters of &#8216;Uthman died at Mecca. We went to attend her funeral procession. Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn Abbas were also present. I sat in between them (or said, I sat beside one of them. Then a man came and sat beside me.) &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said to &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Uthman, &#8220;Will you not prohibit crying as Allah&#8217;s Apostle has said, &#8216;The dead person is tortured by the crying of his relatives.?&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;Umar used to say so.&#8221; Then he added narrating, &#8220;I accompanied Umar on a journey from Mecca till we reached Al-Baida. There he saw some travelers in the shade of a Samura (A kind of forest tree). He said (to me), &#8220;Go and see who those travelers are.&#8221; So I went and saw that one of them was Suhaib. I told this to &#8216;Umar who then asked me to call him. So I went back to Suhaib and said to him, &#8220;Depart and follow the chief of the faithful believers.&#8221; Later, when &#8216;Umar was stabbed, Suhaib came in weeping and saying, &#8220;O my brother, O my friend!&#8221; (on this &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;O Suhaib! Are you weeping for me while the Prophet said, &#8220;The dead person is punished by some of the weeping of his relatives?&#8221; Ibn Abbas added, &#8220;When &#8216;Umar died I told all this to Aisha and she said, &#8216;May Allah be merciful to Umar. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not say that a believer is punished by the weeping of his relatives. But he said, Allah increases the punishment of a non-believer because of the weeping of his relatives.&#8221; Aisha further added, &#8220;The Quran is sufficient for you (to clear up this point) as Allah has stated: &#8216;No burdened soul will bear another&#8217;s burden.&#8217; &#8221; (35.18). Ibn Abbas then said, &#8220;Only Allah makes one laugh or cry.&#8221; Ibn Umar did not say anything after that.</p>

Should I give two-thirds of my property in charity?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Half?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; then he added, &#8216;One-third, and even one-third is much. You&#8217;d better leave your inheritors wealthy rather than leaving them poor, begging others. You will get a reward for whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s sake, even for what you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will I be left alone after my companions have gone?&#8217; He said, &#8216;If you are left behind, whatever good deeds you will do will up-grade you and raise you high. And perhaps you will have a long life so that some people will be benefited by you while others will be harmed by you. O Allah! Complete the emigration of my companions and do not turn them renegades.&#8217; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle felt sorry for poor Sad bin Khaula as he died in Mecca.&#8221; (but Sad bin Abi Waqqas lived long after the Prophet (p.b.u.h).)</p>

Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty and did not notice (us) until the Prophet stroked him with his hand and said to him, &#8220;Do you testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, &#8220;I testify that you are the Messenger of illiterates.&#8221; Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet (p.b.u.h), &#8220;Do you testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) refuted it and said, &#8220;I believe in Allah and His Apostles.&#8221; Then he said (to Ibn Saiyad), &#8220;What do you think?&#8221; Ibn Saiyad answered, &#8220;True people and liars visit me.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You have been confused as to this matter.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to him, &#8220;I have kept something (in my mind) for you, (can you tell me that?)&#8221; Ibn Saiyad said, &#8220;It is Al-Dukh (the smoke).&#8221; (2) The Prophet said, &#8220;Let you be in ignominy. You cannot cross your limits.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar, said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off.&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;If he is he (i.e. Dajjal), then you cannot over-power him, and if he is not, then there is no use of murdering him.&#8221; (Ibn &#8216;Umar added): Later on Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) once again went along with Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b to the date-palm trees (garden) where Ibn Saiyad was staying. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) wanted to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before Ibn Saiyad could see him, and the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw him lying covered with a sheet and from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palm trees. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, &#8220;O Saf ! (and this was the name of Ibn Saiyad) Here is Muhammad.&#8221; And with that Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, &#8220;Had this woman left him (Had she not disturbed him), then Ibn Saiyad would have revealed the reality of his case.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A young Jewish boy used to serve the Prophet and he became sick. So the Prophet went to visit him. He sat near his head and asked him to embrace Islam.

The Prophet came out saying: &#8220;Praises be to Allah Who saved the boy from the Hell-fire.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The funeral prayer should be offered for every child even if he were the son of a prostitute as he was born with a true faith of Islam (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone). If his parents are Muslims, particularly the father, even if his mother were a non-Muslim, and if he after the delivery cries (even once) before his death (i.e. born alive) then the funeral prayer must be offered. And if the child does not cry after his delivery (i.e. born dead) then his funeral prayer should not be offered, and he will be considered as a miscarriage. Abu Huraira, narrated that the Prophet said, &#8220;Every child is born with a true faith (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone) but his parents convert him to Judaism or to Christianity or to Magainism, as an animal delivers a perfect baby animal. Do you find it mutilated?&#8221; Then Abu Huraira recited the holy verses: &#8216;The pure Allah&#8217;s Islamic nature (true faith i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone), with which He has created human beings.&#8217; &#8221; (30.30).</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to Abu Talib, &#8220;O uncle! Say: None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, a sentence with which I shall be a witness (i.e. argue) for you before Allah. Abu Jahl and &#8216;Abdullah bin Abi Umaiya said, &#8220;O Abu Talib! Are you going to denounce the religion of Abdul Muttalib?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept on inviting Abu Talib to say it (i.e. &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah&#8217;) while they (Abu Jahl and Abdullah) kept on repeating their statement till Abu Talib said as his last statement that he was on the religion of Abdul Muttalib and refused to say, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah.&#8217; (Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I will keep on asking Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden (by Allah) to do so.&#8221; So Allah revealed (the verse) concerning him (i.e. It is not fitting for the Prophet and those who believe that they should invoke (Allah) for forgiveness for pagans even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are companions of the fire (9.113).</p>

He then took a green leaf of a date-palm tree split it into two pieces and fixed one on each grave. The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

Should we not depend on what has been written for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us is blessed will do the deeds of a blessed person and whoever amongst us will be wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made easy for the wretched.&#8221; Then he recited the Verses:&#8211; &#8220;As for him who gives (in charity) and is Allah-fearing And believes in the Best reward from Allah. &#8221; (92.5-6)</p>

Go away from me.&#8221; When I talked too much he said, &#8220;I have been given the choice and so I have chosen (to offer the prayer).

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Samura bin Jundab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet finished the (morning) prayer, he would face us and ask, &#8220;Who amongst you had a dream last night?&#8221; So if anyone had seen a dream he would narrate it. The Prophet would say: &#8220;Ma sha&#8217;a-llah&#8221; (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, &#8216;What Allah wished,&#8217; and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet said, &#8220;But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jaw-bone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the mean-time the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the Lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), &#8216;You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen.&#8217; They said, &#8216;Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of Quran (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the gate-keeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head.&#8217; I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, &#8216;That is your place.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Let me enter my place.&#8217; They said, &#8216;You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and when you complete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then enter your place.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 469:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hisham&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said, &#8220;I went to Abu Bakr (during his fatal illness) and he asked me, &#8216;In how many garments was the Prophet shrouded?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;In three Sahuliya pieces of white cloth of cotton, and there was neither a shirt nor a turban among them.&#8217; Abu Bakr further asked her, &#8216;On which day did the Prophet die?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;He died on Monday.&#8217; He asked, &#8216;What is today?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Today is Monday.&#8217; He added, &#8216;I hope I shall die sometime between this morning and tonight.&#8217; Then he looked at a garment that he was wearing during his illness and it had some stains of saffron. Then he said, &#8216;Wash this garment of mine and add two more garments and shroud me in them.&#8217; I said, &#8216;This is worn out.&#8217; He said, &#8216;A living person has more right to wear new clothes than a dead one; the shroud is only for the body&#8217;s pus.&#8217; He did not die till it was the night of Tuesday and was buried before the morning.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 470:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said to the Prophet (p.b.u.h), &#8220;My mother died suddenly and I thought that if she had lived she would have given alms. So, if I give alms now on her behalf, will she get the reward?&#8221; The Prophet replied in the affirmative.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 471:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During his sickness, Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asking repeatedly, &#8220;Where am I today? Where will I be tomorrow?&#8221; And I was waiting for the day of my turn (impatiently). Then, when my turn came, Allah took his soul away (in my lap) between my chest and arms and he was buried in my house.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 472:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle in his fatal illness said, &#8220;Allah cursed the Jews and the Christians, for they built the places of worship at the graves of their prophets.&#8221; And if that had not been the case, then the Prophet&#8217;s grave would have been made prominent before the people. So (the Prophet ) was afraid, or the people were afraid that his grave might be taken as a place for worship.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 473:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakr bin &#8216;Aiyash :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyan At-Tammar told me that he had seen the grave of the Prophet elevated and convex.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 474:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the wall fell on them (i.e. graves) during the caliphate of Al-Walid bin &#8216;Abdul Malik, the people started repairing it, and a foot appeared to them. The people got scared and thought that it was the foot of the Prophet. No-one could be found who could tell them about it till I (&#8216;Urwa) said to them, &#8220;By Allah, this is not the foot of the Prophet but it is the foot of Umar.&#8221; Aisha narrated that she made a will to &#8216;Abdullah bin Zubair, &#8220;Do not bury me with them (the Prophet and his two companions) but bury me with my companions (wives of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) in Al-Baqi as I would not like to be looked upon as better than I really am (by being buried near the Prophet).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 475:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Maimun Al-Audi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (when he was stabbed) saying, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar! Go to the mother of the believers Aisha and say, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab sends his greetings to you,&#8217; and request her to allow me to be buried with my companions.&#8221; (So, Ibn &#8216;Umar conveyed the message to &#8216;Aisha.) She said, &#8220;I had the idea of having this place for myself but today I prefer him (&#8216;Umar) to myself (and allow him to be buried there).&#8221; When &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar returned, &#8216;Umar asked him, &#8220;What (news) do you have?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O chief of the believers! She has allowed you (to be buried there).&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Nothing was more important to me than to be buried in that (sacred) place. So, when I expire, carry me there and pay my greetings to her (&#8216;Aisha ) and say, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks permission; and if she gives permission, then bury me (there) and if she does not, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims. I do not think any person has more right for the caliphate than those with whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) was always pleased till his death. And whoever is chosen by the people after me will be the caliph, and you people must listen to him and obey him,&#8221; and then he mentioned the name of &#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Ali, Talha, Az-Zubair, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf and Sad bin Abi Waqqas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this time a young man from Ansar came and said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Be happy with Allah&#8217;s glad tidings. The grade which you have in Islam is known to you, then you became the caliph and you ruled with justice and then you have been awarded martyrdom after all this.&#8221; &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;O son of my brother! Would that all that privileges will counterbalance (my short comings), so that I neither lose nor gain anything. I recommend my successor to be good to the early emigrants and realize their rights and to protect their honor and sacred things. And I also recommend him to be good to the Ansar who before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith. He should accept the good of the righteous among them and should excuse their wrongdoers. I recommend him to abide by the rules and regulations concerning the Dhimmis (protectees) of Allah and His Apostle, to fulfill their contracts completely and fight for them and not to tax (overburden) them beyond their capabilities.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 476:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t abuse the dead, because they have reached the result of what they forwarded.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 477:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas.:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Lahab, may Allah curse him, once said to the Prophet (p.b.u.h), &#8220;Perish you all the day.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Divine Inspiration came: &#8220;Perish the hands of Abi Lahab! And perish he!&#8221; (111.1).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 478:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thy Prophet sent Muadh to Yemen and said, &#8220;Invite the people to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that Allah has enjoined on them five prayers in every day and night (in twenty-four hours), and if they obey you to do so, then teach them that Allah has made it obligatory for them to pay the Zakat from their property and it is to be taken from the wealthy among them and given to the poor.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 479:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Aiyub:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said to the Prophet &#8220;Tell me of such a deed as will make me enter Paradise.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;What is the matter with him? What is the matter with him?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;He has something to ask. (What he needs greatly) The Prophet said: (In order to enter Paradise) you should worship Allah and do not ascribe any partners to Him, offer prayer perfectly, pay the Zakat and keep good relations with your Kith and kin.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 12, Vol 8).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 480:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Bedouin came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;Tell me of such a deed as will make me enter Paradise, if I do it.&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Worship Allah, and worship none along with Him, offer the (five) prescribed compulsory prayers perfectly, pay the compulsory Zakat, and fast the month of Ramadan.&#8221; The Bedouin said, &#8220;By Him, in Whose Hands my life is, I will not do more than this.&#8221; When he (the Bedouin) left, the Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever likes to see a man of Paradise, then he may look at this man.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 481:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Zur&#8217;a:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">from the Prophet the same as above.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 482:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A delegation of the tribe of &#8216;Abdul Qais came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are from the tribe of Rabi&#8217;a, and the infidels of the tribe of Mudar stands between us and you; so we cannot come to you except during the Sacred Months. Please order us to do something (religious deeds) which we may carry out and also invite to it our people whom we have left behind.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I order you to do four things and forbid you four others: (I order you) to have faith in Allah, and confess that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, (and the Prophet gestured with his hand like this (i.e. one knot) and to offer prayers perfectly and to pay the Zakat, and to pay one-fifth of the booty in Allah&#8217;s Cause. And I forbid you to use Dubba&#8217;, Hantam, Naqir and Muzaffat (all these are the names of utensils used for preparing alcoholic drinks).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 483:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and Abu Bakr became the caliph some Arabs renegade (reverted to disbelief) (Abu Bakr decided to declare war against them), &#8216;Umar, said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;How can you fight with these people although Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;I have been ordered (by Allah) to fight the people till they say: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and whoever said it then he will save his life and property from me except on trespassing the law (rights and conditions for which he will be punished justly), and his accounts will be with Allah.&#8217; &#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah! I will fight those who differentiate between the prayer and the Zakat as Zakat is the compulsory right to be taken from the property (according to Allah&#8217;s orders) By Allah! If they refuse to pay me even a she-kid which they used to pay at the time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . I would fight with them for withholding it&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;By Allah, it was nothing, but Allah opened Abu Bakr&#8217;s chest towards the decision (to fight) and I came to know that his decision was right.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Oppressions</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.043.620"></a>Volume 3, Book 43, Number 620:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When the believers pass safely over (the bridge across) Hell, they will be stopped at a bridge in between Hell and Paradise where they will retaliate upon each other for the injustices done among them in the world, and when they get purified of all their sins, they will be admitted into Paradise. By Him in Whose Hands the life of Muhammad is everybody will recognize his dwelling in Paradise better than he recognizes his dwelling in this world.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 621:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin Muhriz Almazini:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was walking with Ibn &#8216;Umar holding his hand, a man came in front of us and asked, &#8220;What have you heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle about An-Najwa?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Allah will bring a believer near Him and shelter him with His Screen and ask him: Did you commit such-and-such sins? He will say: Yes, my Lord. Allah will keep on asking him till he will confess all his sins and will think that he is ruined. Allah will say: &#8216;I did screen your sins in the world and I forgive them for you today&#8217;, and then he will be given the book of his good deeds. Regarding infidels and hypocrites (their evil acts will be exposed publicly) and the witnesses will say: These are the people who lied against their Lord. Behold! The Curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers.&#8221; (11.18)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A Muslim is a brother of another Muslim, so he should not oppress him, nor should he hand him over to an oppressor. Whoever fulfilled the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfill his needs; whoever brought his (Muslim) brother out of a discomfort, Allah will bring him out of the discomforts of the Day of Resurrection, and whoever screened a Muslim, Allah will screen him on the Day of Resurrection . &#8220;</p>

It is all right to help him if he is oppressed, but how should we help him if he is an oppressor?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;By preventing him from oppressing others.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) to follow funeral processions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) to say to a sneezer, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to you&#8221; (if he says, &#8220;Praise be to Allah!&#8221;),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) to return greetings,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) to help the oppressed,</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the explanation of the following verse:&#8211; &#8220;If a wife fears Cruelty or desertion On her husband&#8217;s part.&#8221; (4.128) A man may dislike his wife and intend to divorce her, so she says to him, &#8220;I give up my rights, so do not divorce me.&#8221; The above verse was revealed concerning such a case.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We were in Medina with some of the Iraqi people, and we were struck with famine and Ibn Az-Zubair used to give us dates.

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 636:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Mas&#8217;ud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was an Ansari man called Abu Shu&#8217;aib who had a slave butcher. Abu Shu&#8217;aib said to him, &#8220;Prepare a meal sufficient for five persons so that I might invite the Prophet besides other four persons.&#8221; Abu Shu&#8217;aib had seen the signs of hunger on the face of the Prophet and so he invited him. Another man who was not invited, followed the Prophet. The Prophet said to Abu Shu&#8217;aib, &#8220;This man has followed us.

He came out and said, &#8220;I am only a human being, and opponents come to me (to settle their problems); maybe someone amongst you can present his case more eloquently than the other, whereby I may consider him true and give a verdict in his favor. So, If I give the right of a Muslim to another by mistake, then it is really a portion of (Hell) Fire, he has the option to take or give up (before the Day of Resurrection).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 639:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Hind bint &#8216;Utba (Abu Sufyan&#8217;s wife) came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Sufyan is a miser.

<p style="text-align:justify;">We staid to the Prophet, &#8220;You send us out and it happens that we have to stay with such people as do not entertain us. What do you think about it? He said to us, &#8220;If you stay with some people and they entertain you as they should for a guest, accept their hospitality, but If they don&#8217;t do, take the right of the guest from them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 642:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah took away the soul of His Prophet at his death, the Ansar assembled In the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;ida. I said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Let us go.&#8221; So, we come to them (i.e. to Ansar) at the shed of Bani Sa&#8217;ida. (See Hadith No. 19, Vol. 5 for details)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 643:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Araj:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Huraira said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;No-one should prevent his neighbor from fixing a wooden peg in his wall.&#8221; Abu Huraira said (to his companions), &#8220;Why do I find you averse to it? By Allah, I certainly will narrate it to you.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 644:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was the butler of the people in the house of Abu Talha, and in those days drinks were prepared from dates. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered somebody to announce that alcoholic drinks had been prohibited. Abu Talha ordered me to go out and spill the wine. I went out and spilled it, and it flowed in the streets of Medina. Some people said, &#8220;Some people were killed and wine was still in their stomachs.&#8221; On that the Divine revelation came:&#8211; &#8220;On those who believe And do good deeds There is no blame For what they ate (in the past).&#8221; (5.93)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Beware! Avoid sitting on he roads (ways).&#8221; The people said, &#8220;There is no way out of it as these are our sitting places where we have talks.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you must sit there, then observe the rights of the way.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;What are the rights of the way?&#8221; He said, &#8220;They are the lowering of your gazes (on seeing what is illegal to look at), refraining from harming people, returning greetings, advocating good and forbidding evil.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 646:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;A man felt very thirsty while he was on the way, there he came across a well. He went down the well, quenched his thirst and came out. Meanwhile he saw a dog panting and licking mud because of excessive thirst. He said to himself, &#8220;This dog is suffering from thirst as I did.&#8221; So, he went down the well again and filled his shoe with water and watered it. Allah thanked him for that deed and forgave him. The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving the animals?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Yes, there is a reward for serving any animate (living being).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 551)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 647:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama bin Zaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet stood at the top of one of the castles (or higher buildings) of Medina and said, &#8220;Do you see what I see? No doubt I am seeing the spots of afflictions amongst your houses as numerous as the spots where rain-drops fall (during a heavy rain). (See Hadith No. 102)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 648:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had been eager to ask &#8216;Umar about the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said (in the Qur&#8217;an saying): If you two (wives of the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes) (66.4), till performed the Hajj along with &#8216;Umar (and on our way back from Hajj) he went aside (to answer the call of nature) and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler of water. When he had answered the call of nature and returned. I poured water on his hands from the tumbler and he performed ablution. I said, &#8220;O Chief of the believers! &#8216; Who were the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet to whom Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If you two return in repentance (66.4)? He said, &#8220;I am astonished at your question, O Ibn &#8216;Abbas. They were Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then &#8216;Umar went on relating the narration and said. &#8220;I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live in &#8216;Awali Al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turns. He used to go one day, and I another day. When I went I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the instructions and orders and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of Quraish, used to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the Ansar, we noticed that the Ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so our women started acquiring the habits of the Ansari women. Once I shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said, &#8216;Why do you take it ill that I retort upon you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet retort upon him, and some of them may not speak with him for the whole day till night.&#8217; What she said scared me and I said to her, &#8216;Whoever amongst them does so, will be a great loser.&#8217; Then I dressed myself and went to Hafsa and asked her, &#8216;Does any of you keep Allah&#8217;s Apostle angry all the day long till night?&#8217; She replied in the affirmative. I said, &#8216;She is a ruined losing person (and will never have success)! Doesn&#8217;t she fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and thus she will be ruined? Don&#8217;t ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle too many things, and don&#8217;t retort upon him in any case, and don&#8217;t desert him. Demand from me whatever you like, and don&#8217;t be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) in her behavior towards the Prophet), for she (i.e. Aisha) is more beautiful than you, and more beloved to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In those days it was rumored that Ghassan, (a tribe living in Sham) was getting prepared their horses to invade us. My companion went (to the Prophet on the day of his turn, went and returned to us at night and knocked at my door violently, asking whether I was sleeping. I was scared (by the hard knocking) and came out to him. He said that a great thing had happened. I asked him: What is it? Have Ghassan come? He replied that it was worse and more serious than that, and added that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had divorced all his wives. I said, Hafsa is a ruined loser! I expected that would happen some day.&#8217; So I dressed myself and offered the Fajr prayer with the Prophet. Then the Prophet entered an upper room and stayed there alone. I went to Hafsa and found her weeping. I asked her, &#8216;Why are you weeping? Didn&#8217;t I warn you? Have Allah&#8217;s Apostle divorced you all?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know. He is there in the upper room.&#8217; I then went out and came to the pulpit and found a group of people around it and some of them were weeping. Then I sat with them for some time, but could not endure the situation. So I went to the upper room where the Prophet was and requested to a black slave of his: &#8220;Will you get the permission of (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) for Umar (to enter)? The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and came out saying, &#8216;I mentioned you to him but he did not reply.&#8217; So, I went and sat with the people who were sitting by the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, so I went to the slave again and said: &#8220;Will you get he permission for Umar? He went in and brought the same reply as before. When I was leaving, behold, the slave called me saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has granted you permission.&#8221; So, I entered upon the Prophet and saw him lying on a mat without wedding on it, and the mat had left its mark on the body of the Prophet, and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing, I said: &#8220;Have you divorced your wives?&#8217; He raised his eyes to me and replied in the negative. And then while still standing, I said chatting: &#8220;Will you heed what I say, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our women (wives), and when we came to the people whose women had the upper hand over them&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar told the whole story (about his wife). &#8220;On that the Prophet smiled.&#8221; &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;I then said, &#8216;I went to Hafsa and said to her: Do not be tempted to imitate your companion (&#8216;Aisha) for she is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Prophet.&#8217; The Prophet smiled again. When I saw him smiling, I sat down and cast a glance at the room, and by Allah, I couldn&#8217;t see anything of importance but three hides. I said (to Allah&#8217;s Apostle) &#8220;Invoke Allah to make your followers prosperous for the Persians and the Byzantines have been made prosperous and given worldly luxuries, though they do not worship Allah?&#8217; The Prophet was leaning then (and on hearing my speech he sat straight) and said, &#8216;O Ibn Al-Khatttab! Do you have any doubt (that the Hereafter is better than this world)? These people have been given rewards of their good deeds in this world only.&#8217; I asked the Prophet . &#8216;Please ask Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for me. The Prophet did not go to his wives because of the secret which Hafsa had disclosed to &#8216;Aisha, and he said that he would not go to his wives for one month as he was angry with them when Allah admonished him (for his oath that he would not approach Maria). When twenty-nine days had passed, the Prophet went to Aisha first of all. She said to him, &#8216;You took an oath that you would not come to us for one month, and today only twenty-nine days have passed, as I have been counting them day by day.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;The month is also of twenty-nine days.&#8217; That month consisted of twenty-nine days. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;When the Divine revelation of Choice was revealed, the Prophet started with me, saying to me, &#8216;I am telling you something, but you needn&#8217;t hurry to give the reply till you can consult your parents.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha knew that her parents would not advise her to part with the Prophet . The Prophet said that Allah had said:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O Prophet! Say To your wives; If you desire The life of this world And its glitter, &#8230; then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free In a handsome manner. But if you seek Allah And His Apostle, and The Home of the Hereafter, then Verily, Allah has prepared For the good-doers amongst you A great reward.&#8217; (33.28) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;Am I to consult my parents about this? I indeed prefer Allah, His Apostle, and the Home of the Hereafter.&#8217; After that the Prophet gave the choice to his other wives and they also gave the same reply as &#8216;Aisha did.&#8221;</p>

Do not let him die until he sees the faces of prostitutes.&#8221; Juraij used to live in a hermitage. A woman said that she would entice Juraij, so she went to him and presented herself (for an evil act) but he refused. She then went to a shepherd and allowed him to commit an illegal sexual intercourse with her and later she gave birth to a boy. She alleged that the baby was from Juraij. The people went to Juraij and broke down his hermitage, pulled him out of it and abused him. He performed ablution and offered the prayer, then he went to the male (baby) and asked him; &#8220;O boy! Who is your father?&#8221; The baby replied that his father was the shepherd. The people said that they would build for him a hermitage of gold but Juraij asked them to make it of mud only.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Prayer at Night (Tahajjud)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.021.221"></a>Volume 2, Book 21, Number 221:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet got up at night to offer the Tahajjud prayer, he used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allahumma lakal-hamd. Anta qaiyimus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Walakal-hamd, Laka mulkus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Walakal-hamd, anta nurus-samawati wal-ard. Walakalhamd, anta-l-haq wa wa&#8217;duka-l-haq, wa liqa&#8217;uka Haq, wa qualuka Haq, wal-jannatu Haq wan-naru Haq wannabiyuna Haq. Wa Muhammadun, sallal-lahu&#8217;alaihi wasallam, Haq, was-sa&#8217;atu Haq. Allahumma aslamtu Laka wabika amantu, wa &#8216;Alaika tawakkaltu, wa ilaika anabtu wa bika khasamtu, wa ilaika hakamtu faghfir li ma qaddamtu wama akh-khartu wama as-rartu wama&#8217;a lantu, anta-l-muqaddim wa anta-l-mu akh-khir, la ilaha illa anta (or la ilaha ghairuka).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah! All the praises are for you, You are the Holder of the Heavens and the Earth, And whatever is in them. All the praises are for You; You have the possession of the Heavens and the Earth And whatever is in them. All the praises are for You; You are the Light of the Heavens and the Earth And all the praises are for You; You are the King of the Heavens and the Earth; And all the praises are for You; You are the Truth and Your Promise is the truth, And to meet You is true, Your Word is the truth And Paradise is true And Hell is true And all the Prophets (Peace be upon them) are true; And Muhammad is true, And the Day of Resurrection is true. O Allah ! I surrender (my will) to You; I believe in You and depend on You. And repent to You, And with Your help I argue (with my opponents, the non-believers) And I take You as a judge (to judge between us). Please forgive me my previous And future sins; And whatever I concealed or revealed And You are the One who make (some people) forward And (some) backward. There is none to be worshipped but you . Sufyan said that &#8216;Abdul Karim Abu Umaiya added to the above, &#8216;Wala haula Wala quwata illa billah&#8217; (There is neither might nor power except with Allah).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 222:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of the Prophet whosoever saw a dream would narrate it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. I had a wish of seeing a dream to narrate it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) I was a grown up boy and used to sleep in the Mosque in the life-time of the Prophet. I saw in the dream that two angels caught hold of me and took me to the Fire which was built all round like a built well and had two poles in it and the people in it were known to me. I started saying, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the Fire.&#8221; Then I met another angel who told me not to be afraid. I narrated the dream to Hafsa who told it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.

I said, &#8216;Where (did he pray)?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(He prayed) Between these two pillars and then he came out and offered a two Rakat prayer in front of the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8217; &#8221; Abu &#8216;Abdullah said: Abu Huraira said, &#8220;The Prophet (p.b.u.h) advised me to offer two Rakat of Duha prayer (prayer to be offered after sunrise and before midday). &#8221; Itban (bin Malik) said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amir Al-Juhani and said, &#8220;Is it not surprising that Abi Tamim offers two Rakat before the Maghrib prayer?&#8221; &#8216;Uqba said, &#8220;We used to do so in the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; I asked him, &#8220;What prevents you from offering it now?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Business.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 279:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mahmud bin Ar-rabi&#8217; Al-Ansari,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he remembered Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he also remembered a mouthful of water which he had thrown on his face, after taking it from a well that was in their house. Mahmud said that he had heard Itban bin Malik, who was present with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the battle of Badr saying, &#8220;I used to lead my people at Bani Salim in the prayer and there was a valley between me and those people. Whenever it rained it used to be difficult for me to cross it to go to their mosque. So I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;I have weak eye-sight and the valley between me and my people flows during the rainy season and it becomes difficult for me to cross it; I wish you would come to my house and pray at a place so that I could take that place as a praying place.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;I will do so.&#8217; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr came to my house in the (next) morning after the sun had risen high. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked my permission to let him in and I admitted him. He did not sit before saying, &#8216;Where do you want us to offer the prayer in your house?&#8217; I pointed to the place where I wanted him to pray. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up for the prayer and started the prayer with Takbir and we aligned in rows behind him; and he offered two Rakat, and finished them with Taslim, and we also performed Taslim with him. I detained him for a meal called &#8220;Khazir&#8221; which I had prepared for him.&#8211;(&#8220;Khazir&#8221; is a special type of dish prepared from barley flour and meat soup)&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the neighbors got the news that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in my house, they poured it till there were a great number of men in the house. One of them said, &#8216;What is wrong with Malik, for I do not see him?&#8217; One of them replied, &#8216;He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His Apostle.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t say this. Haven&#8217;t you seen that he said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah for Allah&#8217;s sake only.&#8217; The man replied, &#8216;Allah and His Apostle know better; but by Allah, we never saw him but helping and talking with the hypocrites.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8216;No doubt, whoever says. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and by that he wants the pleasures of Allah, then Allah will save him from Hell.&#8221; Mahmud added, &#8220;I told the above narration to some people, one of whom was Ab-u Aiyub, the companion of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the battle in which he (Ab-u Aiyub) died and Yazid bin Mu&#8217;aw7ya was their leader in Roman Territory. Abu Aiyub denounced the narration and said, &#8216;I doubt that Allah&#8217;s Apostle ever said what you have said.&#8217; I felt that too much, and I vowed to Allah that if I remained alive in that holy battle, I would (go to Medina and) ask Itban bin Malik if he was still living in the mosque of his people. So when he returned, I assumed Ihram for Hajj or &#8216;Umra and then I proceeded on till I reached Medina. I went to Bani Salim and Itban bin Malik, who was by then an old blind man, was leading his people in the prayer. When he finished the prayer, I greeted him and introduced myself to him and then asked him about that narration. He told that narration again in the same manner as he had narrated it the first time.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.484">Volume 2, Book 24, Number 484: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jarir bin &#8216;Abdullah , </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet for offering  prayer perfectly giving Zakat and giving good advice to every Muslim. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 485: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;(On the Day of Resurrection) camels  will come to their owner in the best state of health they have ever had (in the world),  and if he had not paid their Zakat (in the world) then they would tread him with their  feet; and similarly, sheep will come to their owner in the best state of health they have  ever had in the world, and if he had not paid their Zakat, then they would tread him with  their hooves and would butt him with their horns.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;One of  their rights is that they should be milked while water is kept in front of them.&#8221; The  Prophet added, &#8220;I do not want anyone of you to come to me on the Day of Resurrection,  carrying over his neck a sheep that will be bleating. Such a person will (then) say, &#8216;O  Muhammad! (please intercede for me,) I will say to him. &#8216;I can&#8217;t help you, for I conveyed  Allah&#8217;s Message to you.&#8217; Similarly, I do not want anyone of you to come to me carrying  over his neck a camel that will be grunting. Such a person (then) will say &#8220;O  Muhammad! (please intercede for me).&#8221; I will say to him, &#8220;I can&#8217;t help you for I  conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 486: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever is made wealthy by  Allah and does not pay the Zakat of his wealth, then on the Day of Resurrection his wealth  will be made like a bald-headed poisonous male snake with two black spots over the eyes.  The snake will encircle his neck and bite his cheeks and say, &#8216;I am your wealth, I am your  treasure.&#8217; &#8221; Then the Prophet recited the holy verses:&#8211; &#8216;Let not those who withhold  . . .&#8217; (to the end of the verse). (3.180). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;No Zakat is due on  property mounting to less than five Uqiyas (of silver), and no Zakat is due on less than  five camels, and there is no Zakat on less than five Wasqs.&#8221; (A Wasqs equals 60 Sa&#8217;s)  &amp; (1 Sa=3 K gms App.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 488: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Wahab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I passed by a place called Ar-Rabadha and by chance I met  Abu Dhar and asked him, &#8220;What has brought you to this place?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I  was in Sham and differed with Muawiya on the meaning of (the following verses of the  Quran): &#8216;They who hoard up gold and silver and spend them not in the way of Allah.&#8217;  (9.34). Muawiya said, &#8216;This verse is revealed regarding the people of the  scriptures.&#8221; I said, It was revealed regarding us and also the people of the  scriptures.&#8221; So we had a quarrel and Mu&#8217;awiya sent a complaint against me to &#8216;Uthman.  &#8216;Uthman wrote to me to come to Medina, and I came to Medina. Many people came to me as if  they had not seen me before. So I told this to &#8216;Uthman who said to me, &#8220;You may  depart and live nearby if you wish.&#8221; That was the reason for my being here for even  if an Ethiopian had been nominated as my ruler, I would have obeyed him . </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.489"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 489: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Ahnaf bin Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was sitting with some people from Quraish, a man  with very rough hair, clothes, and appearance came and stood in front of us, greeted us  and said, &#8220;Inform those who hoard wealth, that a stone will be heated in the  Hell-fire and will be put on the nipples of their breasts till it comes out from the bones  of their shoulders and then put on the bones of their shoulders till it comes through the  nipples of their breasts the stone will be moving and hitting.&#8221; After saying that,  the person retreated and sat by the side of the pillar, I followed him and sat beside him,  and I did not know who he was. I said to him, &#8220;I think the people disliked what you  had said.&#8221; He said, &#8220;These people do not understand anything, although my friend  told me.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Who is your friend?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The Prophet said  (to me), &#8216;O Abu Dhar! Do you see the mountain of Uhud?&#8217; And on that I (Abu Dhar) started  looking towards the sun to judge how much remained of the day as I thought that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle wanted to send me to do something for him and I said, &#8216;Yes!&#8217; He said, &#8216;I do not  love to have gold equal to the mountain of Uhud unless I spend it all (in Allah&#8217;s cause)  except three Dinars (pounds). These people do not understand and collect worldly wealth.  No, by Allah, Neither I ask them for worldly benefits nor am I in need of their religious  advice till I meet Allah, The Honorable, The Majestic.&#8221; &#8216; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.490"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 490: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Masud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;There is no envy except  in two: a person whom Allah has given wealth and he spends it in the right way, and a  person whom Allah has given wisdom (i.e. religious knowledge) and he gives his decisions  accordingly and teaches it to the others.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.491"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 491: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If one give in charity what  equals one date-fruit fro the honestly-earned money and Allah accepts only the honestly  earned money &#8211;Allah takes it in His right (hand) ar then enlarges its reward for that  person (who has given it), as anyone of you brings up his baby horse, so much s that it  becomes as big as a mountain </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 492: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Haritha bin Wahab : </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;O people! Give in charity  as a time will come upon you when a person will wander about with his object of charity  and will not find anybody to accept it, and one (who will be requested to take it) will  say, &#8220;If you had brought it yesterday, would have taken it, but to-day I am not in  need of it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 493: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not  be established till your wealth increases so much so that one will be worried, for no one  will accept his Zakat and the person to whom he will give it will reply, &#8216;I am not in need  of it.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.494"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 494: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was sitting with Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) two  person came to him; one of them complained about his poverty and the other complained  about the prevalence of robberies. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;As regards stealing and  robberies, there will shortly come a time when a caravan will go to Mecca (from Medina)  without any guard. And regarding poverty, The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not be  established till one of you wanders about with his object of charity and will not find  anybody to accept it And (no doubt) each one of you will stand in front of Allah and there  will be neither a curtain nor an interpreter between him and Allah, and Allah will ask  him, &#8216;Did not I give you wealth?&#8217; He will reply in the affirmative. Allah will further  ask, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I send a messenger to you?&#8217; And again that person will reply in the  affirmative Then he will look to his right and he will see nothing but Hell-fire, and then  he will look to his left and will see nothing but Hell-fire. And so, any (each one) of you  should save himself from the fire even by giving half of a date-fruit (in charity). And if  you do not find a half date-fruit, then (you can do it through saying) a good pleasant  word (to your brethren). (See Hadith No. 793 Vol. 4). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 495: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Thy Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;A time will come upon the  people when a person will wander about with gold as Zakat and will not find anybody to  accept it, and one man will be seen followed by forty women to be their guardian because  of scarcity of men and great number of women. &#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.496"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 496: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Masud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the verses of charity were revealed, we used to work  as porters. A man came and distributed objects of charity in abundance. And they (the  people) said, &#8220;He is showing off.&#8221; And another man came and gave a sa (a small  measure of food grains); they said, &#8220;Allah is not in need of this small amount of  charity.&#8221; And then the Divine Inspiration came: &#8220;Those who criticize such of the  believers who give in charity voluntarily and those who could not find to give in charity  except what is available to them.&#8221; (9.79). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 497: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Masud Al-Ansar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) ordered us to give in  charity, we used to go to the market and work as porters and get a Mudd (a special measure  of grain) and then give it in charity. (Those were the days of poverty) and to-day some of  us have one hundred thousand. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.498"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 498: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim heard the Prophet saying: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;Save yourself from Hell-fire even by giving half a  date-fruit in charity.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.499"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 499: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A lady along with her two daughters came to me asking (for  some alms), but she found nothing with me except one date which I gave to her and she  divided it between her two daughters, and did not eat anything herself, and then she got  up and went away. Then the Prophet came in and I informed him about this story. He said,  &#8220;Whoever is put to trial by these daughters and he treats them generously (with  benevolence) then these daughters will act as a shield for him from Hell-Fire.&#8221; (See  Hadith No. 24, Vol. 8). </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.500"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 500: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to the Prophet and asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! Which charity is the most superior in reward?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The charity  which you practice while you are healthy, niggardly and afraid of poverty and wish to  become wealthy. Do not delay it to the time of approaching death and then say, &#8216;Give so  much to such and such, and so much to such and such.&#8217; And it has already belonged to such  and such (as it is too late).&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.024.501"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 501: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some of the wives of the Prophet asked him, &#8220;Who  amongst us will be the first to follow you (i.e. die after you)?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Whoever has the longest hand.&#8221; So they started measuring their hands with a  stick and Sauda&#8217;s hand turned out to be the longest. (When Zainab bint Jahsh died first of  all in the caliphate of &#8216;Umar), we came to know that the long hand was a symbol of  practicing charity, so she was the first to follow the Prophet and she used to love to  practice charity. (Sauda died later in the caliphate of Muawiya). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 502: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;A man said that he  would give something in charity. He went out with his object of charity and unknowingly  gave it to a thief. Next morning the people said that he had given his object of charity  to a thief. (On hearing that) he said, &#8220;O Allah! All the praises are for you. I will  give alms again.&#8221; And so he again went out with his alms and (unknowingly) gave it to  an adulteress. Next morning the people said that he had given his alms to an adulteress  last night. The man said, &#8220;O Allah! All the praises are for you. (I gave my alms) to  an adulteress. I will give alms again.&#8221; So he went out with his alms again and  (unknowingly) gave it to a rich person. (The people) next morning said that he had given  his alms to a wealthy person. He said, &#8220;O Allah! All the praises are for you. (I had  given alms) to a thief, to an adulteress and to a wealthy man.&#8221; Then someone came and  said to him, &#8220;The alms which you gave to the thief, might make him abstain from  stealing, and that given to the adulteress might make her abstain from illegal sexual  intercourse (adultery), and that given to the wealthy man might make him take a lesson  from it and spend his wealth which Allah has given him, in Allah&#8217;s cause.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My grandfather, my father and I gave the pledge of  allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Prophet got me engaged and then got me married. One day  I went to the Prophet with a complaint. My father Yazid had taken some gold coins for  charity and kept them with a man in the mosque (to give them to the poor) But I went and  took them and brought them to him (my father). My father said, &#8220;By Allah! I did not  intend to give them to you. &#8221; I took (the case) to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . On that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;O Yazid! You will be rewarded for what you intended. O Man! Whatever  you have taken is yours.&#8221; </font></p>

You need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door  between you and it.&#8217; He asked, &#8216;Will the door be broken or opened?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;No, it  will be broken.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Then, if it is broken, it will never be closed again?&#8217; I  replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; &#8221; Then we were afraid to ask what that door was, so we asked Masruq  to inquire, and he asked Hudhaifa regarding it.

These are the orders for compulsory charity (Zakat) which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had made  obligatory for every Muslim, and which Allah had ordered His Apostle to observe: Whoever  amongst the Muslims is asked to pay Zakat accordingly, he should pay it (to the Zakat  collector) and whoever is asked more than that (what is specified in this script) he  should not pay it; for twenty-four camels or less, sheep are to be paid as Zakat; for  every five camels one sheep is to be paid, and if there are between twenty-five to  thirty-five camels, one Bint Makhad is to be paid; and if they are between thirty-six to  forty-five (camels), one Bint Labun is to be paid; and if they are between forty-six to  sixty (camels), one Hiqqa is to be paid; and if the number is between sixty-one to  seventy-five (camels), one Jadh&#8217;a is to be paid; and if the number is between seventy-six  to ninety (camels), two Bint Labuns are to be paid; and if they are from ninety-one to  one-hundred-and twenty (camels), two Hiqqas are to be paid; and if they are over  one-hundred and-twenty (camels), for every forty (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Bint  Labun is to be paid, and for every fifty camels (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Hiqqa is  to be paid; and who ever has got only four camels, has to pay nothing as Zakat, but if the  owner of these four camels wants to give something, he can. If the number of camels  increases to five, the owner has to pay one sheep as Zakat. As regards the Zakat for the  (flock) of sheep; if they are between forty and one-hundred-and-twenty sheep, one sheep is  to be paid; and if they are between one-hundred-and-twenty to two hundred (sheep), two  sheep are to be paid; and if they are between two-hundred to three-hundred (sheep), three  sheep are to be paid; and for over three-hundred sheep, for every extra hundred sheep, one  sheep is to be paid as Zakat. And if somebody has got less than forty sheep, no Zakat is  required, but if he wants to give, he can. For silver the Zakat is one-fortieth of the lot  (i.e. 2.5%), and if its value is less than two-hundred Dirhams, Zakat is not required, but  if the owner wants to pay he can.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) sent Muadh to Yemen, he said  (to him), &#8220;YOU are going to people of a (Divine) Book. First of all invite them to  worship Allah (alone) and when they come to know Allah, inform them that Allah has  enjoined on them, five prayers in every day and night; and if they start offering these  prayers, inform them that Allah has enjoined on them, the Zakat. And it is to be taken  from the rich amongst them and given to the poor amongst them; and if they obey you in  that, take Zakat from them and avoid (don&#8217;t take) the best property of the people as  Zakat.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Anas bin Malik saying, &#8220;Abu Talha had more  property of date-palm trees gardens than any other amongst the Ansar in Medina and the  most beloved of them to him was Bairuha garden, and it was in front of the Mosque of the  Prophet . Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to go there and used to drink its nice water.&#8221; Anas  added, &#8220;When these verses were revealed:&#8211;&#8216;By no means shall you Attain righteousness  unless You spend (in charity) of that Which you love. &#8216; (3.92) Abu Talha said to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah, the Blessed, the Superior says: By no means shall you  attain righteousness, unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love. And no doubt,  Bairuha&#8217; garden is the most beloved of all my property to me. So I want to give it in  charity in Allah&#8217;s Cause. I expect its reward from Allah. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Spend it  where Allah makes you think it feasible.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Bravo! It is  useful property. I have heard what you have said (O Abu Talha), and I think it would be  proper if you gave it to your Kith and kin.&#8217; Abu Talha said, I will do so, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle.&#8217; Then Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his  cousins.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On &#8216;Id ul Fitr or &#8216;Id ul Adha Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h)  went out to the Musalla. After finishing the prayer, he delivered the sermon and ordered  the people to give alms. He said, &#8220;O people! Give alms.&#8221; Then he went towards  the women and said. &#8220;O women! Give alms, for I have seen that the majority of the  dwellers of Hell-Fire were you (women).&#8221; The women asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  What is the reason for it?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O women! You curse frequently, and are  ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and  religion than you. O women, some of you can lead a cautious wise man astray.&#8221; Then he  left. And when he reached his house, Zainab, the wife of Ibn Masud, came and asked  permission to enter It was said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! It is Zainab.&#8221; He asked,  &#8216;Which Zainab?&#8221; The reply was that she was the wife of Ibn Mas&#8217;ub. He said,  &#8220;Yes, allow her to enter.&#8221; And she was admitted. Then she said, &#8220;O Prophet  of Allah! Today you ordered people to give alms and I had an ornament and intended to give  it as alms, but Ibn Masud said that he and his children deserved it more than anybody  else.&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Ibn Masud had spoken the truth. Your husband and  your children had more right to it than anybody else.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet sat on a pulpit and we sat around him.  Then he said, &#8220;The things I am afraid of most for your sake (concerning what will  befall you after me) is the pleasures and splendors of the world and its beauties which  will be disclosed to you.&#8221; Somebody said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Can the good bring  forth evil?&#8221; The Prophet remained silent for a while. It was said to that person,  &#8220;What is wrong with you? You are talking to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) while he is not  talking to you.&#8221; Then we noticed that he was being inspired divinely. Then the  Prophet wiped off his sweat and said, &#8220;Where is the questioner?&#8221; It seemed as if  the Prophet liked his question. Then he said, &#8220;Good never brings forth evil. Indeed  it is like what grows on the banks of a water-stream which either kill or make the animals  sick, except if an animal eats its fill the Khadira (a kind of vegetable) and then faces  the sun, and then defecates and urinates and grazes again. No doubt this wealth is sweet  and green. Blessed is the wealth of a Muslim from which he gives to the poor, the orphans  and to needy travelers. (Or the Prophet said something similar to it) No doubt, whoever  takes it illegally will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied, and his wealth  will be a witness against him on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

So she said to &#8216;Abdullah, &#8220;Will you ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle whether it  will be sufficient for me to spend part of the Zakat on you and the orphans who are under  my protection?&#8221; He replied &#8220;Will you yourself ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221;  (Zainab added): So I went to the Prophet and I saw there an Ansari woman who was standing  at the door (of the Prophet ) with a similar problem as mine. Bilal passed by us and we  asked him, &#8216;Ask the Prophet whether it is permissible for me to spend (the Zakat) on my  husband and the orphans under my protection.&#8217; And we requested Bilal not to inform the  Prophet about us. So Bilal went inside and asked the Prophet regarding our problem. The  Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked, &#8220;Who are those two?&#8221; Bilal replied that she was Zainab.  The Prophet said, &#8220;Which Zainab?&#8221; Bilal said, &#8220;The wife of &#8216;Adullah (bin  Masud).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, (it is sufficient for her) and she will receive  a double rewards (for that): One for helping relatives, and the other for giving  Zakat.&#8221; </font></p>

But you are unfair in asking Zakat from Khalid as he is keeping  his armor for Allah&#8217;s Cause (for Jihad).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We took part in the holy battle of Tabuk in the company of  the Prophet and when we arrived at the Wadi-al-Qura, there was a woman in her garden. The  Prophet asked his companions to estimate the amount of the fruits in the garden, and  Allah&#8217;s Apostle estimated it at ten Awsuq (One Wasaq = 60 Sa&#8217;s) and 1 Sa&#8217;= 3 kg.  approximately). The Prophet said to that lady, &#8220;Check what your garden will  yield.&#8221; When we reached Tabuk, the Prophet said, &#8220;There will be a strong wind  to-night and so no one should stand and whoever has a camel, should fasten it.&#8221; So we  fastened our camels. A strong wind blew at night and a man stood up and he was blown away  to a mountain called Taiy, The King of Aila sent a white mule and a sheet for wearing to  the Prophet as a present, and wrote to the Prophet that his people would stay in their  place (and will pay Jizya taxation.) (1) When the Prophet reached Wadi-al-Qura he asked  that woman how much her garden had yielded. She said, &#8220;Ten Awsuq,&#8221; and that was  what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had estimated. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;I want to reach Medina  quickly, and whoever among you wants to accompany me, should hurry up.&#8221; The  sub-narrator Ibn Bakkar said something which meant: When the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw Medina  he said, &#8220;This is Taba.&#8221; And when he saw the mountain of Uhud, he said,  &#8220;This mountain loves us and we love it. Shall I tell you of the best amongst the  Ansar?&#8221; They replied in the affirmative. He said, &#8220;The family of Bani-n-Najjar,  and then the family of Bani Sa&#8217;ida or Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj. (The above-mentioned  are the best) but there is goodness in all the families of Ansar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Dates used to be brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle immediately  after being plucked.

One  of them took a date and put it in his mouth. Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at him and took it out  from his mouth and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that Muhammad&#8217;s offspring do not eat what is  given in charity?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I gave a horse in Allah&#8217;s Cause (in charity) but that  person did not take care of it. I intended to buy it, as I thought he would sell it at a  low price. So, I asked the Prophet (p.b.u.h) about it. He said, &#8220;Neither buy, nor  take back your alms which you have given, even if the seller were willing to sell it for  one Dirham, for he who takes back his alms is like the one who swallows his own  vomit.&#8221; </font></p>

So, when you reach  there, invite them to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and that  Muhammad is His Apostle. And if they obey you in that, tell them that Allah has enjoined  on them five prayers in each day and night. And if they obey you in that tell them that  Allah has made it obligatory on them to pay the Zakat which will be taken from the rich  among them and given to the poor among them. If they obey you in that, then avoid taking  the best of their possessions, and be afraid of the curse of an oppressed person because  there is no screen between his invocation and Allah.&#8221; </font></p>

The debtor went on a voyage (when the time for the payment of the debt became due)  but he did not find a boat, so he took a piece of wood and bored it and put 1000 diners in  it and threw it into the sea. The creditor went out and took the piece of wood to his  family to be used as fire-wood.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 488 B, Vol. 3).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Masud: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is  the best deed?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;To offer the prayers at their early stated fixed  times.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What is next in goodness?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;To be good  and dutiful to your parents.&#8221; I further asked, what is next in goodness?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;To participate in Jihad in Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; I did not ask Allah&#8217;s  Apostle anymore and if I had asked him more, he would have told me more. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 42: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There is no Hijra (i.e.  migration) (from Mecca to Medina) after the Conquest (of Mecca), but Jihad and good  intention remain; and if you are called (by the Muslim ruler) for fighting, go forth  immediately. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(That she said), &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We consider Jihad  as the best deed. Should we not fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The best  Jihad (for women) is Hajj-Mabrur (i.e. Hajj which is done according to the Prophet&#8217;s  tradition and is accepted by Allah).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;Instruct me  as to such a deed as equals Jihad (in reward).&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I do not find such  a deed.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;Can you, while the Muslim fighter is in the  battle-field, enter your mosque to perform prayers without cease and fast and never break  your fast?&#8221; The man said, &#8220;But who can do that?&#8221; Abu- Huraira added,  &#8220;The Mujahid (i.e. Muslim fighter) is rewarded even for the footsteps of his horse  while it wanders bout (for grazing) tied in a long rope.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Somebody asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who is the best  among the people?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied &#8220;A believer who strives his utmost in  Allah&#8217;s Cause with his life and property.&#8221; They asked, &#8220;Who is next?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;A believer who stays in one of the mountain paths worshipping Allah and  leaving the people secure from his mischief.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 46: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The example of a  Mujahid in Allah&#8217;s Cause&#8211; and Allah knows better who really strives in His Cause&#8212;-is  like a person who fasts and prays continuously. Allah guarantees that He will admit the  Mujahid in His Cause into Paradise if he is killed, otherwise He will return him to his  home safely with rewards and war booty.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 47: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to visit Um Haran bint Milhan, who  would offer him reals. Um-Haram was the wife of Ubada bin As-Samit. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, once  visited her and she provided him with food and started looking for lice in his head. Then  Allah&#8217;s Apostle slept, and afterwards woke up smiling. Um Haran asked, &#8220;What causes  you to smile, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He said. &#8220;Some of my followers who (in a  dream) were presented before me as fighters in Allah&#8217;s Cause (on board a ship) amidst this  sea cause me to smile; they were as kings on the thrones (or like kings on the  thrones).&#8221; (Ishaq, a sub-narrator is not sure as to which expression the Prophet  used.) Um-Haram said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah that he makes me one of them.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle invoked Allah for her and slept again and woke up smiling. Once again Um  Haram asked, &#8220;What makes you smile, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Some  of my followers were presented to me as fighters in Allah&#8217;s Cause,&#8221; repeating the  same dream. Um-Haram said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah that He makes me one of  them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You are amongst the first ones.&#8221; It happened that she  sailed on the sea during the Caliphate of Mu&#8217;awlya bin Abi Sufyan, and after she  disembarked, she fell down from her riding animal and died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 48: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever believes in Allah and His  Apostle, offer prayer perfectly and fasts the month of Ramadan, will rightfully be granted  Paradise by Allah, no matter whether he fights in Allah&#8217;s Cause or remains in the land  where he is born.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle ! Shall we acquaint the  people with the is good news?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Paradise has one-hundred grades which  Allah has reserved for the Mujahidin who fight in His Cause, and the distance between each  of two grades is like the distance between the Heaven and the Earth. So, when you ask  Allah (for something), ask for Al-firdaus which is the best and highest part of  Paradise.&#8221; (i.e. The sub-narrator added, &#8220;I think the Prophet also said, &#8216;Above  it (i.e. Al-Firdaus) is the Throne of Beneficent (i.e. Allah), and from it originate the  rivers of Paradise.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Samura: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Last night two men came to me (in a  dream) and made me ascend a tree and then admitted me into a better and superior house,  better of which I have never seen. One of them said, &#8216;This house is the house of  martyrs.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A single endeavor (of fighting) in  Allah&#8217;s Cause in the forenoon or in the afternoon is better than the world and whatever is  in it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.052.051"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 51: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A place in Paradise as small as a  bow is better than all that on which the sun rises and sets (i.e. all the world).&#8221; He  also said, &#8220;A single endeavor in Allah&#8217;s Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is  better than all that on which the sun rises and sets.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A single endeavor in Allah&#8217;s Cause  in the afternoon and in the forenoon is better than the world and whatever is in it.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 53: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Nobody who dies and finds good from  Allah (in the Hereafter) would wish to come back to this world even if he were given the  whole world and whatever is in it, except the martyr who, on seeing the superiority of  martyrdom, would like to come back to the world and get killed again (in Allah&#8217;s  Cause).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: The Prophet said, &#8220;A single endeavor  (of fighting) in Allah&#8217;s Cause in the afternoon or in the forenoon is better than all the  world and whatever is in it. A place in Paradise as small as the bow or lash of one of you  is better than all the world and whatever is in it. And if a houri from Paradise appeared  to the people of the earth, she would fill the space between Heaven and the Earth with  light and pleasant scent and her head cover is better than the world and whatever is in  it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my life is!  Were it not for some men amongst the believers who dislike to be left behind me and whom I  cannot provide with means of conveyance, I would certainly never remain behind any Sariya&#8217;  (army-unit) setting out in Allah&#8217;s Cause. By Him in Whose Hands my life is! I would love  to be martyred in Al1ah&#8217;s Cause and then get resurrected and then get martyred, and then  get resurrected again and then get martyred and then get resurrected again and then get  martyred. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 55: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet delivered a sermon and said, &#8220;Zaid took  the flag and was martyred, and then Ja&#8217;far took the flag and was martyred, and then  &#8216;Abdullah bin Rawaha took the flag and was martyred too, and then Khalid bin Al-Walid took  the flag though he was not appointed as a commander and Allah made him victorious.&#8221;  The Prophet further added, &#8220;It would not please us to have them with us.&#8221; Aiyub,  a sub-narrator, added, &#8220;Or the Prophet, shedding tears, said, &#8216;It would not p ease  them to be with us.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 56: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Haram said, &#8220;Once the Prophet slept in my house  near to me and got up smiling. I said, &#8216;What makes you smile?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Some of my  followers who (i.e. in a dream) were presented to me sailing on this green sea like kings  on thrones.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Invoke Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; So the  Prophet invoked Allah for her and went to sleep again. He did the same (i.e. got up and  told his dream) and Um Haran repeated her question and he gave the same reply. She said,  &#8220;Invoke Allah to make me one of them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You are among the first  batch.&#8221; Later on it happened that she went out in the company of her husband &#8216;Ubada  bin As-Samit who went for Jihad and it was the first time the Muslims undertook a naval  expedition led by Mu awiya. When the expedition came to an end and they were returning to  Sham, a riding animal was presented to her to ride, but the animal let her fall and thus  she died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 57: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent seventy men from the tribe of Bani Salim  to the tribe of Bani Amir. When they reached there, my maternal uncle said to them,  &#8220;I will go ahead of you, and if they allow me to convey the message of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle (it will be all right); otherwise you will remain close to me.&#8221; So he went  ahead of them and the pagans granted him security But while he was reporting the message  of the Prophet , they beckoned to one of their men who stabbed him to death. My maternal  uncle said, &#8220;Allah is Greater! By the Lord of the Kaba, I am successful.&#8221; After  that they attached the rest of the party and killed them all except a lame man who went up  to the top of the mountain. (Hammam, a sub-narrator said, &#8220;I think another man was  saved along with him).&#8221; Gabriel informed the Prophet that they (i.e the martyrs) met  their Lord, and He was pleased with them and made them pleased. We used to recite,  &#8220;Inform our people that we have met our Lord, He is pleased with us and He has made  us pleased &#8221; Later on this Quranic Verse was cancelled. The Prophet invoked Allah for  forty days to curse the murderers from the tribe of Ral, Dhakwan, Bani Lihyan and Bam  Usaiya who disobeyed Allah and his Apostle </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 58: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jundab bin Sufyan: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In one of the holy Battles a finger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (got  wounded and) bled. He said, &#8220;You are just a finger that bled, and what you got is in  Allah&#8217;s Cause.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my soul  is! Whoever is wounded in Allah&#8217;s Cause&#8230;.and Allah knows well who gets wounded in His  Cause&#8230;.will come on the Day of Resurrection with his wound having the color of blood but  the scent of musk.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Abu Sufyan told him that Heraclius said to him,  &#8220;I asked you about the outcome of your battles with him (i.e. the Prophet ) and you  told me that you fought each other with alternate success. So the Apostles are tested in  this way but the ultimate victory is always theirs. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 61: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My uncle Anas bin An-Nadr was absent from the Battle of  Badr. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I was absent from the first battle you fought  against the pagans. (By Allah) if Allah gives me a chance to fight the pagans, no doubt.  Allah will see how (bravely) I will fight.&#8221; On the day of Uhud when the Muslims  turned their backs and fled, he said, &#8220;O Allah! I apologize to You for what these  (i.e. his companions) have done, and I denounce what these (i.e. the pagans) have  done.&#8221; Then he advanced and Sad bin Muadh met him. He said &#8220;O Sad bin Muadh ! By  the Lord of An-Nadr, Paradise! I am smelling its aroma coming from before (the mountain  of) Uhud,&#8221; Later on Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I cannot achieve or do what he  (i.e. Anas bin An-Nadr) did. We found more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his  body. We found him dead and his body was mutilated so badly that none except his sister  could recognize him by his fingers.&#8221; We used to think that the following Verse was  revealed concerning him and other men of his sort: &#8220;Among the believers are men who  have been true to their covenant with Allah&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221; (33.23) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>His sister Ar-Rubbaya&#8217; broke a front tooth of a woman and  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered for retaliation. On that Anas (bin An-Nadr) said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, my sister&#8217;s tooth shall not be  broken.&#8221; Then the opponents of Anas&#8217;s sister accepted the compensation and gave up  the claim of retaliation. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There are some people amongst  Allah&#8217;s slaves whose oaths are fulfilled by Allah when they take them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Kharija bin Zaid: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Zaid bin Thabit said, &#8220;When the Quran was compiled  from various written manuscripts, one of the Verses of Surat Al-Ahzab was missing which I  used to hear Allah&#8217;s Apostle reciting. I could not find it except with Khuzaima bin Thabjt  Al-Ansari, whose witness Allah&#8217;s Apostle regarded as equal to the witness of two men. And  the Verse was:&#8211; &#8220;Among the believers are men who have been true to what they  covenanted with Allah.&#8221; (33.23) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man whose face was covered with an iron mask (i.e. clad  in armor) came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Shall I fight or embrace  Islam first? &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;Embrace Islam first and then fight.&#8221; So he  embraced Islam, and was martyred. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, A Little work, but a great reward.  &#8220;(He did very little (after embracing Islam), but he will be rewarded in  abundance).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Ar-Rubai&#8217;bint Al-Bara&#8217;, the mother of Hartha bin Suraqa  came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! Will you tell me about  Hartha?&#8221; Hartha has been killed (i.e. martyred) on the day of Badr with an arrow  thrown by an unidentified person. She added, &#8220;If he is in Paradise, I will be  patient; otherwise, I will weep bitterly for him.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O mother of Hartha!  There are Gardens in Paradise and your son got the Firdausal-ala (i.e. the best place in  Paradise).&#8221; </font></p>

The Prophet passed by &#8216;Ammar and  removed the dust off his head and said, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to &#8216;Ammar. He will be  killed by a rebellious aggressive group. &#8216;Ammar will invite them to (obey) Allah and they  will invite him to the (Hell) fire.&#8221; </font></p>

If I had power, I would surely take part in Jihad.&#8221; He was a blind man. So Allah sent  down revelation to His Apostle while his thigh was on mine and it became so heavy for me  that I feared that my thigh would be broken. Then that state of the Prophet was over after  Allah revealed &#8220;&#8230;except those who are disabled (by injury or are blind or lame  etc.) (4.95) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, &#8220;Nothing  worries me as to what will happen to you after me, except the temptation of worldly  blessings which will be conferred on you.&#8221; Then he mentioned the worldly pleasures.  He started with the one (i.e. the blessings) and took up the other (i.e. the pleasures). A  man got up saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Can the good bring about evil?&#8221; The  Prophet remained silent and we thought that he was being inspired divinely, so all the  people kept silent with awe. Then the Prophet wiped the sweat off his face and asked,  &#8220;Where is the present questioner?&#8221; &#8220;Do you think wealth is good?&#8221; he  repeated thrice, adding, &#8220;No doubt, good produces nothing but good. Indeed it is like  what grows on the banks of a stream which either kills or nearly kills the grazing animals  because of gluttony except the vegetation-eating animal which eats till both its flanks  are full (i.e. till it gets satisfied) and then stands in the sun and defecates and  urinates and again starts grazing. This worldly property is sweet vegetation. How  excellent the wealth of the Muslim is, if it is collected through legal means and is spent  in Allah&#8217;s Cause and on orphans, poor people and travelers. But he who does not take it  legally is like an eater who is never satisfied and his wealth will be a witness against  him on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Musa bin Anas while describing the battle of Yamama,  said, &#8220;Anas bin Malik went to Thabit bin Qais, who had lifted his clothes from his  thighs and was applying Hunut to his body. Anas asked, &#8216;O Uncle! What is holding you back  (from the battle)?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;O my nephew! I am coming just now,&#8217; and went on perfuming  himself with Hunut, then he came and sat (in the row). Anas then mentioned that the people  fled from the battle-field. On that Thabit said, &#8216;Clear the way for me to fight the enemy.  We would never do so (i.e. flee) in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. How bad the habits you  have acquired from your enemies!&#8221; </font></p>

So, he  rode over his horse called Al-Jarada and requested them to give him his lash, but they  refused. So, he himself took it and then attacked the opener and slaughtered it. He ate of  its meat and his companions ate, too, but they regretted their eating. When they met the  Prophet (they asked him about it) and he asked, &#8220;Have you some of its meat (left)  with you?&#8221; Abu Qatada replied, &#8220;Yes, we have its leg with us.&#8221; So, the  Prophet took and ate it. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8221; Horses are kept for one of  three purposes; for some people they are a source of reward, for some others they are a  means of shelter and for some others they are a source of sins. The one for whom they are  a source of reward, is he who keeps a horse for Allah&#8217;s Cause (i.e. Jihad) tying it with a  long tether on a meadow or in a garden with the result that whatever it eats from the area  of the meadow or the garden where it is tied will be counted as good deeds for his  benefit, and if it should break its rope and jump over one or two hillocks then all its  dung and its foot marks will be written as good deeds for him; and if it passes by a river  and drinks water from it even though he had no intention of watering it, even then he will  get the reward for its drinking. As for the man for whom horses are a source of sins, he  is the one who keeps a horse for the sake of pride and pretense and showing enmity for  Muslims: such a horse will be a source of sins for him. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked  about donkeys, he replied, &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to me about them except this  unique, comprehensive Verse: &#8220;Then anyone who does an atom&#8217;s (or a small ant&#8217;s)  weight of good shall see it; And anyone who does an atom&#8217;s (or a small ant&#8217;s) weight of  evil, shall see it.&#8217; (101.7-8) </font></p>

While I was in that state the camel stopped  suddenly (because of exhaustion). On that the Prophet said to me, &#8216;O Jabir, wait!&#8217; Then he  hit it once with his lash and it started moving on a fast pace. He then said, &#8216;Will you  sell the camel?&#8217; I replied in the affirmative when we reached Medina, and the Prophet went  to the Mosque along with his companions. I, too, went to him after tying the camel on the  pavement at the Mosque gate. Then I said to him, &#8216;This is your camel.&#8217; He came out and  started examining the camel and saying, &#8216;The camel is ours.&#8217; Then the Prophet sent some  Awaq (i.e. an amount) of gold saying, &#8216;Give it to Jabir.&#8217; Then he asked, &#8216;Have you taken  the full price (of the camel)?&#8217; I replied in the affirmative. He said, &#8216;Both the price and  the camel are for you.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

She said, &#8220;Invoke Allah to  make me one of them.&#8221; He replied, &#8221;You will be amongst the first group of them; you  will not be amongst the last.&#8221; Later on she married &#8216;Ubada bin As-Samit and then she  sailed on the sea with bint Qaraza, Mu&#8217;awiya&#8217;s wife (for Jihad). On her return, she  mounted her riding animal, which threw her down breaking her neck, and she died on falling  down. </font></p>

Paradise is  for him who holds the reins of his horse to strive in Allah&#8217;s Cause, with his hair unkempt  and feet covered with dust: if he is appointed in the vanguard, he is perfectly satisfied  with his post of guarding, and if he is appointed in the rearward, he accepts his post  with satisfaction; (he is so simple and unambiguous that) if he asks for permission he is  not permitted, and if he intercedes, his intercession is not accepted.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said to Abu Talha, &#8220;Choose one of your boy  servants to serve me in my expedition to Khaibar.&#8221; So, Abu Talha took me letting me  ride behind him while I was a boy nearing the age of puberty. I used to serve Allah&#8217;s  Apostle when he stopped to rest. I heard him saying repeatedly, &#8220;O Allah! I seek  refuge with You from distress and sorrow, from helplessness and laziness, from miserliness  and cowardice, from being heavily in debt and from being overcome by men.&#8221; Then we  reached Khaibar; and when Allah enabled him to conquer the Fort (of Khaibar), the beauty  of Safiya bint Huyai bin Akhtab was described to him. Her husband had been killed while  she was a bride. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle selected her for himself and took her along with him  till we reached a place called Sad-AsSahba,&#8217; where her menses were over and he took her  for his wife. Haris (a kind of dish) was served on a small leather sheet. Then Allah&#8217;s  Apostle told me to call those who were around me. So, that was the marriage banquet of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Safiya. Then we left for Medina. I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle folding a cloak  round the hump of the camel so as to make a wide space for Safiya (to sit on behind him)  He sat beside his camel letting his knees for Safiya to put her feet on so as to mount the  camel. Then, we proceeded till we approached Medina; he looked at Uhud (mountain) and  said, &#8220;This is a mountain which loves us and is loved by us.&#8221; Then he looked at  Medina and said, &#8220;O Allah! I make the area between its (i.e. Medina&#8217;s) two mountains  a sanctuary as Abraham made Mecca a sanctuary. O Allah! Bless them (i.e. the people of  Medina) in their Mudd and Sa (i.e. measures).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the pagans faced each other and started  fighting. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned to his camp and when the pagans returned to their  camp, somebody talked about a man amongst the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle who would  follow and kill with his sword any pagan going alone. He said, &#8220;Nobody did his job  (i.e. fighting) so properly today as that man.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Indeed,  he is amongst the people of the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; A man amongst the people said, &#8220;I  shall accompany him (to watch what he does)&#8221; Thus he accompanied him, and wherever he  stood, he would stand with him, and wherever he ran, he would run with him. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the (brave) man got wounded seriously and he decided  to bring about his death quickly. He planted the blade of the sword in the ground  directing its sharp end towards his chest between his two breasts. Then he leaned on the  sword and killed himself. The other man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;I testify  that you are Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;What has happened?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;(It is about) the man whom you had described as one of the people of the  (Hell) Fire. The people were greatly surprised at what you said, and I said, &#8216;I will find  out his reality for you.&#8217; So, I came out seeking him. He got severely wounded, and  hastened to die by slanting the blade of his sword in the ground directing its sharp end  towards his chest between his two breasts. Then he eased on his sword and killed  himself.&#8221; when Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A man may seem to the people as if he were  practising the deeds of the people of Paradise while in fact he is from the people of the  Hell) Fire, another may seem to the people as if he were practicing the deeds of the  people of Hell (Fire), while in fact he is from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

So, whenever a charitable  person wants to give in charity, his cloak spreads over his body so much so that it wipes  out his traces, but whenever the miser wants to give in charity, the rings (of the iron  cloak) come closer to each other and press over his body, and his hands gets connected to  his collar-bones. Abu Huraira heard the Prophet saying. &#8220;The miser then tries to  widen it but in vain.&#8221; </font></p>

Caesar as a sign of gratitude to  Allah, had walked from Hims to Ilya (i.e. Jerusalem) when Allah had granted Him victory  over the Persian forces. So, when the letter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Caesar, he said  after reading t, &#8216;Seek for me any one of his people! (Arabs of Quraish tribe) if present  here, in order to ask him about Allah&#8217;s Apostle. At that time Abu Sufyan bin Harb was in  Sham with some men frown Quraish who had come (to Sham) as merchants during the truce that  had been concluded between Allah&#8217;s Apostle; and the infidels of Quraish. Abu Sufyan said,  Caesar&#8217;s messenger found us somewhere in Sham so he took me and my companions to Ilya and  we were admitted into Ceasar&#8217;s court to find him sitting in his royal court wearing a  crown and surrounded by the senior dignitaries of the Byzantine. He said to his  translator. &#8216;Ask them who amongst them is a close relation to the man who claims to be a  prophet.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;I replied, &#8216;I am the nearest relative to him.&#8217; He  asked, &#8216;What degree of relationship do you have with him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;He is my cousin,&#8217;  and there was none of Bani Abu Manaf in the caravan except myself. Caesar said, &#8216;Let him  come nearer.&#8217; He then ordered that my companions stand behind me near my shoulder and said  to his translator, &#8216;Tell his companions that I am going to ask this man about the man who  claims to be a prophet. If he tells a lie, they should contradict him immediately.&#8221;  Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allah ! Had it not been shameful that my companions label me a  liar, I would not have spoken the truth about him when he asked me. But I considered it  shameful to be called a liar by my companions. So I told the truth. He then said to his  translator, &#8216;Ask him what kind of family does he belong to.&#8217; I replied, &#8216;He belongs to a  noble family amongst us.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Have anybody else amongst you ever claimed the same  before him? &#8216;I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Had you ever blamed him for telling lies before he  claimed what he claimed? &#8216; I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Was anybody amongst his ancestors a  king?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8220;Do the noble or the poor follow him?&#8217; I replied,  &#8216;It is the poor who follow him.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Are they increasing or decreasing (day by  day)?&#8217; I replied,&#8217; They are increasing.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Does anybody amongst those who embrace  his (the Prophet&#8217;s) Religion become displeased and then discard his Religion?&#8217;. I replied,  &#8216;No. &#8216; He said, &#8216;Does he break his promises? I replied, &#8216;No, but we are now at truce with  him and we are afraid that he may betray us.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;Other than the  last sentence, I could not say anything against him. Caesar then asked, &#8216;Have you ever had  a war with him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He said, &#8216;What was the outcome of your battles with  him?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;The result was unstable; sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.&#8217;  He said, &#8216;What does he order you to do?&#8217; I said, &#8216;He tells us to worship Allah alone, and  not to worship others along with Him, and to leave all that our fore-fathers used to  worship. He orders us to pray, give in charity, be chaste, keep promises and return what  is entrusted to us.&#8217; When I had said that, Caesar said to his translator, &#8216;Say to him: I  ask you about his lineage and your reply was that he belonged to a noble family. In fact,  all the apostles came from the noblest lineage of their nations. Then I questioned you  whether anybody else amongst you had claimed such a thing, and your reply was in the  negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man  was following a claim that had been said before him. When I asked you whether he was ever  blamed for telling lies, your reply was in the negative, so I took it for granted that a  person who did not tell a lie about (others) the people could never tell a lie about  Allah. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the  negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted  to take back his ancestral kingdom. When I asked you whether the rich or the poor people  followed him, you replied that it was the poor who followed him. In fact, such are the  followers of the apostles. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or  decreasing. You replied that they were increasing. In fact, this is the result of true  faith till it is complete (in all respects). I asked you whether there was anybody who,  after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion; your reply was  in the negative. In fact, this is the sign of true faith, for when its cheerfulness enters  and mixes in the hearts completely, nobody will be displeased with it. I asked you whether  he had ever broken his promise. You replied in the negative. And such are the apostles;  they never break their promises. When I asked you whether you fought with him and he  fought with you, you replied that he did, and that sometimes he was victorious and  sometimes you. Indeed, such are the apostles; they are put to trials and the final victory  is always theirs. Then I asked you what he ordered you. You replied that he ordered you to  worship Allah alone and not to worship others along with Him, to leave all that your  fore-fathers used to worship, to offer prayers, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep  promises, and to return what is entrusted to you. These are really the qualities of a  prophet who, I knew (from the previous Scriptures) would appear, but I did not know that  he would be from amongst you. If what you say should be true, he will very soon occupy the  earth under my feet, and if I knew that I would reach him definitely, I would go  immediately to meet Him; and were I with him, then I would certainly wash his feet.&#8217;  &#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;Caesar then asked for the letter of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and it  was read. Its contents were:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;In the name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most  Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad, the slave of Allah, and His Apostle, to  Heraculius, the Ruler of the Byzantine. Peace be upon the followers of guidance. Now then,  I invite you to Islam (i.e. surrender to Allah), embrace Islam and you will be safe;  embrace Islam and Allah will bestow on you a double reward. But if you reject this  invitation of Islam, you shall be responsible for misguiding the peasants (i.e. your  nation). O people of the Scriptures! Come to a word common to you and us and you, that we  worship. None but Allah, and that we associate nothing in worship with Him; and that none  of us shall take others as Lords besides Allah. Then if they turn away, say: Bear witness  that we are (they who have surrendered (unto Him)..(3.64) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;When Heraclius had finished his  speech, there was a great hue and cry caused by the Byzantine Royalties surrounding him,  and there was so much noise that I did not understand what they said. So, we were turned  out of the court. When I went out with my companions and we were alone, I said to them,  &#8216;Verily, Ibn Abi Kabsha&#8217;s (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s) affair has gained power. This is the King  of Bani Al-Asfar fearing him.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allah, I remained low and  was sure that his religion would be victorious till Allah converted me to Islam, though I  disliked it &#8221; </font></p>

But the Prophet  asked for &#8216;Ali. Someone informed him that he was suffering from eye-trouble. So, he  ordered them to bring &#8216;Ali in front of him. Then the Prophet spat in his eyes and his eyes  were cured immediately as if he had never any eye-trouble. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;We will fight  with them (i.e. infidels) till they become like us (i.e. Muslims).&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Be patient, till you face them and invite them to Islam and inform them of what  Allah has enjoined upon them. By Allah! If a single person embraces Islam at your hands  (i.e. through you), that will be better for you than the red camels.&#8221; </font></p>

Beef was brought to us on the day of (i.e. the days of slaughtering)  and I asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; Somebody said, Allah&#8217;s Apostle has slaughtered (a  cow) on behalf of his wives.&#8221; </font></p>

And no doubt, everyone among you  will remain in a good state as long as he obeys Allah. If one is in doubt as to the  legality of something, he should ask somebody who would satisfy him, but soon will come a  time when you will not find such a man.

The Prophet asked me, &#8220;What is wrong with  the camel?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;It has got tired.&#8221; So. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came from  behind it and rebuked it and prayed for it so it started surpassing the other camels and  going ahead of them. Then he asked me, &#8220;How do you find your camel (now)?&#8221; I  replied, &#8220;I find it quite well, now as it has received your blessings.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Will you sell it to me?&#8221; I felt shy (to refuse his offer) though it was the  only camel for irrigation we had. So, I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Sell it to  me then.&#8221; I sold it to him on the condition that I should keep on riding it till I  reached Medina. Then I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am a bridegroom,&#8221; and  requested him to allow me to go home. He allowed me, and I set out for Medina before the  people till I reached Medina, where I met my uncle, who asked me about the camel and I  informed him all about it and he blamed me for that. When I took the permission of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle he asked me whether I had married a virgin or a matron and I replied that I had  married a matron. He said, &#8220;Why hadn&#8217;t you married a virgin who would have played  with you, and you would have played with her?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! My  father died (or was martyred) and I have some young sisters, so I felt it not proper that  I should marry a young girl like them who would neither teach them manners nor serve them.  So, I have married a matron so that she may serve them and teach them manners.&#8221; When  Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived in Medina, I took the camel to him the next morning and he gave me  its price and gave me the camel itself as well. </font></p>

No doubt I wish  I could fight in Allah&#8217;s Cause and be martyred and come to life again to be martyred and  come to life once more.&#8221; </font></p>

Then the former instituted a suit against the latter before the Prophet  who rejected that suit saying, &#8220;Do you expect him to put out his hand for you to snap  as a male camel snaps (vegetation)?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he was in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on some of  his journeys. (The sub-narrator &#8216;Abdullah adds, &#8220;I think that Abu Bashir also said,  &#8216;And the people were at their sleeping places.&#8221;) Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent a messenger  ordering: &#8220;There shall not remain any necklace of string or any other kind of  necklace round the necks of camels except it is cut off.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That he heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;It is not  permissible for a man to be alone with a woman, and no lady should travel except with a  Muhram (i.e. her husband or a person whom she cannot marry in any case for ever; e.g. her  father, brother, etc.).&#8221; Then a man got up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have  enlisted in the army for such-and-such Ghazwa and my wife is proceeding for Hajj.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Go, and perform the Hajj with your wife.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ubaidullah bin Abi Rafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard &#8216;Ali saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent me,  Az-Zubair and Al-Miqdad somewhere saying, &#8216;Proceed till you reach Rawdat Khakh. There you  will find a lady with a letter. Take the letter from her.&#8217; &#8221; So, we set out and our  horses ran at full pace till we got at Ar-Rawda where we found the lady and said (to her).  &#8220;Take out the letter.&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I have no letter with me.&#8221; We  said, &#8220;Either you take out the letter or else we will take off your clothes.&#8221;  So, she took it out of her braid. We brought the letter to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and it  contained a statement from Hatib bin Abi Balta a to some of the Meccan pagans informing  them of some of the intentions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Hatib! What is this?&#8221; Hatib replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Don&#8217;t hasten to give  your judgment about me. I was a man closely connected with the Quraish, but I did not  belong to this tribe, while the other emigrants with you, had their relatives in Mecca who  would protect their dependents and property . So, I wanted to recompense for my lacking  blood relation to them by doing them a favor so that they might protect my dependents. I  did this neither because of disbelief not apostasy nor out of preferring Kufr (disbelief)  to Islam.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle, said, &#8220;Hatib has told you the truth.&#8221; Umar  said, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop off the head of this hypocrite.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;Hatib participated in the battle of Badr, and who knows, perhaps Allah  has already looked at the Badr warriors and said, &#8216;Do whatever you like, for I have  forgiven you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When it was the day (of the battle) of Badr, prisoners of  war were brought including Al-Abbas who was undressed. The Prophet looked for a shirt for  him. It was found that the shirt of &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai would do, so the Prophet let him  wear it. That was the reason why the Prophet took off and gave his own shirt to &#8216;Abdullah.  (The narrator adds, &#8220;He had done the Prophet some favor for which the Prophet liked  to reward him.&#8221;) </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Where is  &#8216;Ali?&#8221; He was told that &#8216;Ali was suffering from eye-trouble, so he applied saliva to  his eyes and invoked Allah to cure him. He at once got cured as if he had no ailment. The  Prophet gave him the flag. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;Should I fight them till they become like us  (i.e. Muslim)?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go to them patiently and calmly till you  enter the land. Then, invite them to Islam, and inform them what is enjoined upon them,  for, by Allah, if Allah gives guidance to somebody through you, it is better for you than  possessing red camels.&#8221; </font></p>

Then they  killed the shepherd and drove away the camels, and they became unbelievers after they were  Muslims. When the Prophet was informed by a shouter for help, he sent some men in their  pursuit, and before the sun rose high, they were brought, and he had their hands and feet  cut off. Then he ordered for nails which were heated and passed over their eyes, and whey  were left in the Harra (i.e. rocky land in Medina). They asked for water, and nobody  provided them with water till they died (Abu Qilaba, a sub-narrator said, &#8220;They  committed murder and theft and fought against Allah and His Apostle, and spread evil in  the land.&#8221;) </font></p>

So, I proceeded with one hundred and fifty cavalry men from  the tribe of Ahmas, who were excellent knights. It happened that I could not sit firm on  horses, so the Prophet , stroke me over my chest till I saw his finger-marks over my  chest, he said, &#8216;O Allah!

That man said,  &#8220;I hid myself in a stable for their animals. They closed the fort gate. Later they  lost a donkey of theirs, so they went out in its search. I, too, went out along with them,  pretending to look for it. They found the donkey and entered their fort. And I, too,  entered along with them. They closed the gate of the fort at night, and kept its keys in a  small window where I could see them. When those people slept, I took the keys and opened  the gate of the fort and came upon Abu Rafi and said, &#8216;O Abu Rafi. When he replied me, I  proceeded towards the voice and hit him. He shouted and I came out to come back,  pretending to be a helper. I said, &#8216;O Abu Rafi, changing the tone of my voice. He asked  me, &#8216;What do you want; woe to your mother?&#8217; I asked him, &#8216;What has happened to you?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know who came to me and hit me.&#8217; Then I drove my sword into his belly and  pushed it forcibly till it touched the bone. Then I came out, filled with puzzlement and  went towards a ladder of theirs in order to get down but I fell down and sprained my foot.  I came to my companions and said, &#8216;I will not leave till I hear the wailing of the women.&#8217;  So, I did not leave till I heard the women bewailing Abu Rafi, the merchant pf Hijaz. Then  I got up, feeling no ailment, (and we proceeded) till we came upon the Prophet and  informed him.&#8221; </font></p>

By Allah, I saw the women fleeing lifting up their clothes  revealing their leg-bangles and their legs. So, the companions of &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair  said, &#8220;The booty! O people, the booty ! Your companions have become victorious, what  are you waiting for now?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Jubair said, &#8220;Have you forgotten what  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to you?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;By Allah! We will go to the people  (i.e. the enemy) and collect our share from the war booty.&#8221; But when they went to  them, they were forced to turn back defeated. At that time Allah&#8217;s Apostle in their rear  was calling them back. Only twelve men remained with the Prophet and the infidels martyred  seventy men from us. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On the day (of the battle) of Badr, the Prophet and his  companions had caused the &#8216;Pagans to lose 140 men, seventy of whom were captured and  seventy were killed. Then Abu Sufyan asked thrice, &#8220;Is Muhammad present amongst these  people?&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions not to answer him. Then he asked thrice,  &#8220;Is the son of Abu Quhafa present amongst these people?&#8221; He asked again thrice,  &#8220;Is the son of Al-Khattab present amongst these people?&#8221; He then returned to his  companions and said, &#8220;As for these (men), they have been killed.&#8221; &#8216;Umar could  not control himself and said (to Abu Sufyan), &#8220;You told a lie, by Allah! O enemy of  Allah! All those you have mentioned are alive, and the thing which will make you unhappy  is still there.&#8221; Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;Our victory today is a counterbalance to  yours in the battle of Badr, and in war (the victory) is always undecided and is shared in  turns by the belligerents, and you will find some of your (killed) men mutilated, but I  did not urge my men to do so, yet I do not feel sorry for their deed&#8221; After that he  started reciting cheerfully, &#8220;O Hubal, be high! (1) On that the Prophet said (to his  companions), &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you answer him back?&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle  What shall we say?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Say, Allah is Higher and more Sublime.&#8221;  (Then) Abu Sufyan said, &#8220;We have the (idol) Al Uzza, and you have no Uzza.&#8221; The  Prophet said (to his companions), &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you answer him back?&#8221; They asked,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What shall we say?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Says Allah is our Helper  and you have no helper.&#8221; </font></p>

Once the people of Medina got frightened having heard an  uproar at night. So, the Prophet met the people while he was riding an unsaddled horse  belonging to Abu Talha and carrying his sword (slung over his shoulder).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I went out of Medina towards Al-Ghaba. When I reached the  mountain path of Al-Ghaba, a slave of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf met me. I said to him,  &#8220;Woe to you! What brought you here?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The she-camels of the  Prophet have been taken away.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Who took them?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Ghatafan and Fazara.&#8221; So, I sent three cries, &#8220;O Sabaha-h ! O Sabahah  !&#8221; so loudly that made the people in between its (i.e. Medina&#8217;s) two mountains hear  me. Then I rushed till I met them after they had taken the camels away. I started throwing  arrows at them saying, &#8220;I am the son of Al-Akwa&#8221;; and today perish the mean  people!&#8221; So, I saved the she-camels from them before they (i.e. the robbers) could  drink water. When I returned driving the camels, the Prophet met me, I said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle Those people are thirsty and I have prevented them from drinking water, so  send some people to chase them.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O son of Al-Akwa&#8217;, you have  gained power (over your enemy), so forgive (them). (Besides) those people are now being  entertained by their folk.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 52, Number 281: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent a Sariya of ten men as spies under the  leadership of &#8216;Asim bin Thabit al-Ansari, the grandfather of &#8216;Asim bin Umar Al-Khattab.  They proceeded till they reached Hadaa, a place between &#8216;Usfan, and Mecca, and their news  reached a branch of the tribe of Hudhail called Bani Lihyan. About two-hundred men, who  were all archers, hurried to follow their tracks till they found the place where they had  eaten dates they had brought with them from Medina. They said, &#8220;These are the dates  of Yathrib (i.e. Medina), &#8220;and continued following their tracks When &#8216;Asim and his  companions saw their pursuers, they went up a high place and the infidels circled them.  The infidels said to them, &#8220;Come down and surrender, and we promise and guarantee you  that we will not kill any one of you&#8221; &#8216;Asim bin Thabit; the leader of the Sariya  said, &#8220;By Allah! I will not come down to be under the protection of infidels. O  Allah! Convey our news to Your Prophet. Then the infidels threw arrows at them till they  martyred &#8216;Asim along with six other men, and three men came down accepting their promise  and convention, and they were Khubaib-al-Ansari and Ibn Dathina and another man So, when  the infidels captured them, they undid the strings of their bows and tied them. Then the  third (of the captives) said, &#8220;This is the first betrayal. By Allah! I will not go  with you. No doubt these, namely the martyred, have set a good example to us.&#8221; So,  they dragged him and tried to compel him to accompany them, but as he refused, they killed  him. They took Khubaid and Ibn Dathina with them and sold them (as slaves) in Mecca (and  all that took place) after the battle of Badr. Khubaib was bought by the sons of Al-Harith  bin &#8216;Amir bin Naufal bin &#8216;Abd Manaf. It was Khubaib who had killed Al-Harith bin &#8216;Amir on  the day (of the battle of) Badr. So, Khubaib remained a prisoner with those people. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Az-Zuhri: &#8216;Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Iyyad said that the  daughter of Al-Harith had told him, &#8220;When those people gathered (to kill Khubaib) he  borrowed a razor from me to shave his pubes and I gave it to him. Then he took a son of  mine while I was unaware when he came upon him. I saw him placing my son on his thigh and  the razor was in his hand. I got scared so much that Khubaib noticed the agitation on my  face and said, &#8216;Are you afraid that I will kill him? No, I will never do so.&#8217; By Allah, I  never saw a prisoner better than Khubaib. By Allah, one day I saw him eating of a bunch of  grapes in his hand while he was chained in irons, and there was no fruit at that time in  Mecca.&#8221; The daughter of Al-Harith used to say, &#8220;It was a boon Allah bestowed  upon Khubaib.&#8221; When they took him out of the Sanctuary (of Mecca) to kill him outside  its boundaries, Khubaib requested them to let him offer two Rakat (prayer). They allowed  him and he offered Two Rakat and then said, &#8220;Hadn&#8217;t I been afraid that you would  think that I was afraid (of being killed), I would have prolonged the prayer. O Allah,  kill them all with no exception.&#8221; (He then recited the poetic verse):&#8211; &#8220;I being  martyred as a Muslim, Do not mind how I am killed in Allah&#8217;s Cause, For my killing is for  Allah&#8217;s Sake, And if Allah wishes, He will bless the amputated parts of a torn body&#8221;  Then the son of Al Harith killed him. So, it was Khubaib who set the tradition for any  Muslim sentenced to death in captivity, to offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer (before being  killed). Allah fulfilled the invocation of Asim bin Thabit on that very day on which he  was martyred. The Prophet informed his companions of their news and what had happened to  them. Later on when some infidels from Quraish were informed that Asim had been killed,  they sent some people to fetch a part of his body (i.e. his head) by which he would be  recognized. (That was because) &#8216;Asim had killed one of their chiefs on the day (of the  battle) of Badr. So, a swarm of wasps, resembling a shady cloud, were sent to hover over  Asim and protect him from their messenger and thus they could not cut off anything from  his flesh. </font></p>

Ibn Saiyad  was lying in his bed, covered with a velvet sheet from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn  Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw the Prophet while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the  date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, &#8220;O Saf!&#8221; (And this was his name). Ibn  Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, &#8220;Had this woman let him to himself, he would have  revealed the reality of his case.&#8221; Then the Prophet got up amongst the people,  glorifying Allah as He deserves, he mentioned Ad-Dajjal, saying, &#8220;I warn you about  him (i.e. Ad-Dajjal) and there is no prophet who did not warn his nation about him, and  Noah warned his nation about him, but I tell you a statement which no prophet informed his  nation of.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar bin Al-Khattab appointed a freed slave of his, called  Hunai, manager of the Hima (i.e. a pasture devoted for grazing the animals of the Zakat or  other specified animals). He said to him, &#8220;O Hunai! Don&#8217;t oppress the Muslims and  ward off their curse (invocations against you) for the invocation of the oppressed is  responded to (by Allah); and allow the shepherd having a few camels and those having a few  sheep (to graze their animals), and take care not to allow the livestock of &#8216;Abdur-Rahman  bin &#8216;Auf and the livestock of (&#8216;Uthman) bin &#8216;Affan, for if their livestock should perish,  then they have their farms and gardens, while those who own a few camels and those who own  a few sheep, if their livestock should perish, would bring their dependents to me and  appeal for help saying, &#8216;O chief of the believers! O chief of the believers!&#8217; Would I then  neglect them? (No, of course). So, I find it easier to let them have water and grass  rather than to give them gold and silver (from the Muslims&#8217; treasury). By Allah, these  people think that I have been unjust to them. This is their land, and during the  pre-lslamic period, they fought for it and they embraced Islam (willingly) while it was in  their possession. By Him in Whose Hand my life is! Were it not for the animals (in my  custody) which I give to be ridden for striving in Allah&#8217;s Cause, I would not have turned  even a span of their land into a Hima.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We were in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in a Ghazwa, and  he remarked about a man who claimed to be a Muslim, saying, &#8220;This (man) is from the  people of the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; When the battle started, the man fought violently till he  got wounded. Somebody said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The man whom you described as being  from the people of the (Hell) Fire fought violently today and died.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;He will go to the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; Some people were on the point of doubting  (the truth of what the Prophet had said) while they were in this state, suddenly someone  said that he was still alive but severely wounded. When night fell, he lost patience and  committed suicide. The Prophet was informed of that, and he said, &#8220;Allah is Greater!  I testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle.&#8221; Then he ordered Bilal to announce  amongst the people: &#8216;None will enter Paradise but a Muslim, and Allah may support this  religion (i.e. Islam) even with a disobedient man.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people of the tribes of Ril, Dhakwan, &#8216;Usiya and Bani  Lihyan came to the Prophet and claimed that they had embraced Islam, and they requested  him to support them with some men to fight their own people. The Prophet supported them  with seventy men from the Ansar whom we used to call Al-Qurra'(i.e. Scholars) who (out of  piety) used to cut wood during the day and pray all the night. So, those people took the  (seventy) men till they reached a place called Bi&#8217;r-Ma&#8217;ana where they betrayed and  martyred them. So, the Prophet invoked evil on the tribe of Ril, Dhakwan and Bani Lihyan  for one month in the prayer. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Qatada: Anas told us that they (i.e. Muslims) used  to recite a Quranic Verse concerning those martyrs which was:&#8211; &#8220;O Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My grandfather, Rafi said, &#8220;We were in the company of  the Prophet at DhulHulaifa, and the people suffered from hunger. We got some camels and  sheep (as booty) and the Prophet was still behind the people. They hurried and put the  cooking pots on the fire. (When he came) he ordered that the cooking pots should be upset  and then he distributed the booty (amongst the people) regarding ten sheep as equal to one  camel then a camel fled and the people chased it till they got tired, as they had a few  horses (for chasing it). So a man threw an arrow at it and caused it to stop (with Allah&#8217;s  Permission). On that the Prophet said, &#8216;Some of these animals behave like wild beasts, so,  if any animal flee from you, deal with it in the same way.&#8221; My grandfather asked (the  Prophet ), &#8220;We hope (or are afraid) that we may meet the enemy tomorrow and we have  no knives. Can we slaughter our animals with canes?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied,  &#8220;If the instrument used for killing causes the animal to bleed profusely and if  Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on killing it, then eat its meat (i.e. it is lawful) but won&#8217;t  use a tooth or a nail and I am telling you the reason: A tooth is a bone (and slaughtering  with a bone is forbidden ), and a nail is the slaughtering instrument of the  Ethiopians.&#8221; </font></p>

So I proceeded with  one hundred-and-fifty (men) from the tribe of Ahmas who were good cavalry. I informed the  Prophet that I could not sit firm on horses, so he stroke me on the chest with his hand  and I noticed his finger marks on my chest. He invoked, &#8216;O Allah! Make him firm and a  guiding and rightly-guided man.&#8221; Jarir set out towards that place, dismantled and  burnt it, and then sent the good news to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . The messenger of Jarir said to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I did  not come to you till it (i.e. the house) had been turned (black) like a scabby camel  (covered with tar).&#8221; So the Prophet invokes Allah to Bless the horses of the men of  Ahmas five times. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Abdur-Rahman who was one of the supporters of Uthman  said to Abu Talha who was one of the supporters of Ali, &#8220;I perfectly know what  encouraged your leader (i.e. &#8216;Ali) to shed blood. I heard him saying: Once the Prophet  sent me and Az-Zubair saying, &#8216;Proceed to such-and-such Ar-Roudah (place) where you will  find a lady whom Hatib has given a letter. So when we arrived at Ar-Roudah, we requested  the lady to hand over the letter to us. She said, &#8216;Hatib has not given me any letter.&#8217; We  said to her. &#8216;Take out the letter or else we will strip off your clothes.&#8217; So she took it  out of her braid. So the Prophet sent for Hatib, (who came) and said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t hurry in  judging me, for, by Allah, I have not become a disbeliever, and my love to Islam is  increasing. (The reason for writing this letter was) that there is none of your companions  but has relatives in Mecca who look after their families and property, while I have nobody  there, so I wanted to do them some favor (so that they might look after my family and  property).&#8217; The Prophet believed him. &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Allow me to chop off his (i.e. Hatib&#8217;s)  neck as he has done hypocrisy.&#8217; The Prophet said, (to &#8216;Umar), &#8216;Who knows, perhaps Allah  has looked at the warriors of Badr and said (to them), &#8216;Do whatever you like, for I have  forgiven you.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman added, &#8220;So this is what encouraged him (i.e.  Ali).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Ali: Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered me to distribute the  saddles and skins of the Budn which had slaughtered. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 497: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Uqba bin Amir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that the Prophet had given him sheep to distribute among  his companions and a male kid was left (after the distribution). When he informed the  Prophet of it, he said (to him), &#8220;Offer it as a sacrifice on your behalf.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.038.498"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 498: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I got an agreement written between me and Umaiya bin Khalaf  that Umaiya would look after my property (or family) in Mecca and I would look after his  in Medina. When I mentioned the word &#8216;Ar-Rahman&#8217; in the documents, Umaiya said, &#8220;I do  not know &#8216;Ar-Rahman.&#8217; Write down to me your name, (with which you called yourself) in the  Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance.&#8221; So, I wrote my name &#8216; &#8216;Abdu &#8216;Amr&#8217;. On the day (of  the battle) of Badr, when all the people went to sleep, I went up the hill to protect him.  Bilal(1) saw him (i.e. Umaiya) and went to a gathering of Ansar and said, &#8220;(Here is)  Umaiya bin Khalaf! Woe to me if he escapes!&#8221; So, a group of Ansar went out with Bilal  to follow us (&#8216;Abdur-Rahman and Umaiya). Being afraid that they would catch us, I left  Umaiya&#8217;s son for them to keep them busy but the Ansar killed the son and insisted on  following us. Umaiya was a fat man, and when they approached us, I told him to kneel down,  and he knelt, and I laid myself on him to protect him, but the Ansar killed him by passing  their swords underneath me, and one of them injured my foot with his sword. (The sub  narrator said, &#8221; &#8216;Abdur-Rahman used to show us the trace of the wound on the back of  his foot.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 499: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri and Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle employed someone as a governor at Khaibar.  When the man came to Medina, he brought with him dates called Janib. The Prophet asked  him, &#8220;Are all the dates of Khaibar of this kind?&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;(No),  we exchange two Sa&#8217;s of bad dates for one Sa of this kind of dates (i.e. Janib), or  exchange three Sa&#8217;s for two.&#8221; On that, the Prophet said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t do so, as it is  a kind of usury (Riba) but sell the dates of inferior quality for money, and then buy  Janib with the money&#8221;. The Prophet said the same thing about dates sold by weight.  (See Hadith No. 506). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 500: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Ka&#8217;b bin Malik from his father: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We had some sheep which used to graze at Sala&#8217;. One of our  slavegirls saw a sheep dying and she broke a stone and slaughtered the sheep with it. My  father said to the people, &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat it till I ask the Prophet about it (or till I  send somebody to ask the Prophet).&#8221; So, he asked or sent somebody to ask the Prophet,  and the Prophet permitted him to eat it. &#8216;Ubaidullah (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;I admire  that girl, for though she was a slave-girl, she dared to slaughter the sheep . &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 501: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet owed somebody a camel of a certain age. When he  came to demand it back, the Prophet said (to some people), &#8220;Give him (his due).&#8221;  When the people searched for a camel of that age, they found none, but found a camel one  year older. The Prophet said, &#8220;Give (it to) him.&#8221; On that, the man remarked,  &#8220;You have given me my right in full. May Allah give you in full.&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;The best amongst you is the one who pays the rights of others  generously.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.038.502"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 502: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to the Prophet demanding his debts and behaved  rudely. The companions of the Prophet intended to harm him, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle said (to  them), &#8220;Leave him, for the creditor (i.e. owner of a right) has the right to  speak.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;Give him a camel of the same age as that of  his.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! There is only a camel that is older  than his.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Give (it to) him, for the best amongst you is  he who pays the rights of others handsomely.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.038.503"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 503: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Marwan bin Al-Hakam and Al-Miswar bin Makhrama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin after embracing  Islam, came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he got up. They appealed to him to return their properties  and their captives. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to them, &#8220;The most beloved statement to me  is the true one. So, you have the option of restoring your properties or your captives,  for I have delayed distributing them.&#8221; The narrator added, Allah&#8217;s Apostle c had been  waiting for them for more than ten days on his return from Taif. When they realized that  Allah&#8217;s Apostle would return to them only one of two things, they said, &#8220;We choose  our captives.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up in the gathering of the Muslims, praised  Allah as He deserved, and said, &#8220;Then after! These brethren of yours have come to you  with repentance and I see it proper to return their captives to them. So, whoever amongst  you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you wants to stick to  his share till we pay him from the very first booty which Allah will give us then he can  do so.&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;We agree to give up our shares willingly as a favor  for Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t know who amongst you  has agreed and who hasn&#8217;t. Go back and your chiefs may tell us your opinion.&#8221; So, all  of them returned and their chiefs discussed the matter with them and then they (i.e. their  chiefs) came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to tell him that they (i.e. the people) had given up their  shares gladly and willingly. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 38, Number 504: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was accompanying the Prophet on a journey and was riding  a slow camel that was lagging behind the others. The Prophet passed by me and asked,  &#8220;Who is this?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What  is the matter, (why are you late)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I am riding a slow camel.&#8221;  He asked, &#8220;Do you have a stick?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He said,  &#8220;Give it to me.&#8221; When I gave it to him, he beat the camel and rebuked it. Then  that camel surpassed the others thenceforth. The Prophet said, &#8220;Sell it to me.&#8221;  I replied, &#8220;It is (a gift) for you, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Sell it  to me. I have bought it for four Dinars (gold pieces) and you can keep on riding it till  Medina.&#8221; When we approached Medina, I started going (towards my house). The Prophet  said, &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; I Sad, &#8220;I have married a widow.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Why have you not married a virgin to fondle with each other?&#8221; I said, &#8220;My  father died and left daughters, so I decided to marry a widow (an experienced woman) (to  look after them).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well done.&#8221; When we reached Medina, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;O Bilal, pay him (the price of the camel) and give him extra  money.&#8221; Bilal gave me four Dinars and one Qirat extra. (A sub-narrator said): Jabir  added, &#8220;The extra Qirat of Allah&#8217;s Apostle never parted from me.&#8221; The Qirat was  always in Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s purse. </font></p>

I want to give up myself to you.&#8221; A man said, &#8220;Marry her to me.&#8221;  The Prophet said, &#8220;We agree to marry her to you with what you know of the Qur&#8217;an by  heart.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle deputed me to keep Sadaqat (al-Fitr) of  Ramadan. A comer came and started taking handfuls of the foodstuff (of the Sadaqa)  (stealthily). I took hold of him and said, &#8220;By Allah, I will take you to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle .&#8221; He said, &#8220;I am needy and have many dependents, and I am in great  need.&#8221; I released him, and in the morning Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked me, &#8220;What did  your prisoner do yesterday?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The person complained  of being needy and of having many dependents, so, I pitied him and let him go.&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Indeed, he told you a lie and he will be coming again.&#8221; I  believed that he would show up again as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had told me that he would return.  So, I waited for him watchfully. When he (showed up and) started stealing handfuls of  foodstuff, I caught hold of him again and said, &#8220;I will definitely take you to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. He said, &#8220;Leave me, for I am very needy and have many dependents. I  promise I will not come back again.&#8221; I pitied him and let him go. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the morning Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked me, &#8220;What did  your prisoner do.&#8221; I replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He complained of his great  need and of too many dependents, so I took pity on him and set him free.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8220;Verily, he told you a lie and he will return.&#8221; I waited for him  attentively for the third time, and when he (came and) started stealing handfuls of the  foodstuff, I caught hold of him and said, &#8220;I will surely take you to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  as it is the third time you promise not to return, yet you break your promise and  come.&#8221; He said, &#8220;(Forgive me and) I will teach you some words with which Allah  will benefit you.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What are they?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Whenever you  go to bed, recite &#8220;Ayat-al-Kursi&#8221;&#8211; &#8216;Allahu la ilaha illa huwa-l-Haiy-ul Qaiyum&#8217;  till you finish the whole verse. (If you do so), Allah will appoint a guard for you who  will stay with you and no satan will come near you till morning. &#8221; So, I released  him. In the morning, Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;What did your prisoner do  yesterday?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;He claimed that he would teach me some words by which  Allah will benefit me, so I let him go.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;What are  they?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;He said to me, &#8216;Whenever you go to bed, recite Ayat-al-Kursi  from the beginning to the end &#8212;- Allahu la ilaha illa huwa-lHaiy-ul-Qaiyum&#8212;-.&#8217; He  further said to me, &#8216;(If you do so), Allah will appoint a guard for you who will stay with  you, and no satan will come near you till morning.&#8217; (Abu Huraira or another sub-narrator)  added that they (the companions) were very keen to do good deeds. The Prophet said,  &#8220;He really spoke the truth, although he is an absolute liar. Do you know whom you  were talking to, these three nights, O Abu Huraira?&#8221; Abu Huraira said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was Satan.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said al-Khudri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Bilal brought Barni (i.e. a kind of dates) to the  Prophet and the Prophet asked him, &#8220;From where have you brought these?&#8221; Bilal  replied, &#8220;I had some inferior type of dates and exchanged two Sas of it for one Sa of  Barni dates in order to give it to the Prophet; to eat.&#8221; Thereupon the Prophet said,  &#8220;Beware! Beware! This is definitely Riba (usury)! This is definitely Riba (Usury)!  Don&#8217;t do so, but if you want to buy (a superior kind of dates) sell the inferior dates for  money and then buy the superior kind of dates with that money.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When An-Nuaman or his son was brought in a state of  drunkenness, Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered all those who were present in the house to beat him.  I was one of those who beat him. We beat him with shoes and palm-leaf stalks. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I twisted the garlands of the Hadis (i.e. animals for  sacrifice) of Allah&#8217;s Apostle with my own hands. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle put them around  their necks with his own hands, and sent them with my father (to Mecca). Nothing legal was  regarded illegal for Allah&#8217;s Apostle till the animals were slaughtered. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Talha was the richest man in Medina amongst the Ansar  and Beeruha&#8217; (garden) was the most beloved of his property, and it was situated opposite  the mosque (of the Prophet.). Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to enter it and drink from its sweet  water. When the following Divine Verse were revealed: &#8216;you will not attain righteousness  till you spend in charity of the things you love&#8217; (3.93), Abu Talha got up in front of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah says in His Book, &#8216;You will not  attain righteousness unless you spend (in charity) that which you love,&#8217; and verily, the  most beloved to me of my property is Beeruha (garden), so I give it in charity and hope  for its reward from Allah. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Spend it wherever you like.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle appreciated that and said, &#8220;That is perishable wealth, that is perishable  wealth. I have heard what you have said; I suggest you to distribute it among your  relatives.&#8221; Abu Talha said, &#8220;I will do so, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; So, Abu  Talha distributed it among his relatives and cousins. The sub-narrator (Malik) said: The  Prophet said: &#8220;That is a profitable wealth,&#8221; instead of &#8220;perishable  wealth&#8221;. </font></p>

Verily when he died he was resting against my chest (or said: in my  lap) and he asked for a wash-basin and then collapsed while in that state, and I could not  even perceive that he had died, so when did he appoint him by will?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sad bin Abu Waqqas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet came visiting me while I was (sick) in Mecca,  (&#8216;Amir the sub-narrator said, and he disliked to die in the land, whence he had already  migrated). He (i.e. the Prophet) said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on Ibn Afra (Sad  bin Khaula).&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May I will all my property (in  charity)?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Then may I will half of it?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;No&#8221;. I said, &#8220;One third?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes, one third, yet  even one third is too much. It is better for you to leave your inheritors wealthy than to  leave them poor begging others, and whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s sake will be considered  as a charitable deed even the handful of food you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth. Allah may  lengthen your age so that some people may benefit by you, and some others be harmed by  you.&#8221; At that time Sad had only one daughter. </font></p>

This boy is for you as the boy belongs to the bed (where he was born), and  for the adulterer is the stone (i.e. deprivation).&#8221; Then the Prophet said to his wife  Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a, &#8220;Screen yourself from this boy,&#8221; when he saw the boy&#8217;s  resemblance to &#8216;Utba.

Don&#8217;t delay giving in charity  till the time when you are on the death bed when you say, &#8216;Give so much to so-and-so and  so much to so-and so,&#8217; and at that time the property is not yours but it belongs to  so-and-so (i.e. your inheritors).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Urwa bin Az-Zubair said that he asked &#8216;Aisha about the  meaning of the Quranic Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And if you fear that you will not deal fairly with  the orphan girls then marry (other) women of your choice.&#8221; (4.2-3) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aisha said, &#8220;It is about a female orphan under the  guardianship of her guardian who is inclined towards her because of her beauty and wealth,  and likes to marry her with a Mahr less than what is given to women of her standard. So  they (i.e. guardians) were forbidden to marry the orphans unless they paid them a full  appropriate Mahr (otherwise) they were ordered to marry other women instead of them. Later  on the people asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it. So Allah revealed the following Verse:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;They ask your instruction (O Muhammad!) regarding  women. Say: Allah instructs you regarding them&#8230;&#8221; (4.127) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>and in this Verse Allah indicated that if the orphan girl  was beautiful and wealthy, her guardian would have the desire to marry her without giving  her an appropriate Mahr equal to what her peers could get, but if she was undesirable for  lack of beauty or wealth, then he would not marry her, but seek to marry some other woman  instead of her. So, since he did not marry her when he had no inclination towards her, he  had not the right to marry her when he had an interest in her, unless he treated her  justly by giving her a full Mahr and securing all her rights. </font></p>

I have some property which I prize highly and I want to give it in charity.&#8221;  The Prophet; said, &#8220;Give it in charity (i.e. as an endowment) with its land and trees  on the condition that the land and trees will neither be sold nor given as a present, nor  bequeathed, but the fruits are to be spent in charity.&#8221; So &#8216;Umar gave it in charity,  and it was for Allah&#8217;s Cause, the emancipation of slaves, for the poor, for guests, for  travelers, and for kinsmen. The person acting as its administrator could eat from it  reasonably and fairly, and could let a friend of his eat from it provided he had no  intention of becoming wealthy by its means. </font></p>

So you can use it as Allah directs you.&#8221; On that the Prophet said,  &#8220;Bravo! It is a profitable (or perishable) property. (Ibn Maslama is not sure as to  which word is right, i.e. profitable or perishable.) I have heard what you have said, and  I recommend that you distribute this amongst your relatives.&#8221; On that Abu Talha said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will do (as you have suggested).&#8221; So, Abu Talha  distributed that garden amongst his relatives and cousins. </font></p>

When the time of plucking the  date-fruits came, I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! you know  that my father was martyred on Uhud&#8217;s day and owed much debt, and I wish that the  creditors would see you.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Go and collect the various kinds of  dates and place them separately in heaps&#8221;&#8216; I did accordingly and called him. On  seeing him, the creditors started claiming their rights pressingly at that time. When the  Prophet saw how they behaved, he went round the biggest heap for three times and sat over  it and said, &#8220;Call your companions (i.e. the creditors).&#8221; Then he kept on  measuring and giving them, till Allah cleared all my father&#8217;s debts. By Allah, it would  have pleased me that Allah would clear the debts of my father even though I had not taken  a single date to my sisters. But by Allah, all the heaps were complete, (as they were) and  I looked at the heap where Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sitting and noticed as if not a single date  had been taken thereof. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle , we used to give one Sa&#8217; of food (edible things)  as Sadaqat-ul-Fit,r (to the poor). Our food used to be either of barley, raisins (dried  grapes), cottage cheese or dates. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet made incumbent on every male or female, free man or  slave, the payment of one Sa&#8217; of dates or barley as Sadaqat-ul-Fitr (or said  Sadaqa-Ramadan).&#8221; The people then substituted half Sa&#8217; of wheat for that. Ibn &#8216;Umar  used to give dates (as Sadaqat-ulFitr). Once there was scarcity of dates in Medina and Ibn  &#8216;Umar gave barley. &#8216;And Ibn &#8216;Umar used to give Sadaqat-ul-Fitr for every young and old  person. He even used to give on behalf of my children. Ibn &#8216;Umar used to give  Sadaqatul-Fitr to those who had been officially appointed for its collection. People used  to give Sadaqat-ul-Fitr (even) a day or two before the &#8216;Id. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas : </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet once stayed for nineteen days and prayed  shortened prayers. So when we travel led (and stayed) for nineteen days, we used to  shorten the prayer but if we travelled (and stayed) for a longer period we used to offer  the full prayer. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle delaying the Maghrib prayer  till he offered it along with the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer whenever he was in a hurry during the  journey.&#8221; Salim narrated, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Umar used to do the same whenever he was in a  hurry during the journey.&#8221; And Salim added, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Umar used to pray the Maghrib  and &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers together in Al-Muzdalifa.&#8221; Salim said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Umar delayed the  Maghrib prayer because at that time he heard the news of the death of his wife Safiya bint  Abi &#8216;Ubaid. I said to him, &#8216;The prayer (is due).&#8217; He said, &#8216;Go on.&#8217; Again I said, &#8216;The  prayer (is due).&#8217; He said, &#8216;Go on,&#8217; till we covered two or three miles. Then he got down,  prayed and said, &#8216;I saw the Prophet praying in this way, whenever he was in a hurry during  the journey.&#8217; &#8216;Abdullah (bin &#8216;Umar) added, &#8220;Whenever the Prophet was in a hurry, he  used to delay the Maghrib prayer and then offer three Rakat (of the Maghrib) and perform  Taslim, and after waiting for a short while, Iqama used to be pronounced for the &#8216;Isha&#8217;  prayer when he would offer two Rakat and perform Taslim. He would never offer any optional  prayer till the middle of the night (when he used to pray the Tahajjud).&#8221; </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Witr Prayer</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.016.105"></a>Volume 2, Book 16, Number 105:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once a person asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the night prayer. Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;The night prayer is offered as two Rakat followed by two Rakat and so on and if anyone is afraid of the approaching dawn (Fajr prayer) he should pray one Raka and this will be a Witr for all the Rakat which he has prayed before.&#8221; Nafi&#8217; told that &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar used to say Taslim between (the first) two Rakat and (the third) odd one in the Witr prayer, when he wanted to attend to a certain matter (during that interval between the Rakat).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 106:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once I passed the night in the house of Maimuna (his aunt). I slept across the bed while Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his wife slept length-wise. The Prophet slept till midnight or nearly so and woke up rubbing his face and recited ten verses from Surat &#8220;Aal-Imran.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle went towards a leather skin and performed ablution in the most perfect way and then stood for the prayer. I did the same and stood beside him. The Prophet put his right hand on my head, twisted my ear and then prayed two Rakat five times and then ended his prayer with Witr. He laid down till the Muadh-dhin came then he stood up and offered two Rakat (Sunna of Fajr prayer) and then went out and offered the Fajr prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(See Hadith No. 183, Vol. 1)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 107:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Night prayer is offered as two Rakat followed by two Rakat and so on, and if you want to finish it, pray only one Raka which will be Witr for all the previous Rakat.&#8221; Al-Qasim said, &#8220;Since we attained the age of puberty we have seen some people offering a three-Rakat prayer as Witr and all that is permissible. I hope there will be no harm in it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 108:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray eleven Rakat at night and that was his night prayer and each of his prostrations lasted for a period enough for one of you to recite fifty verses before Allah&#8217;s Apostle raised his head. He also used to pray two Rakat (Sunna) before the (compulsory) Fajr prayer and then lie down on his right side till the Muadh-dhin came to him for the prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 109:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Sirin:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Ibn &#8216;Umar, &#8220;What is your opinion about the two Rakat before the Fajr (compulsory) prayer, as to prolonging the recitation in them?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to pray at night two Rakat followed by two and so on, and end the prayer by one Raka Witr. He used to offer two Rakat before the Fajr prayer immediately after the Adhan.&#8221; (Hammad, the sub-narrator said, &#8220;That meant (that he prayed) quickly.)&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 110:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered Witr prayer at different nights at various hours extending (from the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer) up to the last hour of the night.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 111:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) used to offer his night prayer while I was sleeping across in his bed. Whenever he intended to offer the Witr prayer, he used to wake me up and I would offer the Witr prayer too.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 112:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Make s your last prayer at night.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 113:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin Yasar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was going to Mecca in the company of &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar and when I apprehended the approaching dawn, I dismounted and offered the Witr prayer and then joined him. &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Where have you been?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I apprehended the approaching dawn so I dismounted and prayed the Witr prayer.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it sufficient for you to follow the good example of Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;Yes, by Allah.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray Witr on the back of the camel (while on a journey).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 114:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to offer (Nawafil) prayers on his Rahila (mount) facing its direction by signals, but not the compulsory prayer. He also used to pray Witr on his (mount) Rahila.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 115:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin Sirin:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas was asked, &#8220;Did the Prophet recite Qunut in the Fajr prayer?&#8221; Anas replied in the affirmative. He was further asked, &#8220;Did he recite Qunut before bowing?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;He recited Qunut after bowing for some time (for one month).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 116:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Asim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Anas bin Malik about the Qunut. Anas replied, &#8220;Definitely it was (recited)&#8221;. I asked, &#8220;Before bowing or after it?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;Before bowing.&#8221; I added, &#8220;So and so has told me that you had informed him that it had been after bowing.&#8221; Anas said, &#8220;He told an untruth (i.e. &#8220;was mistaken,&#8221; according to the Hijazi dialect). Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited Qunut after bowing for a period of one month.&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;The Prophet sent about seventy men (who knew the Quran by heart) towards the pagans (of Najd) who were less than they in number and there was a peace treaty between them and Allah&#8217;s Apostles (but the Pagans broke the treaty and killed the seventy men). So Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited Qunut for a period of one month asking Allah to punish them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 117:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet recited Qunut for one month (in the Fajr prayer) asking Allah to punish the tribes of Ral and Dhakwan.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 16, Number 118:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qunut used to be recited in the Maghrib and the Fajr prayers.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 7:</p>
<h3 align="center">Rubbing hands and feet with dust(Tayammum)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.007.330"></a>Volume 1, Book 7, Number 330:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) We set out with Allahs Apostle on one of his journeys till we reached Al-Baida&#8217; or Dhatul-Jaish, a necklace of mine was broken (and lost). Allah&#8217;s Apostle stayed there to search for it, and so did the people along with him. There was no water at that place, so the people went to Abu- Bakr As-Siddiq and said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see what &#8216;Aisha has done? She has made Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people stay where there is no water and they have no water with them.&#8221; Abu Bakr came while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was sleeping with his head on my thigh, He said, to me: &#8220;You have detained Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the people where there is no water and they have no water with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he admonished me and said what Allah wished him to say and hit me on my flank with his hand. Nothing prevented me from moving (because of pain) but the position of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my thigh. Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up when dawn broke and there was no water. So Allah revealed the Divine Verses of Tayammum. So they all performed Tayammum. Usaid bin Hudair said, &#8220;O the family of Abu Bakr! This is not the first blessing of yours.&#8221; Then the camel on which I was riding was caused to move from its place and the necklace was found beneath it.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 331:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I have been given five things which were not given to any one else before me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allah made me victorious by awe, (by His frightening my enemies) for a distance of one month&#8217;s journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for praying and a thing to perform Tayammum, therefore anyone of my followers can pray wherever the time of a prayer is due.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The booty has been made Halal (lawful) for me yet it was not lawful for anyone else before me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. I have been given the right of intercession (on the Day of Resurrection).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation only but I have been sent to all mankind.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 332:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said, &#8220;I borrowed a necklace from Asma&#8217; and it was lost. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent a man to search for it and he found it. Then the time of the prayer became due and there was no water. They prayed (without ablution) and informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it, so the verse of Tayammum was revealed.&#8221; Usaid bin Hudair said to &#8216;Aisha, &#8220;May Allah reward you. By Allah, whenever anything happened which you did not like, Allah brought good for you and for the Muslims in that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Jurf and the time for the &#8216;Asr prayer became due while he was at Marbad-AnNa&#8217;am (sheep-fold), so he (performed Tayammum) and prayed there and then entered Medina when the sun was still high but he did not repeat that prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 333:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Juhaim Al-Ansari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet came from the direction of Bir Jamal. A man met him and greeted him. But he did not return back the greeting till he went to a (mud) wall and smeared his hands and his face with its dust (performed Tayammum) and then returned back the greeting.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 334:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abza:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab and said, &#8220;I became Junub but no water was available.&#8221; &#8216;Ammar bin Yasir said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;Do you remember that you and I (became Junub while both of us) were together on a journey and you didn&#8217;t pray but I rolled myself on the ground and prayed? I informed the Prophet about it and he said, &#8216;It would have been sufficient for you to do like this.&#8217; The Prophet then stroked lightly the earth with his hands and then blew off the dust and passed his hands over his face and hands.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 335:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Said bin &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abza:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(on the authority of his father who said) &#8216;Ammar said so (the above Statement). And Shu&#8217;ba stroked lightly the earth with his hands and brought them close to his mouth (blew off the dust) and passed them over his face and then the backs of his hands. &#8216;Ammar said, &#8220;Ablution (meaning Tayammum here) is sufficient for a Muslim if water is not available.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 336:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abza:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that while he was in the company of &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Ammar said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;We were in a detachment and became Junub and I blew the dust off my hands (performed the rolling over the earth and prayed.)&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 337:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abza:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ammar said to &#8216;Umar &#8220;I rolled myself in the dust and came to the Prophet who said, &#8216;Passing dusted hands over the face and the backs of the hands is sufficient for you.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 338:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ammar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">as above.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 339:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ammar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet stroked the earth with his hands and then passed them over his face and the backs of his hands (while demonstrating Tayammum).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 340:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we were traveling with the Prophet and we carried on traveling till the last part of the night and then we (halted at a place) and slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in the last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake up was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator &#8216;Auf said that Abu Raja&#8217; had told him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to sleep, nobody would wake up him till he himself used to get up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, &#8216;Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; and raised his voice with Takbir, and kept on saying loudly till the Prophet got up because of it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had happened to them. He said, &#8220;There is no harm (or it will not be harmful). Depart!&#8221; So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, &#8220;O so and so! What has prevented you from praying with us?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I am Junub and there is no water. &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform Tayammum with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator &#8216;Auf added that Abu Raja&#8217; had named him but he had forgotten) and &#8216;Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, &#8220;Where can we find water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I was there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are behind me.&#8221; They requested her to accompany them. She asked, &#8220;Where?&#8221; They said, &#8220;To Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; She said, &#8220;Do you mean the man who is called the Sabi, (with a new religion)?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, the same person. So come along.&#8221; They brought her to the Prophet and narrated the whole story. He said, &#8220;Help her to dismount.&#8221; The Prophet asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured some water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and opened the small ones and the people were called upon to drink and water their animals. So they all watered their animals and they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others and last of all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to the person who was Junub and told him to pour it over his body. The woman was standing and watching all that which they were doing with her water. By Allah, when her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full (of water) than they had been before (Miracle of Allah&#8217;s Apostle) Then the Prophet ordered us to collect something for her; so dates, flour and Sawiq were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in a piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth full of food-stuff was also placed in front of her and then the Prophet said to her, &#8220;We have not taken your water but Allah has given water to us.&#8221; She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: &#8220;O so and so what has delayed you?&#8221; She said, &#8220;A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called the Sabi&#8217; and he did such and such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her index and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is Allah&#8217;s true Apostle.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but never touched her village. One day she said to her people, &#8220;I think that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any inclination to Islam?&#8221; They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu &#8216;Abdultah said: The word Saba&#8217;a means &#8220;The one who has deserted his old religion and embraced a new religion.&#8221; Abul &#8216;Ailya said, &#8220;The Sabis are a sect of people of the Scripture who recite the Book of Psalms.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Muisa said to&#8217;Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;ud, &#8220;If one does not find water (for ablution) can he give up the prayer?&#8221; Abdullah replied, &#8220;If you give the permission to perform Tayammum they will perform Tayammum even if water was available if one of them found it cold.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;What about the statement of &#8216;Ammar to &#8216;Umar?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;Umar was not satisfied by his statement.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 342:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shaqiq bin Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with &#8216;Abdullah and Abu Musa; the latter asked the former, &#8220;O Abu AbdurRahman! What is your opinion if somebody becomes Junub and no water is available?&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;Do not pray till water is found.&#8221; Abu Musa said, &#8220;What do you say about the statement of &#8216;Ammar (who was ordered by the Prophet to perform Tayammum). The Prophet said to him: &#8220;Perform Tayammum and that would be sufficient.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that &#8216;Umar was not satisfied by &#8216;Ammar&#8217;s statement?&#8221; Abu- Musa said, &#8220;All right, leave &#8216;Ammalr&#8217;s statement, but what will you say about this verse (of Tayammum)?&#8221; &#8216;Abqiullah kept quiet and then said, &#8220;If we allowed it, then they would probably perform Tayammum even if water was available, if one of them found it (water) cold.&#8221; The narrator added, &#8220;I said to Shaqrq, &#8220;Then did &#8216;Abdullah dislike to perform Tayammum because of this?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 343:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-A&#8217;mash:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaqiq said, &#8220;While I was sitting with &#8216;Abdullah and Abu Musa Al-Ash-&#8216;ari, the latter asked the former, &#8216;If a person becomes Junub and does not find water for one month, can he perform Tayammum and offer his prayer?&#8217; (He applied in the negative). Abu Musa said, &#8216;What do you say about this verse from Surat &#8220;Al-Ma&#8217;ida&#8221;: When you do not find water then perform Tayammum with clean earth? &#8216;Abdullah replied, &#8216;If we allowed it then they would probably perform Tayammum with clean earth even if water were available but cold.&#8217; I said to Shaqiq, &#8216;You then disliked to perform Tayammum because of this?&#8217; Shaqiq said,&#8217;Yes.&#8217; (Shaqiq added), &#8220;Abu Musa said, &#8216;Haven&#8217;t you heard the statement of &#8216;Ammar to &#8216;Umar? He said: I was sent out by Allah&#8217;s Apostle for some job and I became Junub and could not find water so I rolled myself over the dust (clean earth) like an animal does, and when I told the Prophet of that he said, &#8216;Like this would have been sufficient.&#8217; The Prophet (saying so) lightly stroked the earth with his hand once and blew it off, then passed his (left) hand over the back of his right hand or his (right) hand over the back of his left hand and then passed them over his face.&#8217; So &#8216;Abdullah said to Abu- Musa, &#8216;Don&#8217;t you know that &#8216;Umar was not satisfied with &#8216;Ammar&#8217;s statement?&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shaqiq: While I was with &#8216;Abdullah and Abu Musa, the latter said to the former, &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you heard the statement of &#8216;Ammar to &#8216;Umar? He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent you and me out and I became Junub and rolled myself in the dust (clean earth) (for Tayammum). When we came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle I told him about it and he said, &#8216;This would have been sufficient,&#8217; passing his hands over his face and the backs of his hands once only.&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 7, Number 344:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran bin Husain Al-Khuza&#8217;i:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw a person sitting aloof and not praying with the people. He asked him, &#8220;O so and so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with the people?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I am Junub and there is no water.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform Tayammum with clean earth and that will be sufficient for you.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Times of the Prayers</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.010.500"></a>Volume 1, Book 10, Number 500:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once&#8217;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz delayed the prayer and &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair went to him and said, &#8220;Once in &#8216;Iraq, Al-MughTra bin Shu&#8217;ba delayed his prayers and Abi Mas&#8217;ud Al-Ansari went to him and said, &#8216;O Mughira! What is this? Don&#8217;t you know that once Gabriel came and offered the prayer (Fajr prayer) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle prayed too, then he prayed again (Zuhr prayer) and so did Allah&#8217;s Apostle and again he prayed (&#8216;Asr prayers and Allah&#8217;s Apostle did the same; again he prayed (Maghrib-prayer) and so did Allah&#8217;s Apostle and again prayed (&#8216;Isha prayer) and so did Allah&#8217;s Apostle and (Gabriel) said, &#8216;I was ordered to do so (to demonstrate the prayers prescribed to you)?'&#8221; &#8216;Umar (bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;AzTz) said to &#8216;Urwa, &#8220;Be sure of what you Say. Did Gabriel lead Allah&#8217;s Apostle at the stated times of the prayers?&#8221; &#8216;Urwa replied, &#8220;Bashir bin Abi Mas&#8217;ud narrated like this on the authority of his father.&#8221; Urwa added, &#8220;Aisha told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to pray &#8216;Asr prayer when the sun-shine was still inside her residence (during the early time of &#8216;Asr).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 501:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Once a delegation of &#8216;Abdul Qais came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;We belong to such and such branch of the tribe of Rab&#8217;a and we can only come to you in the sacred months. Order us to do something good so that we may (carry out) take it from you and also invite to it our people whom we have left behind (at home).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8221; I order you to do four things and forbid you from four things. (The first four are as follows):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. To believe in Allah. (And then he: explained it to them i.e.) to testify that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and (Muhammad) am Allah&#8217;s Apostle</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. To offer prayers perfectly (at the stated times):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. To pay Zakat (obligatory charity)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. To give me Khumus</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The other four things which are forbidden are as follows):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Dubba</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Hantam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Muqaiyat</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Naqir (all these are utensils used for the preparation of alcoholic drinks).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 502:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jarir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I gave the pledge of allegiance to Allah&#8217;s Apostle for to offer prayers perfectly, to pay Zakat regularly, and to give good advice to every Muslim.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 503:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Shaqiq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he had heard Hudhaifa saying, &#8220;Once I was sitting with &#8216;Umar and he said, &#8216;Who amongst you remembers the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the afflictions?&#8217; I said, &#8216;I know it as the Prophet had said it.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;No doubt you are bold.&#8217; I said, &#8216;The afflictions caused for a man by his wife, money, children and neighbor are expiated by his prayers, fasting, charity and by enjoining (what is good) and forbidding (what is evil).&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;I did not mean that but I asked about that affliction which will spread like the waves of the sea.&#8217; I (Hudhaifa) said, &#8216;O leader of the faithful believers! You need not be afraid of it as there is a closed door between you and it.&#8217; &#8216;Umar asked, Will the door be broken or opened?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;It will be broken.&#8217; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;Then it will never be closed again.&#8217; I was asked whether &#8216;Umar knew that door. I replied that he knew it as one knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning. I narrated a Hadith that was free from any mis-statement&#8221; The subnarrator added that they deputed Masruq to ask Hudhaifa (about the door). Hudhaifa said, &#8220;The door was &#8216;Umar himself.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 504:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Mas&#8217;ud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man kissed a woman (unlawfully) and then went to the Prophet and informed him. Allah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And offer prayers perfectly At the two ends of the day And in some hours of the night (i.e. the five compulsory prayers). Verily! good deeds remove (annul) the evil deeds (small sins) (11.114). The man asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;Is it for me?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is for all my followers.&#8221;</p>

The Prophet came out and said, &#8216;None amongst the dwellers of the earth but you have been waiting for the prayer.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar did not find any harm in praying it earlier or in delaying it unless he was afraid that sleep might overwhelm him and he might miss the prayer, and sometimes he used to sleep before the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer.

<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with the Prophet on a full moon night. He looked at the moon and said, &#8220;You will certainly see your Lord as you see this moon, and there will be no trouble in seeing Him. So if you can avoid missing (through sleep, business, etc.) a prayer before the rising of the sun (Fajr) and before its setting (&#8216;Asr) you must do so. He (the Prophet ) then recited the following verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And celebrate the praises Of Your Lord before The rising of the sun And before (its) setting.&#8221; (50.39)</p>

The Prophet got up when the edge of the sun had risen and said, &#8216;O Bilal! What about your statement?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I have never slept such a sleep.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Allah captured your souls when He wished, and released them when He wished. O Bilal! Get up and pronounce the Adhan for the prayer.&#8217; The Prophet performed ablution and when the sun came up and became bright, he stood up and prayed.&#8221;</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 573:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu-l-Minhal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father and I went to Abi Barza Al-Aslami and my father said to him, &#8220;Tell us how Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to offer the compulsory congregational prayers.&#8221; He said, &#8220;He used to pray the Zuhr prayer, which you call the first prayer, as the sun declined at noon, the &#8216;Asr at a time when one of US could go to his family at the farthest place in Medina while the sun was still hot. (The narrator forgot what Abu Barza had said about the Maghrib prayer), and the Prophet preferred to pray the &#8216;Isha&#8217; late and disliked to sleep before it or talk after it. And he used to return after finishing the morning prayer at such a time when it was possible for one to recognize the person sitting by his side and he (the Prophet) used to recite 60 to 100 &#8216;Ayat&#8217; (verses) of the Qur&#8217;an in it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Once he waited for Al-Hasan and he did not show up till it was about the usual time for him to start his speech; then he came and apologized saying, &#8220;Our neighbors invited us.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;Narrated Anas, &#8216;Once we waited for the Prophet till it was midnight or about midnight. He came and led the prayer, and after finishing it, he addressed us and said, &#8216;All the people prayed and then slept and you had been in prayer as long as you were waiting for it.&#8221; Al-Hasan said, &#8220;The people are regarded as performing good deeds as long as they are waiting for doing good deeds.&#8221; Al-Hasan&#8217;s statement is a portion of Anas&#8217;s Hadith from the Prophet .</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 575:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet prayed one of the&#8217;lsha&#8217; prayer in his last days and after finishing it with Taslim, he stood up and said, &#8220;Do you realize (the importance of) this night? Nobody present on the</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">surface of the earth to-night would be living after the completion of one hundred years from this night.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people made a mistake in grasping the meaning of this statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and they indulged in those things which are said about these narrators (i.e. some said that the Day of Resurrection will be established after 100 years etc.) But the Prophet said, &#8220;Nobody present on the surface of earth tonight would be living after the completion of 100 years from this night&#8221;; he meant &#8220;When that century (people of that century) would pass away.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 1, Book 10, Number 576:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu &#8216;Uthman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abi Bakr said, &#8220;The Suffa Companions were poor people and the Prophet said, &#8216;Whoever has food for two persons should take a third one from them (Suffa companions). And whosoever has food for four persons he should take one or two from them&#8217; Abu Bakr took three men and the Prophet took ten of them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdur Rahman added, my father my mother and I were there (in the house). (The sub-narrator is in doubt whether &#8216;Abdur Rahman also said, &#8216;My wife and our servant who was common for both my house and Abu Bakr&#8217;s house). Abu Bakr took his supper with the Prophet and remained there till the &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayer was offered. Abu Bakr went back and stayed with the Prophet till the Prophet took his meal and then Abu Bakr returned to his house after a long portion of the night had passed. Abu Bakr&#8217;s wife said, &#8216;What detained you from your guests (or guest)?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Have you not served them yet?&#8217; She said, &#8216;They refused to eat until you come. The food was served for them but they refused.&#8221; &#8216;Abdur Rahman added, &#8220;I went away and hid myself (being afraid of Abu Bakr) and in the meantime he (Abu Bakr) called me, &#8216;O Ghunthar (a harsh word)!&#8217; and also called me bad names and abused me and then said (to his family), &#8216;Eat. No welcome for you.&#8217; Then (the supper was served). Abu Bakr took an oath that he would not eat that food. The narrator added: By Allah, whenever any one of us (myself and the guests of Suffa companions) took anything from the food, it increased from underneath. We all ate to our fill and the food was more than it was before its serving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr looked at it (the food) and found it as it was before serving or even more than that. He addressed his wife (saying) &#8216;O the sister of Bani Firas! What is this?&#8217; She said, &#8216;O the pleasure of my eyes! The food is now three times more than it was before.&#8217; Abu Bakr ate from it, and said, &#8216;That (oath) was from Satan&#8217; meaning his oath (not to eat). Then he again took a morsel (mouthful) from it and then took the rest of it to the Prophet. So that meal was with the Prophet. There was a treaty between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed the Prophet divided us into twelve (groups) (the Prophet&#8217;s companions) each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the command of each (leader). So all of them (12 groups of men) ate of that meal.&#8221;</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 18:</p>
<h3 align="center">Eclipses</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.018.150"></a>Volume 2, Book 18, Number 150:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle when the sun eclipsed. Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up dragging his cloak till he entered the Mosque. He led us in a two-Rakat prayer till the sun (eclipse) had cleared. Then the Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of someone&#8217;s death. So whenever you see these eclipses pray and invoke (Allah) till the eclipse is over.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 151:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Masud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death of someone from the people but they are two signs amongst the signs of Allah. When you see them stand up and pray.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 152:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life (i.e. birth) of someone but they are two signs amongst the signs of Allah. When you see them offer the prayer.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 153:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The sun eclipsed in the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day when (his son) Ibrahim died. So the people said that the sun had eclipsed because of the death of Ibrahim. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of the death or life (i.e. birth) of some-one. When you see the eclipse pray and invoke Allah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 154:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) the sun eclipsed, so he led the people in prayer, and stood up and performed a long Qiyam, then bowed for a long while. He stood up again and performed a long Qiyam but this time the period of standing was shorter than the first. He bowed again for a long time but shorter than the first one, then he prostrated and prolonged the prostration. He did the same in the second Raka as he did in the first and then finished the prayer; by then the sun (eclipse) had cleared. He delivered the Khutba (sermon) and after praising and glorifying Allah he said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs against the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse on the death or life of anyone. So when you see the eclipse, remember Allah and say Takbir, pray and give Sadaqa.&#8221; The Prophet then said, &#8220;O followers of Muhammad! By Allah! There is none who has more ghaira (self-respect) than Allah as He has forbidden that His slaves, male or female commit adultery (illegal sexual intercourse). O followers of Muhammad! By Allah! If you knew that which I know you would laugh little and weep much.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 155:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the sun eclipsed in the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle an announcement was made that a prayer was to be offered in congregation.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 156:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) In the lifetime of the Prophet the sun eclipsed and he went to the Mosque and the people aligned behind him. He said the Takbir (starting the prayer) and prolonged the recitation (from the Quran) and then said Takbir and performed a prolonged bowing; then he (lifted his head and) said, &#8220;Sami allahu liman hamidah&#8221; (Allah heard him who sent his praises to Him). He then did not prostrate but stood up and recited a prolonged recitation which was shorter than the first recitation. He again said Takbir and then bowed a prolonged bowing but shorter than the first one and then said, &#8220;Sami &#8216;a-l-lahu Lyman hamidah Rabbana walak-lhamd, (Allah heard him who sent his praises to Him. O our Sustainer! All the praises are for You)&#8221; and then prostrated and did the same in the second Raka; thus he completed four bowing and four prostrations. The sun (eclipse) had cleared before he finished the prayer. (After the prayer) he stood up, glorified and praised Allah as He deserved and then said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. They do not eclipse because of the death or the life (i.e. birth) of someone. When you see them make haste for the prayer.&#8221; Narrated Az-Zuhri: I said to &#8216;Ursa, &#8220;When the sun eclipsed at Medina your brother (&#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair) offered only a two-Rakat prayer like that of the morning (Fajr) prayer.&#8221; &#8216;Ursa replied, &#8220;Yes, for he missed the Prophet&#8217;s tradition (concerning this matter).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 157:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) On the day when the sun Khasafat (eclipsed) Allah&#8217;s Apostle prayed; he stood up and said Takbir and recited a prolonged recitation, then he performed a prolonged bowing, then he raised his head and said, &#8220;Sami&#8217;a-l-lahu Lyman Hamidah,&#8221; and then remained standing and recited a prolonged recitation which was shorter than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first. Then he prostrated and prolonged the prostration and he did the same in the second Raka as in the first and then finished the prayer with Taslim. By that time the sun (eclipse) had cleared He addressed the people and said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse (Yakhsifan) because of the death or the life (i.e. birth) of someone. So when you see them make haste for the prayer.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 158:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said: &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs amongst the signs of Allah and they do not eclipse because of the death of someone but Allah frightens His devotees with them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 159:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;AbdurRahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jewess came to ask &#8216;Aisha (the wife of the Prophet) about something. She said to her, &#8220;May Allah give you refuge from the punishment of the grave.&#8221; So &#8216;Aisha &#8216; asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Would the people be punished in their graves?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle after seeking refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave (and thus replied in the affirmative). Then one day, Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode to go to some place but the sun eclipsed. He returned in the forenoon and passed through the rear of the dwellings (of his wives) and stood for the (eclipse) prayer, and the people stood behind him. He stood up for a long period and then performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first bowing. Then he raised his head and prostrated. Then he stood up (for the second Raka) for a long while but the standing was shorter than that of the first Raka. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first one. Then he raised his head and prostrated. Then he stood up for a long time but shorter than the first. Then he performed a prolonged bowing but shorter than the first. Then he raised his head and prostrated and finished the prayer and (then delivered the sermon and) said as much as Allah wished. And then he ordered the people to seek refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 160:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the sun eclipsed in the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and an announcement was made that the prayer was to be held in congregation. The Prophet performed two bowing in one Raka. Then he stood up and performed two bowing in one Raka. Then he sat down and finished the prayer; and by then the (eclipse) had cleared &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;I had never performed such a long prostration.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 161:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun eclipsed in the life-time of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) . Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the eclipse prayer and stood for a long period equal to the period in which one could recite Surat-al-Baqara. Then he bowed for a long time and then stood up for a long period which was shorter than that of the first standing, then bowed again for a long time but for a shorter period than the first; then he prostrated twice and then stood up for a long period which was shorter than that of the first standing; then he bowed for a long time which was shorter than the previous one, and then he raised his head and stood up for a long period which was shorter than the first standing, then he bowed for a long time which was shorter than the first bowing, and then prostrated (twice) and finished the prayer. By then, the sun (eclipse) had cleared. The Prophet then said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two of the signs of Allah. They eclipse neither because of the death of somebody nor because of his life (i.e. birth). So when you see them, remember Allah.&#8221; The people say, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We saw you taking something from your place and then we saw you retreating.&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;I saw Paradise and stretched my hands towards a bunch (of its fruits) and had I taken it, you would have eaten from it as long as the world remains. I also saw the Hell-fire and I had never seen such a horrible sight. I saw that most of the inhabitants were women.&#8221; The people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Why is it so?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Because of their ungratefulness.&#8221; It was asked whether they are ungrateful to Allah. The Prophet said, &#8220;They are ungrateful to their companions of life (husbands) and ungrateful to good deeds. If you are benevolent to one of them throughout the life and if she sees anything (undesirable) in you, she will say, &#8216;I have never had any good from you.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 162:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Fatima bint Al-Mundhir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Asma&#8217; bint Al Bakr said, &#8220;I came to &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) during the solar eclipse. The people were standing and offering the prayer and she was also praying too. I asked her, &#8216;What has happened to the people?&#8217; She pointed out with her hand towards the sky and said, &#8216;Subhan-Allah&#8217;. I said, &#8216;Is there a sign?&#8217; She pointed out in the affirmative.&#8221; Asma&#8217; further said, &#8220;I too then stood up for the prayer till I fainted and then poured water on my head. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished his prayer, he thanked and praised Allah and said, &#8216;I have seen at this place of mine what I have never seen even Paradise and Hell. No doubt, it has been inspired to me that you will be put to trial in the graves like or nearly like the trial of (Masih) Ad-Dajjal. (I do not know which one of the two Asma&#8217; said.) (The angels) will come to everyone of you and will ask what do you know about this man (i.e. Muhammad). The believer or a firm believer (I do not know which word Asma&#8217; said) will reply, &#8216;He is Muhammad, Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) who came to us with clear evidences and guidance, so we accepted his teachings, believed and followed him.&#8217; The angels will then say to him, &#8216;Sleep peacefully as we knew surely that you were a firm believer.&#8217; The hypocrite or doubtful person (I do not know which word Asma&#8217; said) will say, &#8216;I do not know. I heard the people saying something so I said it (the same).&#8217; &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 163:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Asma:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt the Prophet ordered people to manumit slaves during the solar eclipse.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 164:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;AbdurRahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jewess came to &#8216;Aisha to ask her about something and then she said, &#8220;May Allah give you refuge from the punishment of the grave.&#8221; So &#8216;Aisha asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;Would the people be punished in their graves?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked Allah&#8217;s refuge from the punishment of the grave (indicating an affirmative reply). Then one day Allah&#8217;s Apostle rode (to leave for some place) but the sun eclipsed. He returned on the forenoon and passed through the rear of the dwellings (of his wives) and stood up and started offering the (eclipse) prayer and the people stood behind him. He stood for a long period and then performed a long bowing and then stood straight for a long period which was shorter than that of the first standing, then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first bowing, then he raised his head and prostrated for a long time and then stood up (for the second Raka) for a long while, but the standing was shorter than the standing of the first Raka. Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than that of the first one. He then stood up for a long time but shorter than the first, then again performed a long bowing which was shorter than the first and then prostrated for a shorter while than that of the first prostration. Then he finished the prayer and delivered the sermon and) said what Allah wished; and ordered the people to seek refuge with Allah from the punishment of the grave.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of someone&#8217;s death or life but they are two signs amongst the signs of Allah, so pray whenever you see them.&#8221;</p>

Then he performed a prolonged bowing which was shorter than the first and then lifted his head and performed two prostrations. He then stood up for the second Raka and offered it like the first. Then he stood up and said, &#8220;The sun and the moon do not eclipse because of someone&#8217;s life or death but they are two signs amongst the signs of Allah which He shows to His worshipers.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun eclipsed and the Prophet got up, being afraid that it might be the Hour (i.e. Day of Judgment). He went to the Mosque and offered the prayer with the longest Qiyam, bowing and prostration that I had ever seen him doing. Then he said, &#8220;These signs which Allah sends do not occur because of the life or death of somebody, but Allah makes His worshipers afraid by them. So when you see anything thereof, proceed to remember Allah, invoke Him and ask for His forgiveness.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day of Ibrahim&#8217;s death, the sun eclipsed and the people said that the eclipse was due to the death of Ibrahim (the son of the Prophet). Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs amongst the signs of Allah. They do not eclipse because of someone&#8217;s death or life.

<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of the Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) the sun eclipsed and he went out dragging his clothes till he reached the Mosque. The people gathered around him and he led them and offered two Rakat. When the sun (eclipse) cleared, he said, &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs amongst the signs of Allah; they do not eclipse because of the death of someone, and so when an eclipse occurs, pray and invoke Allah till the eclipse is over.&#8221; It happened that a son of the Prophet called Ibrahim died on that day and the people were talking about that (saying that the eclipse was caused by his death).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 171:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet led us and performed four bowing in two Rakat during the solar eclipse and the first Raka was longer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 18, Number 172:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (p.b.u.h) recited (the Quran) aloud during the eclipse prayer and when he had finished the eclipse prayer he said the Takbir and bowed. When he stood straight from bowing he would say &#8220;Sami &#8216;al-l-ahu Lyman hamidah Rabbana walaka-l-hamd.&#8221; And he would again start reciting. In the eclipse prayer there are four bowing and four prostrations in two Rakat. Al-Auza&#8217;i and others said that they had heard Az-Zuhi from &#8216;Ursa from &#8216;Aisha saying, &#8220;In the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle the sun eclipsed, and he made a person to announce: &#8216;Prayer in congregation.&#8217; He led the prayer and performed four bowing and four prostrations in two Rakat.&#8221; Narrated Al-Walid that &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Namir had informed him that he had heard the same. Ibn Shihab heard the same. Az-Zuhrl said, &#8220;I asked (&#8216;Ursa), &#8216;What did your brother &#8216;Abdullah bin AzZubair do? He prayed two Rakat (of the eclipse prayer) like the morning prayer, when he offered the (eclipse) prayer in Median.&#8217; &#8216;Ursa replied that he had missed (i.e. did not pray according to) the Prophet&#8217;s tradition.&#8221; Sulaiman bin Kathir and Sufyan bin Husain narrated from Az-Zuhri that the prayer for the eclipse used to be offered with loud recitation.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 1: </font></p>
<h3 align="center"><font>Revelation </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.001.001">Volume 1, Book 1,Number 1: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The  reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward according  to what he has intended. So whoever emigrated for worldly benefits or for a woman to  marry, his emigration was for what he emigrated for.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.001.002"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 1, Number 2: </font></p>
<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the mother of the faithful believers)  Al-Harith bin Hisham asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How is the Divine  Inspiration revealed to you?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;Sometimes it is  (revealed) like the ringing of a bell, this form of Inspiration is the hardest of all and  then this state passes &#8216; off after I have grasped what is inspired. Sometimes the Angel  comes in the form of a man and talks to me and I grasp whatever he says.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha  added: Verily I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the  Sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over). </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.001.003"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 1, Number 3: </font></p>
<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the mother of the faithful believers) The  commencement of the Divine Inspiration to Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in the form of good dreams  which came true like bright day light, and then the love of seclusion was bestowed upon  him. He used to go in seclusion in the cave of Hira where he used to worship (Allah alone)  continuously for many days before his desire to see his family. He used to take with him  the journey food for the stay and then come back to (his wife) Khadija to take his food  like-wise again till suddenly the Truth descended upon him while he was in the cave of  Hira. The angel came to him and asked him to read. The Prophet replied, &#8220;I do not  know how to read. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;The angel caught  me (forcefully) and pressed me so hard that I could not bear it any more. He then released  me and again asked me to read and I replied, &#8216;I do not know how to read.&#8217; Thereupon he  caught me again and pressed me a second time till I could not bear it any more. He then  released me and again asked me to read but again I replied, &#8216;I do not know how to read (or  what shall I read)?&#8217; Thereupon he caught me for the third time and pressed me, and then  released me and said, &#8216;Read in the name of your Lord, who has created (all that exists)  has created man from a clot. Read! And your Lord is the Most Generous.&#8221; (96.1, 96.2,  96.3) Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned with the Inspiration and with his heart beating  severely. Then he went to Khadija bint Khuwailid and said, &#8220;Cover me! Cover me!&#8221;  They covered him till his fear was over and after that he told her everything that had  happened and said, &#8220;I fear that something may happen to me.&#8221; Khadija replied,  &#8220;Never! By Allah, Allah will never disgrace you. You keep good relations with your  Kith and kin, help the poor and the destitute, serve your guests generously and assist the  deserving calamity-afflicted ones.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Khadija then accompanied him to her cousin  Waraqa bin Naufal bin Asad bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Uzza, who, during the PreIslamic Period became a  Christian and used to write the writing with Hebrew letters. He would write from the  Gospel in Hebrew as much as Allah wished him to write. He was an old man and had lost his  eyesight. Khadija said to Waraqa, &#8220;Listen to the story of your nephew, O my  cousin!&#8221; Waraqa asked, &#8220;O my nephew! What have you seen?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  described whatever he had seen. Waraqa said, &#8220;This is the same one who keeps the  secrets (angel Gabriel) whom Allah had sent to Moses. I wish I were young and could live  up to the time when your people would turn you out.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked,  &#8220;Will they drive me out?&#8221; Waraqa replied in the affirmative and said,  &#8220;Anyone (man) who came with something similar to what you have brought was treated  with hostility; and if I should remain alive till the day when you will be turned out then  I would support you strongly.&#8221; But after a few days Waraqa died and the Divine  Inspiration was also paused for a while. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah Al-Ansari  while talking about the period of pause in revelation reporting the speech of the Prophet  &#8220;While I was walking, all of a sudden I heard a voice from the sky. I looked up and  saw the same angel who had visited me at the cave of Hira&#8217; sitting on a chair between the  sky and the earth. I got afraid of him and came back home and said, &#8216;Wrap me (in  blankets).&#8217; And then Allah revealed the following Holy Verses (of Quran): </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;O you (i.e. Muhammad)! wrapped up in  garments!&#8217; Arise and warn (the people against Allah&#8217;s Punishment),&#8230; up to &#8216;and desert  the idols.&#8217; (74.1-5) After this the revelation started coming strongly, frequently and  regularly.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.001.004"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 1, Number 4: </font></p>
<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas in the explanation of the  Statement of Allah. &#8216;Move not your tongue concerning (the Quran) to make haste  therewith.&#8221; (75.16) Said &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to bear the revelation with great  trouble and used to move his lips (quickly) with the Inspiration.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas moved  his lips saying, &#8220;I am moving my lips in front of you as Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to move  his.&#8221; Said moved his lips saying: &#8220;I am moving my lips, as I saw Ibn &#8216;Abbas  moving his.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas added, &#8220;So Allah revealed &#8216;Move not your tongue  concerning (the Qur&#8217;an) to make haste therewith. It is for us to collect it and to give  you (O Muhammad) the ability to recite it (the Qur&#8217;an) (75.16-17) which means that Allah  will make him (the Prophet ) remember the portion of the Qur&#8217;an which was revealed at that  time by heart and recite it. The Statement of Allah: And &#8216;When we have recited it to you  (O Muhammad through Gabriel) then you follow its (Qur&#8217;an) recital&#8217; (75.18) means &#8216;listen  to it and be silent.&#8217; Then it is for Us (Allah) to make It clear to you&#8217; (75.19) means  &#8216;Then it is (for Allah) to make you recite it (and its meaning will be clear by itself  through your tongue). Afterwards, Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to listen to Gabriel whenever he  came and after his departure he used to recite it as Gabriel had recited it.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.001.005"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 1, Number 5: </font></p>
<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle was the most generous of  all the people, and he used to reach the peak in generosity in the month of Ramadan when  Gabriel met him. Gabriel used to meet him every night of Ramadan to teach him the Qur&#8217;an.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was the most generous person, even more generous than the strong  uncontrollable wind (in readiness and haste to do charitable deeds). </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="001.001.006"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 1, Book 1, Number 6: </font></p>
<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that  Heraclius had sent a messenger to him while he had been accompanying a caravan from  Quraish. They were merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and  Jordan), at the time when Allah&#8217;s Apostle had truce with Abu Sufyan and Quraish infidels.  So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called  them in the court and he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for  his translator who, translating Heraclius&#8217;s question said to them, &#8220;Who amongst you  is closely related to that man who claims to be a Prophet?&#8221; Abu Sufyan replied,  &#8220;I am the nearest relative to him (amongst the group).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius said, &#8220;Bring him (Abu  Sufyan) close to me and make his companions stand behind him.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added,  Heraclius told his translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions  to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they (my companions)  should contradict me.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allah! Had I not been afraid of my  companions labeling me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The  first question he asked me about him was: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;What is his family status amongst you?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;He belongs to a good (noble)  family amongst us.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius further asked, &#8216;Has anybody  amongst you ever claimed the same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He said, &#8216;Was anybody amongst his ancestors  a king?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius asked, &#8216;Do the nobles or the poor  follow him?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;It is the poor who follow him.&#8217;  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He said, &#8216;Are his followers increasing  decreasing (day by day)?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;They are increasing.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>He then asked, &#8216;Does anybody amongst those  who embrace his religion become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius said, &#8216;Have you ever accused him  of telling lies before his claim (to be a Prophet)?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;No. &#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius said, &#8216;Does he break his  promises?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;No. We are at truce with him  but we do not know what he will do in it.&#8217; I could not find opportunity to say anything  against him except that. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius asked, &#8216;Have you ever had a war  with him?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then he said, &#8216;What was the outcome of the  battles?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I replied, &#8216;Sometimes he was victorious and  sometimes we.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius said, &#8216;What does he order you to  do?&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8216;He tells us to worship Allah and  Allah alone and not to worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our  ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be chaste and to keep  good relations with our Kith and kin.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Heraclius asked the translator to convey to  me the following, I asked you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a  very noble family. In fact all the Apostles come from noble families amongst their  respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you claimed such a  thing, your reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would  have thought that this man was following the previous man&#8217;s statement. Then I asked you  whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had  been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted to take back his  ancestral kingdom. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I further asked whether he was ever accused  of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. So I  wondered how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a lie about  Allah. I, then asked you whether the rich people followed him or the poor. You replied  that it was the poor who followed him. And in fact all the Apostle have been followed by  this very class of people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or  decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is the way of true  faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further asked you whether there was anybody,  who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your  reply was in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when its delight  enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked you whether he had ever  betrayed. You replied in the negative and likewise the Apostles never betray. Then I asked  you what he ordered you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allah and Allah  alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to worship idols and  ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be chaste. If what you have said is true,  he will very soon occupy this place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures)  that he was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and if I could  reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him and if I were with him, I would  certainly wash his feet.&#8217; Heraclius then asked for the letter addressed by Allah&#8217;s Apostle  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>which was delivered by Dihya to the  Governor of Busra, who forwarded it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were  as follows: &#8220;In the name of Allah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) from  Muhammad the slave of Allah and His Apostle to Heraclius the ruler of Byzantine. Peace be  upon him, who follows the right path. Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become  a Muslim you will be safe, and Allah will double your reward, and if you reject this  invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your Arisiyin (peasants).  (And I recite to you Allah&#8217;s Statement:) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;O people of the scripture! Come to a word  common to you and us that we worship none but Allah and that we associate nothing in  worship with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allah. Then, if  they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those who have surrendered to  Allah).&#8217; (3:64). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Sufyan then added, &#8220;When Heraclius  had finished his speech and had read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the  Royal Court. So we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the question of  Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet Muhammad) has become so prominent that even the King of Bani  Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet)  would be the conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allah guided me to  it).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The sub narrator adds, &#8220;Ibn An-Natur  was the Governor of llya&#8217; (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of  Sham. Ibn An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya&#8217; (Jerusalem), he  got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his priests asked him why he was in that  mood? Heraclius was a foreteller and an astrologer. He replied, &#8216;At night when I looked at  the stars, I saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared (become  the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?&#8217; The people replied, &#8216;Except the  Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you should not be afraid of them (Jews). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Just Issue orders to kill every Jew  present in the country.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While they were discussing it, a messenger  sent by the king of Ghassan to convey the news of Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Heraclius was brought  in. Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see whether the  messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after seeing him, told Heraclius that he  was circumcised. Heraclius then asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, &#8216;Arabs  also practice circumcision.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(After hearing that) Heraclius remarked  that sovereignty of the &#8216;Arabs had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend  in Rome who was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. (a town  in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his letter from his friend who  agreed with him in his opinion about the emergence of the Prophet and the fact that he was  a Prophet. On that Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his  palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of his palace be  closed. Then he came out and said, &#8216;O Byzantines! If success is your desire and if you  seek right guidance and want your empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to  this Prophet (i.e. embrace Islam).&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(On hearing the views of Heraclius) the  people ran towards the gates of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed.  Heraclius realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their embracing  Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in audience. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(When they returned) he said, &#8216;What already  said was just to test the strength of your conviction and I have seen it.&#8217; The people  prostrated before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of Heraclius&#8217;s  story (in connection with his faith). </font></p>
