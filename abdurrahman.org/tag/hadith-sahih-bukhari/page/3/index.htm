<h3 align="center">Hunting, Slaughtering</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="007.067.384"></a>Volume 7, Book 67, Number 384:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet about the game killed by a Mi&#8217;rad (i.e. a sharp-edged piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting). He said, &#8220;If the game is killed with its sharp edge, eat of it, but if it is killed with its shaft, with a hit by its broad side then the game is (unlawful to eat) for it has been beaten to death.&#8221; I asked him about the game killed by a trained hound. He said, &#8220;If the hound catches the game for you, eat of it, for killing the game by the hound, is like its slaughtering. But if you see with your hound or hounds another dog, and you are afraid that it might have shared in hunting the game with your hound and killed it, then you should not eat of it, because you have mentioned Allah&#8217;s name on (sending) your hound only, but you have not mentioned it on some other hound</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 385:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about the Mi&#8217;rad. He said, &#8220;If you hit the game with its sharp edge, eat it, but if the Mi&#8217;rad hits the game with its shaft with a hit by its broad side do not eat it, for it has been beaten to death with a piece of wood. (i.e. unlawful).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;If I let loose my trained hound after a game?&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you let loose your trained hound after game, and mention the name of Allah, then you can eat.&#8221; I said, &#8220;If the hound eats of the game?&#8221; He said &#8220;Then you should not eat of it, for the hound has hunted the game for itself and not for you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Some times I send my hound and then I find some other hound with it?&#8221; He said &#8220;Don&#8217;t eat the game, as you have mentioned the Name of Allah on your dog only and not on the other.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 386:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We let loose our trained hounds after a game?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat what they hunt for you.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Even if they killed (the game)?&#8221; He replied, &#8216;Even if they killed (the game).&#8221; I said, &#8216;We also hit (the game) with the Mi&#8217;rad?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat of the animal which the Mi&#8217;rad kills by piercing its body, but do not eat of the animal which is killed by the broad side of the Mi&#8217;rad.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 387:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Tha&#8217;laba Al-Khushani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Prophet! We are living in a land ruled by the people of the Scripture; Can we take our meals in their utensils? In that land there is plenty of game and I hunt the game with my bow and with my hound that is not trained and with my trained hound. Then what is lawful for me to eat?&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for what you have mentioned about the people of the Scripture, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat out of theirs, but if you cannot get other than theirs, wash their utensils and eat out of it. If you hunt an animal with your bow after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it. and if you hunt something with your trained hound after mentioning Allah&#8217;s Name, eat of it, and if you hunt something with your untrained hound (and get it before it dies) and slaughter it, eat of it.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 388:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Maghaffal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that he saw a man throwing stones with two fingers (at something) and said to him, &#8220;Do not throw stones, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forbidden throwing stones, or e used to dislike it.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah added: Throwing stones will neither hunt the game, nor kill (or hurt) an enemy, but it may break a tooth or gouge out an eye.&#8221; Afterwards &#8216;Abdullah once again saw the man throwing stones. He said to him, &#8220;I tell you that Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forbidden or disliked the throwing the stones (in such a way), yet you are throwing stones! I shall not talk to you for such-and-such a period.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 389:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever keeps a (pet) dog which is neither a watch dog nor a hunting dog, will get a daily deduction of two Qirat from his good deeds.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 390:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;If someone keeps a dog neither for hunting, nor for guarding livestock, the reward (for his good deeds) will be reduced by two Qirats per day.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 391:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If someone keeps a dog neither for guarding livestock, nor for hunting, his good deeds will decrease (in reward) by two Qirats a day.&#8217;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 392:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle. &#8220;We hunt with the help of these hounds.&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you let loose your trained hounds after a game, and mention the name of Allah, then you can eat what the hounds catch for you, even if they killed the game. But you should not eat of it if the hound has eaten of it, for then it is likely that the hound has caught the game for itself. And if other hounds join your hound in hunting the game, then do not eat of it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 393:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;If you let loose your hound after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it, and the hound catches the game and kills it, then you can eat of it. But if the hound eats of it, then you should not eat thereof, for the hound has caught it for itself. And if along with your hound, join other hounds, and Allah&#8217;s Name was not mentioned at the time of their sending, and they catch an animal and kill it, you should not ea: of it, for you will not know which of them has killed it. And if you have thrown an arrow at the game and then find it (dead) two or three days later and, it bears no mark other than the wound inflicted by your arrow, then you can eat of it. But if the game is found (dead) in water, then do not eat of it.&#8221; And it has also been narrated by &#8216;Adi bin Hatim that he asked the Prophet &#8220;If a hunter throws an arrow at the game and after tracing it for two or three days he finds it dead but still bearing his arrow, (can he eat of it)?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;He can eat if he wishes.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 394:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Adi bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I let loose my hound after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;If you let loose your hound after a game and you mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it and the hound catches and kills the game and eats of it, then you should not eat of it, for it has killed it for itself.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Sometimes when I send my hound after a game, I find another hound along with it and I do not know which of them has caught the game.&#8221; He said, &#8220;You must not eat of it because you have not mentioned, the Name of Allah except on sending your own hound, and you did not mention it on the other hound.&#8221; Then I asked him about the game hunted with a Mi&#8217;rad (i.e. a sharp edged piece of wood or a piece of wood provided with a sharp piece of iron used for hunting). He said, &#8220;If the game is killed with its sharp edge, you can eat of it, but if it is killed by its broad side (shaft), you cannot eat of it, for then it is like an animal beaten to death with a pie</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 395:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Adi Bin Hatim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;We hunt with these hounds.&#8221; He said, &#8220;If you send your trained hounds after a game and mention Allah&#8217;s Name on sending, you can eat of what they catch for you. But if the hound eats of the game, then you must not eat of it, for I am afraid that the hound caught it for itself, and if another hound joins your hounds (during the hunt), you should not eat of the game.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 396:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Tha&#8217;laba Al-Khushani:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are living in the land of the people of the Scripture and we take our meals in their utensils, and in the land there is game and I hunt with my bow and trained or untrained hounds; please tell me what is lawful for us of that.&#8221; He said, &#8220;As for your saying that you are living in the land of the people of the Scripture and that you eat in their utensils, if you can get utensils other than theirs, do not eat in their utensils, but if you do not find (other than theirs), then wash their utensils and eat in them. As for your saying that you are in the land of game, if you hung something with your bow, and have mentioned Allah&#8217;s Name while hunting, then you can eat (the game). And if you hunt something with your trained hound, and have mentioned Allah&#8217;s Name on sending it for hunting then you can eat (the game). But if you hunt something with your untrained hound and you were able to slaughter it before its death, you can eat of it.&#8221;</p>

I was riding my horse and I used to be fond of ascending mountains. So while I was doing so I noticed that the people were looking at something. I went to see what it was, and behold it was an onager. I asked my companions, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We do not know.&#8221; I said, &#8220;It is an onager.&#8217; They said, &#8220;It is what you have seen.&#8221; I had left my whip, so I said to them, &#8220;Hand to me my whip.&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will not help you in that (in hunting the onager).&#8221; I got down, took my whip and chased the animal (on my horse) and did not stop till I killed it. I went to them and said, &#8220;Come on, carry it!&#8221; But they said, &#8220;We will not even touch it.&#8221; At last I alone carried it and brought it to them. Some of them ate of it and some refused to eat of it. I said (to them), &#8220;I will ask the Prophet about it (on your behalf).&#8221; When I met the Prophet, I told him the whole story. He said to me, &#8220;Has anything of it been left with you?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Eat, for it is a meal Allah has offered to you.&#8221;</p>

Abu Musa said (to him), &#8220;Come on (and eat), for I have seen Allah&#8217;s Apostle eating of it (i.e. chicken).&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have seen it eating something (dirty) and since then I have disliked it, and have taken an oath that I shall not eat it &#8216; Abu Musa said, &#8220;Come on, I will tell you (or narrate to you). Once I went to Allah s Apostle with a group of Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin, and met him while he was angry, distributing some camels of Rakat. We asked for mounts but he took an oath that he would not give us any mounts, and added, &#8216;I have nothing to mount you on&#8217; In the meantime some camels of booty were brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he asked twice, &#8216;Where are Al-Ash&#8217;ariyin?&#8221; So he gave us five white camels with big humps. We stayed for a short while (after we had covered a little distance), and then I said to my companions, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has forgotten his oath. By Allah, if we do not remind Allah&#8217;s Apostle of his oath, we will never be successful.&#8221; So we returned to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We asked you for mounts, but you took an oath that you would not give us any mounts; we think that you have forgotten your oath.&#8217; He said, &#8216;It is Allah Who has given you mounts. By Allah, and Allah willing, if I take an oath and later find something else better than that. then I do what is better and expiate my oath.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we provoked a rabbit at Marr-az-Zahran. The people chased it till they got tired. Then I caught It and brought it to Abu Talha, who slaughtered it and then sent both its pelvic pieces (or legs) to the Prophet, and the Prophet accepted the present.</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Khalid bin Al-Walid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I entered the house of Maimuna. A roasted mastigure was served. Allah&#8217;s Apostle stretched his hand out (to eat of it) but some woman said, &#8220;Inform Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what he is about to eat.&#8221; So they said, &#8220;It is mastigure, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He withdrew his hand, whereupon I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is it unlawful?&#8221; He said, &#8220;No, but this is not found in the land of my people, so I dislike it.&#8221; So I pulled the mastigure towards me and ate it while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was looking at me.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 446:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Maimuna:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A mouse fell into the butter-fat and died. The Prophet was asked about that. He said, &#8220;Throw away the mouse and the butter-fat that surrounded it, and eat the rest of the butter-fat (As-Samn).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Az-Zhuri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">regarding an animal, e.g., a mouse or some other animal that had fallen into solid or liquid oil or butter-fat: I had been informed that a mouse had died in butter-fat whereupon Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered that the butter-fat near it be thrown away and the rest of the butter-fat can be eaten.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Maimuna:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 449:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that Ibn &#8216;Umar disliked the branding of animals on the face. Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;The Prophet forbade beating (animals) on the face.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 450:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I brought a brother of mine to the Prophet to do Tahnik for him while the Prophet was in a sheep fold of his, and I saw him branding a sheep. (The sub-narrator said: I think Anas said, branding it on the ear.)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Rait&#8217; bin Khadij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to the Prophet, &#8220;We will be facing the enemy tomorrow and we have no knives (for slaughtering)&#8217; He said, &#8220;If you slaughter the animal with anything that causes its blood to flow out, and if Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on slaughtering it, eat of it, unless the killing instrument is a tooth or nail. I will tell you why: As for the tooth, it is a bone; and as for the nail, it is the knife of Ethiopians.&#8221; The quick ones among the people got the war booty while the Prophet was behind the people. So they placed the cooking pots on the fire, but the Prophet ordered the cooking pots to be turned upside down. Then he distributed (the war booty) among them, considering one camel as equal to ten sheep. Then a camel belonging to the first party of people ran away and they had no horses with them, so a man shot it with an arrow whereby Allah stopped it. The Prophet said, &#8220;Of these animals there are some which are as wild as wild beasts. So, if anyone of them runs away like this, do like this (shoot it with an arrow).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 7, Book 67, Number 452:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Rafi bin Khadij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While we were with the Prophet. on a journey, one of the camels ran away. A man shot it with an arrow and stopped it. The Prophet said, &#8220;Of these camels some are as wild as wild beasts, so if one of them runs away and you cannot catch it, then do like this (shoot it with an arrow).&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Sometimes when we are in battles or on a journey we want to slaughter (animals) but we have no knives.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Listen! If you slaughter the animal with anything that causes its blood to flow out, and if Allah&#8217;s Name is mentioned on slaughtering it, eat of it, provided that the slaughtering instrument is not a tooth or a nail, as the tooth is a bone and the nail is the knife of Ethiopians.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah created Adam, making him 60  cubits tall. When He created him, He said to him, &#8220;Go and greet that group of angels,  and listen to their reply, for it will be your greeting (salutation) and the greeting  (salutations of your offspring.&#8221; So, Adam said (to the angels), As-Salamu Alaikum  (i.e. Peace be upon you). The angels said, &#8220;As-salamu Alaika wa Rahmatu-l-lahi&#8221;  (i.e. Peace and Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon you). Thus the angels added to Adam&#8217;s salutation the  expression, &#8216;Wa Rahmatu-l-lahi,&#8217; Any person who will enter Paradise will resemble Adam (in  appearance and figure). People have been decreasing in stature since Adam&#8217;s creation. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The first group of people who  will enter Paradise, will be glittering like the full moon and those who will follow them,  will glitter like the most brilliant star in the sky. They will not urinate, relieve  nature, spit, or have any nasal secretions. Their combs will be of gold, and their sweat  will smell like musk. The aloes-wood will be used in their centers. Their wives will be  houris. All of them will look alike and will resemble their father Adam (in statute),  sixty cubits tall.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Um Salama said, &#8220;Um Salaim said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  Allah does not refrain from saying the truth! Is it obligatory for a woman to take a bath  after she gets nocturnal discharge?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes, if she notices the water (i.e.  discharge).&#8217; Um Salama smiled and said, &#8216;Does a woman get discharge?&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said. &#8216;Then why does a child resemble (its mother)?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam heard the arrival of the Prophet  at Medina, he came to him and said, &#8220;I am going to ask you about three things which  nobody knows except a prophet: What is the first portent of the Hour? What will be the  first meal taken by the people of Paradise? Why does a child resemble its father, and why  does it resemble its maternal uncle&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Gabriel has just now  told me of their answers.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;He (i.e. Gabriel), from amongst all  the angels, is the enemy of the Jews.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The first portent  of the Hour will be a fire that will bring together the people from the east to the west;  the first meal of the people of Paradise will be Extra-lobe (caudate lobe) of fish-liver.  As for the resemblance of the child to its parents: If a man has sexual intercourse with  his wife and gets discharge first, the child will resemble the father, and if the woman  gets discharge first, the child will resemble her.&#8221; On that &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam said,  &#8220;I testify that you are the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam further said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The Jews are liars, and if they should come to know about my  conversion to Islam before you ask them (about me), they would tell a lie about me.&#8221;  The Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and &#8216;Abdullah went inside the house. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  asked (the Jews), &#8220;What kind of man is &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam amongst you?&#8221; They  replied, &#8220;He is the most learned person amongst us, and the best amongst us, and the  son of the best amongst us.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;What do you think if he  embraces Islam (will you do as he does)?&#8221; The Jews said, &#8220;May Allah save him  from it.&#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah bin Salam came out in front of them saying, &#8220;I testify  that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of  Allah.&#8221; Thereupon they said, &#8220;He is the evilest among us, and the son of the  evilest amongst us,&#8221; and continued talking badly of him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the true and truly inspired said,  &#8220;(as regards your creation), every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother  for the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for an other forty days, and then a  piece of flesh for an other forty days. Then Allah sends an angel to write four words: He  writes his deeds, time of his death, means of his livelihood, and whether he will be  wretched or blessed (in religion). Then the soul is breathed into his body. So a man may  do deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire, so much so that there is only  the distance of a cubit between him and it, and then what has been written (by the angel)  surpasses, and so he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise and  enters Paradise. Similarly, a person may do deeds characteristic of the people of  Paradise, so much so that there is only the distance of a cubit between him and it, and  then what has been written (by the angel) surpasses, and he starts doing deeds of the  people of the (Hell) Fire and enters the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

A drop of discharge (i.e. of semen), O Lord! a clot, O  Lord! a piece of flesh.&#8217; And then, if Allah wishes to complete the child&#8217;s creation, the  angel will say. &#8216;O Lord! A male or a female? O Lord! wretched or blessed (in religion)?  What will his livelihood be? What will his age be?&#8217; The angel writes all this while the  child is in the womb of its mother.&#8221; </font></p>

Do you  know how Allah will gather all the first and the last (people) in one level place where an  observer will be able to see (all) of them and they will be able to hear the announcer,  and the sun will come near to them. Some People will say: Don&#8217;t you see, in what condition  you are and the state to which you have reached? Why don&#8217;t you look for a person who can  intercede for you with your Lord? Some people will say: Appeal to your father, Adam.&#8217; They  will go to him and say: &#8216;O Adam! You are the father of all mankind, and Allah created you  with His Own Hands, and ordered the angels to prostrate for you, and made you live in  Paradise. Will you not intercede for us with your Lord? Don&#8217;t you see in what (miserable)  state we are, and to what condition we have reached?&#8217; On that Adam will reply, &#8216;My Lord is  so angry as He has never been before and will never be in the future; (besides), He  forbade me (to eat from) the tree, but I disobeyed (Him), (I am worried about) myself!  Myself! Go to somebody else; go to Noah.&#8217; They will go to Noah and say; &#8216;O Noah! You are  the first amongst the messengers of Allah to the people of the earth, and Allah named you  a thankful slave.

The people will come to me, and I will  prostrate myself underneath Allah&#8217;s Throne. Then I will be addressed: &#8216;O Muhammad! Raise  your head; intercede, for your intercession will be accepted, and ask (for anything). for  you will be given. &#8221; </font></p>

So the  Quraish and the Ansar became angry and said, &#8220;He (i.e. the Prophet, ) gives the chief  of Najd and does not give us.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I give them) so as to attract  their hearts (to Islam).&#8221; Then a man with sunken eyes, prominent checks, a raised  forehead, a thick beard and a shaven head, came (in front of the Prophet ) and said,  &#8220;Be afraid of Allah, O Muhammad!&#8221; The Prophet &#8216; said &#8220;Who would obey Allah  if I disobeyed Him? (Is it fair that) Allah has trusted all the people of the earth to me  while, you do not trust me?&#8221; Somebody who, I think was Khalid bin Al-Walid, requested  the Prophet to let him chop that man&#8217;s head off, but he prevented him. When the man left,  the Prophet said, &#8220;Among the off-spring of this man will be some who will recite the  Qur&#8217;an but the Qur&#8217;an will not reach beyond their throats (i.e. they will recite like  parrots and will not understand it nor act on it), and they will renegade from the  religion as an arrow goes through the game&#8217;s body. They will kill the Muslims but will not  disturb the idolaters. If I should live up to their time&#8217; I will kill them as the people  of &#8216;Ad were killed (i.e. I will kill all of them).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abraham did not tell a lie except on three occasion. Twice  for the Sake of Allah when he said, &#8220;I am sick,&#8221; and he said, &#8220;(I have not  done this but) the big idol has done it.&#8221; The (third was) that while Abraham and  Sarah (his wife) were going (on a journey) they passed by (the territory of) a tyrant.  Someone said to the tyrant, &#8220;This man (i.e. Abraham) is accompanied by a very  charming lady.&#8221; So, he sent for Abraham and asked him about Sarah saying, &#8220;Who  is this lady?&#8221; Abraham said, &#8220;She is my sister.&#8221; Abraham went to Sarah and  said, &#8220;O Sarah! There are no believers on the surface of the earth except you and I.  This man asked me about you and I have told him that you are my sister, so don&#8217;t  contradict my statement.&#8221; The tyrant then called Sarah and when she went to him, he  tried to take hold of her with his hand, but (his hand got stiff and) he was confounded.  He asked Sarah. &#8220;Pray to Allah for me, and I shall not harm you.&#8221; So Sarah asked  Allah to cure him and he got cured. He tried to take hold of her for the second time, but  (his hand got as stiff as or stiffer than before and) was more confounded. He again  requested Sarah, &#8220;Pray to Allah for me, and I will not harm you.&#8221; Sarah asked  Allah again and he became alright. He then called one of his guards (who had brought her)  and said, &#8220;You have not brought me a human being but have brought me a devil.&#8221;  The tyrant then gave Hajar as a girl-servant to Sarah. Sarah came back (to Abraham) while  he was praying. Abraham, gesturing with his hand, asked, &#8220;What has happened?&#8221;  She replied, &#8220;Allah has spoiled the evil plot of the infidel (or immoral person) and  gave me Hajar for service.&#8221; (Abu Huraira then addressed his listeners saying,  &#8220;That (Hajar) was your mother, O Bani Ma-is-Sama (i.e. the Arabs, the descendants of  Ishmael, Hajar&#8217;s son).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on the  mother of Ishmael! Had she not hastened (to fill her water-skin with water from the  Zam-zam well). Zam-zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221;  Ibn &#8216;Abbas further added, &#8220;(The Prophet) Abraham brought Ishmael and his mother (to  Mecca) and she was suckling Ishmael and she had a water-skin with her.&#8217; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.055.583"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 583: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael.  She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and  her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka&#8217;ba under a tree on the  spot of Zam-zam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in  Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a  leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set  out homeward. Ishmael&#8217;s mother followed him saying, &#8220;O Abraham! Where are you going,  leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is  there anything (to enjoy)?&#8221; She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look  back at her Then she asked him, &#8220;Has Allah ordered you to do so?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Then He will not neglect us,&#8221; and returned while  Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he  faced the Ka&#8217;ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a  valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Kaba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord,  that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards  them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks.&#8217; (14.37)  Ishmael&#8217;s mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she  became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e.  Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and  found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on  it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could  not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked  up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed  the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting  to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa  and Marwa) seven times.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;This is the source of the tradition  of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa). When she reached the Marwa  (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened  attentively. She heard the voice again and said, &#8216;O, (whoever you may be)! You have made  me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?&#8221; And behold! She saw an angel  at the place of Zam-zam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed  from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in  this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was  flowing out after she had scooped some of it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;May Allah bestow Mercy on  Ishmael&#8217;s mother! Had she let the Zam-zam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she  not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zam-zam would have been a stream  flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221; The Prophet further added, &#8220;Then she drank  (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, &#8216;Don&#8217;t be afraid of being neglected,  for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah  never neglects His people.&#8217; The House (i.e. Kaba) at that time was on a high place  resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived  in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by  her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada&#8217;.  They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying  around water and not leaving it. They said, &#8216;This bird must be flying around water, though  we know that there is no water in this valley.&#8217; They sent one or two messengers who  discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all  came (towards the water).&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was sitting near  the water. They asked her, &#8216;Do you allow us to stay with you?&#8221; She replied, &#8216;Yes, but  you will have no right to possess the water.&#8217; They agreed to that.&#8221; The Prophet  further said, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to  love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent  for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent  residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his  virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of  puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>After Ishmael&#8217;s mother had died, Abraham came after  Ishmael&#8217;s marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find  Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmael&#8217;s wife about him, she replied, &#8216;He has gone in search  of our livelihood.&#8217; Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and  she replied, &#8216;We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,&#8217;  complaining to him. He said, &#8216;When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and  tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).&#8217; When Ishmael came, he seemed  to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, &#8216;Has anyone visited you?&#8217; She  replied, &#8216;Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I  informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living  in a hardship and poverty.&#8217; On that Ishmael said, &#8216;Did he advise you anything?&#8217; She  replied, &#8216;Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the  threshold of your gate.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce  you. Go back to your family.&#8217; So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from  amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as  Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael&#8217;s  wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, &#8216;He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217;  Abraham asked her, &#8216;How are you getting on?&#8217; asking her about their sustenance and living.  She replied, &#8216;We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).&#8217; Then  she thanked Allah&#8217; Abraham said, &#8216;What kind of food do you eat?&#8217; She said. &#8216;Meat.&#8217; He  said, &#8216;What do you drink?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Water.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Bless their  meat and water.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;At that time they did not have grain, and  if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.&#8221; The Prophet added,  &#8220;If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition  will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.&#8221; The Prophet added,&#8221; Then  Abraham said Ishmael&#8217;s wife, &#8220;When your husband comes, give my regards to him and  tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.&#8217; When Ishmael came back, he  asked his wife, &#8216;Did anyone call on you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, a good-looking old man came  to me,&#8217; so she praised him and added. &#8216;He asked about you, and I informed him, and he  asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition.&#8217; Ishmael asked  her, &#8216;Did he give you any piece of advice?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes, he told me to give his regards  to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate.&#8217; On that Ishmael  said, &#8216;It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to  keep you with me.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as  Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam,  sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted  each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, &#8216;O  Ishmael! Allah has given me an order.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;Do what your Lord has ordered you to  do.&#8217; Abraham asked, &#8216;Will you help me?&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;I will help you.&#8217; Abraham said,  Allah has ordered me to build a house here,&#8217; pointing to a hillock higher than the land  surrounding it.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then they raised the foundations of the  House (i.e. the Ka&#8217;ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the  walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and  carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were  saying, &#8216;O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the  All-Knowing.&#8217; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then both of them went on building and going round  the Ka&#8217;ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the  All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&#8221; (2.127) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 55, Number 584: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abraham had differences with his wife), (because of  her jealousy of Hajar, Ishmael&#8217;s mother), he took Ishmael and his mother and went away.  They had a water-skin with them containing some water, Ishmael&#8217;s mother used to drink  water from the water-skin so that her milk would increase for her child. When Abraham  reached Mecca, he made her sit under a tree and afterwards returned home. Ishmael&#8217;s mother  followed him, and when they reached Kada&#8217;, she called him from behind, &#8216;O Abraham! To whom  are you leaving us?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(I am leaving you) to Allah&#8217;s (Care).&#8217; She said, &#8216;I am  satisfied to be with Allah.&#8217; She returned to her place and started drinking water from the  water-skin, and her milk increased for her child. When the water had all been used up, she  said to herself, &#8216;I&#8217;d better go and look so that I may see somebody.&#8217; She ascended the  Safa mountain and looked, hoping to see somebody, but in vain. When she came down to the  valley, she ran till she reached the Marwa mountain. She ran to and fro (between the two  mountains) many times. They she said to herself, &#8216;i&#8217;d better go and see the state of the  child,&#8217; she went and found it in a state of one on the point of dying. She could not  endure to watch it dying and said (to herself), &#8216;If I go and look, I may find somebody.&#8217;  She went and ascended the Safa mountain and looked for a long while but could not find  anybody. Thus she completed seven rounds (of running) between Safa and Marwa. Again she  said (to herself), &#8216;I&#8217;d better go back and see the state of the child.&#8217; But suddenly she  heard a voice, and she said to that strange voice, &#8216;Help us if you can offer any help.&#8217;  Lo! It was Gabriel (who had made the voice). Gabriel hit the earth with his heel like this  (Ibn &#8216;Abbas hit the earth with his heel to Illustrate it), and so the water gushed out.  Ishmael&#8217;s mother was astonished and started digging. (Abu Al-Qasim) (i.e. the Prophet)  said, &#8220;If she had left the water, (flow naturally without her intervention), it would  have been flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221;) Ishmael&#8217;s mother started drinking  from the water and her milk increased for her child . Afterwards some people of the tribe  of Jurhum, while passing through the bottom of the valley, saw some birds, and that  astonished them, and they said, &#8216;Birds can only be found at a place where there is water.&#8217;  They sent a messenger who searched the place and found the water, and returned to inform  them about it. Then they all went to her and said, &#8216;O ishmael&#8217;s mother! Will you allow us  to be with you (or dwell with you)?&#8217; (And thus they stayed there.) Later on her boy  reached the age of puberty and married a lady from them. Then an idea occurred to Abraham  which he disclosed to his wife (Sarah), &#8216;I want to call on my dependents I left (at  Mecca).&#8217; When he went there, he greeted (Ishmael&#8217;s wife) and said, &#8216;Where is Ishmael?&#8217; She  replied, &#8216;He has gone out hunting.&#8217; Abraham said (to her), &#8216;When he comes, tell him to  change the threshold of his gate.&#8217; When he came, she told him the same whereupon Ishmael  said to her, &#8216;You are the threshold, so go to your family (i.e. you are divorced).&#8217; Again  Abraham thought of visiting his dependents whom he had left (at Mecca), and he told his  wife (Sarah) of his intentions. Abraham came to Ishmael&#8217;s house and asked. &#8220;Where is  Ishmael?&#8221; Ishmael&#8217;s wife replied, &#8220;He has gone out hunting,&#8221; and added,  &#8220;Will you stay (for some time) and have something to eat and drink?&#8217; Abraham asked,  &#8216;What is your food and what is your drink?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Our food is meat and our drink  is water.&#8217; He said, &#8216;O Allah! Bless their meals and their drink.&#8221; Abu Al-Qa-sim (i.e.  Prophet) said, &#8220;Because of Abraham&#8217;s invocation there are blessings (in Mecca).&#8221;  Once more Abraham thought of visiting his family he had left (at Mecca), so he told his  wife (Sarah) of his decision. He went and found Ishmael behind the Zam-zam well, mending  his arrows. He said, &#8220;O Ishmael, Your Lord has ordered me to build a house for  Him.&#8221; Ishmael said, &#8220;Obey (the order of) your Lord.&#8221; Abraham said,  &#8220;Allah has also ordered me that you should help me therein.&#8221; Ishmael said,  &#8220;Then I will do.&#8221; So, both of them rose and Abraham started building (the Ka&#8217;ba)  while Ishmael went on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &#8220;O our  Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the  All-Knowing.&#8221; (2.127). When the building became high and the old man (i.e. Abraham)  could no longer lift the stones (to such a high position), he stood over the stone of  Al-Maqam and Ishmael carried on handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &#8216;O  our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily You are All-Hearing, All-Knowing.&#8221;  (2.127) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked Um Ruman, &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s mother about the accusation  forged against &#8216;Aisha.

The Prophet came  and asked, &#8216;What is wrong with her?&#8217; I said, &#8216;She has got fever because of a story which  has been rumored.&#8217; &#8216;Aisha got up and said, &#8216;By Allah! Even if I took an oath, you would  not believe me, and if I put forward an excuse, You would not excuse me. My example and  your example is just like that example of Jacob and his sons. Against that which you  assert, it is Allah (Alone) Whose Help can be sought.&#8217; (12.18) The Prophet left and then  Allah revealed the Verses (concerning the matter), and on that &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;Thanks to  Allah (only) and not to anybody else.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I asked &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet about the meaning of  the following Verse: &#8212; &#8220;(Respite will be granted) &#8216;Until when the apostles give up  hope (of their people) and thought that they were denied (by their  people)&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;(12.110) &#8216;Aisha replied, &#8220;Really, their nations did not  believe them.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah! They were definite that their nations treated  them as liars and it was not a matter of suspecting.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O &#8216;Uraiya  (i.e. &#8216;Urwa)! No doubt, they were quite sure about it.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;May the Verse be read in such a way as to  mean that the apostles thought that Allah did not help them?&#8221; Aisha said, &#8220;Allah  forbid! (Impossible) The Apostles did not suspect their Lord of such a thing. But this  Verse is concerned with the Apostles&#8217; followers who had faith in their Lord and believed  in their apostles and their period of trials was long and Allah&#8217;s Help was delayed till  the apostles gave up hope for the conversion of the disbelievers amongst their nation and  suspected that even their followers were shaken in their belief, Allah&#8217;s Help then came to  them.&#8221; Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: The Prophet said, &#8220;The honorable, the son of the  honorable, the son of the honorable, (was) Joseph, the son of Jacob! the son of Isaac, the  son of Abraham.&#8221; </font></p>

And I resemble prophet Abraham more than any of  his offspring does. Then I was given two cups, one containing milk and the other wine.

Meanwhile Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b  passed by them and Ibn &#8216;Abbas called him saying, &#8220;My friend and I have differed  regarding Moses&#8217; companion whom Moses asked the way to meet. Have you heard Allah&#8217;s  Apostle mentioning something about him?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle  saying, &#8216;While Moses was sitting in the company of some Israelites, a man came and asked  (him), &#8216;Do you know anyone who is more learned than you?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;No.&#8217; So, Allah  sent the Divine Inspiration to Moses: &#8216;Yes, Our slave, Khadir (is more learned than you).&#8217;  Moses asked how to meet him (i.e. Khadir). So, the fish, was made, as a sign for him, and  he was told that when the fish was lost, he should return and there he would meet him. So,  Moses went on looking for the sign of the fish in the sea. The servant boy of Moses said  to him, &#8216;Do you know that when we were sitting by the side of the rock, I forgot the fish,  and t was only Satan who made me forget to tell (you) about it.&#8217; Moses said, That was what  we were seeking after,&#8217; and both of them returned, following their footmarks and found  Khadir; and what happened further to them, is mentioned in Allah&#8217;s Book.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said to Ibn Abbas, &#8220;Nauf Al-Bukah claims that Moses,  the companion of Al-Khadir was not Moses (the prophet) of the children of Israel, but some  other Moses.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s enemy (i.e. Nauf) has told a lie. Ubai  bin Ka&#8217;b told us that the Prophet said, &#8216;Once Moses stood up and addressed Bani Israel. He  was asked who was the most learned man amongst the people. He said, &#8216;I.&#8217; Allah admonished  him as he did not attribute absolute knowledge to Him (Allah). So, Allah said to him,  &#8216;Yes, at the junction of the two seas there is a Slave of Mine who is more learned than  you.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;O my Lord! How can I meet him?&#8217; Allah said, &#8216;Take a fish and put it in  a large basket and you will find him at the place where you will lose the fish.&#8217; Moses  took a fish and put it in a basket and proceeded along with his (servant) boy, Yusha &#8216;bin  Nun, till they reached the rock where they laid their heads (i.e. lay down). Moses slept,  and the fish, moving out of the basket, fell into the sea. It took its way into the sea  (straight) as in a tunnel. Allah stopped the flow of water over the fish and it became  like an arch (the Prophet pointed out this arch with his hands). They travelled the rest  of the night, and the next day Moses said to his boy (servant), &#8216;Give us our food, for  indeed, we have suffered much fatigue in this journey of ours.&#8217; Moses did not feel tired  till he crossed that place which Allah had ordered him to seek after. His boy (servant)  said to him, &#8216;Do you know that when we were sitting near that rock, I forgot the fish, and  none but Satan caused me to forget to tell (you) about it, and it took its course into the  sea in an amazing way?.&#8217; So there was a path for the fish and that astonished them. Moses  said, &#8216;That was what we were seeking after.&#8217; So, both of them retraced their footsteps  till they reached the rock. There they saw a man Lying covered with a garment. Moses  greeted him and he replied saying, &#8216;How do people greet each other in your land?&#8217; Moses  said, &#8216;I am Moses.&#8217; The man asked, &#8216;Moses of Bani Israel?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Yes, I have come  to you so that you may teach me from those things which Allah has taught you.&#8217; He said, &#8216;O  Moses! I have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught me, and which you do  not know, while you have some of the Knowledge of Allah which Allah has taught you and  which I do not know.&#8217; Moses asked, &#8216;May I follow you?&#8217; He said, &#8216;But you will not be able  to remain patient with me for how can you be patient about things which you will not be  able to understand?&#8217; (Moses said, &#8216;You will find me, if Allah so will, truly patient, and  I will not disobey you in aught.&#8217;) So, both of them set out walking along the sea-shore, a  boat passed by them and they asked the crew of the boat to take them on board. The crew  recognized Al-Khadir and so they took them on board without fare. When they were on board  the boat, a sparrow came and stood on the edge of the boat and dipped its beak once or  twice into the sea. Al-Khadir said to Moses, &#8216;O Moses! My knowledge and your knowledge  have not decreased Allah&#8217;s Knowledge except as much as this sparrow has decreased the  water of the sea with its beak.&#8217; Then suddenly Al-Khadir took an adze and plucked a plank,  and Moses did not notice it till he had plucked a plank with the adze. Moses said to him,  &#8216;What have you done? They took us on board charging us nothing; yet you I have  intentionally made a hole in their boat so as to drown its passengers. Verily, you have  done a dreadful thing.&#8217; Al-Khadir replied, &#8216;Did I not tell you that you would not be able  to remain patient with me?&#8217; Moses replied, &#8216;Do not blame me for what I have forgotten, and  do not be hard upon me for my fault.&#8217; So the first excuse of Moses was that he had  forgotten. When they had left the sea, they passed by a boy playing with other boys. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Khadir took hold of the boys head and plucked it with  his hand like this. (Sufyan, the sub narrator pointed with his fingertips as if he was  plucking some fruit.) Moses said to him, &#8220;Have you killed an innocent person who has  not killed any person? You have really done a horrible thing.&#8221; Al-Khadir said,  &#8220;Did I not tell you that you could not remain patient with me?&#8217; Moses said &#8220;If I  ask you about anything after this, don&#8217;t accompany me. You have received an excuse from  me.&#8217; Then both of them went on till they came to some people of a village, and they asked  its inhabitant for wood but they refused to entertain them as guests. Then they saw  therein a wall which was just going to collapse (and Al Khadir repaired it just by  touching it with his hands). (Sufyan, the sub-narrator, pointed with his hands,  illustrating how Al-Khadir passed his hands over the wall upwards.) Moses said,  &#8220;These are the people whom we have called on, but they neither gave us food, nor  entertained us as guests, yet you have repaired their wall. If you had wished, you could  have taken wages for it.&#8221; Al-Khadir said, &#8220;This is the parting between you and  me, and I shall tell you the explanation of those things on which you could not remain  patient.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;We wished that Moses could have remained patient  by virtue of which Allah might have told us more about their story. (Sufyan the  sub-narrator said that the Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy on Moses! If he  had remained patient, we would have been told further about their case.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The Prophet) Moses was a shy  person and used to cover his body completely because of his extensive shyness. One of the  children of Israel hurt him by saying, &#8216;He covers his body in this way only because of  some defect in his skin, either leprosy or scrotal hernia, or he has some other defect.&#8217;  Allah wished to clear Moses of what they said about him, so one day while Moses was in  seclusion, he took off his clothes and put them on a stone and started taking a bath. When  he had finished the bath, he moved towards his clothes so as to take them, but the stone  took his clothes and fled; Moses picked up his stick and ran after the stone saying, &#8216;O  stone! Give me my garment!&#8217; Till he reached a group of Bani Israel who saw him naked then,  and found him the best of what Allah had created, and Allah cleared him of what they had  accused him of. The stone stopped there and Moses took and put his garment on and started  hitting the stone with his stick. By Allah, the stone still has some traces of the  hitting, three, four or five marks. This was what Allah refers to in His Saying:&#8211; &#8220;O  you who believe! Be you not like those Who annoyed Moses, But Allah proved his innocence  of that which they alleged, And he was honorable In Allah&#8217;s Sight.&#8221; (33.69) </font></p>

So fast (sometimes) and do not fast (sometimes). Pray and  sleep. Fast for three days a month, for the reward of a good deed is multiplied by ten  time, and so the fasting of three days a month equals the fasting of a year.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Verse:&#8211; &#8216;Those who believe and mix not their  belief with wrong.&#8217; was revealed, the Muslims felt it very hard on them and said, &#8220;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Who amongst us does not do wrong to himself?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The  Verse does not mean this. But that (wrong) means to associate others in worship to Allah:  Don&#8217;t you listen to what Luqman said to his son when he was advising him,&#8221; O my son!  Join not others in worship with Allah. Verily joining others in worship with Allah is a  great wrong indeed.&#8221; (31.13) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That the Prophet talked to them about the night of his  Ascension to the Heavens. He said, &#8220;(Then Gabriel took me) and ascended up till he  reached the second heaven where he asked for the gate to be opened, but it was asked, &#8216;Who  is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;I am Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; He  replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; When we reached  over the second heaven, I saw Yahya (i.e. John) and Jesus who were cousins. Gabriel said,  &#8216;These are John (Yahya) and Jesus, so greet them.&#8217; I greeted them and they returned the  greeting saying, &#8216;Welcome, O Pious Brother and Pious Prophet!;&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

A child therefore,  cries loudly at the time of birth because of the touch of Satan, except Mary and her  child.&#8221; Then Abu Huraira recited: &#8220;And I seek refuge with You for her and for  her offspring from the outcast Satan&#8221; (3.36) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The superiority of &#8216;Aisha to other  ladies is like the superiority of Tharid (i.e. meat and bread dish) to other meals.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;None spoke in cradle but three:  (The first was) Jesus, (the second was), there a man from Bani Israel called Juraij. While  he was offering his prayers, his mother came and called him. He said (to himself), &#8216;Shall  I answer her or keep on praying?&#8221; (He went on praying) and did not answer her, his  mother said, &#8220;O Allah! Do not let him die till he sees the faces of  prostitutes.&#8221; So while he was in his hermitage, a lady came and sought to seduce him,  but he refused. So she went to a shepherd and presented herself to him to commit illegal  sexual intercourse with her and then later she gave birth to a child and claimed that it  belonged to Juraij. The people, therefore, came to him and dismantled his hermitage and  expelled him out of it and abused him. Juraij performed the ablution and offered prayer,  and then came to the child and said, &#8216;O child! Who is your father?&#8217; The child replied,  &#8216;The shepherd.&#8217; (After hearing this) the people said, &#8216;We shall rebuild your hermitage of  gold,&#8217; but he said, &#8216;No, of nothing but mud.'(The third was the hero of the following  story) A lady from Bani Israel was nursing her child at her breast when a handsome rider  passed by her. She said, &#8216;O Allah ! Make my child like him.&#8217; On that the child left her  breast, and facing the rider said, &#8216;O Allah! Do not make me like him.&#8217; The child then  started to suck her breast again. (Abu Huraira further said, &#8220;As if I were now  looking at the Prophet sucking his finger (in way of demonstration.&#8221;) After a while  the people passed by, with a lady slave and she (i.e. the child&#8217;s mother) said, &#8216;O Allah!  Do not make my child like this (slave girl)!, On that the child left her breast and said,  &#8216;O Allah! Make me like her.&#8217; When she asked why, the child replied, &#8216;The rider is one of  the tyrants while this slave girl is falsely accused of theft and illegal sexual  intercourse.&#8221; </font></p>

I  saw Abraham whom I resembled more than any of his children did.&#8221; The Prophet further  said, &#8220;(That night) I was given two cups; one full of milk and the other full of  wine. I was asked to take either of them which I liked, and I took the milk and drank it.  On that it was said to me, &#8216;You have taken the right path (religion). If you had taken the  wine, your (Muslim) nation would have gone astray.&#8221; </font></p>

While sleeping near the Ka&#8217;ba last night, I  saw in my dream a man of brown color the best one can see amongst brown color and his hair  was long that it fell between his shoulders. His hair was lank and water was dribbling  from his head and he was placing his hands on the shoulders of two men while  circumambulating the Kaba. I asked, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;This is Jesus, son of  Mary.&#8217; Behind him I saw a man who had very curly hair and was blind in the right eye,  resembling Ibn Qatan (i.e. an infidel) in appearance. He was placing his hands on the  shoulders of a person while performing Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba.

<p style="text-align:justify;">I went to visit &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar at his house which contained many tents made of cotton cloth and these were encircled with Suradik (part of the tent).

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet with his companions started from Medina after combing and oiling his hair and putting on two sheets of lhram (upper body cover and waist cover). He did not forbid anyone to wear any kind of sheets except the ones colored with saffron because they may leave the scent on the skin. And so in the early morning, the Prophet mounted his Mount while in Dhul-Hulaifa and set out till they reached Baida&#8217;, where he and his companions recited Talbiya, and then they did the ceremony of Taqlid (which means to put the colored garlands around the necks of the Budn (camels for sacrifice). And all that happened on the 25th of Dhul-Qa&#8217;da. And when he reached Mecca on the 4th of Dhul-Hijja he performed the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and performed the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. And as he had a Badana and had garlanded it, he did not finish his Ihram. He proceeded towards the highest places of Mecca near Al-Hujun and he was assuming the Ihram for Hajj and did not go near the Ka&#8217;ba after he performed Tawaf (round it) till he returned from &#8216;Arafat. Then he ordered his companions to perform the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and then the Tawaf of Safa and Marwa, and to cut short the hair of their heads and to finish their Ihram. And that was only for those people who had not garlanded Budn. Those who had their wives with them were permitted to contact them (have sexual intercourse), and similarly perfume and (ordinary) clothes were permissible for them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) We set out with the Prophet in his last Hajj and we assumed Ihram for Umra. The Prophet then said, &#8220;Whoever has the Hadi with him should assume Ihram for Hajj along with &#8216;Umra and should not finish the Ihram till he finishes both.&#8221; I was menstruating when I reached Mecca, and so I neither did Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba nor Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. I complained about that to the Prophet on which he replied, &#8220;Undo and comb your head hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj (only) and leave the Umra.&#8221; So, I did so. When we had performed the Hajj, the Prophet sent me with my brother &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to Tan&#8217;im. So I performed the &#8216;Umra. The Prophet said to me, &#8220;This &#8216;Umra is instead of your missed one.&#8221; Those who had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra (Hajj-atTamattu) performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and then finished their Ihram. After returning from Mina, they performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa). Those who had assumed Ihram for Hajj and &#8216;Umra together (Hajj-al-Qiran) performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sent me to some people in Yemen and when I returned, I found him at Al-Batha. He asked me, &#8220;With what intention have you assumed Ihram (i.e. for Hajj or for Umra or for both?&#8221;) I replied, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram with an intention like that of the Prophet.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;Have you a Hadi with you?&#8221; I replied in the negative. He ordered me to perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and then to finish my Ihram. I did so and went to a woman from my tribe who combed my hair or washed my head. Then, when Umar came (i.e. became Caliph) he said, &#8220;If we follow Allah&#8217;s Book, it orders us to complete Hajj and Umra; as Allah says: &#8220;Perform the Hajj and Umra for Allah.&#8221; (2.196). And if we follow the tradition of the Prophet who did not finish his Ihram till he sacrificed his Hadi.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Qasim bin Muhammad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216; Aisha said, &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostles in the months of Hajj, and (in) the nights of Hajj, and at the time and places of Hajj and in a state of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif (a village six miles from Mecca). The Prophet then addressed his companions and said, &#8220;Anyone who has not got the Hadi and likes to do Umra instead of Hajj may do so (i.e. Hajj-al-Tamattu) and anyone who has got the Hadi should not finish the Ihram after performing &#8216; Umra). (i.e. Hajj-al-Qiran). Aisha added, &#8220;The companions of the Prophet obeyed the above (order) and some of them (i.e. who did not have Hadi) finished their Ihram after Umra.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle and some of his companions were resourceful and had the Hadi with them, they could not perform Umra (alone) (but had to perform both Hajj and Umra with one Ihram). Aisha added, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and saw me weeping and said, &#8220;What makes you weep, O Hantah?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I have heard your conversation with your companions and I cannot perform the Umra.&#8221; He asked, &#8220;What is wrong with you?&#8217; I replied, &#8216; I do not offer the prayers (i.e. I have my menses).&#8217; He said, &#8216; It will not harm you for you are one of the daughters of Adam, and Allah has written for you (this state) as He has written it for them. Keep on with your intentions for Hajj and Allah may reward you that.&#8221; Aisha further added, &#8220;Then we proceeded for Hajj till we reached Mina and I became clean from my menses. Then I went out from Mina and performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Aisha added, &#8220;I went along with the Prophet in his final departure (from Hajj) till he dismounted at Al-Muhassab (a valley outside Mecca), and we too, dismounted with him.&#8221; He called &#8216; Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr and said to him, &#8216; Take your sister outside the sanctuary of Mecca and let her assume Ihram for &#8216; Umra, and when you had finished &#8216; Umra, return to this place and I will wait for you both till you both return to me.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216; Aisha added, &#8216; &#8216; So we went out of the sanctuary of Mecca and after finishing from the &#8216; Umra and the Tawaf we returned to the Prophet at dawn. He said, &#8216;Have you performed the &#8216; Umra?&#8217; We replied in the affirmative. So he announced the departure amongst his companions and the people set out for the journey, and the Prophet: too left for Medina.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216; Aisha said, We went out with the Prophet (from Medina) with the intention of performing Hajj only and when we reached Mecca we performed Tawaf round the Kaba and then the Prophet ordered those who had not driven the Hadi along with them to finish their Ihram. So the people who had not driven the Hadi along with them finished their Ihram. The Prophet&#8217;s wives, too, had not driven the Hadi with them, so they too, finished their Ihram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;I got my menses and could not perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; So when it was the night of Hasba (i.e. when we stopped at Al-Muhassab), I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Everyone is returning after performing Hajj and &#8216;Umra but I am returning after performing Hajj only.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba the night we reached Mecca?&#8217; I replied in the negative. He said, &#8216;Go with your brother to Tan&#8217;im and assume the Ihram for&#8217;Umra, (and after performing it) come back to such and such a place.&#8217; On that Safiya said, &#8216;I feel that I will detain you all.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;O &#8216;Aqra Halqa! Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba on the day of sacrifice? (i.e. Tawaf-al-ifada) Safiya replied in the affirmative. He said, (to Safiya). &#8216;There is no harm for you to proceed on with us.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;(after returning from &#8216;Umra), the Prophet met me while he was ascending (from Mecca) and I was descending to it, or I was ascending and he was descending.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostles (to Mecca) in the year of the Prophet&#8217;s Last Hajj. Some of us had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra only, some for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra, and others for Hajj only. Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed Ihram for Hajj. So whoever had assumed Ihram for Hajj or for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra did not finish the Ihram till the day of sacrifice. (See Hadith No. 631, 636, and 639).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people (of the Pre-lslamic Period) used to think that to perform &#8216;Umra during the months of Hajj was one of the major sins on earth. And also used to consider the month of Safar as a forbidden (i.e. sacred) month and they used to say, &#8220;When the wounds of the camel&#8217;s back heal up (after they return from Hajj) and the signs of those wounds vanish and the month of Safar passes away then (at that time) &#8216;Umra is permissible for the one who wishes to perform it.&#8221; In the morning of the 4th of Dhul-Hijja, the Prophet and his companions reached Mecca, assuming Ihram for Hajj and he ordered his companions to make their intentions of the Ihram for&#8217;Umra only (instead of Hajj) so they considered his order as something great and were puzzled, and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What kind (of finishing) of Ihram is allowed?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Finish the Ihram completely like a non-Muhrim (you are allowed everything).&#8221;</p>

I asked Ibn Abbas regarding it and he ordered me to perform Hajj-at-Tammatu&#8217;. Later I saw in a dream someone saying to me, &#8216;Hajj-Mabrur (Hajj performed in accordance with the Prophet&#8217;s tradition without committing sins and accepted by Allah) and an accepted &#8216;Umra.&#8217; So I told that dream to Ibn Abbas. He said, &#8216;This is the tradition of Abu-l-Qasim.&#8217; Then he said to me, &#8216;Stay with me and I shall give you a portion of my property.&#8217; &#8221; I (Shu&#8217;ba) asked, &#8220;Why (did he invite you)?&#8221; He (Abu Jamra) said, &#8220;Because of the dream which I had seen.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I left for Mecca for Hajj-at-Tamattu&#8217; assuming Ihram for &#8216;Umra. I reached Mecca three days before the day of Tarwiya (8th Dhul-Hijja). Some people of Mecca said to me, &#8220;Your Hajj will be like the Hajj performed by the people of Mecca (i.e. you will lose the superiority of assuming Ihram from the Miqat). So I went to &#8216;Ata&#8217; asking him his view about it. He said, &#8220;Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah narrated to me, &#8216;I performed Hajj with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the day when he drove camels with him. The people had assumed Ihram for Hajj-al-Ifrad. The Prophet ordered them to finish their Ihram after Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba, and between Safa and Marwa and to cut short their hair and then to stay there (in Mecca) as non-Muhrims till the day of Tarwiya (i.e. 8th of Dhul-Hijja) when they would assume Ihram for Hajj and they were ordered to make the Ihram with which they had come as for &#8216;Umra only. They asked, &#8216;How can we make it &#8216;Umra (Tamattu&#8217;) as we have intended to perform Hajj?&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;Do what I have ordered you. Had I not brought the Hadi with me, I would have done the same, but I cannot finish my Ihram till the Hadi reaches its destination (i.e. is slaughtered).&#8217; So, they did (what he ordered them to do).&#8221;</p>

Why don&#8217;t you rebuild it on its original foundation laid by Abraham?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Were it not for the fact that your people are close to the pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently become Muslims) I would have done so.&#8221; The sub-narrator, &#8216;Abdullah (bin &#8216;Umar ) stated: &#8216;Aisha &#8216;must have heard this from Allah&#8217;s Apostle for in my opinion Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not placed his hand over the two corners of the Ka&#8217;ba opposite Al-Hijr only because the Ka&#8217;ba was not rebuilt on its original foundations laid by Abraham.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked the Prophet whether the round wall (near Ka&#8217;ba) was part of the Ka&#8217;ba. The Prophet replied in the affirmative. I further said, &#8220;What is wrong with them, why have they not included it in the building of the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see that your people (Quraish) ran short of money (so they could not include it inside the building of Ka&#8217;ba)?&#8221; I asked, &#8220;What about its gate? Why is it so high?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Your people did this so as to admit into it whomever they liked and prevent whomever they liked. Were your people not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance (i.e. they have recently embraced Islam) and were I not afraid that they would dislike it, surely I would have included the (area of the) wall inside the building of the Ka&#8217;ba and I would have lowered its gate to the level of the ground.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aisha said that the Prophet said to her, &#8220;O Aisha! Were your nation not close to the Pre-lslamic Period of Ignorance, I would have had the Ka&#8217;ba demolished and would have included in it the portion which had been left, and would have made it at a level with the ground and would have made two doors for it, one towards the east and the other towards the west, and then by doing this it would have been built on the foundations laid by Abraham.&#8221; That was what urged Ibn-Az-Zubair to demolish the Ka&#8217;ba. Jazz said, &#8220;I saw Ibn-Az-Zubair when he demolished and rebuilt the Ka&#8217;ba and included in it a portion of Al-Hijr (the unroofed portion of Ka&#8217;ba which is at present in the form of a compound towards the north-west of the Ka&#8217;ba). I saw the original foundations of Abraham which were of stones resembling the humps of camels.&#8221; So Jarir asked Yazid, &#8220;Where was the place of those stones?&#8221; Jazz said, &#8220;I will just now show it to you.&#8221; So Jarir accompanied Yazid and entered Al-Hijr, and Jazz pointed to a place and said, &#8220;Here it is.&#8221; Jarir said, &#8220;It appeared to me about six cubits from Al-Hijr or so.&#8221;</p>

Will you stay in your house in Mecca?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Has &#8216;Aqil left any property or house?&#8221; Aqil along with Talib had inherited the property of Abu Talib. Jafar and Ali did not inherit anything as they were Muslims and the other two were non-believers. &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say, &#8220;A believer cannot inherit (anything from an) infidel.&#8221; Ibn Shihab, (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;They (Umar and others) derived the above verdict from Allah&#8217;s Statement: &#8220;Verily! those who believed and Emigrated and strove with their life And property in Allah&#8217;s Cause, And those who helped (the emigrants) And gave them their places to live in, These are (all) allies to one another.&#8221; (8.72)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle performed Tawaf (of the Kaba) ending a camel (at that time the Prophet had foot injury). Whenever he came to the Corner (having the Black Stone) he would point out towards it with a thing in his hand and say, &#8220;Allahu-Akbar.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to the drinking place and asked for water. Al-Abbas said, &#8220;O Fadl! Go to your mother and bring water from her for Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Give me water to drink.&#8221; Al-Abbas said, &#8220;O Allahs Apostle! The people put their hands in it.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle again said, &#8216;Give me water to drink. So, he drank from that water and then went to the Zam-zam (well) and there the people were offering water to the others and working at it (drawing water from the well). The Prophet then said to them, &#8220;Carry on! You are doing a good deed.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;Were I not afraid that other people would compete with you (in drawing water from Zam-zam), I would certainly take the rope and put it over this (i.e. his shoulder) (to draw water).&#8221; On saying that the Prophet pointed to his shoulder.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the year of his Last Hajj and we mended (the Ihram) for &#8216;Umra. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has a Hadi with him should assume Ihram for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra, and should not finish it till he performs both of the them (Hajj and &#8216;Umra).&#8221; When we reached Mecca, I had my menses. When we had performed our Hajj, the Prophet sent me with &#8216;Abdur-Rahman to Tan&#8217;im and I performed the &#8216;Umra. The Prophet said, &#8220;This is in lieu of your missed &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Those who had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra performed Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) and then finished their Ihram. And then they performed another Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa) after returning from Mina. And those who had assumed lhram for Hajj and &#8216;Umra to get her ( Hajj-Qiran ) performed only one Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar and his riding animal entered the house of Ibn &#8216;Umar. He (the son of Ibn &#8216;Umar) said, &#8220;I fear that this year a battle might take place between the people and you might be prevented from going to the Ka&#8217;ba. I suggest that you should stay here.&#8221; Ibn Umar said, &#8220;Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out for the pilgrimage, and the pagans of Quraish intervened between him and the Ka&#8217;ba. So, if the people intervened between me and the Ka&#8217;ba, I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had done . . . &#8220;Verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example.&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;I make you a witness that I have intended to perform Hajj along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; After arriving at Mecca, Ibn &#8216;Umar performed one Tawaf only (between Safa and Marwa).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 704:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi&#8217;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar intended to perform Hajj in the year when Al-Hajjaj attacked Ibn Az-Zubair. Somebody said to Ibn &#8216;Umar, &#8220;There is a danger of an impending war between them.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example. (And if it happened as you say) then I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had done. I make you witness that I have decided to perform &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Then he set out and when he reached Al-Baida&#8217;, he said, &#8220;The ceremonies of both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar. I make you witness that I have made Hajj compulsory for me along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He drove (to Mecca) a Hadi which he had bought from (a place called) Qudaid and did not do more than that. He did not slaughter the Hadi or finish his Ihram, or shave or cut short his hair till the day of slaughtering the sacrifices (10th Dhul-Hijja). Then he slaughtered his Hadi and shaved his head and considered the first Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) as sufficient for Hajj and &#8216;Umra. Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle did the same.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 705:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muhammad bin &#8216;AbdurRahman bin Nawfal Al-Qurashi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Urwa bin Az-Zubair (regarding the Hajj of the Prophet ). &#8216;Urwa replied, &#8220;Aisha narrated, &#8216;When the Prophet reached Mecca, the first thing he started with was the ablution, then he performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and his intention was not &#8216;Umra alone (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together).&#8217; &#8221; Later Abu Bakr I performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together). And then &#8216;Umar did the same. Then &#8216;Uthman performed the Hajj and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone. And then Muawiya and &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar did the same. I performed Hajj with Ibn Az-Zubair and the first thing he started with was Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and it was not &#8216;Umra alone, (but Hajj and &#8216;Umra together). Then I saw the Muhajirin (Emigrants) and Ansar doing the same and it was not &#8216;Umra alone. And the last person I saw doing the same was Ibn &#8216;Umar, and he did not do another &#8216;Umra after finishing the first. Now here is Ibn &#8216;Umar present amongst the people! They neither ask him nor anyone of the previous ones. And all these people, on entering Mecca, would not start with anything unless they had performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and would not finish their Ihram. And no doubt, I saw my mother and my aunt, on entering Mecca doing nothing before performing Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and they would not finish their lhram. And my mother informed me that she, her sister, Az-Zubair and such and such persons had assumed lhram for &#8216;Umra and after passing their hands over the Corner (the Black Stone) (i.e. finishing their Umra) they finished their Ihram.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 26, Number 706:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha : &#8220;How do you interpret the statement of Allah,. : Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah, and whoever performs the Hajj to the Ka&#8217;ba or performs &#8216;Umra, it is not harmful for him to perform Tawaf between them (Safa and Marwa.) (2.158). By Allah! (it is evident from this revelation) there is no harm if one does not perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O, my nephew! Your interpretation is not true. Had this interpretation of yours been correct, the statement of Allah should have been, &#8216;It is not harmful for him if he does not perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; But in fact, this divine inspiration was revealed concerning the Ansar who used to assume lhram for worship ping an idol called &#8220;Manat&#8221; which they used to worship at a place called Al-Mushallal before they embraced Islam, and whoever assumed Ihram (for the idol), would consider it not right to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When they embraced Islam, they asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) regarding it, saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221; So Allah revealed: &#8216;Verily; (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.&#8217; &#8221; Aisha added, &#8220;Surely, Allah&#8217;s Apostle set the tradition of Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, so nobody is allowed to omit the Tawaf between them.&#8221; Later on I (&#8216;Urwa) told Abu Bakr bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s narration) and he said, &#8216;i have not heard of such information, but I heard learned men saying that all the people, except those whom &#8216;Aisha mentioned and who used to assume lhram for the sake of Manat, used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah referred to the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and did not mention Safa and Marwa in the Quran, the people asked, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We used to perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa and Allah has revealed (the verses concerning) Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and has not mentioned Safa and Marwa. Is there any harm if we perform Tawaf between Safa and Marwa?&#8217; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah.&#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;It seems that this verse was revealed concerning the two groups, those who used to refrain from Tawaf between Safa and Marwa in the Pre-lslamic Period of ignorance and those who used to perform the Tawaf then, and after embracing Islam they refrained from the Tawaf between them as Allah had enjoined Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and did not mention Tawaf (of Safa and Marwa) till later after mentioning the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8217;</p>

In Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) you have a good example.&#8221; We asked Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah (the same question) and he said, &#8220;He (that man) should not come near (his wife) till he has completed Tawaf between Safa and Marwa.&#8221;</p>

(The two mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa are among the symbols of Allah. It is therefore no sin for him who performs the pilgrimage to the Ka&#8217;ba, or performs &#8216;Umra, to perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; &#8221; (2.158)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I was menstruating when I reached Mecca. So, I neither performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, nor the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa. Then I informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it. He replied, &#8220;Perform all the ceremonies of Hajj like the other pilgrims, but do not perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba till you get clean (from your menses).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet (p.b.u.h) and Talha had the Hadi (sacrifice) with them. &#8216;Ali arrived from Yemen and had a Hadi with him. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram for what the Prophet has done.&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions to perform the &#8216;Umra with the lhram which they had assumed, and after finishing Tawaf (of Ka&#8217;ba, Safa and Marwa) to cut short their hair, and to finish their lhram except those who had Hadi with them. They (the people) said, &#8220;How can we proceed to Mina (for Hajj) after having sexual relations with our wives?&#8221; When that news reached the Prophet he said, &#8220;If I had formerly known what I came to know lately, I would not have brought the Hadi with me. Had there been no Hadi with me, I would have finished the state of lhram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha got her menses, so she performed all the ceremonies of Hajj except Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, and when she got clean (from her menses), she performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba. She said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (All of you) are returning with the Hajj and &#8216;Umra, but I am returning after performing Hajj only.&#8221; So the Prophet ordered &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Bakr to accompany her to Tan&#8217;im and thus she performed the &#8216;Umra after the Hajj.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(On &#8216;Id) We used to forbid our virgins to go out (for &#8216;Id prayer). A lady came and stayed at the Palace of Bani Khalaf. She mentioned that her sister was married to one of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle who participated in twelve Ghazawats along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and her sister was with him in six of them. She said, &#8220;We used to dress the wounded and look after the patients.&#8221; She (her sister) asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle , &#8220;Is there any harm for a woman to stay at home if she doesn&#8217;t have a veil?&#8221; He said, &#8220;She should cover herself with the veil of her companion and she should take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers.&#8221; When Um &#8216;Atiyya came, I asked her. &#8220;Did you hear anything about that?&#8221; Um &#8216;Atiyya said, &#8220;Bi Abi&#8221; and she never mentioned the name of Allah&#8217;s Apostle without saying &#8220;Bi Abi&#8221; (i.e. &#8216;Let my father be sacrificed for you&#8217;). We asked her, &#8220;Have you heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying so and so (about women)?&#8221; She replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;Let my father be sacrificed for him. He told us that unmarried mature virgins who stay often screened or unmarried young virgins and mature girls who stay often screened should come out and take part in the good deeds and in the religious gatherings of the believers. But the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).&#8221; I asked her, &#8220;The menstruating women?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t they present themselves at &#8216;Arafat and at such and such places?&#8221;</p>

Al-Hajjaj came Out, wrapping himself with a waist-sheet dyed with safflower, and said, &#8220;O Abu Abdur-Rahman! What is the matter?&#8221; He said, If you want to follow the Sunna (the tradition of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) then proceed (to &#8216;Arafat).&#8221; Al-Hajjaj asked, &#8220;At this very hour?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Please wait for me till I pour some water over my head (i.e. take a bath) and come out.&#8221; Then Ibn &#8216;Umar dismounted and waited till Al-Hajjaj came out. So, he (Al-Hajjaj) walked in between me and my father (Ibn &#8216;Umar).

Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Let us proceed (to &#8216;Arafat).&#8221; Al-Hajjaj asked, &#8220;Just now?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; Al-Hajjaj said, &#8220;Wait for me till I pour water on me (i.e. take a bath).&#8221; So, Ibn &#8216;Umar dismounted (and waited) till Al-Hajjaj came out. He was walking between me and my father. I informed Al-Hajjaj, &#8220;If you want to follow the Sunna today, then you should shorten the sermon and then hurry up for the stay (at &#8216;Arafat).&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;He (Salim) has spoken the truth.&#8221;</p>

Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im said, &#8220;My camel was lost and I went out in search of it on the day of &#8216;Arafat, and I saw the Prophet standing in &#8216;Arafat. I said to myself: By Allah he is from the Hums (literally: strictly religious, Quraish were called so, as they used to say, &#8216;We are the people of Allah we shall not go out of the sanctuary).

The Hums used to give clothes to the men who would perform the Tawaf wearing them; and women (of the Hums) used to give clothes to the women who would perform the Tawaf wearing them. Those to whom the Hums did not give clothes would perform Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba naked. Most of the people used to go away (disperse) directly from &#8216;Arafat but they (Hums) used to depart after staying at Al-Muzdalifa. &#8216;Urwa added, &#8220;My father narrated that &#8216;Aisha had said, &#8216;The following verses were revealed about the Hums: Then depart from the place whence all the people depart&#8211;(2.199) &#8216;Urwa added, &#8220;They (the Hums) used to stay at Al-Muzdalifa and used to depart from there (to Mina) and so they were sent to &#8216;Arafat (by Allah&#8217;s order).&#8221;</p>

He ordered a man to pronounce the Adhan and Iqama and then he offered the Maghrib prayer and offered two Rakat after it. Then he asked for his supper and took it, and then, I think, he ordered a man to pronounce the Adhan and Iqama (for the &#8216;isha&#8217; prayer). (&#8216;Amr, a sub-narrator said: The intervening statement &#8216;I think&#8217;, was said by the sub-narrator Zuhair) (i.e. not by &#8216;Abdu-Rahman).

So some of them would reach Mina at the time of the Fajr prayer and some of them would come later. When they reached Mina they would throw pebbles on the Jamra (Jamrat-al-Aqaba) Ibn &#8216;Umar used to say, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the permission to them (weak people) to do so.&#8221;</p>

The second prayer is the morning prayer which is offered at this hour.&#8217; &#8221; Then &#8216;Abdullah stayed there till it became a bit brighter.

Allah&#8217;s Apostle started by assuming Ihram for&#8217;Umra and Hajj. And the people, too, performed the &#8216;Umra and Hajj along with the Prophet. Some of them brought the Hadi and drove it along with them, while the others did not. So, when the Prophet arrived at Mecca. he said to the people, &#8220;Whoever among you has driven the Hadi, should not finish his Ihram till he completes his Hajj. And whoever among you has not (driven) the Hadi with him, should perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and the Tawaf between Safa and Marwa, then cut short his hair and finish his Ihram, and should later assume Ihram for Hajj; but he must offer a Hadi (sacrifice); and if anyone cannot afford a Hadi, he should fast for three days during the Hajj and seven days when he returns home. The Prophet performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba on his arrival (at Mecca); he touched the (Black Stone) corner first of all and then did Ramal (fast walking with moving of the shoulders) during the first three rounds round the Ka&#8217;ba, and during the last four rounds he walked. After finishing Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, he offered a two Rakat prayer at Maqam Ibrahim, and after finishing the prayer he went to Safa and Marwa and performed seven rounds of Tawaf between them and did not do any deed forbidden because of Ihram, till he finished all the ceremonies of his Hajj and sacrificed his Hadi on the day of Nahr (10th day of Dhul-Hijja). He then hastened onwards (to Mecca) and performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and then everything that was forbidden because of Ihram became permissible.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar intended to perform Hajj in the year of the Hajj of Al-Harawriya during the rule of Ibn Az-Zubair. Some people said to him, &#8220;It is very likely that there will be a fight among the people, and we are afraid that they might prevent you (from performing Hajj).&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle there is a good example for you (to follow). In this case I would do the same as he had done. I make you witness that I have intended to perform &#8216;Umra.&#8221; When he reached Al-Baida&#8217;, he said, &#8220;The conditions for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are the same. I make you witness that I have intended to perform Hajj along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; After that he took a garlanded Hadi (to Mecca) which he bought (on the way). When he reached (Mecca), he performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and of Safa (and Marwa) and did not do more than that. He did not make legal for himself the things which were illegal for a Muhrim till it was the Day of Nahr (sacrifice), when he had his head shaved and slaughtered (the sacrifice) and considered sufficient his first Tawaf (between Safa and Marwa), as a (Sa&#8217;i) for his Hajj and &#8216;Umra both.

And do you know which month is this?&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know it better.&#8221; He said, &#8220;This is the forbidden (sacred) month.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;No doubt, Allah made your blood, your properties, and your honor sacred to one another like the sanctity of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours.&#8221; Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: On the Day of Nahr (10th of Dhul-Hijja), the Prophet stood in between the Jamrat during his Hajj which he performed (as in the previous Hadith) and said, &#8220;This is the greatest Day (i.e. 10th of Dhul-Hijjah).&#8221; The Prophet started saying repeatedly, &#8220;O Allah! Be Witness (I have conveyed Your Message).&#8221; He then bade the people farewell. The people said, &#8220;This is Hajjat-al-Wada).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out with the Prophet with the intention of performing Hajj only. The Prophet reached Mecca and performed Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa and did not finish the Ihram, because he had the Hadi with him. His companions and his wives performed Tawaf (of the Ka&#8217;ba and between Safa and Marwa), and those who had no Hadi with them finished their Ihram. I got the menses and performed all the ceremonies of Hajj. So, when the Night of Hasba (night of departure) came, I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! All your companions are returning with Hajj and &#8216;Umra except me.&#8221; He asked me, &#8220;Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba (Umra) when you reached Mecca?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Go to Tan&#8217;im with your brother &#8216;Abdur-Rahman, and assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra and I will wait for you at such and such a place.&#8221; So I went with &#8216;Abdur-Rahman to Tan&#8217;im and assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra. Then Safiya bint Huyay got menses. The Prophet said, &#8221; &#8216;Aqra Halqa! You will detain us! Didn&#8217;t you perform Tawaf-al-Ifada on the Day of Nahr (slaughtering)?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes, I did.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Then there is no harm, depart.&#8221; So I met the Prophet when he was ascending the heights towards Mecca and I was descending, or vice-versa.</p>

I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt about &#8216;Isha&#8217; (i.e. he used to offer it there also), and he used to sleep there for a while.

He said, &#8220;Then depart.&#8221; (Different narrators mentioned that) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle (from Medina) with the intention of performing Hajj only. When we reached Mecca, he ordered us to finish the Ihram. When it was the night of Nafr (departure), Safiya bint Huyay got her menses. The Prophet said, &#8220;Halqa Aqra!

<h3 align="center">Conditions </h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.050.874">Volume 3, Book 50, Number 874: </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Marwan and al-Miswar bin Makhrama: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(from the companions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle) When Suhail bin Amr agreed to the Treaty (of  Hudaibiya), one of the things he stipulated then, was that the Prophet should return to  them (i.e. the pagans) anyone coming to him from their side, even if he was a Muslim; and  would not interfere between them and that person. The Muslims did not like this condition  and got disgusted with it. Suhail did not agree except with that condition. So, the  Prophet agreed to that condition and returned Abu Jandal to his father Suhail bin &#8216;Amr.  Thenceforward the Prophet returned everyone in that period (of truce) even if he was a  Muslim. During that period some believing women emigrants including Um Kalthum bint Uqba  bin Abu Muait who came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she was a young lady then. Her relative came  to the Prophet and asked him to return her, but the Prophet did not return her to them for  Allah had revealed the following Verse regarding women: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe! When the believing women come to you as emigrants. Examine  them, Allah knows best as to their belief, then if you know them for true believers, Send  them not back to the unbelievers, (for) they are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers,  Nor are the unbelievers lawful (husbands) for them (60.10) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Urwa: Aisha told me, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to examine them according to  this Verse: &#8220;O you who believe! When the believing women come to you, as emigrants  test them . . . for Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (60.10-12) Aisha said,  &#8220;When any of them agreed to that condition Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say to her, &#8216;I have  accepted your pledge of allegiance.&#8217; He would only say that, but, by Allah he never  touched the hand of any women (i.e. never shook hands with them) while taking the pledge  of allegiance and he never took their pledge of allegiance except by his words  (only).&#8221; </p>

<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Urwa: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha told me that Buraira came to seek her help in writing for emancipation and at  that time she had not paid any part of her price. &#8216;Aisha said to her, &#8220;Go to your  masters and if they agree that I will pay your price (and free you) on condition that your  Wala&#8217; will be for me, I will pay the money.&#8221; Buraira told her masters about that, but  they refused, and said, &#8220;If &#8216;Aisha wants to do a favor she could, but your Wala will  be for us.&#8221; Aisha informed Allah&#8217;s Apostle of that and he said to her, &#8220;Buy and  manumit Buraira as the Wala&#8217; will go to the manumitted.&#8221; </p>

<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was riding a (slow) and tired camel, the Prophet passed by and beat it and  prayed for Allah&#8217;s Blessings for it. The camel became so fast as it had never been before.  The Prophet then said, &#8220;Sell it to me for one Uqiyya (of gold).&#8221; I said,  &#8220;No.&#8221; He again said, &#8220;Sell it to me for one Uqiyya (of gold).&#8221; I sold  it and stipulated that I should ride it to my house. When we reached (Medina) I took that  camel to the Prophet and he gave me its price. I returned home but he sent for me (and  when I went to him) he said, &#8220;I will not take your camel. Take your camel as a gift  for you.&#8221; (Various narrations are mentioned here with slight variations in  expressions relating the condition that Jabir had the right to ride the sold camel up to  Medina). </p>

<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Rafi bin Khadij: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to work on the fields more than the other Ansar, and we used to rent the land  (for the yield of a specific portion of it). But sometimes that portion or the rest of the  land did not give any yield, so we were forbidden (by the Prophet ) to follow such a  system, but we were allowed to rent the land for money. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;No town-dweller should sell for a bedouin. Do not practice  Najsh (i.e. Do not offer a high price for a thing which you do not want to buy, in order  to deceive the people). No Muslim should offer more for a thing already bought by his  Muslim brother, nor should he demand the hand of a girl already engaged to another Muslim.  A Muslim woman shall not try to bring about The divorce of her sister (i.e. another Muslim  woman) in order to take her place herself.&#8221; </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A bedouin came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s apostle! I ask you by Allah  to judge My case according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; His opponent, who was more learned than  he, said, &#8220;Yes, judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws, and allow me to  speak.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Speak.&#8221; He (i .e. the bedouin or the other  man) said, &#8220;My son was working as a laborer for this (man) and he committed illegal  sexual intercourse with his wife. The people told me that it was obligatory that my son  should be stoned to death, so in lieu of that I ransomed my son by paying one hundred  sheep and a slave girl. Then I asked the religious scholars about it, and they informed me  that my son must be lashed one hundred lashes, and be exiled for one year, and the wife of  this (man) must be stoned to death.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;By Him in Whose  Hands my soul is, I will judge between you according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. The slave-girl and  the sheep are to be returned to you, your son is to receive a hundred lashes and be exiled  for one year. You, Unais, go to the wife of this (man) and if she confesses her guilt,  stone her to death.&#8221; Unais went to that woman next morning and she confessed. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle ordered that she be stoned to death. </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Moses the Apostle of Allah,&#8221; and then he narrated the  whole story about him. Al-Khadir said to Moses, &#8220;Did not I tell you that you can have  no patience with me.&#8221; (18.72). Moses then violated the agreement for the first time  because of forgetfulness, then Moses promised that if he asked Al-Khadir about anything,  the latter would have the right to desert him. Moses abided by that condition and on the  third occasion he intentionally asked Al-Khadir and caused that condition to be applied.  The three occasions referred to above are referred to by the following Verses: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Call me not to account for forgetting And be not hard upon me.&#8221; (18.73) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then they met a boy and Khadir killed him.&#8221; (18.74) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then they proceeded and found a wall which was on the verge of falling and Khadir  set it up straight.&#8221; (18.77) </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said, &#8220;Buraira came to me and said, &#8216;My people (masters) have written the  contract for my emancipation for nine Awaq ) of gold) to be paid in yearly installments,  one Uqiyya per year; so help me.&#8221; Aisha said (to her), &#8220;If your masters agree, I  will pay them the whole sum provided the Wala will be for me.&#8221; Buraira went to her  masters and told them about it, but they refused the offer and she returned from them  while Allah&#8217;s Apostles was sitting. She said, &#8220;I presented the offer to them, but  they refused unless the Wala&#8217; would be for them.&#8221; When the Prophet heard that and  &#8216;Aisha told him about It, he said to her, &#8220;Buy Buraira and let them stipulate that  her Wala&#8217; will be for them, as the Wala&#8217; is for the manumitted.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha did so. After  that Allah&#8217;s Apostle got up amidst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah and said,  &#8220;What is wrong with some people who stipulate things which are not in Allah&#8217;s Laws?  Any condition which is not in Allah&#8217;s Laws is invalid even if there were a hundred such  conditions. Allah&#8217;s Rules are the most valid and Allah&#8217;s Conditions are the most solid.  The Wala is for the manumitted.&#8221; </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the people of Khaibar dislocated Abdullah bin Umar&#8217;s hands and feet, Umar got up  delivering a sermon saying, &#8220;No doubt, Allah&#8217;s Apostle made a contract with the Jews  concerning their properties, and said to them, &#8216;We allow you (to stand in your land) as  long as Allah allows you.&#8217; Now Abdullah bin Umar went to his land and was attacked at  night, and his hands and feet were dislocated, and as we have no enemies there except  those Jews, they are our enemies and the only people whom we suspect, I have made up my  mind to exile them.&#8221; When Umar decided to carry out his decision, a son of Abu  Al-Haqiq&#8217;s came and addressed &#8216;Umar, &#8220;O chief of the believers, will you exile us  although Muhammad allowed us to stay at our places, and made a contract with us about our  properties, and accepted the condition of our residence in our land?&#8221; &#8216;Umar said,  &#8220;Do you think that I have forgotten the statement of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, i.e.: What will  your condition be when you are expelled from Khaibar and your camel will be carrying you  night after night?&#8221; The Jew replied, &#8220;That was joke from Abu-l-Qasim.&#8221;  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O the enemy of Allah! You are telling a lie.&#8221; &#8216;Umar then drove them  out and paid them the price of their properties in the form of fruits, money, camel  saddles and ropes, etc.&#8221; </p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 50, Number 891: </p>
<p>  </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and Marwan: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(whose narrations attest each other) Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out at the time of  Al-Hudaibiya (treaty), and when they proceeded for a distance, he said, &#8220;Khalid bin  Al-Walid leading the cavalry of Quraish constituting the front of the army, is at a place  called Al-Ghamim, so take the way on the right.&#8221; By Allah, Khalid did not perceive  the arrival of the Muslims till the dust arising from the march of the Muslim army reached  him, and then he turned back hurriedly to inform Quraish. The Prophet went on advancing  till he reached the Thaniyya (i.e. a mountainous way) through which one would go to them  (i.e. people of Quraish). The she-camel of the Prophet sat down. The people tried their  best to cause the she-camel to get up but in vain, so they said, &#8220;Al-Qaswa&#8217; (i.e. the  she-camel&#8217;s name) has become stubborn! Al-Qaswa&#8217; has become stubborn!&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;Al-Qaswa&#8217; has not become stubborn, for stubbornness is not her habit, but she  was stopped by Him Who stopped the elephant.&#8221; Then he said, &#8220;By the Name of Him  in Whose Hands my soul is, if they (i.e. the Quraish infidels) ask me anything which will  respect the ordinances of Allah, I will grant it to them.&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet then rebuked the she-camel and she got up. The Prophet changed his way till  he dismounted at the farthest end of Al-Hudaibiya at a pit (i.e. well) containing a little  water which the people used in small amounts, and in a short while the people used up all  its water and complained to Allah&#8217;s Apostle; of thirst. The Prophet took an arrow out of  his arrow-case and ordered them to put the arrow in that pit. By Allah, the water started  and continued sprouting out till all the people quenched their thirst and returned with  satisfaction. While they were still in that state, Budail bin Warqa-al-Khuza&#8217;i came with  some persons from his tribe Khuza&#8217;a and they were the advisers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle who  would keep no secret from him and were from the people of Tihama. Budail said, &#8220;I  left Kab bin Luai and &#8216;Amir bin Luai residing at the profuse water of Al-Hudaibiya and  they had milch camels (or their women and children) with them, and will wage war against  you, and will prevent you from visiting the Kaba.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;We  have not come to fight anyone, but to perform the &#8216;Umra. No doubt, the war has weakened  Quraish and they have suffered great losses, so if they wish, I will conclude a truce with  them, during which they should refrain from interfering between me and the people (i.e.  the &#8216;Arab infidels other than Quraish), and if I have victory over those infidels, Quraish  will have the option to embrace Islam as the other people do, if they wish; they will at  least get strong enough to fight. But if they do not accept the truce, by Allah in Whose  Hands my life is, I will fight with them defending my Cause till I get killed, but (I am  sure) Allah will definitely make His Cause victorious.&#8221; Budail said, &#8220;I will  inform them of what you have said.&#8221; So, he set off till he reached Quraish and said,  &#8220;We have come from that man (i.e. Muhammad) whom we heard saying something which we  will disclose to you if you should like.&#8221; Some of the fools among Quraish shouted  that they were not in need of this information, but the wiser among them said,  &#8220;Relate what you heard him saying.&#8221; Budail said, &#8220;I heard him saying  so-and-so,&#8221; relating what the Prophet had told him. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Urwa bin Mas&#8217;ud got up and said, &#8220;O people! Aren&#8217;t you the sons? They said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He added, &#8220;Am I not the father?&#8221; They said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;Do you mistrust me?&#8221; They said, &#8220;No.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you  know that I invited the people of &#8216;Ukaz for your help, and when they refused I brought my  relatives and children and those who obeyed me (to help you)?&#8221; They said,  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Well, this man (i.e. the Prophet) has offered you a  reasonable proposal, you&#8217;d better accept it and allow me to meet him.&#8221; They said,  &#8220;You may meet him.&#8221; So, he went to the Prophet and started talking to him. The  Prophet told him almost the same as he had told Budail. Then Urwa said, &#8220;O Muhammad!  Won&#8217;t you feel any scruple in extirpating your relations? Have you ever heard of anyone  amongst the Arabs extirpating his relatives before you? On the other hand, if the reverse  should happen, (nobody will aid you, for) by Allah, I do not see (with you) dignified  people, but people from various tribes who would run away leaving you alone.&#8221; Hearing  that, Abu Bakr abused him and said, &#8220;Do you say we would run and leave the Prophet  alone?&#8221; Urwa said, &#8220;Who is that man?&#8221; They said, &#8220;He is Abu  Bakr.&#8221; Urwa said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;By Him in Whose Hands my life is, were it not for  the favor which you did to me and which I did not compensate, I would retort on you.&#8221;  Urwa kept on talking to the Prophet and seizing the Prophet&#8217;s beard as he was talking  while Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba was standing near the head of the Prophet, holding a sword and  wearing a helmet. Whenever Urwa stretched his hand towards the beard of the Prophet,  Al-Mughira would hit his hand with the handle of the sword and say (to Urwa), &#8220;Remove  your hand from the beard of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Urwa raised his head and asked,  &#8220;Who is that?&#8221; The people said, &#8220;He is Al-Mughira bin Shu&#8217;ba.&#8221; Urwa  said, &#8220;O treacherous! Am I not doing my best to prevent evil consequences of your  treachery?&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before embracing Islam Al-Mughira was in the company of some people. He killed them and  took their property and came (to Medina) to embrace Islam. The Prophet said (to him,  &#8220;As regards your Islam, I accept it, but as for the property I do not take anything  of it. (As it was taken through treason). Urwa then started looking at the Companions of  the Prophet. By Allah, whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle spat, the spittle would fall in the hand  of one of them (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s companions) who would rub it on his face and skin; if  he ordered them they would carry his orders immediately; if he performed ablution, they  would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke to him, they would lower  their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of respect. Urwa returned to  his people and said, &#8220;O people! By Allah, I have been to the kings and to Caesar,  Khosrau and An-Najashi, yet I have never seen any of them respected by his courtiers as  much as Muhammad is respected by his companions. By Allah, if he spat, the spittle would  fall in the hand of one of them (i.e. the Prophet&#8217;s companions) who would rub it on his  face and skin; if he ordered them, they would carry out his order immediately; if he  performed ablution, they would struggle to take the remaining water; and when they spoke,  they would lower their voices and would not look at his face constantly out of  respect.&#8221; Urwa added, &#8220;No doubt, he has presented to you a good reasonable  offer, so please accept it.&#8221; A man from the tribe of Bani Kinana said, &#8220;Allow me  to go to him,&#8221; and they allowed him, and when he approached the Prophet and his  companions, Allah&#8217;s Ap le I said, &#8220;He is so-and-so who belongs to the tribe that  respects the Budn (i.e. camels of the sacrifice). So, bring the Budn in front of  him.&#8221; So, the Budn were brought before him and the people received him while they  were reciting Talbiya. When he saw that scene, he said, &#8220;Glorified be Allah! It is  not fair to prevent these people from visiting the Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; When he returned to his  people, he said, &#8216;I saw the Budn garlanded (with colored knotted ropes) and marked (with  stabs on their backs). I do not think it is advisable to prevent them from visiting the  Ka&#8217;ba.&#8221; Another person called Mikraz bin Hafs got up and sought their permission to  go to Muhammad, and they allowed him, too. When he approached the Muslims, the Prophet  said, &#8220;Here is Mikraz and he is a vicious man.&#8221; Mikraz started talking to the  Prophet and as he was talking, Suhail bin Amr came. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Suhail bin Amr came, the Prophet said, &#8220;Now the matter has become easy.&#8221;  Suhail said to the Prophet &#8220;Please conclude a peace treaty with us.&#8221; So, the  Prophet called the clerk and said to him, &#8220;Write: By the Name of Allah, the most  Beneficent, the most Merciful.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;As for &#8216;Beneficent,&#8217; by Allah, I  do not know what it means. So write: By Your Name O Allah, as you used to write  previously.&#8221; The Muslims said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not write except: By the Name  of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Write: By  Your Name O Allah.&#8221; Then he dictated, &#8220;This is the peace treaty which Muhammad,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle has concluded.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;By Allah, if we knew that you are  Allah&#8217;s Apostle we would not prevent you from visiting the Kaba, and would not fight with  you. So, write: &#8220;Muhammad bin Abdullah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;By Allah! I am  Apostle of Allah even if you people do not believe me. Write: Muhammad bin Abdullah.&#8221;  (Az-Zuhri said, &#8220;The Prophet accepted all those things, as he had already said that  he would accept everything they would demand if it respects the ordinance of Allah, (i.e.  by letting him and his companions perform &#8216;Umra.)&#8221; The Prophet said to Suhail,  &#8220;On the condition that you allow us to visit the House (i.e. Ka&#8217;ba) so that we may  perform Tawaf around it.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;By Allah, we will not (allow you this  year) so as not to give chance to the &#8216;Arabs to say that we have yielded to you, but we  will allow you next year.&#8221; So, the Prophet got that written. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Suhail said, &#8220;We also stipulate that you should return to us whoever comes to  you from us, even if he embraced your religion.&#8221; The Muslims said, &#8220;Glorified be  Allah! How will such a person be returned to the pagans after he has become a Muslim?  While they were in this state Abu- Jandal bin Suhail bin &#8216;Amr came from the valley of  Mecca staggering with his fetters and fell down amongst the Muslims. Suhail said, &#8220;O  Muhammad! This is the very first term with which we make peace with you, i.e. you shall  return Abu Jandal to me.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The peace treaty has not been  written yet.&#8221; Suhail said, &#8220;I will never allow you to keep him.&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, do.&#8221; He said, &#8220;I won&#8217;t do.: Mikraz said, &#8220;We allow  you (to keep him).&#8221; Abu Jandal said, &#8220;O Muslims! Will I be returned to the  pagans though I have come as a Muslim? Don&#8217;t you see how much I have suffered?&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Jandal had been tortured severely for the Cause of Allah. Umar bin Al-Khattab said,  &#8220;I went to the Prophet and said, &#8216;Aren&#8217;t you truly the Apostle of Allah?&#8217; The Prophet  said, &#8216;Yes, indeed.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Isn&#8217;t our Cause just and the cause of the enemy unjust?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Then why should we be humble in our religion?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I am  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I do not disobey Him, and He will make me victorious.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t  you tell us that we would go to the Ka&#8217;ba and perform Tawaf around it?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes, but  did I tell you that we would visit the Ka&#8217;ba this year?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;So you  will visit it and perform Tawaf around it?&#8217; &#8221; Umar further said, &#8220;I went to Abu  Bakr and said, &#8216;O Abu Bakr! Isn&#8217;t he truly Allah&#8217;s Prophet?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;Then why should we be humble in our religion?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Indeed, he is Allah&#8217;s Apostle  and he does not disobey his Lord, and He will make him victorious. Adhere to him as, by  Allah, he is on the right.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Was he not telling us that we would go to the Kaba  and perform Tawaf around it?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes, but did he tell you that you would go to the  Ka&#8217;ba this year?&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8220;You will go to Ka&#8217;ba and perform Tawaf  around it.&#8221; (Az-Zuhri said, &#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8216;I performed many good deeds as  expiation for the improper questions I asked them.&#8217; &#8220;) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the writing of the peace treaty was concluded, Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to his  companions, &#8220;Get up and&#8217; slaughter your sacrifices and get your head shaved.&#8221; By  Allah none of them got up, and the Prophet repeated his order thrice. When none of them  got up, he left them and went to Um Salama and told her of the people&#8217;s attitudes towards  him. Um Salama said, &#8220;O the Prophet of Allah! Do you want your order to be carried  out? Go out and don&#8217;t say a word to anybody till you have slaughtered your sacrifice and  call your barber to shave your head.&#8221; So, the Prophet went out and did not talk to  anyone of them till he did that, i.e. slaughtered the sacrifice and called his barber who  shaved his head. Seeing that, the companions of the Prophet got up, slaughtered their  sacrifices, and started shaving the heads of one another, and there was so much rush that  there was a danger of killing each other. Then some believing women came (to the Prophet  ); and Allah revealed the following Divine Verses:&#8211; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who believe, when the believing women come to you as emigrants examine them  . . .&#8221; (60.10) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar then divorced two wives of his who were infidels. Later on Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan  married one of them, and Safwan bin Umaya married the other. When the Prophet returned to  Medina, Abu Basir, a new Muslim convert from Quraish came to him. The Infidels sent in his  pursuit two men who said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Abide by the promise you gave us.&#8221;  So, the Prophet handed him over to them. They took him out (of the City) till they reached  Dhul-Hulaifa where they dismounted to eat some dates they had with them. Abu Basir said to  one of them, &#8220;By Allah, O so-and-so, I see you have a fine sword.&#8221; The other  drew it out (of the scabbard) and said, &#8220;By Allah, it is very fine and I have tried  it many times.&#8221; Abu Bair said, &#8220;Let me have a look at it.&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the other gave it to him, he hit him with it till he died, and his companion ran  away till he came to Medina and entered the Mosque running. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him  he said, &#8220;This man appears to have been frightened.&#8221; When he reached the Prophet  he said, &#8220;My companion has been murdered and I would have been murdered too.&#8221;  Abu Basir came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, by Allah, Allah has made you fulfill  your obligations by your returning me to them (i.e. the Infidels), but Allah has saved me  from them.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Woe to his mother! what excellent war kindler he  would be, should he only have supporters.&#8221; When Abu Basir heard that he understood  that the Prophet would return him to them again, so he set off till he reached the  seashore. Abu Jandal bin Suhail got himself released from them (i.e. infidels) and joined  Abu Basir. So, whenever a man from Quraish embraced Islam he would follow Abu Basir till  they formed a strong group. By Allah, whenever they heard about a caravan of Quraish  heading towards Sham, they stopped it and attacked and killed them (i.e. infidels) and  took their properties. The people of Quraish sent a message to the Prophet requesting him  for the Sake of Allah and Kith and kin to send for (i.e. Abu Basir and his companions)  promising that whoever (amongst them) came to the Prophet would be secure. So the Prophet  sent for them (i.e. Abu Basir&#8217;s companions) and Allah I revealed the following Divine  Verses: </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And it is He Who Has withheld their hands from you and your hands From them in  the midst of Mecca, After He made you the victorious over them. . . . the unbelievers had  pride and haughtiness, in their hearts . . . the pride and haughtiness of the time of  ignorance.&#8221; (48.24-26) And their pride and haughtiness was that they did not confess  (write in the treaty) that he (i.e. Muhammad) was the Prophet of Allah and refused to  write: &#8220;In the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the Most Merciful,&#8221; and  prevented the Mushriks from visiting the Ka&#8217;ba. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Az-Zuhri: Urwa said, &#8220;Aisha told me that Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to examine  the women emigrants. We have been told also that when Allah revealed the order that the  Muslims should return to the pagans what they had spent on their wives who emigrated  (after embracing Islam) and that the Mushriks should not. keep unbelieving women as their  wives, &#8216;Umar divorced two of his wives, Qariba, the daughter of Abu Urhaiya and the  daughter of Jarwal Al-Khuza&#8217;i. Later on Mu&#8217;awlya married Qariba and Abu Jahm married the  other.&#8221; </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the pagans refused to pay what the Muslims had spent on their wives, Allah  revealed: &#8220;And if any of your wives have gone from you to the unbelievers and you  have an accession (By the coming over of a woman from the other side) (Then pay to those  whose wives have gone) The equivalent of what they had spent (On their Mahr).&#8221;  (60.11) </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allah ordered that the Muslim whose wife, has gone, should be given, as a  compensation of the Mahr he had given to his wife, from the Mahr of the wives of the  pagans who had emigrated deserting their husbands. </p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not know any of the women emigrants who deserted Islam after embracing it. We  have also been told that Abu Basir bin Asid Ath-Thaqafi came to the Prophet as a Muslim  emigrant during the truce. Al-Akhnas bin Shariq wrote to the Prophet requesting him to  return Abu Basir. </p>

The Prophet said  to her, &#8220;Buy her (i.e. Buraira) and manumit her, for the Wala is for the one who  manumits.&#8221; Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle ascended the pulpit and said, &#8220;What about those  people who stipulate conditions which are not in Allah&#8217;s Laws? Whoever stipulates such  conditions as are not in Allah&#8217;s Laws, then those conditions are invalid even if he  stipulated a hundred such conditions.&#8221; </p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Witnesses </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.048.805">Volume 3, Book 48, Number 805: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Urwa bin Al-Musayyab, Alqama bin Waqqas and  Ubaidullah bin Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>About the story of &#8216;Aisha and their narrations were similar  attesting each other, when the liars said what they invented about &#8216;Aisha, and the Divine  Inspiration was delayed, Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for &#8216;Ali and Usama to consult them in  divorcing his wife (i.e. &#8216;Aisha). Usama said, &#8220;Keep your wife, as we know nothing  about her except good.&#8221; Buraira said, &#8220;I cannot accuse her of any defect except  that she is still a young girl who sleeps, neglecting her family&#8217;s dough which the  domestic goats come to eat (i.e. she was too simpleminded to deceive her husband).&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Who can help me to take revenge over the man who has harmed me  by defaming the reputation of my family? By Allah, I have not known about my  family-anything except good, and they mentioned (i.e. accused) a man about whom I did not  know anything except good.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 806: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Ubai bin Kab Al-Ansari went to the  garden where Ibn Saiyad used to live. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle entered (the garden), he (i.e.  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ) started hiding himself behind the datepalms as he wanted to hear  secretly the talk of Ibn Saiyad before the latter saw him. Ibn Saiyad wrapped with a soft  decorated sheet was lying on his bed murmuring. Ibn Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw the Prophet hiding  behind the stems of the date-palms. She addressed Ibn Saiyad saying, &#8220;O Saf, this is  Muhammad.&#8221; Hearing that Ibn Saiyad stopped murmuring (or got cautious), the Prophet  said, &#8220;If she had left him undisturbed, he would have revealed his reality.&#8221;  (See Hadith No. 290, Vol 4 for details) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 807: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The wife of Rifa&#8217;a Al-Qurazi came to the Prophet and said,  &#8220;I was Rifa&#8217;a&#8217;s wife, but he divorced me and it was a final irrevocable divorce. Then  I married AbdurRahman bin Az-Zubair but he is impotent.&#8221; The Prophet asked her &#8216;Do  you want to remarry Rifa&#8217;a? You cannot unless you had a complete sexual relation with your  present husband.&#8221; Abu Bakr was sitting with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Khalid bin Said bin  Al-&#8216;As was at the door waiting to be admitted. He said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Do you hear what  this (woman) is revealing frankly before the Prophet ?&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.048.808"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 808: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika from &#8216;Uqba bin Al-Harith:  </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Uqba married the daughter of Abu Ihab bin Aziz, and then a  woman came and said, &#8220;I suckled &#8216;Uqba and his wife.&#8221; &#8216;Uqba said to her, &#8220;I  do not know that you have suckled me, and you did not inform me.&#8221; He then sent  someone to the house of Abu Ihab to enquire about that but they did not know that she had  suckled their daughter. Then &#8216;Uqba went to the Prophet in Medina and asked him about it.  The Prophet said to him, &#8220;How (can you keep your wife) after it has been said (that  both of you were suckled by the same woman)?&#8221; So, he divorced her and she was married  to another (husband). </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.048.809"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 809: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>People were (sometimes) judged by the revealing of a Divine  Inspiration during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle but now there is no longer any more  (new revelation). Now we judge you by the deeds you practice publicly, so we will trust  and favor the one who does good deeds in front of us, and we will not call him to account  about what he is really doing in secret, for Allah will judge him for that; but we will  not trust or believe the one who presents to us with an evil deed even if he claims that  his intentions were good. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 810: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A funeral procession passed in front of the Prophet and the  people praised the deceased. The Prophet said, &#8220;It has been affirmed  (Paradise).&#8221; Then another funeral procession passed by and the people talked badly of  the deceased. The Prophet said, &#8220;It has been affirmed (Hell).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  was asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You said it has been affirmed for both?&#8221; The  Prophet said, &#8220;The testimony of the people (is accepted), (for) the believer are  Allah&#8217;s witnesses on the earth.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.048.811"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 811: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Al-Aswad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once I went to Medina where there was an outbreak of  disease and the people were dying rapidly. I was sitting with &#8216;Umar and a funeral  procession passed by. The people praised the deceased. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It has been  affirmed&#8221; (Paradise). Then another funeral procession passed by. The people praised  the deceased. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It has been affirmed.&#8221; (Paradise). Then another  funeral procession passed by. The people praised the deceased. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It has  been affirmed (Paradise).&#8221; Then a third funeral procession passed by and the people  talked badly of the deceased. &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;It has been affirmed (Hell).&#8221; I asked  Umar, &#8220;O chief of the believers! What has been affirmed?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I have  said what the Prophet said. He said, &#8216;Allah will admit into paradise any Muslim whose good  character is attested by four persons.&#8217; We asked the Prophet, &#8216;If there were three  witnesses only?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Even three.&#8217; We asked, &#8216;If there were two only?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Even  two.&#8217; But we did not ask him about one witness.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 812: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aflah asked the permission to visit me but I did not allow  him. He said, &#8220;Do you veil yourself before me although I am your uncle?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha  said, &#8220;How is that?&#8221; Aflah replied, &#8220;You were suckled by my brother&#8217;s wife  with my brother&#8217;s milk.&#8221; I asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it, and he said, &#8220;Allah  is right, so permit him to visit you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 813: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said about Hamza&#8217;s daughter, &#8220;I am not  legally permitted to marry her, as foster relations are treated like blood relations (in  marital affairs). She is the daughter of my foster brother.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.048.814"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 814: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Amra bint &#8216;Abdur-Rahman: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet told her uncle that  once, while the Prophet was in her house, she heard a man asking Hafsa&#8217;s permission to  enter her house. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I think the man is Hafsa&#8217;s  foster uncle.&#8217; &#8221; &#8216;Aisha added, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! There is a man asking the  permission to enter your house.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8220;I think the man is  Hafsa&#8217;s foster uncle.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;If so-and-so were living (i.e. her foster  uncle) would he be allowed to visit me?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Yes, he would,  as the foster relations are treated like blood relations (in marital affairs).&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.048.815"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 48, Number 815: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet came to me while a man was in my house. He  said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha! Who is this (man)?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;My foster brothers&#8221;  He said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha! Be sure about your foster brothers, as fostership is only valid  if it takes place in the suckling period (before two years of age).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A woman committed theft in the Ghazwa of the Conquest (of  Mecca) and she was taken to the Prophet who ordered her hand to be cut off. &#8216;Aisha said,  &#8220;Her repentance was perfect and she was married (later) and used to come to me (after  that) and I would present her needs to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My mother asked my father to present me a gift from his  property; and he gave it to me after some hesitation. My mother said that she would not be  satisfied unless the Prophet was made a witness to it. I being a young boy, my father held  me by the hand and took me to the Prophet . He said to the Prophet, &#8220;His mother, bint  Rawaha, requested me to give this boy a gift.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do you have  other sons besides him?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Do not  make me a witness for injustice.&#8221; Narrated Ash-Shabi that the Prophet said, &#8220;I  will not become a witness for injustice.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zahdam bin Mudrab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Imran bin Husain saying, &#8220;The Prophet said,  &#8216;The best people are those living in my generation, then those coming after them, and then  those coming after (the second generation).&#8221; Imran said &#8220;I do not know whether  the Prophet mentioned two or three generations after your present generation. The Prophet  added, &#8216;There will be some people after you, who will be dishonest and will not be  trustworthy and will give witness (evidences) without being asked to give witness, and  will vow but will not fulfill their vows, and fatness will appear among them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The people of my generation are the  best, then those who follow them, and then whose who follow the latter. After that there  will come some people whose witness will go ahead of their oaths, and their oaths will go  ahead of their witness.&#8221; Ibrahim (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;We used to be beaten  for taking oaths by saying, &#8216;I bear witness by the Name of Allah or by the Covenant of  Allah.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet was asked about the great sins He said,  &#8220;They are:&#8211; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(1 ) To join others in worship with Allah, </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(2) To be undutiful to one&#8217;s parents. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(3) To kill a person (which Allah has forbidden to kill)  (i.e. to commit the crime of murdering). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(4) And to give a false witness.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet heard a man (reciting Quran) in the Mosque, and  he said, &#8220;May Allah bestow His Mercy upon him. No doubt, he made me remember such-and  such Verses of such-and-such Sura which I dropped (from my memory). </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: The Prophet performed the Tahajjud prayer  in my house, and then he heard the voice of &#8216;Abbas who was praying in the Mosque, and  said, &#8220;O &#8216;Aisha! Is this &#8216;Abbad&#8217;s voice?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;O Allah! Be merciful to &#8216;Abbas!&#8221; </font></p>

He said, &#8216;How can you (keep her as your wife) when the lady  has said that she suckled both of you (i.e. you and your wife?)&#8221; So, the Prophet  ordered him to divorce her. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) &#8220;Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle  intended to go on a journey, he would draw lots amongst his wives and would take with him  the one upon whom the lot fell. During a Ghazwa of his, he drew lots amongst us and the  lot fell upon me, and I proceeded with him after Allah had decreed the use of the veil by  women. I was carried in a Howdah (on the camel) and dismounted while still in it. When  Allah&#8217;s Apostle was through with his Ghazwa and returned home, and we approached the city  of Medina, Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered us to proceed at night. When the order of setting off  was given, I walked till I was past the army to answer the call of nature. After finishing  I returned (to the camp) to depart (with the others) and suddenly realized that my  necklace over my chest was missing. So, I returned to look for it and was delayed because  of that. The people who used to carry me on the camel, came to my Howdah and put it on the  back of the camel, thinking that I was in it, as, at that time, women were light in  weight, and thin and lean, and did not use to eat much. So, those people did not feel the  difference in the heaviness of the Howdah while lifting it, and they put it over the  camel. At that time I was a young lady. They set the camel moving and proceeded on. I  found my necklace after the army had gone, and came to their camp to find nobody. So, I  went to the place where I used to stay, thinking that they would discover my absence and  come back in my search. While in that state, I felt sleepy and slept. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Safwan bin Mu&#8217;attal As-Sulami Adh-Dhakwani was behind the  army and reached my abode in the morning. When he saw a sleeping person, he came to me,  and he used to see me before veiling. So, I got up when I heard him saying, &#8220;Inna  lil-lah-wa inn a ilaihi rajiun (We are for Allah, and we will return to Him).&#8221; He  made his camel knell down. He got down from his camel, and put his leg on the front legs  of the camel and then I rode and sat over it. Safwan set out walking, leading the camel by  the rope till we reached the army who had halted to take rest at midday. Then whoever was  meant for destruction, fell into destruction, (some people accused me falsely) and the  leader of the false accusers was &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. After that we returned to  Medina, and I became ill for one month while the people were spreading the forged  statements of the false accusers. I was feeling during my ailment as if I were not  receiving the usual kindness from the Prophet which I used to receive from him when I got  sick. But he would come, greet and say, &#8216;How is that (girl)?&#8217; I did not know anything of  what was going on till I recovered from my ailment and went out with Um Mistah to the  Manasi where we used to answer the call of nature, and we used not to go to answer the  call of nature except from night to night and that was before we had lavatories near to  our houses. And this habit of ours was similar to the habit of the old &#8216;Arabs in the open  country (or away from houses). So. I and Um Mistah bint Ruhm went out walking. Um Mistah  stumbled because of her long dress and on that she said, &#8216;Let Mistah be ruined.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;You are saying a bad word. Why are you abusing a man who took part in (the battle of)  Badr?&#8217; She said, &#8216;O Hanata (you there) didn&#8217;t you hear what they said?&#8217; Then she told me  the rumors of the false accusers. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My sickness was aggravated, and when I returned home,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me, and after greeting he said, &#8216;How is that (girl)?&#8217; I requested  him to allow me to go to my parents. I wanted then to be sure of the news through them I  Allah&#8217;s Apostle allowed me, and I went to my parents and asked my mother, &#8216;What are the  people talking about?&#8217; She said, &#8216;O my daughter! Don&#8217;t worry much about this matter. By  Allah, never is there a charming woman loved by her husband who has other wives, but the  women would forge false news about her.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Glorified be Allah! Are the people  really taking of this matter?&#8217; That night I kept on weeping and could not sleep till  morning. In the morning Allah&#8217;s Apostle called Ali bin Abu Talib and Usama bin Zaid when  he saw the Divine Inspiration delayed, to consul them about divorcing his wife (i.e.  &#8216;Aisha). Usama bin Zaid said what he knew of the good reputation of his wives and added,  &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Keep you wife, for, by Allah, we know nothing about her but good.&#8217;  &#8216;Ali bin Abu Talib said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has no imposed restrictions on you, and  there are many women other than she, yet you may ask the woman-servant who will tell you  the truth.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle called Buraira and said, &#8216;O Burair. Did you ever see  anything which roused your suspicions about her?&#8217; Buraira said, &#8216;No, by Allah Who has sent  you with the Truth, I have never seen in her anything faulty except that she is a girl of  immature age, who sometimes sleeps and leaves the dough for the goats to eat.&#8217; On that day  Allah&#8217;s Apostle ascended the pulpit and requested that somebody support him in punishing  &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Who will support me to punish that  person (&#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai bin Salul) who has hurt me by slandering the reputation of my  family? By Allah, I know nothing about my family but good, and they have accused a person  about whom I know nothing except good, and he never entered my house except in my  company.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Sad bin Mu&#8217;adh got up and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! by  Allah, I will relieve you from him. If that man is from the tribe of the Aus, then we will  chop his head off, and if he is from our brothers, the Khazraj, then order us, and we will  fulfill your order.&#8217; On that Sad bin &#8216;Ubada, the chief of the Khazraj and before this  incident, he had been a pious man, got up, motivated by his zeal for his tribe and said,  &#8216;By Allah, you have told a lie; you cannot kill him, and you will never be able to kill  him.&#8217; On that Usaid bin Al-Hadir got up and said (to Sad bin &#8216;Ubada), &#8216;By Allah! you are a  liar. By Allah, we will kill him; and you are a hypocrite, defending the hypocrites.&#8217; On  this the two tribes of Aus and Khazraj got excited and were about to fight each other,  while Allah&#8217;s Apostle was standing on the pulpit. He got down and quietened them till they  became silent and he kept quiet. On that day I kept on weeping so much so that neither did  my tears stop, nor could I sleep. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>In the morning my parents were with me and I had wept for  two nights and a day, till I thought my liver would burst from weeping. While they were  sitting with me and I was weeping, an Ansari woman asked my permission to enter, and I  allowed her to come in. She sat down and started weeping with me. While we were in this  state, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came and sat down and he had never sat with me since the day they  forged the accusation. No revelation regarding my case came to him for a month. He recited  Tashah-hud (i.e. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and Muhammad is His  Apostle) and then said, &#8216;O &#8216;Aisha! I have been informed such-and-such about you; if you  are innocent, then Allah will soon reveal your innocence, and if you have committed a sin,  then repent to Allah and ask Him to forgive you, for when a person confesses his sin and  asks Allah for forgiveness, Allah accepts his repentance.&#8217; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished  his speech my tears ceased completely and there remained not even a single drop of it. I  requested my father to reply to Allah&#8217;s Apostle on my behalf. My father said, By Allah, I  do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8217; I said to my mother, &#8216;Talk to Allah&#8217;s Apostle  on my behalf.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah, I do not know what to say to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I was a young girl and did not have much knowledge of the  Quran. I said. &#8216;I know, by Allah, that you have listened to what people are saying and  that has been planted in your minds and you have taken it as a truth. Now, if I told you  that I am innocent and Allah knows that I am innocent, you would not believe me and if I  confessed to you falsely that I am guilty, and Allah knows that I am innocent you would  believe me. By Allah, I don&#8217;t compare my situation with you except to the situation of  Joseph&#8217;s father (i.e. Jacob) who said, &#8216;So (for me) patience is most fitting against that  which you assert and it is Allah (Alone) whose help can be sought.&#8217; Then I turned to the  other side of my bed hoping that Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah I never thought  that Allah would reveal Divine Inspiration in my case, as I considered myself too inferior  to be talked of in the Holy Qur&#8217;an. I had hoped that Allah&#8217;s Apostle might have a dream in  which Allah would prove my innocence. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had not got up and nobody  had left the house before the Divine Inspiration came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. So, there  overtook him the same state which used to overtake him, (when he used to have, on being  inspired divinely). He was sweating so much so that the drops of the sweat were dropping  like pearls though it was a (cold) wintry day. When that state of Allah&#8217;s Apostle was  over, he was smiling and the first word he said, &#8216;Aisha! Thank Allah, for Allah has  declared your innocence.&#8217; My mother told me to go to Allah&#8217;s Apostle . I replied, &#8216;By  Allah I will not go to him and will not thank but Allah.&#8217; So Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily!  They who spread the slander are a gang among you . . .&#8221; (24.11) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah gave the declaration of my Innocence, Abu Bakr,  who used to provide for Mistah bin Uthatha for he was his relative, said, &#8216;By Allah, I  will never provide Mistah with anything because of what he said about Aisha.&#8217; But Allah  later revealed: &#8212; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8220;And let not those who are good and wealthy among you  swear not to help their kinsmen, those in need and those who left their homes in Allah&#8217;s  Cause. Let them forgive and overlook. Do you not wish that Allah should forgive you?  Verily! Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221; (24.22) After that Abu Bakr said,  &#8216;Yes ! By Allah! I like that Allah should forgive me,&#8217; and resumed helping Mistah whom he  used to help before. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle also asked Zainab bint Jahsh (i.e. the  Prophet&#8217;s wife about me saying, &#8216;What do you know and what did you see?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I refrain to claim hearing or seeing what I have not heard or seen. By  Allah, I know nothing except goodness about Aisha.&#8221; Aisha further added &#8220;Zainab  was competing with me (in her beauty and the Prophet&#8217;s love), yet Allah protected her  (from being malicious), for she had piety.&#8221; </font></p>

This was  said regarding me. There was a dispute about a piece of land between me and a man from the  Jews who denied my right. I took him to the Prophet. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked me, &#8216;Do you  have an evidence?&#8217; I replied in the negative. He said to the Jew, &#8216;Take an oath.&#8217; I said,  &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He will surely take an oath and take my property unjustly.&#8221; So,  Allah revealed: &#8220;Verily!

Will get painful punishment.&#8221;  (3.77) Ibn Abu Aufa added, &#8220;Such person as described above is a treacherous  Riba-eater (i.e. eater of usury). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Wail from Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever takes a false oath in order  to grab another man&#8217;s (or his brother&#8217;s) property, then Allah will be angry with him when  he will meet him.&#8221; Then Allah confirmed this by revealing the Divine Verse:  &#8220;Verily! Those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s Covenant and their  oaths . . . Will get painful punishment.&#8221; (3.77) Al-Ash&#8217;ath met me and asked,  &#8220;What did &#8216;Abdullah tell you today?&#8221; I said, &#8220;So and so.&#8221; He said,  &#8220;The Verse was revealed regarding my case.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Talha bin &#8216;Ubaidullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle asking him about Islam,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;You have to offer five compulsory prayers in a day and a night  (24 hours).&#8221; The man asked, &#8220;Is there any more compulsory prayers for me?&#8221;  Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No, unless you like to offer Nawafil (i.e. optional  prayers).&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then added, &#8220;You have to observe fasts during the  month of Ramadan.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;Am I to fast any other days?&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said, &#8220;No, unless you wish to observe the optional fast voluntarily.&#8221; Then  Allah&#8217;s Apostle told him about the compulsory Zakat. The man asked, &#8220;Do I have to  give anything besides?&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No, unless you wish to give in  charity voluntarily.&#8221; So, the man departed saying, &#8220;By Allah I will neither do  more nor less than that.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If he has said the truth he  will be successful.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has to take an oath should  swear by Allah or remain silent.&#8221; (i.e. He should not swear by other than Allah.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Um Salama: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;You people present your  cases to me and some of you may be more eloquent and persuasive in presenting their  argument. So, if I give some one&#8217;s right to another (wrongly) because of the latter&#8217;s  (tricky) presentation of the case, I am really giving him a piece of fire; so he should  not take it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Sufyan told me that Heraclius said to him, &#8220;When I  enquired you what he (i.e. Muhammad) ordered you, you replied that he ordered you to  establish the prayer, to speak the truth, to be chaste, to keep promises and to pay back  trusts.&#8221; Then Heraclius added, &#8220;These are really the qualities of a  prophet.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;The signs of a hypocrite are  three: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(1) whenever he speaks, he tells a lie, </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Jabir bin Abdullah said, &#8220;When the Prophet died, Abu  Bakr received some property from Al-Ala bin Al-Hadrami. Abu Bakr said to the people,  &#8220;Whoever has a money claim on the Prophet, or was promised something by him, should  come to us (so that we may pay him his right).&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;I said (to Abu  Bakr), Allah&#8217;s Apostle promised me that he would give me this much, and this much, and  this much (spreading his hands three times).&#8221; Jabir added, &#8220;Abu Bakr counted for  me and handed me five-hundred (gold pieces), and then five-hundred, and then  five-hundred.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A Jew from Hira asked me which one of the two periods Musa  (i.e. Prophet Moses) completed. I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, (but wait) till I see the most  learned &#8216;Arab and enquire him about it.&#8221; So, I went to Ibn &#8216;Abbas and asked him. He  replied, &#8220;Moses completed the longer and better period.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Abbas added,  &#8220;No doubt, an apostle of Allah always does what he says.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ubaidullah bin Abdullah bin Utba: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;O Muslims? How do you ask the people  of the Scriptures, though your Book (i.e. the Quran) which was revealed to His Prophet is  the most recent information from Allah and you recite it, the Book that has not been  distorted? Allah has revealed to you that the people of the scriptures have changed with  their own hands what was revealed to them and they have said (as regards their changed  Scriptures): This is from Allah, in order to get some worldly benefit thereby.&#8221; Ibn  Abbas added: &#8220;Isn&#8217;t the knowledge revealed to you sufficient to prevent you from  asking them? By Allah I have never seen any one of them asking (Muslims) about what has  been revealed to you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated An-Nu&#8217;man bin Bashir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of the person abiding  by Allah&#8217;s orders and limits (or the one who abides by the limits and regulations  prescribed by Allah) in comparison to the one who do wrong and violate Allah&#8217;s limits and  orders is like the example of people drawing lots for seats in a boat. Some of them got  seats in the upper part while the others in the lower part ; those in the, lower part have  to pass by those in the upper one to get water, and that troubled the latter. One of them  (i.e. the people in the lower part) took an axe and started making a hole in the bottom of  the boat. The people of the upper part came and asked him, (saying), &#8216;What is wrong with  you?&#8217; He replied, &#8220;You have been troubled much by my (coming up to you), and I have  to get water.&#8217; Now if they prevent him from doing that they will save him and themselves,  but if they leave him (to do what he wants), they will destroy him and themselves.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Um Al-Ala: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That when the Ansar drew lots as to which of the emigrants  should dwell with which of the Ansar, the name of Uthman bin Mazun came out (to be in  their lot). Um Al-Ala further said, &#8220;Uthman stayed with us, and we nursed him when he  got sick, but he died. We shrouded him in his clothes, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to our  house and I said, (addressing the dead &#8216;Uthman), &#8216;O Abu As-Sa&#8217;ib! May Allah be merciful to  you. I testify that Allah has blessed you.&#8217; The Prophet said to me, &#8220;How do you know  that Allah has blessed him?&#8221; I replied, &#8216;I do not know O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! May my  parents be sacrificed for you.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;As regards Uthman, by Allah he has  died and I really wish him every good, yet, by Allah, although I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle, I do  not know what will be done to him.&#8217; Um Al-Ala added, &#8216;By Allah I shall never attest the  piety of anybody after him. And what Allah&#8217;s Apostles said made me sad.&#8221; Um Al-Ala  further said, &#8220;Once I slept and saw in a dream, a flowing stream for Uthman. So I  went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him about it, he said, &#8216;That is (the symbol of) his  deeds.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to go on a journey, he  used to draw lots among his wives and would take with him the one on whom the lot fell. He  also used to fix for everyone of his wives a day and a night, but Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a gave  her day and night to &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet intending thereby to please Allah&#8217;s  Apostle. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If the people knew what is the  reward of making the call (for the prayer) and (of being in) the first row (in the  prayer), and if they found no other way to get this privilege except by casting lots, they  would certainly cast lots for it. If they knew the reward of the noon prayer, they would  race for it, and if they knew the reward of the morning (i.e. Fajr) and Isha prayers, they  would present themselves for the prayer even if they had to crawl to reach there. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;O Muslim women! None of you should  look down upon the gift sent by her she-neighbour even if it were the trotters of the  sheep (fleshless part of legs).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Urwa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Aisha said to me, &#8220;O my nephew! We used to see the  crescent, and then the crescent and then the crescent in this way we saw three crescents  in two months and no fire (for cooking) used to be made in the houses of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.  I said, &#8220;O my aunt! Then what use to sustain you?&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;The two  black things: dates and water, our neighbors from Ansar had some Manarh and they used to  present Allah&#8217;s Apostle some of their milk and he used to make us drink.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;I shall accept the invitation even  if I were invited to a meal of a sheep&#8217;s trotter, and I shall accept the gift even if it  were an arm or a trotter of a sheep.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet sent for a woman from the emigrants and she had  a slave who was a carpenter. The Prophet said to her &#8220;Order your slave to prepare the  wood (pieces) for the pulpit.&#8221; So, she ordered her slave who went and cut the wood  from the tamarisk and prepared the pulpit, for the Prophet. When he finished the pulpit,  the woman informed the Prophet that it had been finished. The Prophet asked her to send  that pulpit to him, so they brought it. The Prophet lifted it and placed it at the place  in which you see now.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 744: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Qatada Al-Aslami: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That his father said, &#8220;One day I was sitting with some  of the Prophet&#8217;s companions on the way to Mecca. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was ahead of us. All of  my companions were in the state of Ihram while I was a non-Muhrim. They saw an onager  while I was busy repairing my shoes, so they did not tell me about it but they wished I  had seen it. By chance I looked up and saw it. So, I turned to the horse, saddled it and  rode on it, forgetting to take the spear and the whip. I asked them if they could hand  over to me the whip and the spear but they said, &#8216;No, by Allah, we shall not help you in  that in any way.&#8217; I became angry and got down from the horse, picked up both the things  and rode the horse again. I attacked the onager and slaughtered it, and brought it (after  it had been dead). They took it (cooked some of it) and started eating it, but they  doubted whether it was allowed for them to eat it or not, as they were in the state of  Ihram. So, we proceeded and I hid with me one of its fore-legs. When we met Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and asked him about the case, he asked, &#8216;Do you have a portion of it with you?&#8217; I  replied in the affirmative and gave him that fleshy fore-leg which he ate completely while  he was in the state of Ihram . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 745: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle visited us in this house of ours and  asked for something to drink. We milked one of our sheep and mixed it with water from this  well of ours and gave it to him. Abu Bakr was sitting on his left side and &#8216;Umar in front  of him and a bedouin on his right side. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle finished, &#8216;Umar said to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle &#8220;Here is Abu Bakr.&#8221; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the remaining milk  to the bedouin and said twice, &#8220;The (persons on the) right side! So, start from the  right side.&#8221; Anas added, &#8220;It is a Sunna (the Prophet&#8217;s traditions)&#8221; and  repeated it thrice. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We chased a rabbit at Mar-al-Zahran and the people ran  after it but were exhausted. I overpowered and caught it, and gave it to Abu Talha who  slaughtered it and sent its hip or two thighs to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. (The narrator confirms  that he sent two thighs). The Prophet accepted that. (The sub-narrator asked Anas,  &#8220;Did the Prophet; eat from it?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;He ate from it.&#8221;) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An onager was presented to Allah&#8217;s Apostle at the place  called Al-Abwa&#8217; or Waddan, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle rejected it. When the Prophet noticed the  signs of sorrow on the giver&#8217;s face he said, &#8220;We have not rejected your gift, but we  are in the state of Ihram.&#8221; (i.e. if we were not in a state of Ihram we would have  accepted your gift, Fateh-al-Bari page 130, Vol. 6) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Said bin Jubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn Abbas said: Um Hufaid, Ibn &#8216;Abbas&#8217;s aunt sent some  dried yogurt (butter free), ghee (butter) and a mastigar to the Prophet as a gift. The  Prophet ate the dried yogurt and butter but left the mastigar because he disliked it. Ibn  &#8216;Abbas said, &#8220;The mastigar was eaten at the table of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and if it had  been illegal to eat, it could not have been eaten at the table of Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Whenever a meal was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he would  ask whether it was a gift or Sadaqa (something given in charity). If he was told that it  was Sadaqa, he would tell his companions to eat it, but if it was a gift, he would hurry  to share it with them. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some meat was brought to the Prophet and it was said that  the meat had been given in charity to Buraira. He said, &#8220;It was Sadaqa for Buraira  but a gift for us.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 752: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I intended to buy Buraira but her masters stipulated that  her Wala should be for them. When the Prophet was told about it, he said to me, &#8220;Buy  and manumit her, as the Wala&#8217; is for the liberator.&#8221; Once Buraira was given some  meat, and the Prophet asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; I said, &#8220;It has been given to  Buraira in charity.&#8221; He said, &#8220;It is sadaqa for her but a gift for us.&#8221;  Buraira was given the option (to stay with her husband or to part with him). AbdurRahman  (a sub-narrator) wondered, &#8220;Was her husband a slave or a free man?&#8221; Shu&#8217;ba  (another sub-narrator) said, &#8220;I asked &#8216;Abdur-Rahman whether her husband was a slave  or a free man. He replied that he did not know whether he was a slave or a free man.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Um &#8216;Atiyya: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet went to &#8216;Aisha and asked her whether she  had something (to eat). She said that she had nothing except the mutton which Um &#8216;Atiyya  had sent to (Buraira) in charity. The Prophet said that it had reached its destination  (i.e. it is no longer an object of charity.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 754: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to send gifts to the Prophet on the day of  my turn. Um Salama said: &#8220;My companions (the wives of the Prophet Other than Aisha)  gathered and they complained about it. So I informed the Prophet about it on their behalf,  but he remained silent. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.047.755"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 47, Number 755: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Urwa from &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle were in two groups. One group  consisted of &#8216;Aisha, Hafsa, Safiyya and Sauda; and the other group consisted of Um Salama  and the other wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Muslims knew that Allah&#8217;s Apostle loved  &#8216;Aisha, so if any of them had a gift and wished to give to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, he would delay  it, till Allah&#8217;s Apostle had come to &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s home and then he would send his gift to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle in her home. The group of Um Salama discussed the matter together and  decided that Um Salama should request Allah&#8217;s Apostle to tell the people to send their  gifts to him in whatever wife&#8217;s house he was. Um Salama told Allah&#8217;s Apostle of what they  had said, but he did not reply. Then they (those wives) asked Um Salama about it. She  said, &#8220;He did not say anything to me.&#8221; They asked her to talk to him again. She  talked to him again when she met him on her day, but he gave no reply. When they asked  her, she replied that he had given no reply. They said to her, &#8220;Talk to him till he  gives you a reply.&#8221; When it was her turn, she talked to him again. He then said to  her, &#8220;Do not hurt me regarding Aisha, as the Divine Inspirations do not come to me on  any of the beds except that of Aisha.&#8221; On that Um Salama said, &#8220;I repent to  Allah for hurting you.&#8221; Then the group of Um Salama called Fatima, the daughter of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle and sent her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to say to him, &#8220;Your wives request to  treat them and the daughter of Abu Bakr on equal terms.&#8221; Then Fatima conveyed the  message to him. The Prophet said, &#8220;O my daughter! Don&#8217;t you love whom I love?&#8221;  She replied in the affirmative and returned and told them of the situation. They requested  her to go to him again but she refused. They then sent Zainab bint Jahsh who went to him  and used harsh words saying, &#8220;Your wives request you to treat them and the daughter  of Ibn Abu Quhafa on equal terms.&#8221; On that she raised her voice and abused &#8216;Aisha to  her face so much so that Allah&#8217;s Apostle looked at &#8216;Aisha to see whether she would retort.  &#8216;Aisha started replying to Zainab till she silenced her. The Prophet then looked at &#8216;Aisha  and said, &#8220;She is really the daughter of Abu Bakr.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the delegates of the tribe of Hawazin came to the  Prophet he stood up amongst the people, Glorified and Praised Allah as He deserved, and  said, &#8220;Then after: Your brethren have come to you with repentance and I see it  logical to return to them their captives; so whoever amongst you likes to do that as a  favor, then he can do it, and whoever of you like to stick to his share till we give him  his right from the very first Fai (war booty) (1) which Allah will bestow on us, then (he  can do so).&#8221; The people replied, &#8220;We do that (to return the captives) willingly  as a favor for your sake.&#8221; </font></p>

So, my father went to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and said, &#8216;I have given a gift to my son from &#8216;Amra bint Rawaha, but she ordered  me to make you as a witness to it, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8216;Have you  given (the like of it) to everyone of your sons?&#8217; He replied in the negative. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said, &#8216;Be afraid of Allah, and be just to your children.&#8217; My father then returned  and took back his gift.&#8221; </font></p>

He came out leaning on  two men while his feet were dragging on the ground. He was walking between Al-&#8216;Abbas and  another man.&#8221; &#8216;Ubaidullah said, &#8220;When I informed Ibn &#8216;Abbas of what &#8216;Aisha had  said, he asked me whether I knew who was the second man whom &#8216;Aisha had not named.

But Sauda bint Zam&#8217;a gave up  her (turn) day and night to &#8216;Aisha, the wife of the Prophet in order to seek the pleasure  of Allah&#8217;s Apostle (by that action). </font></p>

The Prophet did not accept it. When the Prophet saw the signs of sorrow on As-Sa&#8217;b&#8217;s face  because of not accepting his present, he said (to him), &#8220;We are not returning your  present, but we are in the state of Ihram.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 747) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet appointed a man from the tribe of Al-Azd,  called Ibn &#8216;Utbiyya for collecting the Zakat.

By Him in Whose Hands my life is, whoever takes something from the  resources of the Zakat (unlawfully) will be carrying it on his neck on the Day of  Resurrection; if it be a camel, it will be grunting; if a cow, it will be mooing; and if a  sheep, it will be bleating.&#8221; The Prophet then raised his hands till we saw the  whiteness of his armpits, and he said thrice, &#8220;O Allah!

So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not give them the fruits, nor did he cut  them and distribute them among them, but said, &#8220;I will come to you tomorrow  morning.&#8221; So, he came to us the next morning and walked about in between the  date-palms and invoked Allah to bless their fruits. I plucked the fruits and gave back all  the rights of the creditors in full, and a lot of fruits were left for us. Then I went to  Allah&#8217;s Apostle, who was sitting, and informed him about what happened.

He said to them,  &#8220;This concerns also other people along with me as you see, and the best statement to  me is the true one, so you may choose one of two alternatives; either the captives or the  property and (I have not distributed the booty for) I have been waiting for you.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet had returned from Ta&#8217;if, he waited for  them for more than ten nights. When they came to know that the Prophet would not return  except one of the two, they chose their captives. The Prophet then stood up amongst the  Muslims, Glorified and Praised Allah as He deserved, and then said, &#8220;Then after:  These brothers of yours have come to you with repentance and I see it proper to return  their captives, so whoever amongst you likes to do that as a favor, then he can do it, and  whoever of you wants to stick to his share till we pay him from the very first Fai (i.e.  war booty) which Allah will give us, then he can do so.&#8221; The people said, &#8220;We  return (the captives) to them willingly as a favor, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; The Prophet  said, &#8220;I do not know who of you has given his consent and who has not; so go back and  your leaders may present your decision to me.&#8221; The people went away, and their  leaders discussed the matter with them, and then came to the Prophet to tell him that all  of them had given their consent (to return the captives) willingly.

The Prophet also returned to Anas&#8217;s mother the date-pallms. Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave Um  Aiman other trees from his garden in lieu of the old gift. </font></p>

He asked, &#8220;Do you lend them so that their milk may be utilized by  others?&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet asked, &#8220;Do you milk them  on the day off watering them?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The Prophet said,  &#8220;Do good deeds beyond the merchants (or the sea) and Allah will never disregard any  of your deeds.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 260, Vol. 5) </font></p>

It is shameful for us. But we  will mortgage our arms to you.&#8221; So, Muhammad bin Maslama promised him that he would  come to him next time.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Ash&#8217;ath bin Qais came to us and asked as to what Abu  Abdur-Rehman (i.e. Ibn Mas&#8217;ud) was telling you.&#8221; We related the story to him. On that  he said, &#8220;He has told the truth. This verse was revealed about me. I had some dispute  with another man regarding a well and we took the case before Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s  Apostle said (to me), &#8220;Produce two witnesses (to support your claim); otherwise the  defendant has the right to take an oath (to refute your claim).&#8217; I said, &#8216;The defendant  would not mind to take a false oath.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8216;Whoever took a  false oath in order to grab someone else&#8217;s property will meet Allah, Allah will be angry  with him.&#8217; Allah then revealed what Confirmed it.&#8221; Al-Ash&#8217;ath then recited the  following Verse:&#8211;&#8220;Verily! Those who purchase a small gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s  covenant, And their oaths . . . (to) . . . they shall have a painful torment!&#8217; (3.77) (See  Hadith No. 546) </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Retiring to a Mosque for Remembrance ofAllah (I&#8217;tikaf)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.033.242"></a>Volume 3, Book 33, Number 242:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practise Itikaf in the last ten days of the month of Ramadan.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 243:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) The Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan till he died and then his wives used to practice Itikaf after him.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 244:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf in the middle ten days of Ramadan and once he stayed in Itikaf till the night of the twenty-first and it was the night in the morning of which he used to come out of his Itikaf. The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever was in Itikaf with me should stay in Itikaf for the last ten days, for I was informed (of the date) of the Night (of Qadr) but I have been caused to forget it. (In the dream) I saw myself prostrating in mud and water in the morning of that night. So, look for it in the last ten nights and in the odd ones of them.&#8221; It rained that night and the roof of the mosque dribbled as it was made of leaf stalks of date-palms. I saw with my own eyes the mark of mud and water on the forehead of the Prophet (i.e. in the morning of the twenty-first).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 245:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to (put) bend his head (out) to me while he was in Itikaf in the mosque during my monthly periods and I would comb and oil his hair.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 246:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to let his head in (the house) while he was in the mosque and I would comb and oil his hair. When in Itikaf he used not to enter the house except for a need.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 247:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to embrace me during my menses. He also used to put his head out of the mosque while he was in Itikaf, and I would wash it during my menses.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 248:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar asked the Prophet &#8220;I vowed in the Pre-lslamic period of ignorance to stay in Itikaf for one night in Al-Masjid al-Haram.&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 249:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Aisha said, &#8220;the Prophet used to practice Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan and I used to pitch a tent for him, and after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the tent.&#8221; Hafsa asked the permission of &#8216;Aisha to pitch a tent for her and she allowed her and she pitched her tent. When Zainab bint Jahsh saw it, she pitched another tent. In the morning the Prophet noticed the tents. He said, &#8216;What is this?&#8221; He was told of the whole situation. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;Do you think that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?&#8221; He therefore abandoned the Itikaf in that month and practiced Itikaf for ten days in the month of Shawwal.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 250:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet intended to practice Itikaf and when he reached the place where he intended to perform Itikaf, he saw some tents, the tents of &#8216;Aisha, Hafsa and Zainab. So, he said, &#8220;Do you consider that they intended to do righteousness by doing this?&#8221; And then he went away and did not perform Itikaf (in Ramadan) but performed it in the month of Shawwal for ten days.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 251:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ali bin Al-Husain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya, the wife of the Prophet told me that she went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to visit him in the mosque while he was in Itikaf in the last ten days of Ramadan. She had a talk with him for a while, then she got up in order to return home. The Prophet accompanied her. When they reached the gate of the mosque, opposite the door of Um-Salama, two Ansari men were passing by and they greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle . He told them: Do not run away! And said, &#8220;She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai.&#8221; Both of them said, &#8220;Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of any evil) O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; And they felt it. The Prophet said (to them), &#8220;Satan reaches everywhere in the human body as blood reaches in it, (everywhere in one&#8217;s body). I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 252:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Salama bin &#8216;Abdur-Rahman:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Abu Said Al-Khudri, &#8220;Did you hear Allah&#8217;s Apostle talking about the Night of Qadr?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative and said, &#8220;Once we were in Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the middle ten days of (Ramadan) and we came out of it in the morning of the twentieth, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle- delivered a sermon on the 20th (of Ramadan) and said, &#8216;I was informed (of the date) of the Night of Qadr (in my dream) but had forgotten it. So, look for it in the odd nights of the last ten nights of the month of Ramadan. I saw myself prostrating in mud and water on that night (as a sign of the Night of Qadr). So, whoever had been in Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle should return for it.&#8217; The people returned to the mosque (for Itikaf). There was no trace of clouds in the sky. But all of a sudden a cloud came and it rained. Then the prayer was established (they stood for the prayer) and Allah&#8217;s Apostle prostrated in mud and water and I saw mud over the forehead and the nose of the Prophet.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 253:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the wives of Allah&#8217;s Apostle practiced Itikaf with him while she ad bleeding in between her periods and she would see red (blood) or yellowish traces, and sometimes we put a tray beneath her when she offered the prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 254:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain (from Safiya, the Prophet&#8217;s wife):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wives of the Prophet were with him in the mosque (while he was in Itikaf) and then they departed and the Prophet said to Safiya bint Huyai, &#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry up, for I shall accompany you,&#8221; (and her dwelling was in the house of Usama). The Prophet went out and in the meantime two Ansari men met him and they looked at the Prophet and passed by. The Prophet said to them, &#8220;Come here. She is (my wife) Safiya bint Huyai.&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Subhan Allah, (How dare we think of evil) O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! (we never expect anything bad from you).&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Satan circulates in the human being as blood circulates in the body, and I was afraid lest Satan might insert an evil thought in your minds.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 255:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Al-Husain from Safiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiya went to the Prophet while he was in Itikaf. When she returned, the Prophet accompanied her walking. An Ansari man saw him. When the Prophet noticed him, he called him and said, &#8220;Come here. She is Safiya. (Sufyan a sub-narrator perhaps said that the Prophet had said, &#8220;This is Safiya&#8221;). And Satan circulates in the body of Adam&#8217;s offspring as his blood circulates in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(A sub-narrator asked Sufyan, &#8220;Did Safiya visit him at night?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Of course, at night.&#8221;)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 256:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We practiced Itikaf with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the middle ten days (of Ramadan). In the morning of the twentieth (of Ramadan) we shifted our baggage, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to us and said, &#8220;Whoever was m Itikaf should return to his place of Itikaf, for I saw (i.e. was informed about the date of) this Night (of Qadr) and saw myself prostrating in mud and water.&#8221; When I returned to my place the sky was overcast with clouds and it rained. By Him Who sent Muhammad with the Truth, the sky was covered with clouds from the end of that day, and the mosque which was roofed with leaf-stalks of date palm trees (leaked with rain) and I saw the trace of mud and water over the nose of the Prophet and its tip.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amra bint &#8216;Abdur-Rahman from &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to practice Itikaf every year in the month of Ramadan. And after offering the morning prayer, he used to enter the place of his Itikaf. &#8216;Aisha asked his permission to let her practice Itikaf and he allowed her, and so she pitched a tent in the mosque. When Hafsa heard of that, she also pitched a tent (for herself), and when Zainab heard of that, she too pitched another tent. When, in the morning, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had finished the morning prayer, he saw four tents and asked, &#8220;What is this?&#8221; He was informed about it. He then said, &#8220;What made them do this? Is it righteousness? Remove the tents, for I do not want to see them.&#8221; So, the tents were removed. The Prophet did not perform Itikaf that year in the month of Ramadan, but did it in the last ten days of Shawwal.</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 33, Number 259:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that &#8216;Umar had vowed in the Pre-lslamic period to perform Itikaf in Al-Masjid-al-Haram. (A sub-narrator thinks that &#8216;Umar vowed to perform Itikaf for one night.) Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;Fulfill your vow.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>

<h3 align="center">Virtues of Madinah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.030.091"></a>Volume 3, Book 30, Number 91:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Medina is a sanctuary from that place to that. Its trees should not be cut and no heresy should be innovated nor any sin should be committed in it, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits sins (bad deeds), then he will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 409, Vol 9).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 92:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet came to Medina and ordered a mosque to be built and said, &#8220;O Bani Najjar! Suggest to me the price (of your land).&#8221; They said, &#8220;We do not want its price except from Allah&#8221; (i.e. they wished for a reward from Allah for giving up their land freely). So, the Prophet ordered the graves of the pagans to be dug out and the land to be levelled, and the date-palm trees to be cut down. The cut date-palms were fixed in the direction of the Qibla of the mosque.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 93:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;I have made Medina a sanctuary between its two (Harrat) mountains.&#8221; The Prophet went to the tribe of Bani Haritha and said (to them), &#8220;I see that you have gone out of the sanctuary,&#8221; but looking around, he added, &#8220;No, you are inside the sanctuary.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 94:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have nothing except the Book of Allah and this written paper from the Prophet (where-in is written:) Medina is a sanctuary from the &#8216;Air Mountain to such and such a place, and whoever innovates in it an heresy or commits a sin, or gives shelter to such an innovator in it will incur the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted. And the asylum (of protection) granted by any Muslim is to be secured (respected) by all the other Muslims; and whoever betrays a Muslim in this respect incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted, and whoever (freed slave) befriends (take as masters) other than his manumitters without their permission incurs the curse of Allah, the angels, and all the people, and none of his compulsory or optional good deeds of worship will be accepted.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 95:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;I was ordered to migrate to a town which will swallow (conquer) other towns and is called Yathrib and that is Medina, and it turns out (bad) persons as a furnace removes the impurities of iron.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 96:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Humaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We came with the Prophet from Tabuk, and when we reached near Medina, the Prophet said, &#8220;This is Tabah.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 97:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If I saw deers grazing in Medina, I would not chase them, for Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(Medina) is a sanctuary between its two mountains.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 98:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;The people will leave Medina in spite of the best state it will have, and none except the wild birds and the beasts of prey will live in it, and the last persons who will die will be two shepherds from the tribe of Muzaina, who will be driving their sheep towards Medina, but will find nobody in it, and when they reach the valley of Thaniyat-al-Wada&#8217;, they will fall down on their faces dead.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 99:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Zuhair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Yemen will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families, and those who will obey them to migrate (to Yemen) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. Sham will also be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them, to migrate (to Sham) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew. &#8216;Iraq will be conquered and some people will migrate (from Medina) and will urge their families and those who will obey them to migrate (to &#8216;Iraq) although Medina will be better for them; if they but knew.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 100:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Verily, Belief returns and goes back to Medina as a snake returns and goes back to its hole (when in danger).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 101:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;None plots against the people of Medina but that he will be dissolved (destroyed) like the salt is dissolved in water.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 102:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Usama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet stood at the top of a (looked out from upon one) castle amongst the castles (or the high buildings) of Medina and said, &#8220;Do you see what I see? (No doubt) I see the spots where afflictions will take place among your houses (and these afflictions will be) as numerous as the spots where rain-drops fall.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 103:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;The terror caused by Al-Masih Ad-Dajjal will not enter Medina and at that time Medina will have seven gates and there will be two angels at each gate guarding them.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 104:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There are angels guarding the entrances (or roads) of Medina, neither plague nor Ad-Dajjal will be able to enter it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 105:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;There will be no town which Ad-Dajjal will not enter except Mecca and Medina, and there will be no entrance (road) (of both Mecca and Medina) but the angels will be standing in rows guarding it against him, and then Medina will shake with its inhabitants thrice (i.e. three earth-quakes will take place) and Allah will expel all the nonbelievers and the hypocrites from it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 106:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle told us a long narrative about Ad-Dajjal, and among the many things he mentioned, was his saying, &#8220;Ad-Dajjal will come and it will be forbidden for him to pass through the entrances of Medina. He will land in some of the salty barren areas (outside) Medina; on that day the best man or one of the best men will come up to him and say, &#8216;I testify that you are the same Dajjal whose description was given to us by Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say to the people, &#8216;If I kill this man and bring him back to life again, will you doubt my claim?&#8217; They will say, &#8216;No.&#8217; Then Ad-Dajjal will kill that man and bring him back to life. That man will say, &#8216;Now I know your reality better than before.&#8217; Ad-Dajjal will say, &#8216;I want to kill him but I cannot.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 107:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A bedouin came to the Prophet and gave a pledge of allegiance for embracing Islam. The next day he came with fever and said (to the Prophet ), &#8220;Please cancel my pledge (of embracing Islam and of emigrating to Medina).&#8221; The Prophet refused (that request) three times and said, &#8220;Medina is like a furnace, it expels out the impurities (bad persons) and selects the good ones and makes them perfect.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 108:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Thabit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet went out for (the battle of) Uhud, some of his companions (hypocrites) returned (home). A party of the believers remarked that they would kill those (hypocrites) who had returned, but another party said that they would not kill them. So, this Divine Inspiration was revealed: &#8220;Then what is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties concerning the hypocrites.&#8221; (4.88) The Prophet said, &#8220;Medina expels the bad persons from it, as fire expels the impurities of iron.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 109:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Bestow on Medina twice the blessings You bestowed on Mecca.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 110:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet returned from a journey and observed the walls of Medina, he would make his Mount go fast, and if he was on an animal (i.e. a horse), he would make it gallop because of his love for Medina.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 111:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(The people of) Bani Salama intended to shift near the mosque (of the Prophet) but Allah&#8217;s Apostle disliked to see Medina vacated and said, &#8220;O the people of Bani Salama! Don&#8217;t you think that you will be rewarded for your footsteps which you take towards the mosque?&#8221; So, they stayed at their old places.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 112:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira: The Prophet said, &#8220;There is a garden from the gardens of Paradise between my house and my pulpit, and my pulpit is on my Lake Fount (Al-Kauthar).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 113:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Medina, Abu Bakr and Bilal became ill. When Abu Bakr&#8217;s fever got worse, he would recite (this poetic verse): &#8220;Everybody is staying alive with his People, yet Death is nearer to him than His shoe laces.&#8221; And Bilal, when his fever deserted him, would recite: &#8220;Would that I could stay overnight in A valley wherein I would be Surrounded by Idhkhir and Jalil (kinds of good-smelling grass). Would that one day I could Drink the water of the Majanna, and Would that (The two mountains) Shama and Tafil would appear to me!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O Allah! Curse Shaiba bin Rabi&#8217;a and &#8216;Utba bin Rabi&#8217;a and Umaiya bin Khalaf as they turned us out of our land to the land of epidemics.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said, &#8220;O Allah! Make us love Medina as we love Mecca or even more than that. O Allah! Give blessings in our Sa and our Mudd (measures symbolizing food) and make the climate of Medina suitable for us, and divert its fever towards Aljuhfa.&#8221; Aisha added: When we reached Medina, it was the most unhealthy of Allah&#8217;s lands, and the valley of Bathan (the valley of Medina) used to flow with impure colored water.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 30, Number 114:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar said, O Allah! Grant me martyrdom in Your cause, and let my death be in the city of Your Apostle.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A tumbler (full of milk or water) was brought to the  Prophet who drank from it, while on his right side there was sitting a boy who was the  youngest of those who were present and on his left side there were old men. The Prophet  asked, &#8220;O boy, will you allow me to give it (i.e. the rest of the drink) to the old  men?&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will not give preference to anyone  over me to drink the rest of it from which you have drunk.&#8221; So, the Prophet gave it  to him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Az-Zuhri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Anas bin Malik said, that once a domestic sheep was milked  for Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was in the house of Anas bin Malik. The milk was mixed with  water drawn from the well in Anas&#8217;s house. A tumbler of it was presented to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle who drank from it. Then Abu Bakr was sitting on his left side and a bedouin on his  right side. When the Prophet removed the tumbler from his mouth, &#8216;Umar was afraid that the  Prophet might give it to the bedouin, so he said. &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Give it to Abu  Bakr who is sitting by your side.&#8221; But the Prophet gave it to the bedouin, who was to  his right and said, &#8220;You should start with the one on your right side.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;No bloodmoney will be charged  if somebody dies in a mine or in a well or is killed by an animal; and if somebody finds a  treasure in his land he has to give one-fifth of it to the Government.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah (bin Mas&#8217;ud): </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever takes a false oath to  deprive somebody of his property will meet Allah while He will be angry with him.&#8221;  Allah revealed: &#8216;Verily those who purchase a little gain at the cost of Allah&#8217;s covenant,  and their oaths.&#8217; &#8230;&#8230;..(3.77) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Al-Ash&#8217;ath came (to the place where &#8216;Abdullah was  narrating) and said, &#8220;What has Abu &#8216;Abdur-Rahman (i.e. Abdullah) been telling you?  This verse was revealed concerning me. I had a well in the land of a cousin of mine. The  Prophet asked me to bring witnesses (to confirm my claim). I said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t have  witnesses.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Let the defendant take an oath then.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He  will take a (false) oath immediately.&#8217; Then the Prophet mentioned the above narration and  Allah revealed the verse to confirm what he had said.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 692) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 40, Number 547: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There are three persons whom  Allah will not look at on the Day of Resurrection, nor will he purify them and theirs  shall be a severe punishment. They are: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>1. A man possessed superfluous water, on a way and he  withheld it from travelers. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>2. A man who gave a pledge of allegiance to a ruler and he  gave it only for worldly benefits. If the ruler gives him something he gets satisfied, and  if the ruler withholds something from him, he gets dissatisfied. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>3. And man displayed his goods for sale after the &#8216;Asr  prayer and he said, &#8216;By Allah, except Whom None has the right to be worshipped, I have  been given so much for my goods,&#8217; and somebody believes him (and buys them).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An Ansari man quarrelled with Az-Zubair in the presence of  the Prophet about the Harra Canals which were used for irrigating the date-palms. The  Ansari man said to Az-Zubair, &#8220;Let the water pass&#8217; but Az-Zubair refused to do so.  So, the case was brought before the Prophet who said to Az-Zubair, &#8220;O Zubair!  Irrigate (your land) and then let the water pass to your neighbor.&#8221; On that the  Ansari got angry and said to the Prophet, &#8220;Is it because he (i.e. Zubair) is your  aunt&#8217;s son?&#8221; On that the color of the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle changed (because of  anger) and he said, &#8220;O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) and then withhold the water till  it reaches the walls between the pits round the trees.&#8221; Zubair said, &#8220;By Allah,  I think that the following verse was revealed on this occasion&#8221;: &#8220;But no, by  your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between  them.&#8221; (4.65) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When a man from the Ansar quarrelled with AzZubair, the  Prophet said, &#8220;O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) first and then let the water flow (to  the land of the others).&#8221; &#8220;On that the Ansari said, (to the Prophet), &#8220;It  is because he is your aunt&#8217;s son.&#8221; On that the Prophet said, &#8220;O Zubair! Irrigate  till the water reaches the walls between the pits around the trees and then stop (i.e. let  the water go to the other&#8217;s land).&#8221; I think the following verse was revealed  concerning this event: &#8220;But no, by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make  you judge In all disputes between them.&#8221; (4.65) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>An-Ansari man quarrelled with Az-Zubair about a canal in  the Harra which was used for irrigating date-palms. Allah&#8217;s Apostle, ordering Zubair to be  moderate, said, &#8220;O Zubair! Irrigate (your land) first and then leave the water for  your neighbor.&#8221; The Ansari said, &#8220;Is it because he is your aunt&#8217;s son?&#8221; On  that the color of the face of Allah&#8217;s Apostle changed and he said, &#8220;O Zubair!  Irrigate (your land) and withhold the water till it reaches the walls that are between the  pits around the trees.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave Zubair his full right. Zubair said,  &#8220;By Allah, the following verse was revealed in that connection&#8221;: &#8220;But no,  by your Lord They can have No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between  them.&#8221; (4.65) </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(The sub-narrator,) Ibn Shihab said to Juraij (another  sub-narrator), &#8220;The Ansar and the other people interpreted the saying of the Prophet,  &#8216;Irrigate (your land) and with-hold the water till it reaches the walls between the pits  around the trees,&#8217; as meaning up to the ankles.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;While a man was walking he felt  thirsty and went down a well and drank water from it. On coming out of it, he saw a dog  panting and eating mud because of excessive thirst. The man said, &#8216;This (dog) is suffering  from the same problem as that of mine. So he (went down the well), filled his shoe with  water, caught hold of it with his teeth and climbed up and watered the dog. Allah thanked  him for his (good) deed and forgave him.&#8221; The people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  Is there a reward for us in serving (the) animals?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Yes, there is a  reward for serving any animate.&#8221; </font></p>

Do you allow me to give (the drink) to the elder people  (first)?&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;I will not prefer anybody to have my share from you, O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; So, he gave it to the boy. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to the mother  of Ishmael! If she had left the water of Zam-Zam (fountain) as it was, (without  constructing a basin for keeping the water), (or said, &#8220;If she had not taken handfuls  of its water&#8221;), it would have been a flowing stream. Jurhum (an Arab tribe) came and  asked her, &#8216;May we settle at your dwelling?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes, but you have no right to  possess the water.&#8217; They agreed.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;There are three types of people  whom Allah will neither talk to, nor look at, on the Day of Resurrection. (They are): </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>1. A man who takes an oath falsely that he has been offered  for his goods so much more than what he is given, </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>2. a man who takes a false oath after the &#8216;Asr prayer in  order to grab a Muslim&#8217;s property, and </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>3. a man who with-holds his superfluous water. Allah will  say to him, &#8220;Today I will with-hold My Grace from you as you with-held the  superfluity of what you had not created.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, No Hima except for Allah and His  Apostle. We have been told that Allah&#8217;s Apostle made a place called An-Naqi&#8217; as Hima, and  &#8216;Umar made Ash-Sharaf and Ar-Rabadha Hima (for grazing the animals of Zakat). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Keeping horses may be a source  of reward to some (man), a shelter to another (i.e. means of earning one&#8217;s living), or a  burden to a third. He to whom the horse will be a source of reward is the one who keeps it  in Allah&#8217;s Cause (prepare it for holy battles) and ties it by a long rope in a pasture (or  a garden). He will get a reward equal to what its long rope allows it to eat in the  pasture or the garden, and if that horse breaks its rope and crosses one or two hills,  then all its foot-steps and its dung will be counted as good deeds for its owner; and if  it passes by a river and drinks from it, then that will also be regarded as a good deed  for its owner even if he has had no intention of watering it then. Horses are a shelter  from poverty to the second person who keeps horses for earning his living so as not to ask  others, and at the same time he gives Allah&#8217;s right (i.e. Rakat) (from the wealth he earns  through using them in trading etc.,) and does not overburden them. He who keeps horses  just out of pride and for showing off and as a means of harming the Muslims, his horses  will be a source of sins to him.&#8221; When Allah&#8217;s Apostle was asked about donkeys, he  replied, &#8220;Nothing particular was revealed to me regarding </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A man came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and asked about Al-Luqata (a  fallen thing). The Prophet said, &#8220;Recognize its container and its tying material and  then make a public announcement about it for one year and if its owner shows up, give it  to him; otherwise use it as you like.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;What about a lost  sheep?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;It is for you, your brother or the wolf.&#8221; The  man said &#8220;What about a lost camel?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Why should you take  it as it has got its water-container (its stomach) and its hooves and it can reach the  places of water and can eat the trees till its owner finds it?&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ali bin Abi Talib said: &#8220;I got a she-camel as my share  of the war booty on the day (of the battle) of Badr, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave me another  she-camel. I let both of them kneel at the door of one of the Ansar, intending to carry  Idhkhir on them to sell it and use its price for my wedding banquet on marrying Fatima. A  goldsmith from Bam Qainqa&#8217; was with me. Hamza bin &#8216;Abdul-Muttalib was in that house  drinking wine and a lady singer was reciting: &#8220;O Hamza! (Kill) the (two) fat old she  camels (and serve them to your guests).&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>So Hamza took his sword and went towards the two she-camels  and cut off their humps and opened their flanks and took a part of their livers.&#8221; (I  said to Ibn Shihab, &#8220;Did he take part of the humps?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;He cut  off their humps and carried them away.&#8221;) &#8216;Ali further said, &#8220;When I saw that  dreadful sight, I went to the Prophet and told him the news. The Prophet came out in the  company of Zaid bin Haritha who was with him then, and I too went with them. He went to  Hamza and spoke harshly to him. Hamza looked up and said, &#8216;Aren&#8217;t you only the slaves of  my forefathers?&#8217; The Prophet retreated and went out. This incident happened before the  prohibition of drinking.&#8221; </font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation of Sahih Bukhari, Book 27:</p>
<h3 align="center">Minor Pilgrammage (Umra)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.027.001"></a>Volume 3, Book 27, Number 1:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;(The performance of) &#8216;Umra is an expiation for the sins committed (between it and the previous one). And the reward of Hajj Mabrur (the one accepted by Allah) is nothing except Paradise.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 2:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Juraij:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ikrima bin Khalid asked Ibn &#8216;Umar about performing &#8216;Umra before Hajj. Ibn &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;There is no harm in it.&#8221; &#8216;Ikrima said, &#8220;Ibn &#8216;Umar also said, &#8216;The Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra before performing Hajj.'&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 3:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ikrima bin Khalid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I asked Ibn &#8216;Umar the same (as above).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 4:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Mujahid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ursa bin AzZubair and I entered the Mosque (of the Prophet) and saw &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar sitting near the dwelling place of Aisha and some people were offering the Duha prayer. We asked him about their prayer and he replied that it was a heresy. He (Ursa) then asked him how many times the Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra. He replied, &#8216;Four times; one of them was in the month of Rajab.&#8221; We disliked to contradict him. Then we heard &#8216;Aisha, the Mother of faithful believers cleaning her teeth with Siwak in the dwelling place. &#8216;Ursa said, &#8220;O Mother! O Mother of the believers! Don&#8217;t you hear what Abu &#8216;Abdur Rahman is saying?&#8221; She said, &#8220;What does he say?&#8221; &#8216;Ursa said, &#8220;He says that Allah&#8217;s Apostle performed four &#8216;Umra and one of them was in the month of Rajab.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to Abu &#8216;Abdur Rahman! The Prophet did not perform any &#8216;Umra except that he was with him, and he never performed any &#8216;Umra in Rajab.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 5:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ursa bin Az-Zubair:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha (whether the Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra in Rajab). She replied, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle never performed any &#8216;Umra in Rajab.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 6:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Anas how many times the Prophet had performed &#8216;Umra. He replied, &#8220;Four times. 1. &#8216;Umra of Hudaibiya in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da when the pagans hindered him; 2. &#8216;Umra in the following year in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da after the peace treaty with them (the pagans); 3. &#8216;Umra from Al-Jr&#8217;rana where he distributed the war booty.&#8221; I think he meant the booty (of the battle) of Hunain. I asked, &#8220;How many times did he perform Hajj?&#8221; He (Anas) replied, &#8220;Once. &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 7:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Anas (about the Prophet&#8217;s &#8216;Umra) and he replied, &#8220;The Prophet performed &#8216;Umra when the pagans made him return, and Umra of al-Hudaibiya (the next year), and another &#8216;Umra in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da, and another &#8216;Umra in combination with his Hajj.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 8:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hammam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet performed four &#8216;Umra (three) in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da except the (one) &#8216;Umra which he performed with his Hajj: His &#8216;Umra from Al-hudaibiya, and the one of the following year, and the one from Al-Jr&#8217;rana where he distributed the booty (of the battle) of Hunain, and another &#8216;Umra with his Hajj.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 9:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ishaq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Masruq, &#8216;Ata&#8217; and Mujahid (about the &#8216;Umra of Allah&#8217;s Apostle). They said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had performed &#8216;Umra in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da before he performed Hajj.&#8221; I heard Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle had performed &#8216;Umra in Dhi-l-Qa&#8217;da twice before he performed Hajj.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 10:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ata:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Ibn &#8216;Abbas saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked an Ansari woman (Ibn &#8216;Abbas named her but &#8216;Ata&#8217; forgot her name), &#8216;What prevented you from performing Hajj with us?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;We have a camel and the father of so-and-so and his son (i.e. her husband and her son) rode it and left one camel for us to use for irrigation.&#8217; He said (to her), &#8216;Perform &#8216;Umra when Ramadan comes, for &#8216;Umra in Ramadan is equal to Hajj (in reward),&#8217; or said something similar.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 11:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out along with Allah&#8217;s Apostle shortly before the appearance of the new moon (crescent) of the month of Dhi-l-Hijja and he said to us, &#8220;Whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so; and whoever wants to assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra may do so. Hadn&#8217;t I brought the Hadi (animal for sacrificing) (with me), I would have assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra.&#8221; (&#8216;Aisha added,): So some of us assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra while the others for Hajj. I was amongst those who assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra. The day of &#8216;Arafat approached and I was still menstruating. I complained to the Prophet (about that) and he said, &#8220;Abandon your &#8216;Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj;.&#8221; When it was the night of Hasba, he sent &#8216;Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tan&#8217;im and I assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra (and performed it) in lieu of my missed &#8216;Umra.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 12:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Aus:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdul Rahman bin Abu Bakr told me that the Prophet had ordered him to let &#8216;Aisha ride behind him and to make he perform &#8216;Umra from At-Tan&#8217;im.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 13:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet and his companions assumed Ihram for Hajj and none except the Prophet and Talha had the Hadi with them. &#8216;Ali had come from Yemen and he had the Hadi with him. He (&#8216;Ali) said, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram with an intention like that of Allah&#8217;s Apostle has assumed it.&#8221; The Prophet ordered his companions to intend the Ihram with which they had come for &#8216;Umra, to perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba (and between Safa and Marwa), to get their hair cut short and then to finish their Ihram with the exception of those who had the Hadi with them. They asked, &#8220;Shall we go to Mina and the private organs of some of us are dribbling (if we finish Ihram and have sexual relations with our wives)?&#8221; The Prophet heard that and said, &#8220;Had I known what I know now, I would not have brought the Hadi. If I did not have the Hadi with me I would have finished my Ihram.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha got her menses and performed all the ceremonies (of Hajj) except the Tawaf . So when she became clean from her menses, and she had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, she said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! You (people) are returning with both Hajj and &#8216;Umra and I am returning only with Hajj!&#8221; So, he ordered &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Abu Bakr to go with her to At-Tan&#8217;im. Thus she performed &#8216;Umra after the Hajj in the month of Dhi-l-Hijja. Suraqa bin Malik bin Ju&#8217;sham met the Prophet at Al-&#8216;Aqaba (Jamrat-ul &#8216;Aqaba) while the latter was stoning it and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is this permissible only for you?&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;No, it is for ever (i.e. it is permissible for all Muslims to perform &#8216;Umra before Hajj.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 14:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle shortly before the appearance of the new moon of Dhi-l-Hiija and he said, &#8220;Whoever wants to assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra may do so, and whoever wants to assume Ihram for Hajj may do so. Had not I brought the Hadi with me, I would have assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra.&#8221; Some of the people assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra while others for Hajj. I was amongst those who had assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra. I got my menses before entering Mecca, and was menstruating till the day of &#8216;Arafat. I complained to Allah&#8217;s Apostle about it, he said, &#8220;Abandon your &#8216;Umra, undo and comb your hair, and assume Ihram for Hajj.&#8221; So, I did that accordingly. When it was the night of Hasba (day of departure from Mina), the Prophet sent &#8216;Abdur Rahman with me to At-Tanim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sub-narrator adds: He (&#8216;AbdurRahman) let her ride behind him. And she assumed Ihram for &#8216;Umra in lieu of the abandoned one. Aisha completed her Hajj and &#8216;Umra, and no Hadi, Sadaqa (charity), or fasting was obligatory for her.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 15:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The people are returning after performing the two Nusuks (i.e. Hajj and &#8216;Umra) but I am returning with one only?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Wait till you become clean from your menses and then go to At-Tan&#8217;im, assume Ihram (and after performing &#8216;Umra) join us at such-and-such a place. But it (i.e. the reward if &#8216;Umra) is according to your expenses or the hardship (which you will undergo while performing it).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 16:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We set out assuming the Ihram for Hajj in the months of Hajj towards the sacred precincts of Hajj. We dismounted at Sarif and the Prophet said to his companions, &#8220;Whoever has not got the Hadi with him and likes to make it as &#8216;Umra, he should do it, but he who has got the Hadi with him should not do it.&#8221; The Prophet and some of his wealthy companions had the Hadi with them, so they did not finish Ihram after performing the &#8216;Umra. The Prophet came to me while I was weeping. He asked me the reason for it. I replied, &#8220;I have heard of what you have said to your companions and I cannot do the &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He asked me, &#8220;What is the matter with you?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I am not praying.&#8221; He said, &#8220;There is no harm in it as you are one of the daughters of Adam and the same is written for you as for others. So, you should perform Hajj and I hope that Allah will enable you to perform the &#8216;Umra as well.&#8221; So, I carried on till we departed from Mina and halted at Al-Mahassab. The Prophet called &#8216;Abdur-Rahman and said, &#8220;Go out of the sanctuary with your sister and let her assume Ihram for &#8216;Umra, and after both of you have finished the Tawaf I will be waiting for you at this place.&#8221; We came back at mid-night and the Prophet asked us, &#8220;Have you finished?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He announced the departure and the people set out for the journey and some of them had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba before the morning prayer, and after that the Prophet set out for Medina.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 17:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin Ya&#8217;la bin Umaiya from his father who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;A man came to the Prophet while he was at Ji&#8217;rana. The man was wearing a cloak which had traces of Khaluq or Sufra (a kind of perfume). The man asked (the Prophet ), &#8216;What do you order me to perform in my &#8216;Umra?&#8217; So, Allah inspired the Prophet divinely and he was screened by a place of cloth. I wished to see the Prophet being divinely inspired. &#8216;Umar said to me, &#8216;Come! Will you be pleased to look at the Prophet while Allah is inspiring him?&#8217; I replied in the affirmative. &#8216;Umar lifted one corner of the cloth and I looked at the Prophet who was snoring. (The sub-narrator thought that he said: The snoring was like that of a camel). When that state was over, the Prophet asked, &#8220;Where is the questioner who asked about &#8216;Umra? Put off your cloak and wash away the traces of Khaluq from your body and clean the Sufra (yellow color) and perform in your Umra what you perform in your Hajj (i.e. the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and the Sa&#8217;i between Safa and Marwa). &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 18:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hisham Ibn &#8216;Urwa from his father who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was a youngster, I asked &#8216;Aisha the wife of the Prophet. &#8220;What about the meaning of the Statement of Allah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al Marwa, are among the symbols of Allah. So, it is not harmful if those who perform Hajj or &#8216;Umra of the House (Ka&#8217;ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them? (2.158) I understand (from that) that there is no harm if somebody does not perform the Tawaf between them.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha replied, &#8220;No, for if it were as you are saying, then the recitation would have been like this: &#8216;It is not harmful not to perform Tawaf between them.&#8217; This verse was revealed in connection with the Ansar who used to assume the Ihram for the idol Manat which was put beside a place called Qudaid and those people thought it not right to perform the Tawaf of As-Safa and Al-Marwa. When Islam came, they asked Allah&#8217;s Apostle about that, and Allah revealed:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwa Are among the symbols of Allah. So, it is not harmful of those who perform Hajj or &#8216;Umra of the House (Ka&#8217;ba at Mecca) to perform the going (Tawaf) between them.&#8221; (2.158) Sufyan and Abu Muawiya added from Hisham (from &#8216;Aisha): &#8220;The Hajj or &#8216;Umra of the person who does not perform the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa is incomplete in Allah&#8217;s sight.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 19:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Isma&#8217;il:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah bin Abu Aufa said: &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle performed &#8216;Umra and we too performed &#8216;Umra along with him. When he entered Mecca he performed the Tawaf (of Ka&#8217;ba) and we too performed it along with him, and then he came to the As-Safa and Al-Marwa (i.e. performed the Sai) and we also came to them along with him. We were shielding him from the people of Mecca lest they may hit him with an arrow.&#8221; A friend of his asked him (i.e. &#8216;Abdullah bin Aufa), &#8220;Did the Prophet enter the Ka&#8217;ba (during that &#8216;Umra)?&#8221; He replied in the negative. Then he said, &#8220;What did he (the Prophet ) say about Khadija?&#8221; He (Abdullah bin Aufa) said, &#8220;(He said) &#8216;Give Khadija the good tidings that she will have a palace made of Qasab in Paradise and there will be neither noise nor any trouble in it.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 20:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Amr bin Dinar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We asked Ibn &#8216;Umar whether a man who had performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba but had not performed the Tawaf between As-Safa and Al-Marwa yet, was permitted to have sexual relation with his wife. He replied, &#8220;The Prophet arrived (at Mecca) and circumambulated the Ka&#8217;ba seven times and then offered a two Rak&#8217;at prayer behind Maqam-lbrahim and then performed the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa (seven times) (and verily, in Allah&#8217;s Apostle you have a good example.&#8221; And we asked Jabir bin &#8216;Abdullah (the same question) and he replied, &#8220;He should not go near her till he has finished the going (Tawaf) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 21:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I came to the Prophet at Al-Batha&#8217; while his camel was kneeling down and he asked me, &#8220;Have you intended to perform the Hajj?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He asked me, &#8216;With what intention have you assumed Ihram?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I have assumed Ihram with the same intention as that of the Prophet. He said, &#8220;You have done well. Perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and (the Sai) between As-safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram.&#8221; So, I performed the Tawaf around the Ka&#8217;ba and the Sai) between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then went to a woman of the tribe of Qais who cleaned my head from lice. Later I assumed the Ihram for Hajj. I used to give the verdict of doing the same till the caliphate of &#8216;Umar who said, &#8220;If you follow the Holy Book then it orders you to remain in the state of Ihram till you finish from Hajj, if you follow the Prophet then he did not finish his Ihram till the Hadi (sacrifice) had reached its place of slaughtering (Hajj-al-Qiran).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 22:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Aswad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah the slave of Asma bint Abu Bakr, told me that he used to hear Asma&#8217;, whenever she passed by Al-Hajun, saying, &#8220;May Allah bless His Apostle Muhammad. Once we dismounted here with him, and at that time we were traveling with light luggage; we had a few riding animals and a little food ration. I, my sister, &#8216;Aisha, Az-Zubair and such and such persons performed &#8216;Umra, and when we had passed our hands over the Ka&#8217;ba (i.e. performed Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) we finished our lhram. Later on we assumed Ihram for Hajj the same evening.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 23:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned from a Ghazwa, Hajj or &#8216;Umra, he used to say Takbir thrice at every elevation of the ground and then would say, &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah; He is One and has no partner. All the kingdoms is for Him, and all the praises are for Him, and He is Omnipotent. We are returning with repentance, worshipping, prostrating, and praising our Lord. He has kept up His promise and made His slave victorious, and He Alone defeated all the clans of (non-believers).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 24:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet arrived at Mecca, some boys of the tribe of Bani &#8216;Abdul Muttalib went to receive him, and the Prophet made one of them ride in front of him and the other behind him.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 25:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle left for Mecca, he used to pray in the mosque of Ash-Shajra, and when he returned (to Medina), he used to pray in the middle of the valley of Dhul-Hulaifa and used to pass the night there till morning.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 26:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas: The Prophet never returned to his family from a journey at night. He</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 27:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir: The Prophet forbade going to one&#8217;s family at night (on arrival from a</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 28:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Humaid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas said, &#8220;Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle returned from a journey, he, on seeing the high places of Medina, would make his she-camel proceed faster; and if it were another animal, even then he used to make it proceed faster.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Humaid that the Prophet used to make it proceed faster out of his love for Medina.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 29:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As above, but mentioned &#8220;the walls of Medina&#8221; instead of &#8220;the high places of Medina. Al-Harith bin Umar agrees with Anas.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 30:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Ishaq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Al-Bara&#8217; saying, &#8220;The above Verse was revealed regarding us, for the Ansar on returning from Hajj never entered their houses through the proper doors but from behind. One of the Ansar came and entered through the door and he was taunted for it. Therefore, the following was revealed: &#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is not righteousness That you enter the houses from the back, But the righteous man is He who fears Allah, Obeys His order and keeps away from What He has forbidden So, enter houses through the proper doors.&#8221; (2.189)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 31:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;Traveling is a kind of torture as it prevents one from eating, drinking and sleeping properly. So, when one&#8217;s needs are fulfilled, one should return quickly to one&#8217;s family.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 27, Number 32:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Aslam from his father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with Ibn &#8216;Umar on the way to Mecca, and he got the news that Safiya bint Abu Ubaid was seriously ill. So, he hastened his pace, and when the twilight disappeared, he dismounted and offered the Maghrib and &#8216;Isha&#8217; prayers together. Then he said, &#8220;I saw that whenever the Prophet had to hasten when traveling, he would delay the Maghrib prayer and join them together (i.e. offer the Maghrib and the Isha prayers together).&#8221;</p>

The Prophet and Abu Bakr had  confidence in him and gave him their riding camels and told him to bring them to the Cave  of Thaur after three days. So, he brought them their two riding camels after three days  and both of them (The Prophet and Abu Bakr) set out accompanied by &#8216;Amir bin Fuhaira and  the Dili guide who guided them below Mecca along the road leading to the sea-shore. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr  hired a man from the tribe of Bani-Ad-Dil as an expert guide who was a pagan (follower of  the religion of the pagans of Quraish).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I fought in Jaish-al-Usra (Ghazwa of Tabuk) along with the  Prophet and in my opinion that was the best of my deeds. Then I had an employee, who  quarrel led with someone and one of the them bit and cut the other&#8217;s finger and caused his  own tooth to fall out. He then went to the Prophet (with a complaint) but the Prophet  cancelled the suit and said to the complainant, &#8220;Did you expect him to let his finger  in your mouth so that you might snap and cut it (as does a stallion camel)?&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Juraij from Abdullah bin Abu Mulaika from his  grandfather a similar story: A man bit the hand of another man and caused his own tooth to  fall out, but Abu Bakr judged that he had no right for compensation (for the broken  tooth). </font></p>

He then asked, Who will work for  me from midday up to the &#8216;Asr prayer for one Qirat?&#8217; The Christians accepted and fulfilled  the work. He then said, &#8216;Who will work for me from the &#8216;Asr till sunset for two Qirats?&#8217;  You, Muslims have accepted the offer. The Jews and the Christians got angry and said, &#8216;Why  should we work more and get lesser wages?&#8217; (Allah) said, &#8216;Have I with-held part of your  right?&#8217; They replied in the negative.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Allah said, &#8216;I will be an opponent  to three types of people on the Day of Resurrection: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>1. One who makes a covenant in My Name, but proves  treacherous; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>2. One who sells a free person and eats his price; and </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>3. One who employs a laborer and takes full work from him  but does not pay him for his lab our.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Musa: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of Muslims, Jews and  Christians is like the example of a man who employed laborers to work for him from morning  till night for specific wages. They worked till midday and then said, &#8216;We do not need your  money which you have fixed for us and let whatever we have done be annulled.&#8217; The man said  to them, &#8216;Don&#8217;t quit the work, but complete the rest of it and take your full wages.&#8217; But  they refused and went away. The man employed another batch after them and said to them,  &#8216;Complete the rest of the day and yours will be the wages I had fixed for the first  batch.&#8217; So, they worked till the time of &#8216;Asr prayer. Then they said, &#8220;Let what we  have done be annulled and keep the wages you have promised us for yourself.&#8217; The man said  to them, &#8216;Complete the rest of the work, as only a little of the day remains,&#8217; but they  refused. Thereafter he employed another batch to work for the rest of the day and they  worked for the rest of the day till the sunset, and they received the wages of the two  former batches. So, that was the example of those people (Muslims) and the example of this  light (guidance) which they have accepted willingly. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 36, Number 472: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Three men from among  those who were before you, set out together till they reached a cave at night and entered  it. A big rock rolled down the mountain and closed the mouth of the cave. They said (to  each other), Nothing could save you Tom this rock but to invoke Allah by giving referenda  to the righteous deed which you have done (for Allah&#8217;s sake only).&#8217; So, one of them said,  &#8216;O Allah! I had old parents and I never provided my family (wife, children etc.) with milk  before them. One day, by chance I was delayed, and I came late (at night) while they had  slept. I milked the sheep for them and took the milk to them, but I found them sleeping. I  disliked to provide my family with the milk before them. I waited for them and the bowl of  milk was in my hand and I kept on waiting for them to get up till the day dawned. Then  they got up and drank the milk. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve  us from our critical situation caused by this rock.&#8217; So, the rock shifted a little but  they could not get out.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;The second man said, &#8216;O Allah! I  had a cousin who was the dearest of all people to me and I wanted to have sexual relations  with her but she refused. Later she had a hard time in a famine year and she came to me  and I gave her one-hundred-and-twenty Dinars on the condition that she would not resist my  desire, and she agreed. When I was about to fulfill my desire, she said: It is illegal for  you to outrage my chastity except by legitimate marriage. So, I thought it a sin to have  sexual intercourse with her and left her though she was the dearest of all the people to  me, and also I left the gold I had given her. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only,  please relieve us from the present calamity.&#8217; So, the rock shifted a little more but still  they could not get out from there.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet added, &#8220;Then the third man said, &#8216;O Allah!  I employed few laborers and I paid them their wages with the exception of one man who did  not take his wages and went away. I invested his wages and I got much property thereby.  (Then after some time) he came and said to me: O Allah&#8217;s slave! Pay me my wages. I said to  him: All the camels, cows, sheep and slaves you see, are yours. He said: O Allah&#8217;s slave!  Don&#8217;t mock at me. I said: I am not mocking at you. So, he took all the herd and drove them  away and left nothing. O Allah! If I did that for Your Sake only, please relieve us from  the present suffering.&#8217; So, that rock shifted completely and they got out walking. </font></p>

He said,  &#8220;I will not pay you unless you disbelieve in Muhammad.&#8221; I said, &#8220;By Allah!  I will never do that till you die and be resurrected.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Will I be dead  and then resurrected after my death?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;There I  will have property and offspring and then I will pay you your due.&#8221; Then Allah  revealed. &#8216;Have you seen him who disbelieved in Our signs, and yet says: I will be given  property and offspring?&#8217; (19.77) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some of the companions of the Prophet went on a journey  till they reached some of the &#8216;Arab tribes (at night). They asked the latter to treat them  as their guests but they refused. The chief of that tribe was then bitten by a snake (or  stung by a scorpion) and they tried their best to cure him but in vain. Some of them said  (to the others), &#8220;Nothing has benefited him, will you go to the people who resided  here at night, it may be that some of them might possess something (as treatment),&#8221;  They went to the group of the companions (of the Prophet ) and said, &#8220;Our chief has  been bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and we have tried everything but he has  not benefitted. Have you got anything (useful)?&#8221; One of them replied, &#8220;Yes, by  Allah! I can recite a Ruqya, but as you have refused to accept us as your guests, I will  not recite the Ruqya for you unless you fix for us some wages for it.&#8221; They agrees to  pay them a flock of sheep. One of them then went and recited (Suratul-Fatiha): &#8216;All the  praises are for the Lord of the Worlds&#8217; and puffed over the chief who became all right as  if he was released from a chain, and got up and started walking, showing no signs of  sickness. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>They paid them what they agreed to pay. Some of them (i.e.  the companions) then suggested to divide their earnings among themselves, but the one who  performed the recitation said, &#8220;Do not divide them till we go to the Prophet and  narrate the whole story to him, and wait for his order.&#8221; So, they went to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle and narrated the story. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;How did you come to know that  Surat-ul-Fatiha was recited as Ruqya?&#8221; Then he added, &#8220;You have done the right  thing. Divide (what you have earned) and assign a share for me as well.&#8221; The Prophet  smiled thereupon. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I saw some agricultural equipments and said: &#8220;I heard  the Prophet saying: &#8220;There is no house in which these equipment enters except that  Allah will cause humiliation to enter it.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Sufyan bin Abu Zuhair, a man from Azd Shanu&#8217;a and one  of the companions of the Prophet said, &#8220;I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;If one keeps  a dog which is meant for guarding neither a farm nor cattle, one Qirat of the reward of  his good deeds is deducted daily.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Did you hear this from Allah&#8217;s  Apostle?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, by the Lord of this Mosque.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;While a man was riding a cow, it  turned towards him and said, &#8216;I have not been created for this purpose (i.e. carrying), I  have been created for sloughing.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar  believe in the story.&#8221; The Prophet went on, &#8220;A wolf caught a sheep, and when the  shepherd chased it, the wolf said, &#8216;Who will be its guard on the day of wild beasts, when  there will be no shepherd for it except me?&#8217; &#8220;After narrating it, the Prophet said,  &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar too believe it.&#8221; Abu Salama (a sub-narrator) said,  &#8220;Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were not present then.&#8221; (It has been written that a wolf  also spoke to one of the companions of the Prophet near Medina as narrated in  Fatah-al-Bari: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Unais bin &#8216;Amr: Ahban bin Aus said, &#8220;I was  amongst my sheep. Suddenly a wolf caught a sheep and I shouted at it. The wolf sat on its  tail and addressed me, saying, &#8216;Who will look after it (i.e. the sheep) when you will be  busy and not able to look after it? Do you forbid me the provision which Allah has  provided me?&#8217; &#8221; Ahban added, &#8220;I clapped my hands and said, &#8216;By Allah, I have  never seen anything more curious and wonderful than this!&#8217; On that the wolf said, &#8216;There  is something (more curious) and wonderful than this; that is, Allah&#8217;s Apostle in those  palm trees, inviting people to Allah (i.e. Islam).&#8217; &#8220;Unais bin &#8216;Amr further said,  &#8220;Then Ahban went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him what happened and embraced  Islam.)&#8221; palm trees or other trees and share the fruits with me.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 518: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Ansar said to the Prophet &#8220;Distribute the date  palm trees between us and our emigrant brothers.&#8221; He replied, &#8220;No.&#8221; The  Ansar said (to the emigrants), &#8220;Look after the trees (water and watch them) and share  the fruits with us.&#8221; The emigrants said, &#8220;We listen and obey.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 519: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet got the date palm trees of the tribe of  Bani-An-Nadir burnt and the trees cut down at a place called Al-Buwaira . Hassan bin  Thabit said in a poetic verse: &#8220;The chiefs of Bani Lu&#8217;ai found it easy to watch fire  spreading at Al-Buwaira.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 520: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi&#8217; bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We  used to rent the land at the yield of specific delimited portion of it to be given to the  landlord. Sometimes the vegetation of that portion was affected by blights etc., while the  rest remained safe and vice versa, so the Prophet forbade this practice. At that time gold  or silver were not used (for renting the land). If they provided the seeds, they would get  so-and-so much. Al-Hasan said, &#8220;There is no harm if the land belongs to one but both  spend on it and the yield is divided between them.&#8221; Az-Zuhri had the same opinion.  Al-Hasan said, &#8220;There is no harm if cotton is picked on the condition of having half  the yield.&#8221; Ibrahim, Ibn Siain, &#8216;Ata&#8217;, Al-Hakam, Az-Zuhri and Qatada said,  &#8220;There is no harm in giving the yarn to the weaver to weave into cloth on the basis  that one-third or one-fourth (or any other portion) of the cloth is given to the weaver  for his labor.&#8221; Ma&#8217;am said, &#8220;There is no harm in hiring animals for a definite  (fixed) period on the basis that one-third or one-fourth of the products carried by the  animals is given to the owner of the animals.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 521: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet concluded a contract with the people of Khaibar  to utilize the land on the condition that half the products of fruits or vegetation would  be their share. The Prophet used to give his wives one hundred Wasqs each, eighty Wasqs of  dates and twenty Wasqs of barley. (When &#8216;Umar became the Caliph) he gave the wives of the  Prophet the option of either having the land and water as their shares, or carrying on the  previous practice. Some of them chose the land and some chose the Wasqs, and &#8216;Aisha chose  the land. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 522: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet made a deal with the people of Khaibar that  they would have half the fruits and vegetation of the land they cultivated. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.039.523"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 523: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said to Tawus, &#8220;I wish you would give up Mukhabara  (Share-cropping), for the people say that the Prophet forbade it.&#8221; On that Tawus  replied, &#8220;O &#8216;Amr! I give the land to share-croppers and help them. No doubt; the most  learned man, namely Ibn &#8216;Abbas told me that the Prophet had not forbidden it but said, &#8216;It  is more beneficial for one to give his land free to one&#8217;s brother than to charge him a  fixed rental.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.039.524"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 524: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave the land of Khaibar to the Jew&#8217;s on  the condition that they work on it and cultivate it, and be given half of its yield. </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.039.525"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 525: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We worked on farms more than anybody else in Medina. We  used to rent the land and say to the owner, &#8220;The yield of this portion is for us and  the yield of that portion is for you (as the rent).&#8221; One of those portions might  yield something and the other might not. So, the Prophet forbade us to do so. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.039.526"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 526: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;While three men were walking, It  started raining and they took shelter (refuge) in a cave in a mountain. A big rock rolled  down from the mountain and closed the mouth of the cave. They said to each other,  &#8220;Think of good deeds which you did for Allah&#8217;s sake only, and invoke Allah by giving  reference to those deeds so that He may remove this rock from you.&#8221; One of them said,  &#8216;O Allah! I had old parents and small children and I used to graze the sheep for them. On  my return to them in the evening, I used to milk (the sheep) and start providing my  parents first of all before my children. One day I was delayed and came late at night and  found my parents sleeping. I milked (the sheep) as usual and stood by their heads. I hated  to wake them up and disliked to give milk to my children before them, although my children  were weeping (because of hunger) at my feet till the day dawned. O Allah! If I did this  for Your sake only, kindly remove the rock so that we could see the sky through it.&#8217; So,  Allah removed the rock a little and they saw the sky. The second man said, &#8216;O Allah! I was  in love with a cousin of mine like the deepest love a man may have for a woman. I wanted  to outrage her chastity but she refused unless I gave her one hundred Dinars. So, I  struggled to collect that amount. And when I sat between her legs, she said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s  slave! Be afraid of Allah and do not deflower me except rightfully (by marriage).&#8217; So, I  got up. O Allah! If I did it for Your sake only, please remove the rock.&#8217; The rock shifted  a little more. Then the third man said, &#8216;O Allah! I employed a laborer for a Faraq of rice  and when he finished his job and demanded his right, I presented it to him, but he refused  to take it. So, I sowed the rice many time till I gathered cows and their shepherd (from  the yield). (Then after some time) He came and said to me, &#8216;Fear Allah (and give me my  right).&#8221; I said, &#8216;Go and take those cows and the shepherd.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Be afraid of  Allah! Don&#8217;t mock at me.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I am not mocking at you. Take (all that).&#8217; So, he took  all that. O Allah! If I did that for Your sake only, please remove the rest of the rock.&#8217;  So, Allah removed the rock.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was passing the night at his place of  rest in Dhul-Hulaifa in the bottom of the valley (of Aqiq), he saw a dream and it was said  to him, &#8220;You are in a blessed valley.&#8221; Musa said, &#8220;Salim let our camels  kneel at the place where &#8216;Abdullah used to make his camel kneel, seeking the place where  Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to take a rest, which is situated below the mosque which is in the  bottom of the valley; it is midway between the mosque and the road.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While the Prophet was in Al-&#8216;Aqiq he said, &#8220;Someone  (meaning Gabriel) came to me from my Lord tonight (in my dream) and said, &#8216;Offer the  prayer in this blessed valley and say (I intend to perform) Umra along with Hajj  (together).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Umar expelled the Jews and the Christians from Hijaz. When  Allah&#8217;s Apostle had conquered Khaibar, he wanted to expel the Jews from it as its land  became the property of Allah, His Apostle, and the Muslims. Allah&#8217;s Apostle intended to  expel the Jews but they requested him to let them stay there on the condition that they  would do the labor and get half of the fruits. Allah&#8217;s Apostle told them, &#8220;We will  let you stay on thus condition, as long as we wish.&#8221; So, they (i.e. Jews) kept on  living there until &#8216;Umar forced them to go towards Taima&#8217; and Ariha&#8217;. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rafi bin Khadij: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My uncle Zuhair said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade us to  do a thing which was a source of help to us.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Whatever Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said was right.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent for me and asked, &#8216;What are you  doing with your farms?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;We give our farms on rent on the basis that we get the  yield produced at the banks of the water streams (rivers) for the rent, or rent it for  some Wasqs of barley and dates.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Do not do so, but cultivate (the  land) yourselves or let it be cultivated by others gratis, or keep it uncultivated.&#8217; I  said, &#8216;We hear and obey.&#8217; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 533: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people used to rent their land for cultivation for  one-third, one-fourth or half its yield. The Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever has land should  cultivate it himself or give it to his (Muslim) brother gratis; otherwise keep it  uncultivated.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever  has land should cultivate it himself or give it to his (Muslim) brother gratis; otherwise  he should keep it uncultivated.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 534: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When I mentioned it (i.e. the narration of Rafi &#8216;bin  Khadij: no. 532) to Tawus, he said, &#8220;It is permissible to rent the land for  cultivation, for Ibn &#8216;Abbas said, &#8216;The Prophet did not forbid that, but said: One had  better give the land to one&#8217;s brother gratis rather than charge a certain amount for it.&#8217;  &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Nafi: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Umar used to rent his farms in the time of Abu Bakr,  &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Uthman, and in the early days of Muawiya. Then he was told the narration of Rafi  &#8216;bin Khadij that the Prophet had forbidden the renting of farms. Ibn &#8216;Umar went to Rafi&#8217;  and I accompanied him. He asked Rafi who replied that the Prophet had forbidden the  renting of farms. Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;You know that we used to rent our farms in the  life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle for the yield of the banks of the water streams (rivers) and  for certain amount of figs. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Salim: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I knew that the land was  rented for cultivation in the life-time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; Later on Ibn &#8216;Umar was  afraid that the Prophet had forbidden it, and he had no knowledge of it, so he gave up  renting his land. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 537: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Hanzla bin Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Rafi bin Khadij said, &#8220;My two uncles told me that they  (i.e. the companions of the Prophet) used to rent the land in the life-time of the Prophet  for the yield on the banks of water streams (rivers) or for a portion of the yield  stipulated by the owner of the land. The Prophet forbade it.&#8221; I said to Rafi,  &#8220;What about renting the land for Dinars and Dirhams?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;There is  no harm in renting for Dinars-Dirhams. Al-Laith said, &#8220;If those who have discernment  for distinguishing what is legal from what is illegal looked into what has been forbidden  concerning this matter they would not permit it, for it is surrounded with dangers.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 538: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet was narrating (a story), while a bedouin  was sitting with him. &#8220;One of the inhabitants of Paradise will ask Allah to allow him  to cultivate the land. Allah will ask him, &#8216;Are you not living in the pleasures you like?&#8217;  He will say, &#8216;Yes, but I like to cultivate the land.&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;When  the man (will be permitted he) will sow the seeds and the plants will grow up and get  ripe, ready for reaping and so on till it will be as huge as mountains within a wink.  Allah will then say to him, &#8216;O son of Adam! Take here you are, gather (the yield); nothing  satisfies you.&#8217; &#8221; On that, the bedouin said, &#8220;The man must be either from  Quraish (i.e. an emigrant) or an Ansari, for they are farmers, whereas we are not  farmers.&#8221; The Prophet smiled (at this). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 539: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We used to be very happy on Friday as an old lady used to  cut some roots of the Silq, which we used to plant on the banks of our small water  streams, and cook them in a pot of her&#8217;s, adding to them, some grains of barley. (Ya&#8217;qub,  the sub-narrator said, &#8220;I think the narrator mentioned that the food did not contain  fat or melted fat (taken from meat).&#8221;) When we offered the Friday prayer we would go  to her and she would serve us with the dish. So, we used to be happy on Fridays because of  that. We used not to take our meals or the midday nap except after the Jumua prayer (i.e.  Friday prayer) . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 540: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people say that Abu Huraira narrates too many  narrations. In fact Allah knows whether I say the truth or not. They also ask, &#8220;Why  do the emigrants and the Ansar not narrate as he does?&#8221; In fact, my emigrant brethren  were busy trading in the markets, and my Ansar brethren were busy with their properties. I  was a poor man keeping the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and was satisfied with what filled  my stomach. So, I used to be present while they (i.e. the emigrants and the Ansar) were  absent, and I used to remember while they forgot (the Hadith). One day the Prophet said,  &#8220;Whoever spreads his sheet till I finish this statement of mine and then gathers it  on his chest, will never forget anything of my statement.&#8221; So, I spread my covering  sheet which was the only garment I had, till the Prophet finished his statement and then I  gathered it over my chest. By Him Who had sent him (i.e. Allah&#8217;s Apostle) with the truth,  since then I did not forget even a single word of that statement of his, until this day of  mine. By Allah, but for two verses in Allah&#8217;s Book, I would never have related any  narration (from the Prophet). (These two verses are): &#8220;Verily! Those who conceal the  clear signs and the guidance which we have sent down &#8230;..(up to) the Merciful.&#8217;  (2.159-160) </font></p>

<h3 align="center">Pilgrims Prevented from Completing thePilgrimage</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.028.033"></a>Volume 3, Book 28, Number 33:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin Umar set out for Mecca intending to perform Umra, at the time of afflictions, he said, &#8220;If I should be prevented from reaching the Kaba, then I would do the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did, so I assume the lhram for Umra as Allah&#8217;s Apostle assumed the Ihram for Umra in the year of Hudaibiya.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 34:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Ubaidullah bin &#8216;Abdullah and Salim bin &#8216;Abdullah informed him that they told Ibn &#8216;Umar when Ibn Az-Zubair was attacked by the army, saying &#8220;There is no harm for you if you did not perform Hajj this year. We are afraid that you may be prevented from reaching the Kaba.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said &#8220;We set out with Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the non-believers of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba, and so the Prophet slaughtered his Hadi and got his head shaved.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar added, &#8220;I make you witnesses that I have made &#8216;Umra obligatory for me. And, Allah willing, I will go and then if the way to Ka&#8217;ba is clear, I will perform the Tawaf, but if I am prevented from going to the Ka&#8217;ba then I will do the same as the Prophet did while I was in his company.&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar then assumed Ihram for Umra from Dhul-Hulaifa and proceeded for a while and said, &#8220;The conditions of &#8216;Umra and Hajj are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made &#8216;Umra and Hajj obligatory for myself.&#8221; So, he did not finish the Ihram till the day of Nahr (slaughtering) came, and he slaughtered his Hadi. He used to say, &#8220;I will not finish the Ihram till I perform the Tawaf, one Tawaf on the day of entering Mecca (i.e. of Safa and Marwa for both &#8216;Umra and Hajj).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 36:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle was prevented from performing (&#8216;Umra) Therefore, he shaved his head and had sexual relations with his wives and slaughtered his Hadi and performed Umra in the following year.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 37:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Abdullah) bin &#8216;Umar used to say, &#8220;Is not (the following of) the tradition of Allah&#8217;s Apostle sufficient for you? If anyone of you is prevented from performing Hajj, he should perform the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba and between As-Safa and Al-Marwa and then finish the Ihram and everything will become legal for him which was illegal for him (during the state of Ihram) and he can perform Hajj in a following year and he should slaughter a Hadi or fast in case he cannot afford the Hadi.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 38:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Miswar:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 39:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That Abdullah and Salim said to &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar, &#8220;(You should not go for Hajj this year).&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;We set out with the Prophet (to Mecca for performing &#8216;Umra) and e infidels of Quraish prevented us from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba. Allah&#8217;s Apostle slaughtered his Budn (camels for sacrifice) and got his head shaved.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 40:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Nafi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar set out for Mecca with the intentions performing &#8216;Umra in the period of afflictions, he said, &#8220;If I should be prevented from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba, then I would do the same as we did while in the company of Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; So, he assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra since the Prophet had assumed the Ihram for &#8216;Umra in the year of Al-Hudaibiya. Then &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar thought about it and said, &#8220;The conditions for both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar.&#8221; He then turned towards his companions and said, &#8220;The conditions of both Hajj and &#8216;Umra are similar and I make you witnesses that I have made the performance of Hajj obligatory for myself along with &#8216;Umra.&#8221; He then performed one Tawaf (between As-Safa and Al-Marwa) for both of them (i.e. Hajj and (&#8216;Umra) and considered that to be sufficient for him and offered a Hadi.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to him (Ka&#8217;b), &#8220;Perhaps your lice have troubled you?&#8221; Ka&#8217;b replied, &#8220;Yes! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Have your head shaved and then either fast three days or feed six poor persons or slaughter one sheep as a sacrifice.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 42:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Umra:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood beside me at Al-Hudaibiya and the lice were falling from my head in great number. He asked me, &#8220;Have your lice troubled you?&#8221; I replied in the affirmative. He ordered me to get my head shaved. Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;This Holy Verse:&#8211;&#8216;And if any of you is ill, or has ailment in his scalp (2.196), etc. was revealed regarding me. &#8220;The Prophet then ordered me either to fast three days, or to feed six poor persons with one Faraq (three Sas) (of dates), or to slaughter a sheep, etc (sacrifice) whatever was available.</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I sat with Ka&#8217;b bin &#8216;Ujra and asked him about the Fidya. He replied, &#8220;This revelation was revealed concerning my case especially, but it is also for you in general. I was carried to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the lice were falling in great number on my face. The Prophet said, &#8220;I have never thought that your ailment (or struggle) has reached to such an extent as I see. Can you afford a sheep?&#8221; I replied in the negative. He then said, &#8220;Fast for three days, or feed six poor persons each with half a Sa of food.&#8221; (1 Sa = 3 Kilograms approx.)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 28, Number 44:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdur-Rahman bin Abu Layla:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reporting the speech of Ka&#8217;b bin Umra) Allah&#8217;s Apostle saw him (i.e. Ka&#8217;b) while the lice were falling on his face. He asked (him), &#8220;Have your lice troubled you?&#8221; He replied in the affirmative. So, he ordered him to get his head shaved while he was at Al-Hudaibiya. At that time they were not permitted to finish their Ihram, and were still hoping to enter Mecca. So, Allah revealed the verses of Al-Fidya. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to feed six poor persons with one Faraq of food or to slaughter one sheep (as a sacrifice) or to fast for three days.</p>

<h3 align="center">Actions while Praying</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.022.289"></a>Volume 2, Book 22, Number 289:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Kuraib Maula Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah bin Abbas said that he had passed a night in the house of Maimuna the mother of the faithful believers , who was his aunt. He said, &#8220;I slept across the bed, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle along with his wife slept lengthwise. Allah&#8217;s Apostle slept till mid-night or slightly before or after it. Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle woke up, sat, and removed the traces of sleep by rubbing his hands over his face. Then he recited the last ten verses of Surat-Al Imran (2). Then he went towards a hanging leather water-container and performed a perfect ablution and then stood up for prayer.&#8221; &#8216;Abdullah bin Abbas added, &#8220;I got up and did the same as Allah&#8217;s Apostle had done and then went and stood by his side. Allah&#8217;s Apostle then put his right hand over my head and caught my right ear and twisted it. He offered two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat, then two Rakat and then offered one Raka Witr. Then he lay down till the Muadh-dhin came and then he prayed two light Rakat and went out and offered the early morning (Fajr) prayer.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 290:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to greet the Prophet while he was praying and he used to answer our greetings. When we returned from AnNajashi (the ruler of Ethiopia), we greeted him, but he did not answer us (during the prayer) and (after finishing the prayer) he said, &#8220;In the prayer one is occupied (with a more serious matter).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 291:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the same as No. 290. from the Prophet</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 292:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Zaid bin Arqam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of the Prophet we used to speak while praying, and one of us would tell his needs to his companions, till the verse, &#8216;Guard strictly your prayers (2.238) was revealed. After that we were ordered to remain silent while praying.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 293:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet went out to affect a reconciliation between the tribes of Bani &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf and the time of the prayer became due; Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;The Prophet is detained. Will you lead the people in the prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;Yes, if you wish.&#8221; So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr led the prayer. In the meantime the Prophet came crossing the rows (of the praying people) till he stood in the first row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr never looked hither and thither during the prayer but when the people clapped too much, he looked back and saw the Prophet in the (first) row. The Prophet waved him to remain at his place, but Abu Bakr raised both his hands and sent praises to Allah and then retreated and the Prophet went forward and led the prayer. (See Hadith No. 295 &amp; 296)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 294:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Masud:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to say the greeting, name and greet each other in the prayer. Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard it and said:&#8211;&#8220;Say, &#8216;At-tahiyyatu lil-lahi was-salawatu wat-taiyibatu .

<p style="text-align:justify;">While Abu Bakr was leading the people in the morning prayer on a Monday, the Prophet came towards them suddenly having lifted the curtain of &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s house, and looked at them as they were standing in rows and smiled. Abu Bakr tried to come back thinking that Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to come out for the prayer. The attention of the Muslims was diverted from the prayer because they were delighted to see the Prophet. The Prophet waved his hand to them to complete their prayer, then he went back into the room and let down the curtain. The Prophet expired on that very day.</p>

My mother (is calling me) and (I am offering) my prayer. (What shall I do?)&#8217; She said, &#8216;O Allah! Do not let Juraij die till he sees the faces of prostitutes.&#8217; A shepherdess used to come by his hermitage for grazing her sheep and she gave birth to a child. She was asked whose child that was, and she replied that it was from Juraij and that he had come out from his hermitage. Juraij said, &#8216;Where is that woman who claims that her child is from me?&#8217; (When she was brought to him along with the child), Juraij asked the child, &#8216;O Babus, who is your father?&#8217; The child replied, &#8216;The shepherd.&#8217; &#8221; (See Hadith No 662.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to stretch my legs towards the Qibla of the Prophet while he was praying; whenever he prostrated he touched me, and I would withdraw my legs, and whenever he stood up, I would restretch my legs.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 22, Number 301:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet once offered the prayer and said, &#8220;Satan came in front of me and tried to interrupt my prayer, but Allah gave me an upper hand on him and I choked him. No doubt, I thought of tying him to one of the pillars of the mosque till you get up in the morning and see him. Then I remembered the statement of Prophet Solomon, &#8216;My Lord ! Bestow on me a kingdom such as shall not belong to any other after me.&#8217; Then Allah made him (Satan) return with his head down (humiliated).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Azraq bin Qais:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were at Al-Ahwaz fighting the AlHaruriya (tribe). While I was at the bank of a river a man was praying and the reins of his animal were in his hands and the animal was struggling and he was following the animal. (Shu&#8217;ba, a sub-narrator, said that man was Abu Barza al-Aslaml). A man from the Khawarij said, &#8220;O Allah! Be harsh to this sheik.&#8221; And when the sheik (Abu Barza) finished his prayer, he said, &#8220;I heard your remark. No doubt, I participated with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in six or seven or eight holy battles and saw his leniency, and no doubt, I would rather retain my animal than let it return to its stable, as it would cause me much trouble. &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the sun eclipsed and Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up for the prayer and recited a very long Sura and when bowed for a long while and then raised his head and started reciting another Sura. Then he bowed, and after finishing, he prostrated and did the same in the second Raka and then said, &#8220;These (lunar and solar eclipses) are two of the signs of Allah and if you see them, pray till the eclipse is over. No doubt, while standing at this place I saw everything promised to me by Allah and I saw (Paradise) and I wanted to pluck a bunch (of grapes) therefrom, at the time when you saw me stepping forward. No doubt, I saw Hell with its different parts destroying each other when you saw me retreating and in it I saw &#8216;Amr bin Luhai who started the tradition of freeing animals (set them free) in the name of idols.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle sent me for some job and when I had finished it I returned and came to the Prophet and greeted him but he did not return my greeting. So I felt so sorry that only Allah knows it and I said to myself,, &#8216;Perhaps Allah&#8217;s Apostle is angry because I did not come quickly, then again I greeted him but he did not reply. I felt even more sorry than I did the first time. Again I greeted him and he returned the greeting and said, &#8220;The thing which prevented me from returning the greeting was that I was praying.&#8221; And at that time he was on his Rahila and his face was not towards the Qibla.</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle is detained (there) and the time for the prayer is due. Will you lead the people in prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;Yes, if you wish.&#8221; So Bilal pronounced the Iqama and Abu Bakr went forward and the people said Takbir. In the meantime, Allah&#8217;s Apostle came piercing through the rows till he stood in the (first) row and the people started clapping. Abu Bakr, would never look hither and thither during the prayer but when the people clapped much he looked back and saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Prophet beckoned him to carry on. Abu Bakr raised both his hands, praised Allah and retreated till he stood in the row and Allah&#8217;s Apostle went forward and led the people in the prayer. When he had finished the prayer, he addressed the people and said, &#8220;O people! Why did you start clapping when something happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is for women. Whenever one is confronted with something unusual in the prayer one should say, &#8216;Sub Han Allah&#8217;.&#8221; Then the Prophet looked towards Abu Bakr and asked, &#8220;What prevented you from leading the prayer when I beckoned you to carry on?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;It does not befit the son of Al Quhafa to lead the prayer in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle</p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;What is that?&#8221; He said, &#8220;You have offered five Rakat.&#8221; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle performed two prostrations of Sahu after Taslim.</p>

Sad said, &#8220;I saw that &#8216;Ursa bin Az-Zubair had offered two Rakat in the Maghrib prayer and finished it with Taslim.

He then stood near a price of wood in front of the Mosque and put his hand over it. Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were amongst those who were present, but they dared not talk to him about that (because of excessive respect for him), and those who were in a hurry went out. They said, &#8220;Has the prayer been reduced?&#8221; A man who was called DhulYadain by the Prophet said (to the Prophet), &#8220;Has the prayer been reduced or have you forgotten?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Neither have I forgotten, nor has the prayer been reduced.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Certainly you have forgotten.&#8221; So the Prophet offered two more Rakat and performed Tashm and then said Takbir and performed a prostration of Sahu like his ordinary prostration or a bit longer and then raised his head and said Takbir and then put his head down and performed a prostration like his ordinary prostration or a bit longer, and then raised his head and said Takbir.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I was sent to Aisha by Ibn Abbas, Al-Miswar bin Makhrama and &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Azhar . They told me to greet her on their behalf and to ask her about the offering of the two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer and to say to her, &#8220;We were informed that you offer those two Rakat and we were told that the Prophet had forbidden offering them.&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;I along with &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab used to beat the people whenever they offered them.&#8221; I went to Aisha and told her that message. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8220;Go and ask Um Salama about them.&#8221; So I returned and informed them about her statement. They then told me to go to Um Salama with the same question with which t sent me to &#8216;Aisha. Um Salama replied, &#8220;I heard the Prophet forbidding them. Later I saw him offering them immediately after he prayed the &#8216;Asr prayer. He then entered my house at a time when some of the Ansari women from the tribe of Bani Haram were sitting with me, so I sent my slave girl to him having said to her, &#8216;Stand beside him and tell him that Um Salama says to you, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I have heard you forbidding the offering of these (two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer) but I have seen you offering them.&#8221; If he waves his hand then wait for him.&#8217; The slave girl did that. The Prophet beckoned her with his hand and she waited for him. When he had finished the prayer he said, &#8220;O daughter of Bani Umaiya! You have asked me about the two Rakat after the &#8216;Asr prayer. The people of the tribe of &#8216;Abdul-Qais came to me and made me busy and I could not offer the two Rakat after the Zuhr prayer. These (two Rakat that I have just prayed) are for those (missed) ones.</p>

When he completed the prayer he faced the people and said, &#8220;O people! Why did you start clapping when something unusual happened to you in the prayer? Clapping is only for women. So whoever amongst you comes across something in the prayer should say, &#8216;Subhan-Allah&#8217; for there is none who will not turn round on hearing him saying Subhan-Allah. O Ab-u Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned you to do so?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;How dare the son of Abu Quhafa lead the prayer in the presence of Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Peacemaking </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="003.049.855">Volume 3, Book 49, Number 855: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a dispute amongst the people of the tribe of Bani  &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Auf. The Prophet went to them along with some of his companions in order to make  peace between them. The time for the prayer became due but the Prophet did not turn up;  Bilal pronounced the Adhan (i.e. call) for the prayer but the Prophet did not turn up, so  Bilal went to Abu Bakr and said, &#8220;The time for the prayer is due and the Prophet i  detained, would you lead the people in the prayer?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;Yes, you  wish.&#8221; So, Bilal pronounced the Iqama of the prayer and Abu Bakr went ahead (to lead  the prayer), but the Prophet came walking among the rows till he joined the first row. The  people started clapping and they clapped too much, and Abu Bakr used not to look hither  and thither in the prayer, but he turned round and saw the Prophet standing behind him.  The Prophet beckoned him with his hand to keep on praying where he was. Abu Bakr raised  his hand and praised Allah and then retreated till he came in the (first) row, and the  Prophet went ahead and lead the people in the prayer. When the Prophet finished the  prayer, he turned towards the people and said, &#8220;O people! When something happens to  you during the prayer, you start clapping. Really clapping is (permissible) for women  only. If something happens to one of you in his prayer, he should say: &#8216;Subhan Allah&#8217;,  (Glorified be Allah), for whoever hears him (saying so) will direct his attention towards  him. O Abu Bakr! What prevented you from leading the people in the prayer when I beckoned  to you (to continue)?&#8221; Abu Bakr replied, &#8220;It did not befit the son of Abu Quhafa  to lead the prayer in front of the Prophet. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>It was said to the Prophet &#8220;Would that you see  Abdullah bin Ubai.&#8221; So, the Prophet went to him, riding a donkey, and the Muslims  accompanied him, walking on salty barren land. When the Prophet reached &#8216;Abdullah bin  Ubai, the latter said, &#8220;Keep away from me! By Allah, the bad smell of your donkey has  harmed me.&#8221; On that an Ansari man said (to &#8216;Abdullah), &#8220;By Allah! The smell of  the donkey of Allah&#8217;s Apostle is better than your smell.&#8221; On that a man from  &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s tribe got angry for &#8216;Abdullah&#8217;s sake, and the two men abused each other which  caused the friends of the two men to get angry, and the two groups started fighting with  sticks, shoes and hands. We were informed that the following Divine Verse was revealed (in  this concern):&#8211; &#8220;And if two groups of Believers fall to fighting then, make peace  between them.&#8221; (49.9) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That she heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;He who makes  peace between the people by inventing good information or saying good things, is not a  liar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Sahl bin Sad: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the people of Quba fought with each other till they  threw stones on each other. When Allah&#8217;s Apostle was informed about it, he said, &#8220;Let  us go to bring about a reconciliation between them.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The following Verse: If a woman fears cruelty or desertion  on her husband&#8217;s part (i.e. the husband notices something unpleasant about his wife, such  as old age or the like, and wants to divorce her, but she asks him to keep her and provide  for her as he wishes). (4.128) &#8220;There is no blame on them if they reconcile on such  basis.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>A bedouin came and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Judge  between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; His opponent got up and said, &#8220;He is  right. Judge between us according to Allah&#8217;s Laws.&#8221; The bedouin said, &#8220;My son  was a laborer working for this man, and he committed illegal sexual intercourse with his  wife. The people told me that my son should be stoned to death; so, in lieu of that, I  paid a ransom of one hundred sheep and a slave girl to save my son. Then I asked the  learned scholars who said, &#8220;Your son has to be lashed one-hundred lashes and has to  be exiled for one year.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;No doubt I will judge between you  according to Allah&#8217;s Laws. The slave-girl and the sheep are to go back to you, and your  son will get a hundred lashes and one year exile.&#8221; He then addressed somebody,  &#8220;O Unais! go to the wife of this (man) and stone her to death&#8221; So, Unais went  and stoned her to death. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;If somebody innovates something  which is not in harmony with the principles of our religion, that thing is rejected.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Allah&#8217;s Apostle concluded a peace treaty with the  people of Hudaibiya, Ali bin Abu Talib wrote the document and he mentioned in it,  &#8220;Muhammad, Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; The pagans said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t write: &#8216;Muhammad,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217;, for if you were an apostle we would not fight with you.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle asked Ali to rub it out, but Ali said, &#8220;I will not be the person to rub it  out.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle rubbed it out and made peace with them on the condition that  the Prophet and his companions would enter Mecca and stay there for three days, and that  they would enter with their weapons in cases. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 49, Number 863: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the Prophet intended to perform &#8216;Umra in the month of  Dhul-Qada, the people of Mecca did not let him enter Mecca till he settled the matter with  them by promising to stay in it for three days only. When the document of treaty was  written, the following was mentioned: &#8216;These are the terms on which Muhammad, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle agreed (to make peace).&#8217; They said, &#8220;We will not agree to this, for if we  believed that you are Allah&#8217;s Apostle we would not prevent you, but you are Muhammad bin  &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle and also Muhammad bin  &#8216;Abdullah.&#8221; Then he said to &#8216;Ali, &#8220;Rub off (the words) &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle&#8217; &#8220;,  but &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;No, by Allah, I will never rub off your name.&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s  Apostle took the document and wrote, &#8216;This is what Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdullah has agreed upon:  No arms will be brought into Mecca except in their cases, and nobody from the people of  Mecca will be allowed to go with him (i.e. the Prophet ) even if he wished to follow him  and he (the Prophet ) will not prevent any of his companions from staying in Mecca if the  latter wants to stay.&#8217; When the Prophet entered Mecca and the time limit passed, the  Meccans went to &#8216;Ali and said, &#8220;Tell your Friend (i.e. the Prophet ) to go out, as  the period (agreed to) has passed.&#8221; So, the Prophet went out of Mecca. The daughter  of Hamza ran after them (i.e. the Prophet and his companions), calling, &#8220;O Uncle! O  Uncle!&#8221; &#8216;Ali received her and led her by the hand and said to Fatima, &#8220;Take your  uncle&#8217;s daughter.&#8221; Zaid and Ja&#8217;far quarrel ed about her. &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;I have more  right to her as she is my uncle&#8217;s daughter.&#8221; Ja&#8217;far said, &#8220;She is my uncle&#8217;s  daughter, and her aunt is my wife.&#8221; Zaid said, &#8220;She is my brother&#8217;s  daughter.&#8221; The Prophet judged that she should be given to her aunt, and said that the  aunt was like the mother. He then said to &#8216;All, &#8220;You are from me and I am from  you&#8221;, and said to Ja&#8217;far, &#8220;You resemble me both in character and  appearance&#8221;, and said to Zaid, &#8220;You are our brother (in faith) and our freed  slave.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn &#8216;Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle set out for the &#8216;Umra but the pagans of  Quraish prevented him from reaching the Ka&#8217;ba. So, he slaughtered his sacrifice and got  his head shaved at Al-Hudaibiya, and agreed with them that he would perform &#8216;Umra the  following year and would not carry weapons except swords and would not stay in Mecca  except for the period they al lowed. So, the Prophet performed the &#8216;Umra in the following  year and entered Mecca according to the treaty, and when he stayed for three days, the  pagans ordered him to depart, and he departed. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 49, Number 866: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ar-Rabi, the daughter of An-Nadr broke the tooth of a girl,  and the relatives of Ar-Rabi&#8217; requested the girl&#8217;s relatives to accept the Irsh  (compensation for wounds etc.) and forgive (the offender), but they refused. So, they went  to the Prophet who ordered them to bring about retaliation. Anas bin An-Nadr asked,  &#8220;O Allah&#8221;; Apostle! Will the tooth of Ar-Rabi&#8217; be broken? No, by Him Who has  sent you with the Truth, her tooth will not be broken.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;O  Anas! Allah&#8221;; law ordains retaliation.&#8221; Later the relatives of the girl agreed  and forgave her. The Prophet said, &#8220;There are some of Allah&#8217;s slaves who, if they  take an oath by Allah, are responded to by Allah i.e. their oath is fulfilled). Anas  added, &#8220;The people agreed and accepted the Irsh.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 49, Number 867: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Hasan Al-Basri: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>By Allah, Al-Hasan bin Ali led large battalions like  mountains against Muawiya. Amr bin Al-As said (to Muawiya), &#8220;I surely see battalions  which will not turn back before killing their opponents.&#8221; Muawiya who was really the  best of the two men said to him, &#8220;O &#8216;Amr! If these killed those and those killed  these, who would be left with me for the jobs of the public, who would be left with me for  their women, who would be left with me for their children?&#8221; Then Muawiya sent two  Quraishi men from the tribe of &#8216;Abd-i-Shams called &#8216;Abdur Rahman bin Sumura and Abdullah  bin &#8216;Amir bin Kuraiz to Al-Hasan saying to them, &#8220;Go to this man (i.e. Al-Hasan) and  negotiate peace with him and talk and appeal to him.&#8221; So, they went to Al-Hasan and  talked and appealed to him to accept peace. Al-Hasan said, &#8220;We, the offspring of  &#8216;Abdul Muttalib, have got wealth and people have indulged in killing and corruption (and  money only will appease them).&#8221; They said to Al-Hasan, &#8220;Muawiya offers you so  and so, and appeals to you and entreats you to accept peace.&#8221; Al-Hasan said to them,  &#8220;But who will be responsible for what you have said?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We will  be responsible for it.&#8221; So, what-ever Al-Hasan asked they said, &#8220;We will be  responsible for it for you.&#8221; So, Al-Hasan concluded a peace treaty with Muawiya.  Al-Hasan (Al-Basri) said: I heard Abu Bakr saying, &#8220;I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the  pulpit and Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali was by his side. The Prophet was looking once at the people  and once at Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Ali saying, &#8216;This son of mine is a Saiyid (i.e. a noble) and may  Allah make peace between two big groups of Muslims through him.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard the loud voices of some  opponents quarreling at the door. One of them was appealing to the other to deduct his  debt and asking him to be lenient but the other was saying, &#8220;By Allah I will not do  so.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle went out to them and said, &#8220;Who is the one who was swearing  by Allah that he would not do a favor?&#8221; That man said, &#8220;I am that person, O  Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will give my opponent whatever he wishes.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abdullah bin Kab bin Malik from Kab bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abdullah bin Abu Hadrad Al-Aslami owed Kab bin Malik some  money. One day the latter met the former and demanded his right, and their voices grew  very loud. The Prophet passed by them and said, &#8220;O Ka&#8217;b,&#8221; beckoning with his  hand as if intending to say, &#8220;Deduct half the debts.&#8221; So, Kab took half what the  other owed him and remitted the other half. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;There is a Sadaqa to be given  for every joint of the human body; and for every day on which the sun rises there is a  reward of a Sadaqa (i.e. charitable gift) for the one who establishes justice among  people.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 3, Book 49, Number 871: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Urwa bin Az-Zubair: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Az-Zubair told me that he quarrelled with an Ansari man who  had participated in (the battle of) Badr in front of Allah&#8217;s Apostle about a water stream  which both of them used for irrigation. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to Az-Zubair, &#8220;O Zubair!  Irrigate (your garden) first, and then let the water flow to your neighbor.&#8221; The  Ansari became angry and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is it because he is your  cousin?&#8221; On that the complexion of Allah&#8217;s Apostle changed (because of anger) and  said (to Az-Zubair), &#8220;I irrigate (your garden) and then with-hold the water till it  reaches the walls (surrounding the palms).&#8221; So, Allah&#8217;s Apostle gave Az-Zubair his  full right. Before that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had given a generous judgment beneficial for  Az-Zubair and the Ansari, but when the Ansan irritated Allah&#8217;s Apostle he gave Az-Zubair  his full right according to the evident law. Az-Zubair said, &#8220;By Allah ! I think the  following Verse was revealed concerning that case: &#8220;But no by your Lord They can have  No faith Until they make you judge In all disputes between them.&#8221; (4.65) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Jabir bin Abdullah: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>My father died and was in debt. I suggested that his  creditors take the fruits (i.e. dates) of my garden in lieu of the debt of my father, but  they refused the offer, as they thought that it would not cover the full debt. So, I went  to the Prophet and told him about it. He said (to me), &#8220;When you pluck the dates and  collect them in the Mirbad (i.e. a place where dates are dried), call me (Allah&#8217;s  Apostle).&#8221; Finally he came accompanied by Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar and sat on the dates and  invoked Allah to bless them. Then he said, &#8220;Call your creditors and give them their  full rights.&#8221; So, I paid all my father&#8217;s creditors in full and yet thirteen extra  Wasqs of dates remained, seven of which were &#8216;Ajwa and six were Laun or six of which were  Ajwa and seven were Laun. I met Allah&#8217;s Apostle at sunset and informed him about it. On  that he smiled and said, &#8220;Go to Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar and tell them about it.&#8221; They  said, &#8220;We perceived that was going to happen, as Allah&#8217;s Apostle did what he  did.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That Ka&#8217;b bin Malik told him that in the lifetime of  Allah&#8217;s Apostle he demanded his debt from Ibn Abu Hadrad in the Mosque. Their voices grew  louder till Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard them while he was in his house. So he lifted the curtain  of his room and called Ka&#8217;b bin Malik saying, &#8220;O Ka&#8217;b!&#8221; He replied,  &#8220;Labbaik! O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; He beckoned to him with his hand suggesting that  he deduct half the debt. Ka&#8217;b said, &#8220;I agree, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8221; Allah&#8217;s  Apostle then said (to Ibn Abu Hadrad), &#8220;Get up and pay him the rest.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr came riding his horse from his dwelling place in As-Sunh. He got down from it, entered the Mosque and did not speak with anybody till he came to me and went direct to the Prophet, who was covered with a marked blanket. Abu Bakr uncovered his face.

Allah said: &#8216;Muhammad is no more than an Apostle and indeed (many) Apostles have passed away before him ..(up to the) grateful.&#8217; &#8221; (3.144) (The narrator added, &#8220;By Allah, it was as if the people never knew that Allah had revealed this verse before till Abu Bakr recited it and then whoever heard it, started reciting it &#8220;)</p>

On that the eyes of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) started shedding tears. Sad said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What is this?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;It is mercy which Allah has lodged in the hearts of His slaves, and Allah is merciful only to those of His slaves who are merciful (to others).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">We were (in the funeral procession) of one of the daughters of the Prophet and he was sitting by the side of the grave. I saw his eyes shedding tears. He said, &#8220;Is there anyone among you who did not have sexual relations with his wife last night?&#8221; Abu Talha replied in the affirmative. And so the Prophet told him to get down in the grave. And so he got down in her grave.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Ubaidullah bin Abi Mulaika:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the daughters of &#8216;Uthman died at Mecca. We went to attend her funeral procession. Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn Abbas were also present. I sat in between them (or said, I sat beside one of them. Then a man came and sat beside me.) &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar said to &#8216;Amr bin &#8216;Uthman, &#8220;Will you not prohibit crying as Allah&#8217;s Apostle has said, &#8216;The dead person is tortured by the crying of his relatives.?&#8221; Ibn Abbas said, &#8220;Umar used to say so.&#8221; Then he added narrating, &#8220;I accompanied Umar on a journey from Mecca till we reached Al-Baida. There he saw some travelers in the shade of a Samura (A kind of forest tree). He said (to me), &#8220;Go and see who those travelers are.&#8221; So I went and saw that one of them was Suhaib. I told this to &#8216;Umar who then asked me to call him. So I went back to Suhaib and said to him, &#8220;Depart and follow the chief of the faithful believers.&#8221; Later, when &#8216;Umar was stabbed, Suhaib came in weeping and saying, &#8220;O my brother, O my friend!&#8221; (on this &#8216;Umar said to him, &#8220;O Suhaib! Are you weeping for me while the Prophet said, &#8220;The dead person is punished by some of the weeping of his relatives?&#8221; Ibn Abbas added, &#8220;When &#8216;Umar died I told all this to Aisha and she said, &#8216;May Allah be merciful to Umar. By Allah, Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not say that a believer is punished by the weeping of his relatives. But he said, Allah increases the punishment of a non-believer because of the weeping of his relatives.&#8221; Aisha further added, &#8220;The Quran is sufficient for you (to clear up this point) as Allah has stated: &#8216;No burdened soul will bear another&#8217;s burden.&#8217; &#8221; (35.18). Ibn Abbas then said, &#8220;Only Allah makes one laugh or cry.&#8221; Ibn Umar did not say anything after that.</p>

I told him, &#8216;I am reduced to this state because of illness and I am wealthy and have no inheritors except a daughter, (In this narration the name of &#8216;Amir bin Sad is mentioned and in fact it is a mistake; the narrator is &#8216;Aisha bint Sad bin Abi Waqqas). Should I give two-thirds of my property in charity?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; I asked, &#8216;Half?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No.&#8217; then he added, &#8216;One-third, and even one-third is much. You&#8217;d better leave your inheritors wealthy rather than leaving them poor, begging others. You will get a reward for whatever you spend for Allah&#8217;s sake, even for what you put in your wife&#8217;s mouth.&#8217; I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Will I be left alone after my companions have gone?&#8217; He said, &#8216;If you are left behind, whatever good deeds you will do will up-grade you and raise you high. And perhaps you will have a long life so that some people will be benefited by you while others will be harmed by you. O Allah! Complete the emigration of my companions and do not turn them renegades.&#8217; But Allah&#8217;s Apostle felt sorry for poor Sad bin Khaula as he died in Mecca.&#8221; (but Sad bin Abi Waqqas lived long after the Prophet (p.b.u.h).)</p>

Allah knows better (why he did so). &#8216;Abdullah bin Ubai had given his shirt to Al-Abbas to wear.

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar set out along with the Prophet (p.b.u.h) with a group of people to Ibn Saiyad till they saw him playing with the boys near the hillocks of Bani Mughala. Ibn Saiyad at that time was nearing his puberty and did not notice (us) until the Prophet stroked him with his hand and said to him, &#8220;Do you testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Ibn Saiyad looked at him and said, &#8220;I testify that you are the Messenger of illiterates.&#8221; Then Ibn Saiyad asked the Prophet (p.b.u.h), &#8220;Do you testify that I am Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) refuted it and said, &#8220;I believe in Allah and His Apostles.&#8221; Then he said (to Ibn Saiyad), &#8220;What do you think?&#8221; Ibn Saiyad answered, &#8220;True people and liars visit me.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;You have been confused as to this matter.&#8221; Then the Prophet said to him, &#8220;I have kept something (in my mind) for you, (can you tell me that?)&#8221; Ibn Saiyad said, &#8220;It is Al-Dukh (the smoke).&#8221; (2) The Prophet said, &#8220;Let you be in ignominy. You cannot cross your limits.&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar, said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allow me to chop his head off.&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;If he is he (i.e. Dajjal), then you cannot over-power him, and if he is not, then there is no use of murdering him.&#8221; (Ibn &#8216;Umar added): Later on Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) once again went along with Ubai bin Ka&#8217;b to the date-palm trees (garden) where Ibn Saiyad was staying. The Prophet (p.b.u.h) wanted to hear something from Ibn Saiyad before Ibn Saiyad could see him, and the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw him lying covered with a sheet and from where his murmurs were heard. Ibn Saiyad&#8217;s mother saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle while he was hiding himself behind the trunks of the date-palm trees. She addressed Ibn Saiyad, &#8220;O Saf ! (and this was the name of Ibn Saiyad) Here is Muhammad.&#8221; And with that Ibn Saiyad got up. The Prophet said, &#8220;Had this woman left him (Had she not disturbed him), then Ibn Saiyad would have revealed the reality of his case.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The funeral prayer should be offered for every child even if he were the son of a prostitute as he was born with a true faith of Islam (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone). If his parents are Muslims, particularly the father, even if his mother were a non-Muslim, and if he after the delivery cries (even once) before his death (i.e. born alive) then the funeral prayer must be offered. And if the child does not cry after his delivery (i.e. born dead) then his funeral prayer should not be offered, and he will be considered as a miscarriage. Abu Huraira, narrated that the Prophet said, &#8220;Every child is born with a true faith (i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone) but his parents convert him to Judaism or to Christianity or to Magainism, as an animal delivers a perfect baby animal. Do you find it mutilated?&#8221; Then Abu Huraira recited the holy verses: &#8216;The pure Allah&#8217;s Islamic nature (true faith i.e. to worship none but Allah Alone), with which He has created human beings.&#8217; &#8221; (30.30).</p>

Should we not depend on what has been written for us and leave the deeds as whoever amongst us is blessed will do the deeds of a blessed person and whoever amongst us will be wretched, will do the deeds of a wretched person?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;The good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made easy for the wretched.&#8221; Then he recited the Verses:&#8211; &#8220;As for him who gives (in charity) and is Allah-fearing And believes in the Best reward from Allah. &#8221; (92.5-6)</p>

Had I known that he would be forgiven by asking for Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for more than seventy times, surely I would have done so.&#8221; (&#8216;Umar added): Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered his funeral prayer and returned and after a short while the two verses of Surat Bara&#8217; were revealed: i.e. &#8220;And never (O Muhammad) pray for any of them who dies . . . (to the end of the verse) rebellion (9.84)&#8221; &#8212; (&#8216;Umar added), &#8220;Later I astonished at my daring before Allah&#8217;s Apostle on that day. And Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 468:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Samura bin Jundab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet finished the (morning) prayer, he would face us and ask, &#8220;Who amongst you had a dream last night?&#8221; So if anyone had seen a dream he would narrate it. The Prophet would say: &#8220;Ma sha&#8217;a-llah&#8221; (An Arabic maxim meaning literally, &#8216;What Allah wished,&#8217; and it indicates a good omen.) One day, he asked us whether anyone of us had seen a dream. We replied in the negative. The Prophet said, &#8220;But I had seen (a dream) last night that two men came to me, caught hold of my hands, and took me to the Sacred Land (Jerusalem). There, I saw a person sitting and another standing with an iron hook in his hand pushing it inside the mouth of the former till it reached the jaw-bone, and then tore off one side of his cheek, and then did the same with the other side; in the mean-time the first side of his cheek became normal again and then he repeated the same operation again. I said, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on and we went on till we came to a man Lying flat on his back, and another man standing at his head carrying a stone or a piece of rock, and crushing the head of the Lying man, with that stone. Whenever he struck him, the stone rolled away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man went to pick it up and by the time he returned to him, the crushed head had returned to its normal state and the man came back and struck him again (and so on). I said, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on; so we proceeded on and passed by a hole like an oven; with a narrow top and wide bottom, and the fire was kindling underneath that hole. Whenever the fire-flame went up, the people were lifted up to such an extent that they about to get out of it, and whenever the fire got quieter, the people went down into it, and there were naked men and women in it. I said, &#8216;Who is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on. So we proceeded on till we reached a river of blood and a man was in it, and another man was standing at its bank with stones in front of him, facing the man standing in the river. Whenever the man in the river wanted to come out, the other one threw a stone in his mouth and caused him to retreat to his original position; and so whenever he wanted to come out the other would throw a stone in his mouth, and he would retreat to his original position. I asked, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; They told me to proceed on and we did so till we reached a well-flourished green garden having a huge tree and near its root was sitting an old man with some children. (I saw) Another man near the tree with fire in front of him and he was kindling it up. Then they (i.e. my two companions) made me climb up the tree and made me enter a house, better than which I have ever seen. In it were some old men and young men, women and children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then they took me out of this house and made me climb up the tree and made me enter another house that was better and superior (to the first) containing old and young people. I said to them (i.e. my two companions), &#8216;You have made me ramble all the night. Tell me all about that I have seen.&#8217; They said, &#8216;Yes. As for the one whose cheek you saw being torn away, he was a liar and he used to tell lies, and the people would report those lies on his authority till they spread all over the world. So, he will be punished like that till the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one whose head you saw being crushed is the one whom Allah had given the knowledge of Quran (i.e. knowing it by heart) but he used to sleep at night (i.e. he did not recite it then) and did not use to act upon it (i.e. upon its orders etc.) by day; and so this punishment will go on till the Day of Resurrection. And those you saw in the hole (like oven) were adulterers (those men and women who commit illegal sexual intercourse). And those you saw in the river of blood were those dealing in Riba (usury). And the old man who was sitting at the base of the tree was Abraham and the little children around him were the offspring of the people. And the one who was kindling the fire was Malik, the gate-keeper of the Hell-fire. And the first house in which you have gone was the house of the common believers, and the second house was of the martyrs. I am Gabriel and this is Michael. Raise your head.&#8217; I raised my head and saw a thing like a cloud over me. They said, &#8216;That is your place.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Let me enter my place.&#8217; They said, &#8216;You still have some life which you have not yet completed, and when you complete (that remaining portion of your life) you will then enter your place.&#8217; &#8220;</p>

Then he said, &#8216;Wash this garment of mine and add two more garments and shroud me in them.&#8217; I said, &#8216;This is worn out.&#8217; He said, &#8216;A living person has more right to wear new clothes than a dead one; the shroud is only for the body&#8217;s pus.&#8217; He did not die till it was the night of Tuesday and was buried before the morning.&#8221;</p>

The people got scared and thought that it was the foot of the Prophet. No-one could be found who could tell them about it till I (&#8216;Urwa) said to them, &#8220;By Allah, this is not the foot of the Prophet but it is the foot of Umar.&#8221; Aisha narrated that she made a will to &#8216;Abdullah bin Zubair, &#8220;Do not bury me with them (the Prophet and his two companions) but bury me with my companions (wives of the Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) in Al-Baqi as I would not like to be looked upon as better than I really am (by being buried near the Prophet).&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab (when he was stabbed) saying, &#8220;O &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar! Go to the mother of the believers Aisha and say, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab sends his greetings to you,&#8217; and request her to allow me to be buried with my companions.&#8221; (So, Ibn &#8216;Umar conveyed the message to &#8216;Aisha.) She said, &#8220;I had the idea of having this place for myself but today I prefer him (&#8216;Umar) to myself (and allow him to be buried there).&#8221; When &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar returned, &#8216;Umar asked him, &#8220;What (news) do you have?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O chief of the believers! She has allowed you (to be buried there).&#8221; On that &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Nothing was more important to me than to be buried in that (sacred) place. So, when I expire, carry me there and pay my greetings to her (&#8216;Aisha ) and say, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks permission; and if she gives permission, then bury me (there) and if she does not, then take me to the grave-yard of the Muslims. I do not think any person has more right for the caliphate than those with whom Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) was always pleased till his death. And whoever is chosen by the people after me will be the caliph, and you people must listen to him and obey him,&#8221; and then he mentioned the name of &#8216;Uthman, &#8216;Ali, Talha, Az-Zubair, &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin &#8216;Auf and Sad bin Abi Waqqas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this time a young man from Ansar came and said, &#8220;O chief of the believers! Be happy with Allah&#8217;s glad tidings. The grade which you have in Islam is known to you, then you became the caliph and you ruled with justice and then you have been awarded martyrdom after all this.&#8221; &#8216;Umar replied, &#8220;O son of my brother! Would that all that privileges will counterbalance (my short comings), so that I neither lose nor gain anything. I recommend my successor to be good to the early emigrants and realize their rights and to protect their honor and sacred things. And I also recommend him to be good to the Ansar who before them, had homes (in Medina) and had adopted the Faith. He should accept the good of the righteous among them and should excuse their wrongdoers. I recommend him to abide by the rules and regulations concerning the Dhimmis (protectees) of Allah and His Apostle, to fulfill their contracts completely and fight for them and not to tax (overburden) them beyond their capabilities.&#8221;</p>

(What he needs greatly) The Prophet said: (In order to enter Paradise) you should worship Allah and do not ascribe any partners to Him, offer prayer perfectly, pay the Zakat and keep good relations with your Kith and kin.&#8221; (See Hadith No. 12, Vol 8).</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 480:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Bedouin came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;Tell me of such a deed as will make me enter Paradise, if I do it.&#8221; The Prophet (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;Worship Allah, and worship none along with Him, offer the (five) prescribed compulsory prayers perfectly, pay the compulsory Zakat, and fast the month of Ramadan.&#8221; The Bedouin said, &#8220;By Him, in Whose Hands my life is, I will not do more than this.&#8221; When he (the Bedouin) left, the Prophet said, &#8220;Whoever likes to see a man of Paradise, then he may look at this man.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 481:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Zur&#8217;a:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">from the Prophet the same as above.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 482:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A delegation of the tribe of &#8216;Abdul Qais came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We are from the tribe of Rabi&#8217;a, and the infidels of the tribe of Mudar stands between us and you; so we cannot come to you except during the Sacred Months. Please order us to do something (religious deeds) which we may carry out and also invite to it our people whom we have left behind.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I order you to do four things and forbid you four others: (I order you) to have faith in Allah, and confess that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah, (and the Prophet gestured with his hand like this (i.e. one knot) and to offer prayers perfectly and to pay the Zakat, and to pay one-fifth of the booty in Allah&#8217;s Cause. And I forbid you to use Dubba&#8217;, Hantam, Naqir and Muzaffat (all these are the names of utensils used for preparing alcoholic drinks).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 23, Number 483:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah&#8217;s Apostle died and Abu Bakr became the caliph some Arabs renegade (reverted to disbelief) (Abu Bakr decided to declare war against them), &#8216;Umar, said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;How can you fight with these people although Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;I have been ordered (by Allah) to fight the people till they say: &#8220;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and whoever said it then he will save his life and property from me except on trespassing the law (rights and conditions for which he will be punished justly), and his accounts will be with Allah.&#8217; &#8221; Abu Bakr said, &#8220;By Allah! I will fight those who differentiate between the prayer and the Zakat as Zakat is the compulsory right to be taken from the property (according to Allah&#8217;s orders) By Allah! If they refuse to pay me even a she-kid which they used to pay at the time of Allah&#8217;s Apostle . I would fight with them for withholding it&#8221; Then &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;By Allah, it was nothing, but Allah opened Abu Bakr&#8217;s chest towards the decision (to fight) and I came to know that his decision was right.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Said Al-Khudri:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;When the believers pass safely over (the bridge across) Hell, they will be stopped at a bridge in between Hell and Paradise where they will retaliate upon each other for the injustices done among them in the world, and when they get purified of all their sins, they will be admitted into Paradise. By Him in Whose Hands the life of Muhammad is everybody will recognize his dwelling in Paradise better than he recognizes his dwelling in this world.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 621:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Safwan bin Muhriz Almazini:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was walking with Ibn &#8216;Umar holding his hand, a man came in front of us and asked, &#8220;What have you heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle about An-Najwa?&#8221; Ibn &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Allah will bring a believer near Him and shelter him with His Screen and ask him: Did you commit such-and-such sins? He will say: Yes, my Lord. Allah will keep on asking him till he will confess all his sins and will think that he is ruined. Allah will say: &#8216;I did screen your sins in the world and I forgive them for you today&#8217;, and then he will be given the book of his good deeds. Regarding infidels and hypocrites (their evil acts will be exposed publicly) and the witnesses will say: These are the people who lied against their Lord. Behold! The Curse of Allah is upon the wrongdoers.&#8221; (11.18)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 622:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;A Muslim is a brother of another Muslim, so he should not oppress him, nor should he hand him over to an oppressor. Whoever fulfilled the needs of his brother, Allah will fulfill his needs; whoever brought his (Muslim) brother out of a discomfort, Allah will bring him out of the discomforts of the Day of Resurrection, and whoever screened a Muslim, Allah will screen him on the Day of Resurrection . &#8220;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 623:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Help your brother, whether he is an oppressor or he is an oppressed one. People asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! It is all right to help him if he is oppressed, but how should we help him if he is an oppressor?&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;By preventing him from oppressing others.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 625:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Muawiya bin Suwald:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib saying, &#8220;The Prophet orders us to do seven things and prohibited us from doing seven other things.&#8221; Then Al-Bara&#8217; mentioned the following:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) To pay a visit to the sick (inquiring about his health),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) to follow funeral processions,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) to say to a sneezer, &#8220;May Allah be merciful to you&#8221; (if he says, &#8220;Praise be to Allah!&#8221;),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) to return greetings,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) to help the oppressed,</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Musa:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever has oppressed another person concerning his reputation or anything else, he should beg him to forgive him before the Day of Resurrection when there will be no money (to compensate for wrong deeds), but if he has good deeds, those good deeds will be taken from him according to his oppression which he has done, and if he has no good deeds, the sins of the oppressed person will be loaded on him.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 630:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the explanation of the following verse:&#8211; &#8220;If a wife fears Cruelty or desertion On her husband&#8217;s part.&#8221; (4.128) A man may dislike his wife and intend to divorce her, so she says to him, &#8220;I give up my rights, so do not divorce me.&#8221; The above verse was revealed concerning such a case.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sahl bin Sad As-Sa&#8217;idi:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A drink (milk mixed with water) was brought to Allah&#8217;s Apostle who drank some of it. A boy was sitting to his right, and some old men to his left. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said to the boy, &#8220;Do you allow me to give the rest of the drink to these people?&#8221; The boy said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I will not give preference to anyone over me to drink the rest of it from which you have drunk.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then handed the bowl (of drink) to the boy. (See Hadith No. 541).</p>

Avoid taking the land unjustly, for the Prophet said, &#8216;Whoever usurps even one span of the land of somebody, his neck will be encircled with it down the seven earths.&#8221;</p>

Abu Shu&#8217;aib said to him, &#8220;Prepare a meal sufficient for five persons so that I might invite the Prophet besides other four persons.&#8221; Abu Shu&#8217;aib had seen the signs of hunger on the face of the Prophet and so he invited him. Another man who was not invited, followed the Prophet. The Prophet said to Abu Shu&#8217;aib, &#8220;This man has followed us. Do you allow him to share the meal?&#8221; Abu Shu&#8217;aib said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(the wife of the Prophet) Allah&#8217;s Apostle heard some people quarreling at the door of his dwelling. He came out and said, &#8220;I am only a human being, and opponents come to me (to settle their problems); maybe someone amongst you can present his case more eloquently than the other, whereby I may consider him true and give a verdict in his favor. So, If I give the right of a Muslim to another by mistake, then it is really a portion of (Hell) Fire, he has the option to take or give up (before the Day of Resurrection).&#8221;</p>

Allah thanked him for that deed and forgave him. The people said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Is there a reward for us in serving the animals?&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Yes, there is a reward for serving any animate (living being).&#8221; (See Hadith No. 551)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Prophet stood at the top of one of the castles (or higher buildings) of Medina and said, &#8220;Do you see what I see? No doubt I am seeing the spots of afflictions amongst your houses as numerous as the spots where rain-drops fall (during a heavy rain). (See Hadith No. 102)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 3, Book 43, Number 648:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I had been eager to ask &#8216;Umar about the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet regarding whom Allah said (in the Qur&#8217;an saying): If you two (wives of the Prophet namely Aisha and Hafsa) turn in repentance to Allah your hearts are indeed so inclined (to oppose what the Prophet likes) (66.4), till performed the Hajj along with &#8216;Umar (and on our way back from Hajj) he went aside (to answer the call of nature) and I also went aside along with him carrying a tumbler of water. When he had answered the call of nature and returned. I poured water on his hands from the tumbler and he performed ablution. I said, &#8220;O Chief of the believers! &#8216; Who were the two ladies from among the wives of the Prophet to whom Allah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;If you two return in repentance (66.4)? He said, &#8220;I am astonished at your question, O Ibn &#8216;Abbas. They were Aisha and Hafsa.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then &#8216;Umar went on relating the narration and said. &#8220;I and an Ansari neighbor of mine from Bani Umaiya bin Zaid who used to live in &#8216;Awali Al-Medina, used to visit the Prophet in turns. He used to go one day, and I another day. When I went I would bring him the news of what had happened that day regarding the instructions and orders and when he went, he used to do the same for me. We, the people of Quraish, used to have authority over women, but when we came to live with the Ansar, we noticed that the Ansari women had the upper hand over their men, so our women started acquiring the habits of the Ansari women. Once I shouted at my wife and she paid me back in my coin and I disliked that she should answer me back. She said, &#8216;Why do you take it ill that I retort upon you? By Allah, the wives of the Prophet retort upon him, and some of them may not speak with him for the whole day till night.&#8217; What she said scared me and I said to her, &#8216;Whoever amongst them does so, will be a great loser.&#8217; Then I dressed myself and went to Hafsa and asked her, &#8216;Does any of you keep Allah&#8217;s Apostle angry all the day long till night?&#8217; She replied in the affirmative. I said, &#8216;She is a ruined losing person (and will never have success)! Doesn&#8217;t she fear that Allah may get angry for the anger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and thus she will be ruined? Don&#8217;t ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle too many things, and don&#8217;t retort upon him in any case, and don&#8217;t desert him. Demand from me whatever you like, and don&#8217;t be tempted to imitate your neighbor (i.e. &#8216;Aisha) in her behavior towards the Prophet), for she (i.e. Aisha) is more beautiful than you, and more beloved to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In those days it was rumored that Ghassan, (a tribe living in Sham) was getting prepared their horses to invade us. My companion went (to the Prophet on the day of his turn, went and returned to us at night and knocked at my door violently, asking whether I was sleeping. I was scared (by the hard knocking) and came out to him. He said that a great thing had happened. I asked him: What is it? Have Ghassan come? He replied that it was worse and more serious than that, and added that Allah&#8217;s Apostle had divorced all his wives. I said, Hafsa is a ruined loser! I expected that would happen some day.&#8217; So I dressed myself and offered the Fajr prayer with the Prophet. Then the Prophet entered an upper room and stayed there alone. I went to Hafsa and found her weeping. I asked her, &#8216;Why are you weeping? Didn&#8217;t I warn you? Have Allah&#8217;s Apostle divorced you all?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know. He is there in the upper room.&#8217; I then went out and came to the pulpit and found a group of people around it and some of them were weeping. Then I sat with them for some time, but could not endure the situation. So I went to the upper room where the Prophet was and requested to a black slave of his: &#8220;Will you get the permission of (Allah&#8217;s Apostle) for Umar (to enter)? The slave went in, talked to the Prophet about it and came out saying, &#8216;I mentioned you to him but he did not reply.&#8217; So, I went and sat with the people who were sitting by the pulpit, but I could not bear the situation, so I went to the slave again and said: &#8220;Will you get he permission for Umar? He went in and brought the same reply as before. When I was leaving, behold, the slave called me saying, &#8220;Allah&#8217;s Apostle has granted you permission.&#8221; So, I entered upon the Prophet and saw him lying on a mat without wedding on it, and the mat had left its mark on the body of the Prophet, and he was leaning on a leather pillow stuffed with palm fires. I greeted him and while still standing, I said: &#8220;Have you divorced your wives?&#8217; He raised his eyes to me and replied in the negative. And then while still standing, I said chatting: &#8220;Will you heed what I say, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! We, the people of Quraish used to have the upper hand over our women (wives), and when we came to the people whose women had the upper hand over them&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar told the whole story (about his wife). &#8220;On that the Prophet smiled.&#8221; &#8216;Umar further said, &#8220;I then said, &#8216;I went to Hafsa and said to her: Do not be tempted to imitate your companion (&#8216;Aisha) for she is more beautiful than you and more beloved to the Prophet.&#8217; The Prophet smiled again. When I saw him smiling, I sat down and cast a glance at the room, and by Allah, I couldn&#8217;t see anything of importance but three hides. I said (to Allah&#8217;s Apostle) &#8220;Invoke Allah to make your followers prosperous for the Persians and the Byzantines have been made prosperous and given worldly luxuries, though they do not worship Allah?&#8217; The Prophet was leaning then (and on hearing my speech he sat straight) and said, &#8216;O Ibn Al-Khatttab! Do you have any doubt (that the Hereafter is better than this world)? These people have been given rewards of their good deeds in this world only.&#8217; I asked the Prophet . &#8216;Please ask Allah&#8217;s forgiveness for me. The Prophet did not go to his wives because of the secret which Hafsa had disclosed to &#8216;Aisha, and he said that he would not go to his wives for one month as he was angry with them when Allah admonished him (for his oath that he would not approach Maria). When twenty-nine days had passed, the Prophet went to Aisha first of all. She said to him, &#8216;You took an oath that you would not come to us for one month, and today only twenty-nine days have passed, as I have been counting them day by day.&#8217; The Prophet said, &#8216;The month is also of twenty-nine days.&#8217; That month consisted of twenty-nine days. &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;When the Divine revelation of Choice was revealed, the Prophet started with me, saying to me, &#8216;I am telling you something, but you needn&#8217;t hurry to give the reply till you can consult your parents.&#8221; &#8216;Aisha knew that her parents would not advise her to part with the Prophet . The Prophet said that Allah had said:&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;O Prophet! Say To your wives; If you desire The life of this world And its glitter, &#8230; then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free In a handsome manner. But if you seek Allah And His Apostle, and The Home of the Hereafter, then Verily, Allah has prepared For the good-doers amongst you A great reward.&#8217; (33.28) &#8216;Aisha said, &#8216;Am I to consult my parents about this? I indeed prefer Allah, His Apostle, and the Home of the Hereafter.&#8217; After that the Prophet gave the choice to his other wives and they also gave the same reply as &#8216;Aisha did.&#8221;</p>

<h3 align="center">Prayer at Night (Tahajjud)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="002.021.221"></a>Volume 2, Book 21, Number 221:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet got up at night to offer the Tahajjud prayer, he used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allahumma lakal-hamd. Anta qaiyimus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Walakal-hamd, Laka mulkus-samawati wal-ard wa man fihinna. Walakal-hamd, anta nurus-samawati wal-ard. Walakalhamd, anta-l-haq wa wa&#8217;duka-l-haq, wa liqa&#8217;uka Haq, wa qualuka Haq, wal-jannatu Haq wan-naru Haq wannabiyuna Haq. Wa Muhammadun, sallal-lahu&#8217;alaihi wasallam, Haq, was-sa&#8217;atu Haq. Allahumma aslamtu Laka wabika amantu, wa &#8216;Alaika tawakkaltu, wa ilaika anabtu wa bika khasamtu, wa ilaika hakamtu faghfir li ma qaddamtu wama akh-khartu wama as-rartu wama&#8217;a lantu, anta-l-muqaddim wa anta-l-mu akh-khir, la ilaha illa anta (or la ilaha ghairuka).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(O Allah! All the praises are for you, You are the Holder of the Heavens and the Earth, And whatever is in them. All the praises are for You; You have the possession of the Heavens and the Earth And whatever is in them. All the praises are for You; You are the Light of the Heavens and the Earth And all the praises are for You; You are the King of the Heavens and the Earth; And all the praises are for You; You are the Truth and Your Promise is the truth, And to meet You is true, Your Word is the truth And Paradise is true And Hell is true And all the Prophets (Peace be upon them) are true; And Muhammad is true, And the Day of Resurrection is true. O Allah ! I surrender (my will) to You; I believe in You and depend on You. And repent to You, And with Your help I argue (with my opponents, the non-believers) And I take You as a judge (to judge between us). Please forgive me my previous And future sins; And whatever I concealed or revealed And You are the One who make (some people) forward And (some) backward. There is none to be worshipped but you . Sufyan said that &#8216;Abdul Karim Abu Umaiya added to the above, &#8216;Wala haula Wala quwata illa billah&#8217; (There is neither might nor power except with Allah).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 222:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Salim&#8217;s father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the life-time of the Prophet whosoever saw a dream would narrate it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. I had a wish of seeing a dream to narrate it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) I was a grown up boy and used to sleep in the Mosque in the life-time of the Prophet. I saw in the dream that two angels caught hold of me and took me to the Fire which was built all round like a built well and had two poles in it and the people in it were known to me. I started saying, &#8220;I seek refuge with Allah from the Fire.&#8221; Then I met another angel who told me not to be afraid. I narrated the dream to Hafsa who told it to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. The Prophet said, &#8220;Abdullah is a good man. I wish he prayed Tahajjud.&#8221; After that &#8216;Abdullah (i.e. Salim&#8217;s father) used to sleep but a little at night.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 223:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to offer eleven Rakat and that was his prayer. He used to prolong the prostration to such an extent that one could recite fifty verses (of the Quran) before he would lift his head. He used to pray two Rakat (Sunna) before the Fajr prayer and then used to lie down on his right side till the call-maker came and informed him about the prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 224:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet became sick and did not get up (for Tahajjud prayer) for a night or two.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 225:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jundab bin &#8216;Abdullah :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Gabriel did not come to the Prophet (for some time) and so one of the Quraish women said, &#8220;His Satan has deserted him.&#8221; So came the Divine Revelation: &#8220;By the forenoon And by the night When it is still! Your Lord (O Muhammad) has neither Forsaken you Nor hated you.&#8221; (93.1-3)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 226:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Um Salama:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night the Prophet got up and said, &#8220;Subhan Allah! How many afflictions Allah has revealed tonight and how many treasures have been sent down (disclosed). Go and wake the sleeping lady occupants of these dwellings up (for prayers), perhaps a well-dressed in this world may be naked in the Hereafter.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 227:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Ali bin Abi Talib</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night Allah&#8217;s Apostle came to me and Fatima, the daughter of the Prophet and asked, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you pray (at night)?&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Our souls are in the hands of Allah and if He wants us to get up He will make us get up.&#8221; When I said that, he left us without saying anything and I heard that he was hitting his thigh and saying, &#8220;But man is more quarrelsome than anything.&#8221; (18.54)</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 228:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to give up a good deed, although he loved to do it, for fear that people might act on it and it might be made compulsory for them. The Prophet never prayed the Duha prayer, but I offer it.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 229:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha, the mother of the faithful believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night Allah&#8217;s Apostle offered the prayer in the Mosque and the people followed him. The next night he also offered the prayer and too many people gathered. On the third and the fourth nights more people gathered, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not come out to them. In the morning he said, &#8220;I saw what you were doing and nothing but the fear that it (i.e. the prayer) might be enjoined on you, stopped me from coming to you.&#8221; And that happened in the month of Ramadan.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 230:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Mughira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to stand (in the prayer) or pray till both his feet or legs swelled. He was asked why (he offered such an unbearable prayer) and he said, &#8220;should I not be a thankful slave.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 231:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr bin Al-&#8216;As:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle told me, &#8220;The most beloved prayer to Allah is that of David and the most beloved fasts to Allah are those of David. He used to sleep for half of the night and then pray for one third of the night and again sleep for its sixth part and used to fast on alternate days.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 232:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Masruq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked &#8216;Aisha which deed was most loved by the Prophet. She said, &#8220;A deed done continuously.&#8221; I further asked, &#8220;When did he used to get up (in the night for the prayer).&#8221; She said, &#8220;He used to get up on hearing the crowing of a cock.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 233:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Ashath:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 234:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In my house he (Prophet (p.b.u.h) ) never passed the last hours of the night but sleeping.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 235:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Qatada:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas bin Malik said, &#8220;The Prophet (p.b.u.h) and Zaid bin Thabit took their Suhur together. When they finished it, the Prophet stood for the (Fajr) prayer and offered it.&#8221; We asked Anas, &#8220;What was the interval between their finishing the Suhur and the starting of the morning prayer?&#8221; Anas replied, &#8220;It was equal to the time taken by a person in reciting fifty verses of the Quran.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 236:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu-Wa il:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullah said, &#8220;One night I offered the Tahajjud prayer with the Prophet and he kept on standing till an ill-thought came to me.&#8221; We said, &#8220;What was the ill-thought?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It was to sit down and leave the Prophet (standing).&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 237:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Hudhaifa :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever the Prophet got up for Tahajjud prayer he used to clean his mouth (and teeth) with Siwak.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 238:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Umar :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! How is the prayer of the night?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Two Rakat followed by two Rakat and so on, and when you apprehend the approaching dawn, offer one Raka as Witr.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 239:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prayer of the Prophet used to be of thirteen Rakat, i.e. of the night prayer.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 240:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Masruq:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Aisha about the night prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and she said, &#8220;It was seven, nine or eleven Rakat besides the two Rakat of the Fajr prayer (i.e. Sunna). &#8220;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 241:</p>

<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 242:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes Allah&#8217;s Apostle would not fast (for so many days) that we thought that he would not fast that month and he sometimes used to fast (for so many days) that we thought he would not leave fasting through-out that month and (as regards his prayer and sleep at night), if you wanted to see him praying at night, you could see him praying and if you wanted to see him sleeping, you could see him sleeping.</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 243:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Satan puts three knots at the back of the head of any of you if he is asleep. On every knot he reads and exhales the following words, &#8216;The night is long, so stay asleep.&#8217; When one wakes up and remembers Allah, one knot is undone; and when one performs ablution, the second knot is undone, and when one prays the third knot is undone and one gets up energetic with a good heart in the morning; otherwise one gets up lazy and with a mischievous heart.&#8221;</p>
<hr>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Volume 2, Book 21, Number 244:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Samura bin Jundab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said in his narration of a dream that he saw, &#8220;He whose head was being crushed with a stone was one who learnt the Quran but never acted on it, and slept ignoring the compulsory prayers.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:justify;">that he remembered Allah&#8217;s Apostle and he also remembered a mouthful of water which he had thrown on his face, after taking it from a well that was in their house. Mahmud said that he had heard Itban bin Malik, who was present with Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the battle of Badr saying, &#8220;I used to lead my people at Bani Salim in the prayer and there was a valley between me and those people. Whenever it rained it used to be difficult for me to cross it to go to their mosque. So I went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;I have weak eye-sight and the valley between me and my people flows during the rainy season and it becomes difficult for me to cross it; I wish you would come to my house and pray at a place so that I could take that place as a praying place.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;I will do so.&#8217; So Allah&#8217;s Apostle and Abu Bakr came to my house in the (next) morning after the sun had risen high. Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked my permission to let him in and I admitted him. He did not sit before saying, &#8216;Where do you want us to offer the prayer in your house?&#8217; I pointed to the place where I wanted him to pray. So Allah&#8217;s Apostle stood up for the prayer and started the prayer with Takbir and we aligned in rows behind him; and he offered two Rakat, and finished them with Taslim, and we also performed Taslim with him. I detained him for a meal called &#8220;Khazir&#8221; which I had prepared for him.&#8211;(&#8220;Khazir&#8221; is a special type of dish prepared from barley flour and meat soup)&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the neighbors got the news that Allah&#8217;s Apostle was in my house, they poured it till there were a great number of men in the house. One of them said, &#8216;What is wrong with Malik, for I do not see him?&#8217; One of them replied, &#8216;He is a hypocrite and does not love Allah and His Apostle.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t say this. Haven&#8217;t you seen that he said, &#8216;None has the right to be worshipped but Allah for Allah&#8217;s sake only.&#8217; The man replied, &#8216;Allah and His Apostle know better; but by Allah, we never saw him but helping and talking with the hypocrites.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle replied, &#8216;No doubt, whoever says. None has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and by that he wants the pleasures of Allah, then Allah will save him from Hell.&#8221; Mahmud added, &#8220;I told the above narration to some people, one of whom was Ab-u Aiyub, the companion of Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the battle in which he (Ab-u Aiyub) died and Yazid bin Mu&#8217;aw7ya was their leader in Roman Territory. Abu Aiyub denounced the narration and said, &#8216;I doubt that Allah&#8217;s Apostle ever said what you have said.&#8217; I felt that too much, and I vowed to Allah that if I remained alive in that holy battle, I would (go to Medina and) ask Itban bin Malik if he was still living in the mosque of his people. So when he returned, I assumed Ihram for Hajj or &#8216;Umra and then I proceeded on till I reached Medina. I went to Bani Salim and Itban bin Malik, who was by then an old blind man, was leading his people in the prayer. When he finished the prayer, I greeted him and introduced myself to him and then asked him about that narration. He told that narration again in the same manner as he had narrated it the first time.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;(On the Day of Resurrection) camels  will come to their owner in the best state of health they have ever had (in the world),  and if he had not paid their Zakat (in the world) then they would tread him with their  feet; and similarly, sheep will come to their owner in the best state of health they have  ever had in the world, and if he had not paid their Zakat, then they would tread him with  their hooves and would butt him with their horns.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;One of  their rights is that they should be milked while water is kept in front of them.&#8221; The  Prophet added, &#8220;I do not want anyone of you to come to me on the Day of Resurrection,  carrying over his neck a sheep that will be bleating. Such a person will (then) say, &#8216;O  Muhammad! (please intercede for me,) I will say to him. &#8216;I can&#8217;t help you, for I conveyed  Allah&#8217;s Message to you.&#8217; Similarly, I do not want anyone of you to come to me carrying  over his neck a camel that will be grunting. Such a person (then) will say &#8220;O  Muhammad! (please intercede for me).&#8221; I will say to him, &#8220;I can&#8217;t help you for I  conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Whoever is made wealthy by  Allah and does not pay the Zakat of his wealth, then on the Day of Resurrection his wealth  will be made like a bald-headed poisonous male snake with two black spots over the eyes.  The snake will encircle his neck and bite his cheeks and say, &#8216;I am your wealth, I am your  treasure.&#8217; &#8221; Then the Prophet recited the holy verses:&#8211; &#8216;Let not those who withhold  . . .&#8217; (to the end of the verse).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) said, &#8220;No Zakat is due on  property mounting to less than five Uqiyas (of silver), and no Zakat is due on less than  five camels, and there is no Zakat on less than five Wasqs.&#8221; (A Wasqs equals 60 Sa&#8217;s)  &amp; (1 Sa=3 K gms App.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 488: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Zaid bin Wahab: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I passed by a place called Ar-Rabadha and by chance I met  Abu Dhar and asked him, &#8220;What has brought you to this place?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I  was in Sham and differed with Muawiya on the meaning of (the following verses of the  Quran): &#8216;They who hoard up gold and silver and spend them not in the way of Allah.&#8217;  (9.34). Muawiya said, &#8216;This verse is revealed regarding the people of the  scriptures.&#8221; I said, It was revealed regarding us and also the people of the  scriptures.&#8221; So we had a quarrel and Mu&#8217;awiya sent a complaint against me to &#8216;Uthman.  &#8216;Uthman wrote to me to come to Medina, and I came to Medina. Many people came to me as if  they had not seen me before. So I told this to &#8216;Uthman who said to me, &#8220;You may  depart and live nearby if you wish.&#8221; That was the reason for my being here for even  if an Ethiopian had been nominated as my ruler, I would have obeyed him . </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 2, Book 24, Number 489: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Ahnaf bin Qais: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was sitting with some people from Quraish, a man  with very rough hair, clothes, and appearance came and stood in front of us, greeted us  and said, &#8220;Inform those who hoard wealth, that a stone will be heated in the  Hell-fire and will be put on the nipples of their breasts till it comes out from the bones  of their shoulders and then put on the bones of their shoulders till it comes through the  nipples of their breasts the stone will be moving and hitting.&#8221; After saying that,  the person retreated and sat by the side of the pillar, I followed him and sat beside him,  and I did not know who he was. I said to him, &#8220;I think the people disliked what you  had said.&#8221; He said, &#8220;These people do not understand anything, although my friend  told me.&#8221; I asked, &#8220;Who is your friend?&#8221; He said, &#8220;The Prophet said  (to me), &#8216;O Abu Dhar! Do you see the mountain of Uhud?&#8217; And on that I (Abu Dhar) started  looking towards the sun to judge how much remained of the day as I thought that Allah&#8217;s  Apostle wanted to send me to do something for him and I said, &#8216;Yes!&#8217; He said, &#8216;I do not  love to have gold equal to the mountain of Uhud unless I spend it all (in Allah&#8217;s cause)  except three Dinars (pounds). These people do not understand and collect worldly wealth.  No, by Allah, Neither I ask them for worldly benefits nor am I in need of their religious  advice till I meet Allah, The Honorable, The Majestic.&#8221; &#8216; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was sitting with Allah&#8217;s Apostle (p.b.u.h) two  person came to him; one of them complained about his poverty and the other complained  about the prevalence of robberies. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;As regards stealing and  robberies, there will shortly come a time when a caravan will go to Mecca (from Medina)  without any guard. And regarding poverty, The Hour (Day of Judgment) will not be  established till one of you wanders about with his object of charity and will not find  anybody to accept it And (no doubt) each one of you will stand in front of Allah and there  will be neither a curtain nor an interpreter between him and Allah, and Allah will ask  him, &#8216;Did not I give you wealth?&#8217; He will reply in the affirmative. Allah will further  ask, &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I send a messenger to you?&#8217; And again that person will reply in the  affirmative Then he will look to his right and he will see nothing but Hell-fire, and then  he will look to his left and will see nothing but Hell-fire. And so, any (each one) of you  should save himself from the fire even by giving half of a date-fruit (in charity). And if  you do not find a half date-fruit, then (you can do it through saying) a good pleasant  word (to your brethren). (See Hadith No. 793 Vol. 4). </font></p>

Which charity is the most superior in reward?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;The charity  which you practice while you are healthy, niggardly and afraid of poverty and wish to  become wealthy. Do not delay it to the time of approaching death and then say, &#8216;Give so  much to such and such, and so much to such and such.&#8217; And it has already belonged to such  and such (as it is too late).&#8221; </font></p>

(When Zainab bint Jahsh died first of  all in the caliphate of &#8216;Umar), we came to know that the long hand was a symbol of  practicing charity, so she was the first to follow the Prophet and she used to love to  practice charity.

He said, &#8220;O Allah! All the praises are for you. (I had  given alms) to a thief, to an adulteress and to a wealthy man.&#8221; Then someone came and  said to him, &#8220;The alms which you gave to the thief, might make him abstain from  stealing, and that given to the adulteress might make her abstain from illegal sexual  intercourse (adultery), and that given to the wealthy man might make him take a lesson  from it and spend his wealth which Allah has given him, in Allah&#8217;s cause.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Every day two angels come down from  Heaven and one of them says, &#8216;O Allah! Compensate every person who spends in Your Cause,&#8217;  and the other (angel) says, &#8216;O Allah! Destroy every miser.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The example of a miser and an  alms-giver is like the example of two persons wearing iron cloaks.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle  also said, &#8220;The example of an alms-giver and a miser is like the example of two  persons who have two iron cloaks on them from their breasts to their collar bones, and  when the alms-giver wants to give in charity, the cloak becomes capacious till it covers  his whole body to such an extent that it hides his fingertips and covers his footprints  (obliterates his tracks). (1) And when the miser wants to spend, it (the iron cloak)  sticks and every ring gets stuck to its place and he tries to widen it, but it did not  become wide. </font></p>

If someone has nothing to give, what will he do?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He should  work with his hands and benefit himself and also give in charity (from what he  earns).&#8221; The people further asked, &#8220;If he cannot find even that?&#8221; He  replied, &#8220;He should help the needy who appeal for help.&#8221; Then the people asked,  &#8220;If he cannot do that?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Then he should perform good deeds and  keep away from evil deeds and this will be regarded as charitable deeds.&#8221; </font></p>

(He wrote that) it could be accepted from him as Zakat, and the collector of  Zakat would return him 20 Dirhams or two sheep; and if the Zakat payer had not a Bint  Makhad, but he had Ibn Labun (a two year old he-camel) then it could be accepted as his  Zakat, but he would not be paid anything . </font></p>

(The sub-narrator Aiyub pointed towards his ears and  neck meaning that they gave ornaments from those places such as ear-rings and necklaces.) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Abu Bakr; sent me to (collect the Zakat from) Bahrein,  he wrote to me the following:&#8211; (In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful).  These are the orders for compulsory charity (Zakat) which Allah&#8217;s Apostle had made  obligatory for every Muslim, and which Allah had ordered His Apostle to observe: Whoever  amongst the Muslims is asked to pay Zakat accordingly, he should pay it (to the Zakat  collector) and whoever is asked more than that (what is specified in this script) he  should not pay it; for twenty-four camels or less, sheep are to be paid as Zakat; for  every five camels one sheep is to be paid, and if there are between twenty-five to  thirty-five camels, one Bint Makhad is to be paid; and if they are between thirty-six to  forty-five (camels), one Bint Labun is to be paid; and if they are between forty-six to  sixty (camels), one Hiqqa is to be paid; and if the number is between sixty-one to  seventy-five (camels), one Jadh&#8217;a is to be paid; and if the number is between seventy-six  to ninety (camels), two Bint Labuns are to be paid; and if they are from ninety-one to  one-hundred-and twenty (camels), two Hiqqas are to be paid; and if they are over  one-hundred and-twenty (camels), for every forty (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Bint  Labun is to be paid, and for every fifty camels (over one-hundred-and-twenty) one Hiqqa is  to be paid; and who ever has got only four camels, has to pay nothing as Zakat, but if the  owner of these four camels wants to give something, he can. If the number of camels  increases to five, the owner has to pay one sheep as Zakat. As regards the Zakat for the  (flock) of sheep; if they are between forty and one-hundred-and-twenty sheep, one sheep is  to be paid; and if they are between one-hundred-and-twenty to two hundred (sheep), two  sheep are to be paid; and if they are between two-hundred to three-hundred (sheep), three  sheep are to be paid; and for over three-hundred sheep, for every extra hundred sheep, one  sheep is to be paid as Zakat. And if somebody has got less than forty sheep, no Zakat is  required, but if he wants to give, he can. For silver the Zakat is one-fortieth of the lot  (i.e. 2.5%), and if its value is less than two-hundred Dirhams, Zakat is not required, but  if the owner wants to pay he can.&#8217; </font></p>

Allah&#8217;s Apostle used to go there and used to drink its nice water.&#8221; Anas  added, &#8220;When these verses were revealed:&#8211;&#8216;By no means shall you Attain righteousness  unless You spend (in charity) of that Which you love. &#8216; (3.92) Abu Talha said to Allah&#8217;s  Apostle &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah, the Blessed, the Superior says: By no means shall you  attain righteousness, unless you spend (in charity) of that which you love. And no doubt,  Bairuha&#8217; garden is the most beloved of all my property to me. So I want to give it in  charity in Allah&#8217;s Cause. I expect its reward from Allah. O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Spend it  where Allah makes you think it feasible.&#8217; On that Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Bravo! It is  useful property. I have heard what you have said (O Abu Talha), and I think it would be  proper if you gave it to your Kith and kin.&#8217; Abu Talha said, I will do so, O Allah&#8217;s  Apostle.&#8217; Then Abu Talha distributed that garden amongst his relatives and his  cousins.&#8221; </font></p>

After finishing the prayer, he delivered the sermon and ordered  the people to give alms. He said, &#8220;O people! Give alms.&#8221; Then he went towards  the women and said. &#8220;O women! Give alms, for I have seen that the majority of the  dwellers of Hell-Fire were you (women).&#8221; The women asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  What is the reason for it?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;O women! You curse frequently, and are  ungrateful to your husbands. I have not seen anyone more deficient in intelligence and  religion than you. O women, some of you can lead a cautious wise man astray.&#8221; Then he  left. And when he reached his house, Zainab, the wife of Ibn Masud, came and asked  permission to enter It was said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! It is Zainab.&#8221; He asked,  &#8216;Which Zainab?&#8221; The reply was that she was the wife of Ibn Mas&#8217;ub. He said,  &#8220;Yes, allow her to enter.&#8221; And she was admitted. Then she said, &#8220;O Prophet  of Allah! Today you ordered people to give alms and I had an ornament and intended to give  it as alms, but Ibn Masud said that he and his children deserved it more than anybody  else.&#8221; The Prophet replied, &#8220;Ibn Masud had spoken the truth. Your husband and  your children had more right to it than anybody else.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once the Prophet sat on a pulpit and we sat around him.  Then he said, &#8220;The things I am afraid of most for your sake (concerning what will  befall you after me) is the pleasures and splendors of the world and its beauties which  will be disclosed to you.&#8221; Somebody said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Can the good bring  forth evil?&#8221; The Prophet remained silent for a while. It was said to that person,  &#8220;What is wrong with you? You are talking to the Prophet (p.b.u.h) while he is not  talking to you.&#8221; Then we noticed that he was being inspired divinely. Then the  Prophet wiped off his sweat and said, &#8220;Where is the questioner?&#8221; It seemed as if  the Prophet liked his question. Then he said, &#8220;Good never brings forth evil. Indeed  it is like what grows on the banks of a water-stream which either kill or make the animals  sick, except if an animal eats its fill the Khadira (a kind of vegetable) and then faces  the sun, and then defecates and urinates and grazes again. No doubt this wealth is sweet  and green. Blessed is the wealth of a Muslim from which he gives to the poor, the orphans  and to needy travelers. (Or the Prophet said something similar to it) No doubt, whoever  takes it illegally will be like the one who eats but is never satisfied, and his wealth  will be a witness against him on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

So she said to &#8216;Abdullah, &#8220;Will you ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle whether it  will be sufficient for me to spend part of the Zakat on you and the orphans who are under  my protection?&#8221; He replied &#8220;Will you yourself ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221;  (Zainab added): So I went to the Prophet and I saw there an Ansari woman who was standing  at the door (of the Prophet ) with a similar problem as mine. Bilal passed by us and we  asked him, &#8216;Ask the Prophet whether it is permissible for me to spend (the Zakat) on my  husband and the orphans under my protection.&#8217; And we requested Bilal not to inform the  Prophet about us. So Bilal went inside and asked the Prophet regarding our problem. The  Prophet (p.b.u.h) asked, &#8220;Who are those two?&#8221; Bilal replied that she was Zainab.  The Prophet said, &#8220;Which Zainab?&#8221; Bilal said, &#8220;The wife of &#8216;Adullah (bin  Masud).&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, (it is sufficient for her) and she will receive  a double rewards (for that): One for helping relatives, and the other for giving  Zakat.&#8221; </font></p>

But you are unfair in asking Zakat from Khalid as he is keeping  his armor for Allah&#8217;s Cause (for Jihad).

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Some Ansari persons asked for (something) from Allah&#8217;s  Apostle (p.b.u.h) and he gave them. They again asked him for (something) and he again gave  them. And then they asked him and he gave them again till all that was with him finished.  And then he said &#8220;If I had anything. I would not keep it away from you. (Remember)  Whoever abstains from asking others, Allah will make him contented, and whoever tries to  make himself self-sufficient, Allah will make him self-sufficient. And whoever remains  patient, Allah will make him patient. Nobody can be given a blessing better and greater  than patience.&#8221; </font></p>

Again I asked  and he gave (it to me). And then he said, &#8220;O Hakim! This property is like a sweet  fresh fruit; whoever takes it without greediness, he is blessed in it, and whoever takes  it with greediness, he is not blessed in it, and he is like a person who eats but is never  satisfied; and the upper (giving) hand is better than the lower (receiving) hand.&#8221;  Hakim added, &#8220;I said to Allah&#8217;s Apostle , &#8216;By Him (Allah) Who sent you with the  Truth, I shall never accept anything from anybody after you, till I leave this world.&#8217;  &#8221; Then Abu Bakr (during his caliphate) called Hakim to give him his share from the  war booty (like the other companions of the Prophet ), he refused to accept anything. Then  &#8216;Umar (during his caliphate) called him to give him his share but he refused. On that  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;O Muslims! I would like you to witness that I offered Hakim his share  from this booty and he refused to take it.&#8221; So Hakim never took anything from anybody  after the Prophet till he died. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We took part in the holy battle of Tabuk in the company of  the Prophet and when we arrived at the Wadi-al-Qura, there was a woman in her garden. The  Prophet asked his companions to estimate the amount of the fruits in the garden, and  Allah&#8217;s Apostle estimated it at ten Awsuq (One Wasaq = 60 Sa&#8217;s) and 1 Sa&#8217;= 3 kg.  approximately). The Prophet said to that lady, &#8220;Check what your garden will  yield.&#8221; When we reached Tabuk, the Prophet said, &#8220;There will be a strong wind  to-night and so no one should stand and whoever has a camel, should fasten it.&#8221; So we  fastened our camels. A strong wind blew at night and a man stood up and he was blown away  to a mountain called Taiy, The King of Aila sent a white mule and a sheet for wearing to  the Prophet as a present, and wrote to the Prophet that his people would stay in their  place (and will pay Jizya taxation.) (1) When the Prophet reached Wadi-al-Qura he asked  that woman how much her garden had yielded. She said, &#8220;Ten Awsuq,&#8221; and that was  what Allah&#8217;s Apostle had estimated. Then the Prophet said, &#8220;I want to reach Medina  quickly, and whoever among you wants to accompany me, should hurry up.&#8221; The  sub-narrator Ibn Bakkar said something which meant: When the Prophet (p.b.u.h) saw Medina  he said, &#8220;This is Taba.&#8221; And when he saw the mountain of Uhud, he said,  &#8220;This mountain loves us and we love it. Shall I tell you of the best amongst the  Ansar?&#8221; They replied in the affirmative. He said, &#8220;The family of Bani-n-Najjar,  and then the family of Bani Sa&#8217;ida or Bani Al-Harith bin Al-Khazraj. (The above-mentioned  are the best) but there is goodness in all the families of Ansar.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>took &#8216;Abdullah bin Abu Talha to Allah&#8217;s Apostle to perform  Tahnik for him. (Tahnik was a custom among the Muslims that whenever a child was born they  used to take it to the Prophet who would chew a piece of date and put a part of its juice  in the child&#8217;s mouth). I saw the Prophet and he had an instrument for branding in his  hands and was branding the camels of Zakat. </font></p>
