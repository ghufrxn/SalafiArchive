<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Explanation of Verse 5 of Sooratul Faatiha</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">ihdinā aṣ-Ṣirāṭ al-Mustaqīm</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Guide us to the straight path.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;the path&#8221; (aṣ-Ṣirāṭ):</strong></span> Regarding this word, there are two permissible recitations, one with the Arabic letter س (sīn) as in السِّرَاط and another with the letter ص (ṣād) as it is here in the verse: الصِّرَاط . The meaning of <em>aṣ-Ṣirāṭ</em> is the way or path. The meaning of &#8220;<strong>Guide us&#8221;</strong> refers to the guidance of showing and directing to the right path as well as the guidance of granting success. So, by reciting, <strong>&#8220;Guide us to the straight path&#8221;</strong>, you are asking Allah for <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> (which is the guidance of direction) and <strong>righteous action</strong> (which is the guidance of success in following the knowledge).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;straight&#8221; (al-Mustaqīm):</strong></span> This means the correct path with no crookedness or deviation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verse 5:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the benefits we gain from this verse is the concept of mankind’s resorting back to Allah. After requesting Allah’s help in fulfilling his worship in the previous verse, mankind now asks Allah to guide them to the straight path. There must be sincerity solely to Allah in worship as indicated by the verse, &#8220;<strong>You alone we worship</strong>&#8221; and help must be sought in fulfilling and strengthening this worship as indicated by the verse, &#8220;<strong>and from you alone we seek help</strong>&#8220;. Also, one must follow the Islamic legislation and this is indicated by the verse, &#8220;<strong>Guide us to the straight path</strong>&#8221; because the straight path is none other than the complete legislation with which the messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) has come with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Another point from this verse is that the eloquence of the Qur&#8217;an is shown in that there is no preposition after <strong>&#8220;Guide us&#8221;</strong> in the Arabic text.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">[TN: The author here refers to the original Arabic text. The verse would literally be translated as “Guide us the straight path” without the added English preposition “to.”]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This point is made so that the verse would contain both types of seeking guidance: the guidance of knowledge and direction, and the guidance of success and action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>This first type</strong></span> is only the directing to and showing the straight path, and Allah guides all of mankind with this meaning of guidance as in his statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">شَهْرُ رَمَضَانَ الَّذِي أُنْزِلَ فِيهِ الْقُرْآنُ هُدًى لِلنَّاسِ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The month of Ramadan in which the Qur&#8217;an was revealed (as) guidance for mankind</span>. [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The second type of guidance</span></strong> is the granting of success along with the first type of guidance and the following of the Islamic legislation as Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لا رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِلْمُتَّقِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">That is the book, wherein there is no doubt, a means of guidance for the <em>Muttaqīn</em> (those who are constantly and fearfully conscious of Allah)</span>. [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This second type of guidance may not be achieved by some people as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا ثَمُودُ فَهَدَيْنَاهُمْ فَاسْتَحَبُّوا الْعَمَى عَلَى الْهُدَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And as for (the people of) Thamūd, we guided them (i.e. showed them the right way), but they preferred blindness over guidance.</span> [Sūrah al-Fuṣṣilat, 41:17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here,<strong> &#8220;we guided them&#8221;</strong> means: We made clear to them the truth and directed them to follow it but they chose not to accept the guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Another benefit we get from this verse is that the “path” is of two types: one straight and all others crooked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever is in accordance with the truth, it is the straight path as Allah tells the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) to say:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنَّ هَذَا صِرَاطِي مُسْتَقِيمًا فَاتَّبِعُوهُ وَلا تَتَّبِعُوا السُّبُلَ فَتَفَرَّقَ بِكُمْ عَنْ سَبِيلِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And this is my straight path so follow it and do not follow (other) paths for they will separate you away from his (Allah’s) path</span>. [Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And anything that opposes the truth is a crooked path.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation of Verses 6 &amp; 7  of Sooratul Faatiha</span></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Ṣirāṭ al-ladhīna an’amta ‘alayhim</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The path of those you bestowed grace upon</span></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلا الضَّالِّينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">ghayri al-Maghḍūbi ‘alayhim wa lā aḍ-Ḍālīn</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Not of those who earned anger upon themselves, nor of those who are astray.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The path of those you bestowed grace upon&#8221; (Ṣirāṭ al-ladhīna An’amta ‘alayhim)</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is connected to the previous verse and provides further clarification of &#8220;the straight path&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;those you bestowed grace upon&#8221; (al-ladhīna an’amta ‘alayhim):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the same ones mentioned in the statement of Allah in another part of the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَالرَّسُولَ فَأُولَئِكَ مَعَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِمْ مِنَ النَّبِيِّينَ  وَالصِّدِّيقِينَ وَالشُّهَدَاءِ وَالصَّالِحِينَ وَحَسُنَ أُولَئِكَ رَفِيقًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever obeys Allah and the messenger, then they will be with those Allah bestowed grace upon of the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs, and the righteous. And what excellent companions they are!</span> [Sūrah an-Nisā, 4:69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Not of those who earned anger upon themselves&#8221; (ghayri al-Maghḍūbi ‘alayhim): </strong>Such as the followers of Judaism and anyone else who knows the truth yet refuses to act according to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;nor of those who are astray&#8221; (wa lā aḍ-Ḍālīn): </strong>Such as the Christians before the mission of the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) began. It also refers to anyone who works contrary to the truth, choosing to remain ignorant of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the word &#8220;upon them&#8221; (‘alayhim), it has two acceptable recitations from the seven forms: one is with a (ḍammah) on the letter هُ (hā) making the reading عَلَيْهُم (‘alayhum) and the other reading is the common one with a (kasrah) on the هِ (hā) which is read as عَلَيْهِم (‘alayhim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to know that any different form of recitation that is not within the copies of the Qur&#8217;an that most people have, this different recitation, even though it is permissible, should not be read among common people who may not be aware of the different ways of reciting. This is due to three reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Even the common people, although unaware of the different forms of recitation, consider this Qur&#8217;an to be something amazing and honorable. Their hearts are filled with its greatness and respect for it. If they began to hear it read sometimes one way and then other times a different way, then this may result in the Qur&#8217;an being lower with them from the high status it was once given. This is only because they are not aware of the various recitations and therefore cannot distinguish between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If someone recites with the different forms of recitation, he may be accused of making mistakes and not knowing how to recite. This is because he recites in a way that is unknown to most people. So, this reader, even though may be correct, is then spoken about in a negative way amongst the majority of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Even if a common person gives someone reciting in a different way the benefit of the doubt and believes that he knows what he recites, then such a person may begin to blindly follow the one reciting in the various ways of reading. So, perhaps he, the common person, may then mistakenly recite a way different from any of the permissible ways believing it to be one of the seven allowable recitations of the Qur&#8217;an. This would then be a form of distortion and corruption. For this reason, ‘Alī (رضي الله عنه), one of the prophet’s companions, said, “<strong>Speak to people according to what they know, (otherwise) would you like that they (unknowingly) deny what Allah and his messenger say (because you confuse them)?”</strong> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī as notes to another ḥadīth (no. 127)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Mas’ūd ( رضي الله عنه ), another companion of Prophet Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), said, “<strong>You will never speak to any people with something that they cannot comprehend except that it will become a Fitnah (negative trial or tribulation) for some of them</strong>.” [Recorded by Muslim (no. 14)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whenever ‘Umar Ibn al-Khaṭṭāb heard Hishām Ibn Ḥakīm recite a verse that he had never heard recited in that way before, he (‘Umar) dragged him to the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and informed him of this. The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said to Hishām:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اِقْرَأ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Recite</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he finished reading, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>هَكَذَا أُنْزِلَتْ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">It was revealed in this way.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) told ‘Umar to recite and afterwards again said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>هَكَذَا أُنْزِلَتْ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">It was (also) revealed in this way.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">[Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 4992) and Muslim (no. 818)]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an was revealed in seven different dialects and the people used to recite in all of them until ‘Uthmān gathered the people together upon one common recitation because they were beginning to differ and dispute over each other’s recitations. He feared that the differences would become severe, dividing the people. So, he gathered them all together upon one recitation which was the dialect of the Quraysh tribe because the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ), upon whom the Qur&#8217;an was revealed, was sent from and among them. The other forms of recitation were somewhat forgotten by most people. So, if ‘Umar ( رضي الله عنه ) did what he did to another companion, then what about an ordinary person who hears you recite in a way different from the familiar copy of the Qur&#8217;an he has?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And thanks to Allah, the scholars have always been in agreement that it is not compulsory for people to recite in all the different permissible ways. If a person remains reciting upon one particular recitation, there is no problem with this. So, avoid problems and what could lead to them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verses 6 and 7:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the benefits we gain from these two verses is the mentioning of specific descriptive details after a general description. This is from the verse, &#8220;<strong>Guide us to the straight path</strong>&#8221; – this is a general description and &#8220;<strong>The path of those you bestowed grace upon</strong>&#8221; is a more specific and detailed description of the path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The benefit in mentioning something general and then afterwards more relevant details is that when a person hears of something general that could benefit him, he might eagerly anticipate more details and a clearer explanation. Then, after becoming aware of the detailed descriptions, he is ready to accept them and anxiously hopes to obtain what is mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another benefit is the explanation that the people upon whom Allah has bestowed his favors and grace, they are the same ones who are upon the straight path as a result of this grace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Another point we learn from this verse is that the blessing of guidance, with which some people have been favored, is directly from Allah alone; it is a pure favor from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. From the verse, we understand that all of mankind is of either one of three categories: those upon whom Allah has bestowed his grace, those who have earned anger upon themselves, or those who are astray. Each of these categories has already been explained previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ways leading away from the straight path are either <strong>ignorance</strong> or <strong>arrogant disobedience</strong>.The ones who were taken away from the straight path due to arrogance and disobedience, they are those who earned anger upon themselves and the head of this group are the followers of Judaism. The other group, those who have deviated from the straight path due to ignorance, they are any people who do not know the truth, the main ones among these being the Christians. However, this was their (the Christian’s) situation before the advent of the last prophet, Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم). Now that the prophet’s mission has been established and completed, they have known the truth but in spite of that, opposed it. So, they and the Jews both have become the same – all of them are those who have earned anger upon themselves (if they do not repent and accept Allah’s religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. These last two verses also illustrate the eloquence of the Qur&#8217;an in that the expression used to refer to those who have earned anger upon themselves, مَغْضُوْب (Maghḍūb), is in the Arabic form (according to Arabic morphology) known as the مَفْعُوْل (maf’ūl) – an Arabic conjugal form that indicates that the anger upon them has already begun and is continuously occurring from Allah and from his close allies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Another point we learn from these verses is that the severest type of misguided group is placed first, then the next in severity. Allah mentioned those who earned anger upon themselves before those who are astray because the first are more severe in opposition to the truth than the ones astray and misguided. Opposing something while being fully aware of it is much harder to return from than opposing something simply because of being ignorant of it.</p>

<p><em>Ibn Rajab al-Ḥanbalī’s book, “Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Ḥikam,” is an explanation of the forty-two famous ḥadīth collected by Imām an-Nawawī.  In this article, part of the  twenty-fourth ḥadīth of that book explained.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">يَا عِبَادِي كُلُّكُمْ ضَالٌّ إِلاّ مَنْ هَدَيْتُهُ، فَاسْتَهْدُوْنِي أَهْدِكُمْ. يَا عِبَادِي كُلُّكُمْ جَائِعٌ إِلاّ مَنْ أَطْعَمْتُهُ، فُاسْتَطْعِمُوْنِي أُطْعِمْكُمْ. يَا عِبَادِي كُلُّكُمْ عَارٍ إِلاّ مَنْ كَسَوْتُهُ، فَاسْتَكْسُوْنِي أُكْسُكُمْ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Oh my servants, each of you is astray except those I have guided, so ask me for guidance and I will guide you. Oh my servants, each of you is hungry except those I have fed, so ask me for food and I will feed you. Oh my servants, each of you is naked except those I have clothed, so ask me for clothing and I will clothe you.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an indication that all creatures are dependent upon Allah for their well-being and for protection from harm in all of their affairs whether religious or worldly. The servants of Allah possess nothing of these things themselves (without Allah’s assistance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever has not been graced with the bounties of guidance and sustenance will be deprived of them in this life. And whoever has not been graced by Allah’s forgiveness of his sins, his misdeeds will ruin him in the hereafter. Allah ( تَعَالى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَن يَهْدِ اللَّهُ فَهُوَ الْمُهْتَدِ وَمَن يُضْلِلْ فَلَن تَجِدَ لَهُ وَلِيًّا مُّرْشِدًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Whomever Allah guides is rightly-guided, but whomever he leaves astray, you will never find for him a protecting guide.</span> [Sūrah al-Kahf, 18:17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many similar examples in the Quran. All also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>مَّا يَفْتَحِ اللَّهُ لِلنَّاسِ مِن رَّحْمَةٍ فَلا مُمْسِكَ لَهَا وَمَا يُمْسِكْ فَلا مُرْسِلَ لَهُ مِن بَعْدِهِ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْحَكِيمُ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Whatever Allah grants to people of mercy, none can withhold it; and whatever he withholds, none can release it thereafter. And he is the Mighty, the Wise.</span> [Sūrah Fāṭir, 35:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الأَرْضِ إِلاَّ عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And there is no creature on earth but that (dependent) upon Allah is its provision.</span> [Sūrah Hūd, 11:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah says, quoting the prayer of Adam (the prophet and first of mankind) and his wife (عَلَيْهِِمَا السَّلام) :</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالا رَبَّنَا ظَلَمْنَا أَنفُسَنَا وَإِن لَّمْ تَغْفِرْ لَنَا وَتَرْحَمْنَا لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They said, “Our lord, we have wronged ourselves, and if you do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we will surely be among the losers.”</span> [Sūrah al-A’rāf, 7:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And quoting Noah, the prophet and first messenger ( عَلَيْهِِ السَّلام ) , Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِلاَّ تَغْفِرْ لِي وَتَرْحَمْنِي أَكُن مِّنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And unless you forgive me and have mercy upon me, I will be among the losers.”</span> [Sūrah Hūd, 11:47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abraham ( عَلَيْهِِ السَّلام ), the prophet, messenger, and close friend of Allah, made reference to such affairs being dependent upon Allah as proof that nothing should be worshipped except Allah, and that anything else worshipped besides him is done in falsehood. Abraham <span style="color:#000000;">said to his people:</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ أَفَرَأَيْتُم مَّا كُنتُمْ تَعْبُدُونَ أَنتُمْ وَآبَاؤُكُمُ الْأَقْدَمُونَ فَإِنَّهُمْ عَدُوٌّ لِّي إِلَّا رَبَّ الْعَالَمِينَ الَّذِي خَلَقَنِي فَهُوَ يَهْدِينِ وَالَّذِي هُوَ يُطْعِمُنِي وَيَسْقِينِ وَإِذَا مَرِضْتُ فَهُوَ يَشْفِينِ وَالَّذِي يُمِيتُنِي ثُمَّ يُحْيِينِ وَالَّذِي أَطْمَعُ أَن يَغْفِرَ لِي خَطِيئَتِي يَوْمَ الدِّينِ رَبِّ هَبْ لِي حُكْمًا وَأَلْحِقْنِي بِالصَّالِحِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">He said, “Then do you see what you have been worshipping, you and your forefather of old? They are enemies to me, except the lord of the worlds. And it is He who created me and who guides me, the one who feeds me and gives me drink. When I become sick, it is he who heals me, and he who will cause me to die then give me life again. It is he, I hope, will forgive me for my sins on the Day of Judgment. My lord, grant me authority and join me with the righteous.”</span> [Sūrah al-Shu’arā, 26:75-83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who alone creates people, guides them, provides them with their sustenance, gives them life and death in this life and forgiveness of their sins in the hereafter—he alone deserves to be singled out as the only god, the only one deserving of worship, prayer and supplication, and humble submission. Allah ( عَزَّ وَجَلَّ ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ ثُمَّ رَزَقَكُمْ ثُمَّ يُمِيتُكُمْ ثُمَّ يُحْيِيكُمْ هَلْ مِن شُرَكَائِكُم مَّن </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَفْعَلُ مِن ذَلِكُم مِّن شَيْءٍ سُبْحَانَهُ وَتَعَالَى عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah is the one who created you, then provided for you, then will cause you to die and then will give you life. Are there any of your “partners” (you worship along with him) who does anything of that? Exalted is he and high above what they associate (in worship) with him.</span> [Sūrah al-Rūm, 30:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are ḥadīth that show Allah loves for his servants to pray and ask for anything contributing to the well-being of their religion or worldly life such as food, drink, clothing, and similar things just as they would ask him for guidance and forgiveness. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">22</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet some of the Salaf used to be ashamed before Allah to ask him anything of worldly affairs. But following the Sunnah is better and preferable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the statement in the ḥadīth, “each of you is astray except those I have guided,” some people found this to be in contradiction to another ḥadīth in which the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ) said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">يَقُوْلُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ : خَلَقْتُ عِبَادِي حُنَفَاءً<span style="color:#333300;">) وَفِي رِوَايَةٍ : مُسْلِمِيْنَ(</span> فَاجْتَالَتْهُمْ الشَّيَاطِيْنُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah ( عَزَّ وَجَلَّ ) said,<span style="color:#008000;"> “I have created my servants inclining to believe in the truth </span>(and in another narration: “as Muslims”)<span style="color:#008000;"> but the devils misled them.”</span> [Recorded by Muslim (no. 2865]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But there is actually no contradiction here. Allah created all the children of Adam with an innate nature to accept (the monotheism of) Islam, to be more inclined toward it as opposed to any other belief, and to be predisposed and prepared with the capacity for accepting it. However, a servant must still take the action to learn Islam; without actually learning about it, he is ignorant, knowing nothing of it just as Allah ( عَزَّ وَجَلَّ ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاللَّهُ أَخْرَجَكُم مِّن بُطُونِ أُمَّهَاتِكُمْ لا تَعْلَمُونَ شَيْئًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And Allah has brought you out of your mothers’ wombs not knowing anything.</span>[Sūrah al-Naḥl, 16:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said to his prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَوَجَدَكَ ضَالاًّ فَهَدَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And he found you lost but he guided you.</span> [Sūrah al-Ḍuḥá, 93:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The preceding verse means that he found you while you had no knowledge of the book (the Quran) and wisdom (the Sunnah) as He ( تَعَالى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ رُوحًا مِّنْ أَمْرِنَا مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِي مَا الْكِتَابُ وَلا الإِيمَاَانُ وَلَكِن جَعَلْنَاهُ نُورًا نَّهْدِي بِهِ مَن نَّشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And thus we have revealed to you an inspiration by our command. You neither knew what the book was nor faith, but we have (now) made it a light by which we guide whomever we will of our servants.</span> [Sūrah al-Shūrá, 45:52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So people are born with a natural inclination to accept and believe in truth. If Allah then guides them then that is the reason they know guidance and become guided in action after they were guided at birth with the inclination and capacity to accept truth and guidance. But for whomever Allah has abandoned, he will be destined to learn from those who would teach him beliefs that would change his natural disposition. This is similar to the statement of the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ) :</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">كُلِّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى الْفِطْرَةِ، فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ وَيُنَصِّرَانِهِ وَيُمَجِّسَانِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Every newborn is born upon the natural disposition, but his parents may then raise him as a Jew, as a Christian, or as a Zoroastrian</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 1358) and Muslim (no. 2658)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for a believer asking Allah for guidance, guidance is of two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>General Guidance:</strong> This type is the guidance to Islam, faith and this occurs only with believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Specific Guidance:</strong> This second type is the guidance to knowing the details of faith and belief of Islam and Allah’s assistance in acting in accordance with those details. Every believer needs this type of guidance night and day. And this is why Allah instructs his worshippers to recite in every prayer:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اِهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Guide us to the straight path.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the prophet (صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ) used to say in one of his nighttime supplications:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اهْدِنِي لِمَا اخْتُلِفَ فِيهِ مِنَ الْحَقِّ بِإِذْنِكَ ، إِنَّكَ تَهْدِي مَنْ تَشَاءُ إِلَى صِرَاطٍ </span><span style="color:#000000;"> مُسْتَقِيمٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Guide me, in matters that are inconsistent with the truth, by your permission. You certainly guide whomever you will to a straight path.</span> [Recorded by Muslim (no. 770)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the one who sneezes to which another replies, “May Allah have mercy on you,” should say, “May Allah guide you,” as has been narrated in the Sunnah.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">30</span>] And although some scholars (of the past) of Iraq rejected this under the assumption that one does not need to ask for guidance for a Muslim, most scholars differ with them by following the Sunnah in this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding this specific guidance, the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ) also instructed ‘Alī to ask Allah for correctness and guidance.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">31</span>] And he ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ) instructed al-Ḥasan to say in the supplication during the Witr Prayer:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّا اْهْدِنِي فِيْمَنْ هَدَيْتَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allah, guide me with those you have guided</span>.[32]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Foot Notes:</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">22</span>] As some examples of such ḥadīth, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ مَنْ لَمْ يَسْأَلِ اللهَ تَعَالى يَغْضَبْ عَلَيْهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Indeed, whoever does not ask Allah ( تَعَالى ), he becomes angry with him. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan al-Tirmidhī” (no. 2686) and “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Ibn Mājah” (no. 3085) by al-Albānī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَعْجَزُ النَّاسِ مَنْ عَجَزَ عَنِ الدُّعَاءِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The most deficient of people is he who fails to supplicate.</span> [Recorded in “Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah” (no. 601) by al-Albānī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) also instructed:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَلُوْا اللهَ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ حَتَّى الشِّسْع، فَإِنَّ اللهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ إِنْ لَمْ يُيَسِّرْهُ لَمْ يَتَيَسَّر</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Ask Allah for everything, even for a shoe strap. For if Allah ( عَزَّ وَجَلَّ ) did not make such a thing easy, it would certainly not be easy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[See al-Albānī’s statements about no. 21 of his “Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ḍaī’fah”]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَيْسَ شَيْءٌ أَكْرَمُ عَلَى اللهِ تَعَالَى مِنَ الدُّعَاءِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">There is nothing more honorable to Allah ( تَعَالى ) than supplication. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan al-Tirmidhī” (no. 2684) and “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Ibn Mājah” (no. 3087) by al-Albānī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">30</span>] See “Ṣaḥīḥ al-Wābil al-Sayyib” (pgs. 237-238).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">31</span>] In a ḥadīth, recorded by Muslim (no. 2725), ‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) said: The prophet (صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ) instructed me:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُل : اللَّهُمَّ اهْدِنِي وَسَدِّدْنِي وَاذْكُرْ بِالْهُدَى هِدَايَتَكَ الطَّرِيقَ وَبِالسَّدَادِ سَدَادَ السَّهْمِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Say, “<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Allah, guide me and correct me,</strong></span>” intending thereby with “your guidance,” the guidance of (a traveler on) a path, and with “correctness,” the straightness of an arrow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">32</span>] This ḥadīth is recorded by Abū Dāwūd (no. 1425) and al-Albānī said it is authentic in “Saḥīḥ Sunan Abī Dāwood” (no. 1263). It is also recorded by al-Tirmidhī (no. 464), al-Nasāī (3/248), and Ibn Mājah (no. 1178). Ahmad Shākir also said it is authentic in his notes of “Sunan al-Tirmidhī.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The full Qunūt supplication is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ اهْدِنِي فِيمَنْ هَدَيْتَ ، وَعَافِنِي فِيمَنْ عَافَيْتَ ، وَتَوَلَّنِي فِيمَنْ تَوَلَّيْتَ ، وَبَارِكْ لِي فِيمَا أَعْطَيْتَ ، وَقِنِي شَرَّ مَا قَضَيْتَ ، إِنَّكَ تَقْضِي وَلا يُقْضَى عَلَيْكَ ، وَإِنَّهُ لا يَذِلُّ مَنْ وَالَيْتَ ، وَلا يَعِزُّ مَنْ عَادَيْتَ ، تَبَارَكْتَ رَبَّنَا وَتَعَالَيْتَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Oh Allah, guide me with those you have guided. Heal me with those you have healed. Care for me with those you have cared for. Bless me in what you have given, and protect me from the evil of what you have decreed. Indeed, you decree while no one decrees against you. Whomever you show loyalty towards will never be humiliated, and whomever you show enmity towards will never be honored. Blessed are you, our lord, and you are exalted far above (any weakness).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>لِمَن شَاءَ مِنكُمْ أَن<span style="color:#0000ff;"> يَسْتَقِيمَ</span></strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>For whoever wills among you to take <span style="color:#0000ff;">the straight path</span> </strong></span>(Surah al-Takwir Verse 28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, the Arabic noun for the verb used is <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>اِسْتِقَامَة</strong> </span>(<strong>istiqāmah</strong>) which means “<strong>moderation</strong>.” And there is nothing more moderate or just than the justice found within Allah’s legislated religion. Previous legislations were suitable for earlier nations, appropriate for their time, place, and circumstances. Likewise, after the mission of the messenger Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ), the legislation he brought is suitable and applicable to those to whom he was sent – everyone from the beginning of his mission until the end of this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a well-known saying in our religion: The religion of Islam is suitable and ensures the well-being of every time, place, and circumstance. When people stick to it, Allah corrects the affairs of creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consider that a person is instructed to pray standing. If he is unable to stand, then sitting, and if unable to sit, he may pray lying down. In this way, the religion is suitable and easily applied—and progressive—according to the circumstances of each individual. This religion is appropriate for every time, place, and condition. Similarly, someone who washes for prayer may use water if he is able or has it. Otherwise, he may use clean sand or even pray without washing at all. This is because Allah’s religious legislation, all of it, is based on moderation and justice. There is no unfairness, discrimination, oppression, strictness or hardship in it. For this reason, Allah refers to it as &#8220;<strong> the straight path</strong> &#8221; .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The opposite of this <strong>istiqāmah</strong>, this moderation or “<strong>straightness</strong>,” is <strong>deviation</strong> – deviation to the side of extremism and intolerance or deviation to the side of negligence and slackness. So people follow three different paths regarding the religion of Allah: 1) the path of extremism, intolerance, or extravagance; 2) the path of negligence and carelessness, and 3) the path of moderation between the two extremes. This third path is the &#8221; the straight path &#8221; , the praiseworthy manner of following the religion of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the first and second paths, extremism and negligence, both lead to destruction. They destroy their followers with excessiveness or negligence. For example, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) forbade people from going to the extreme of intolerance and harshness; he said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">هَلَكَ الْمُتَنَطِّعُونَ ، هَلَكَ الْمُتَنَطِّعُونَ ، هَلَكَ الْمُتَنَطِّعُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">The harsh ones are destroyed, the harsh ones are destroyed, the harsh ones are destroyed.</span></strong>[54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Harshness brings about hardship and causes people to leave the religion of Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ). The other extreme, that of negligence and carelessness, has also been criticized. Allah says, describing the hypocrites:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذَا قَامُوا إِلَى الصَّلَاةِ قَامُوا كُسَالَىٰ يُرَاءُونَ النَّاسَ وَلَا يَذْكُرُونَ اللَّهَ إِلَّا قَلِيلًا</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And when they stand up for prayer, they stand with laziness and (only) to be seen of men, and they do not remember Allah but little.</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā, 4:142]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The religion of Allah is one of moderation, between extremism and negligence, and this is why Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;For whoever wills among you to take the straight path&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever wills to take this path, let him not deviate right or left. He should constantly remain straight on his religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for this “straightness” as it relates to behaving with the creator—which is to worship him alone—it also relates to one’s behavior with his creation. So your character toward people should be between these two extremes. Neither be harsh, intolerant, and overly strict; nor be careless, or behave as inferior or feeble. Rather, behave with seriousness though with leniency toward others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars used to advise judges to be lenient yet without weakness, strong yet without harshness. One’s leniency and gentleness should not lead him to become weak, yet one’s strength should not lead him to behave harshly with others. Instead, a person should be lenient but not weak, strong without harshness so that he achieves moderation in all his affairs. You find some people always acting rough, inflexible, or confrontational as if he is above everyone else. This is wrong. Others you see them among people as if they were worthless, so humble that they belittle themselves. They behave totally indifferent or as if they have no dignity. This is also wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People should be between the two extremes as was the guidance and character of the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ). He was tough in situations which called for that, gentle when gentleness was appropriate. So we should try to behave with others with seriousness and determination yet also with leniency and mercy.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[54] Collected by Muslim. Imam al-Nawawī, in his explanation of Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, explained the Arabic word in the ḥadīth المُتَنَطِّعُوْن (<strong>al-Mutanaṭṭi’ūn</strong>), to mean, “<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The extremists who go beyond the limits in their statements and actions</strong></span>.” In another ḥadīth collected by Muslim, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ رَفِيقٌ يُحِبُّ الرِّفْقَ ، وَيُعْطِي عَلَى الرِّفْقِ مَا لا يُعْطِي عَلَى الْعُنْفِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">Indeed, Allah is gentle and loves gentleness. He gives due to gentleness that which he does not give due to harshness.</span></strong></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">لِمَن شَاءَ مِنكُمْ أَن يَسْتَقِيمَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>For whoever wills among you to take the straight path </strong></span>(Surah al-Takwir Verse 28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>For whoever wills</strong>&#8221; is connected to what came before it, &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">It is only a reminder to the worlds, for whoever among you wills to take the straight path</span>&#8220;. As for those who choose not to take the straight path, they neither accept the reminder, nor do they gain any benefit from it. Allah says about those who do accept the reminder:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لَذِكْر َ لِمَن كَانَ لَهُ قَلْبٌ أَوْ أَلْقَى السَّمْعَ وَهُوَ شَهِيدٌ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>In that is surely a reminder for whoever has a heart or listens while he is heedful.</strong> </span>[Sūrah Qāf, 50:37]</p>
<p>For anyone who does not want to take this straight path, there is no way to benefit such a person with this Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Issue of Freewill:</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is a question: <strong>Do people actually have freewill to do as they choose?</strong> Yes, people have the freedom to choose as they will. Allah (عزّ وجل) has allowed each person the freedom of choice and freewill; if he wants, he does something, if not he does not do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this were not the case—if people had no freewill—then anyone to whom the messengers were sent would have an excuse against Allah to plead (because they disbelieved): “<strong>We had no choice in the matter</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So yes, people certainly have the freedom to act on their choices. Each individual knows that if he decides, for example, to visit Mecca, Medina, or some other place, it is by his choice. Anytime a person makes a choice, it is by his own decision. He neither feels others force his choice on him or force him to prefer one thing over another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, if an individual chooses to obey Allah, it is by his own choice. And should someone choose to commit a sin, it is also by his own choice. So people do have freewill yet we know with total certainty that people will never “will,” or actually make something happen (including his own actions), unless Allah has willed it to happen before it happens. For this reason, after &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">For whoever wills among you to take the straight path</span>&#8221; Allah then clarifies: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And you do not will unless Allah wills</span>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not will for anything to happen unless Allah has already allowed it to happen. So when anything happens, we know Allah has obviously allowed it to take place. If Allah had not allowed it to happen, we could not have willed it to occur ourselves as Allah  (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلَ الَّذِينَ مِن بَعْدِهِم مِّن بَعْدِ مَا جَاءَتْهُمُ الْبَيِّنَاتُ وَلَكِنِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">اخْتَلَفُوا فَمِنْهُم مَّنْ آمَنَ وَمِنْهُم مَّن كَفَرَ ۖ وَلَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا اقْتَتَلُوا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If Allah had willed, those (generations) succeeding them would not have fought each other after the clear proofs had come to them. But they differed, so some of them believed and some of them disbelieved. And if Allah had willed, they would not have fought each other.</span> [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:253]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after we have done anything, we know we chose to do it based on our will and choice, but we also know that this occurred by the will of Allah (عزّ وجل), If he had not willed it, we would not have accomplished it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Now we come to another question:</strong></span> Based on the points above, we then have an excuse to commit sins because whatever happens, Allah allows it and has willed it. We say no, we have no justification for sinning because we have no way of knowing whether Allah has willed something or not until after we have done the deed – after we have chosen to do it. We cannot say, “Allah has willed this for me,” until the sin has already taken place. So once the sin does take place, once it is committed, why was it committed? Because of our freewill and our choice to do it. Therefore, sinners have no justification or excuse before Allah. He nullifies this claim by saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَيَقُولُ الَّذِينَ أَشْرَكُوا لَوْ شَاءَ اللَّهُ مَا أَشْرَكْنَا وَلا آبَاؤُنَا وَلا حَرَّمْنَا مِن شَيْءٍ </span><span style="color:#000000;">ۖ كَذَلِكَ كَذَّبَ الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ حَتَّى ذَاقُوا بَأْسَنَا </span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Those who associated others (in worship) with Allah will say, “If Allah had willed, we would not have associated partners with him, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything (against his will).” Likewise, those before them denied until they tasted our punishment.</span> [Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:148]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If they had any justification for making their Shirk (worshipping others with Allah), then they would not have been punished by Allah; they would have been spared the punishment. But they had no right or excuse to worship others, so they were punished. As another example, consider that if someone were informed about a land, safe and peaceful, with sufficient provision and affluence for everyone, everywhere and with successful commerce and a strong economy not found in another land. At the same time, the person is also told of a land where people constantly fear for their lives, live in chaos, having no reliable economy, no law and order, no guaranteed safety for anyone. To which land would he choose to travel? Of course, he travels to the first land and he does not imagine someone, somewhere has forced him to make his decision. He chose the first land based on his own determination and freewill.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have before us now a similar choice: a path to good and a path leading to evil. Allah has already clearly simplified the two for us: this is the path to Paradise, this one to Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, he explained some of what is waiting for us in Paradise of blessings and enjoyment and some punishments that await us in the fire. Which path do we take? Clearly, we would choose the path to Paradise just like we would choose to move to the peaceful land over the land in turmoil. Had we chosen the path to the fire, we alone would have justifiably been to blame. We would have made the worst, most foolish choice just as if we had decided to move to the land of fear and instability. Everyone would understandably hold us responsible for our own choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, in Allah’s statement &#8220;<strong>For whoever wills among you</strong>&#8220;, he confirms that each individual has the choice and will to decide his actions; he has freewill. Still, we know that even before we do or will anything, once it has happened, we know full well that Allah willed it to happen. Otherwise, it would not have occurred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many times, people become determined to do something, yet at the last minute they find themselves unable to do it for whatever reason. This is because Allah did not will such an action to take place. For example, we may decide to go to the mosque to attend a lecture, yet on our way there, we may then remember we have some other obligations which prevent us from attending.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a final example, it is said that a common Bedouin, knowing little about the details of religion, was asked, “<strong>How do you know you have a Lord?</strong>” he answered, “<strong>By unfulfilled determination and changes in plans</strong>.” In other words, a person may be fully determined to do something, completely resolved and able to do it. Yet, something totally contradictory to his intentions occurs. Who changed his resolve? He does not think someone made him prefer something over his original decision. Instead, Allah simply did not will it to happen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, a person may plan to do something and sets out to accomplish his plans, but he then finds within himself some reason not to carry out his plans. It may be something physically preventing him or simply a change of mind; he decides to do something else instead. All of this is from Allah (عزّ وجل).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of Verse 1 of Sooratul Faatiha</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">(<span style="color:#008000;">al-Ḥamdu lillāhi Rabbil-‘Ālamīn</span>)<br />
<strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah, the lord of all creations.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;All praise and thanks&#8221; (al-Ḥamd):</strong></span> This word الْحَمْدُ (<strong>al-Ḥamd</strong>) is used only to describe someone, out of love and honor, with complete perfection of self, attributes, and actions. So, Allah is perfect in his self, his attributes, and his actions. This praising, however, must be with a condition, it must be made with love and honor. The people of knowledge say that simply describing someone with perfection yet not out of real love and honor for the praised one is not called حَمْدُ (Ḥamd). Rather, in that case it would only be called مَدْح (<strong>Madḥ</strong>) (a lesser degree of praise or admiration). Therefore, this (second) type of praising occurs often from people while they may not really love the one they are praising. Often, they only want to gain something from them. For example, some poets stand before their government leaders and recite poetry of amazing praiseworthy descriptions of them yet void of any real love for them. The poets’ love is for the wealth they are given or they do this out of fear of the leaders. On the contrary, our praise for our lord is a form of praise out of love and honor.<strong> So, &#8220;All praise and thanks&#8221; is to praise the one described with total perfection out of love and honor for him</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ال (al-) in الْحَمْدُ (al-Ḥamd) is inclusive, meaning that it includes all forms of praise and thanks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;are for Allah&#8221; (lillāhi):</span> </strong>The لِ (li) is to show possession and a sense of deserving. The name “Allah” is the proper name of our lord ( عزّ وجلّ ) and no one else is given this name; it means the one god that is worshipped out of love and honor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;the lord&#8221; (Rabb):</span></strong> The word “lord” here includes three main descriptions: the creator, the owner, and the controller of all affairs. So, he is the creator of all that exists, the owner of all that exists, and the controller of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;of all creations&#8221; (al-‘Ālamīn):</span> </strong>As for the word “‘Ālamīn”, the scholars say it refers to anything and everything other than Allah. Everything else besides Allah is described with this word because the very existence of everything is a sign or indication (in Arabic: Ālam) that they have a creator (سبحانه وتعالى) In every form of creation there is a sign indicating the existence of its creator, his capability, wisdom, mercy, power, and the rest of his attributes of lordship.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verse 1:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. One of the beneficial points we gain from this verse is the affirmation of praise of perfection to Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ). This is shown by the “al-” in the word “al-Ḥamd” because this definite article in Arabic grammar is inclusive to include all forms or praise and gratitude.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It also shows that Allah alone deserves all forms of praise and gratitude. For this reason, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) used to say whenever something happened he was happy with:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الحَمْدُ للهِ الَّذِي بِنِعْمَتِهِ تُتِمُّ الصَّالِحَات</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah by whose favor righteous deeds are fulfilled.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he would say when if something did not please him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الحَمْدُ للهِ عَلَى كُلِّ حَالٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>All praise and thanks are for Allah in all situations</strong>.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">18</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Another point of benefit from the verse is the description of Allah with his sole right to worship first before describing him with his lordship. This is either indicated because the name “Allah” is his proper name, specific to him and the source of all the rest of His names; or it is due to the fact that the people the messengers were sent to used to only deny Allah’s sole right to worship. Most of the people did not deny Allah’s lordship (that he is the creator, owner, and controller of everything).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. This verse also proves Allah’s complete lordship over all of the creations due to his statement: &#8220;<strong>The lord of all creation</strong>s.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">18</span>] Recorded by Ibn Mājah (no. 3803) and al-Ḥākim in his “Mustadrak” (1/449) and he said, “This ḥadīth has an authentic chain of narrators.” adh-Dhahabī agreed with him. The famous ḥadīth scholar, al-Albānī, said it is “ḥasan” in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Ibn Mājah” (no. 3066).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ سَتَرَ مُسْلِمًا سَتَرَهُ اللَّهُ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالآخِرَةِ</span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Whoever conceals (the faults of) a Muslim, Allah will conceal him in this life and the hereafter.”</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is another point that is emphasized by other texts with similar meanings. Ibn Mājah recorded a ḥadīth from Ibn ‘Abbās ( رضي الله عنه ) that the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ سَتَرَ عَوْرَةَ أَخِيهِ الْمُسْلِمِ سَتَرَ اللَّهُ عَوْرَتَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ، وَمَنْ كَشَفَ عَوْرَةَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَخِيهِ الْمُسْلِمِ كَشَفَ اللَّهُ عَوْرَتَهُ حَتَّى يَفْضَحَهُ بِهَا فِي بَيْتِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever conceals the faults of his Muslim brother, Allah will conceal his faults on the Day of Resurrection. And whoever exposes the faults of his Muslim brother, Allah will expose his faults even by revealing those he committed in (the privacy of) his home.</span>[22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that some of the Salaf said something similar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#0000ff;">I have met people having no shameful faults but they began to mention the faults of others, so the people began discovering their faults. And I met people who had faults, yet they used to conceal other people’s faults, so their own faults were forgotten.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ḥadīth of Abū Barzah ( رضي الله عنه ) also supports this in that the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا مَعْشَرَ مَنْ آمَنَ بِلِسَانِهِ وَلَمْ يَدْخُلْ الإِيمَانُ قَلْبَهُ ، لا تَغْتَابُوا الْمُسْلِمِينَ وَلا </span><span style="color:#000000;">تَتَّبِعُوا عَوْرَاتِهِمْ ، فَإِنَّهُ مَنْ اتَّبَعَ عَوْرَاتِهِمْ يَتَّبِعُ اللَّهُ عَوْرَتَهُ ، وَمَنْ يَتَّبِعْ اللَّهُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">عَوْرَتَهُ يَفْضَحْهُ فِي بَيْتِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Oh you who have believed with your tongues but faith has not yet entered your hearts, do not back-bite Muslims. Do not seek to discover their faults, for whoever seeks after their faults, Allah will seek his faults. And if Allah seeks after someone’s faults, he will expose him for even (what he committed) in his home</span>. [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam al-Tirmidhī collected a ḥadīth with a similar meaning from Ibn ‘Umar ( رضي الله عنه ) [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And know that people or are two types in this regard:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. People whose faults are not know to others in that they may have committed them in private but nothing of their sins is known. If they make a mistake or sin, it is not permissible to reveal or expose it or even speak about it. That would be the forbidden type of back-biting that has been condemned in the texts. Regarding this, Allah (عزّ وجلّ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُحِبُّونَ أَن تَشِيعَ الْفَاحِشَةُ فِي الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ فِي </span><span style="color:#000000;">الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, those who like that immorality should be spread and publicized among those who believe, there will be for them a painful punishment in this world and in the hereafter</span>.[25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This spreading and publicizing of such immorality from a believer could be regarding something the person actually did or something he is wrongly accused of, being innocent of it, such as the case with the famous story of the lie against ‘Āishah, the wife of the prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some righteous officials used to instruct those who enjoin good upon people saying, “<strong>Try to conceal the sinners, for publicizing their sins is a means of showing the faults of the people of Islam, and the most important thing is to conceal people’s fault</strong>s.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, if a remorseful person comes repenting and admitting his crime, he is not to be exposed or inquired about. Rather, he is ordered to return and conceal his affair as the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) instructed Mā’iz and a Ghāmīdee woman. [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) also did not inquire into the affair of the one who came to him saying, “I transgressed the prescribed limit, so establish the punishment upon me.” [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the same way, if such a person were to be taken to account for his crime yet the news of which had not reached the leader, then intercession should be made on his part so that he would not inform the leader.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, there has come a ḥadīth in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَقِيلُوا ذَوِي الْهَيْئَاتِ عَثَرَاتِهِمْ إِلاّ الْحُدُودَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Pardon those of prestigious character of their faults except the prescribed punishments.</span> [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The second type of people with respect to sins is those who are well-known for their sins, those who openly and publicly commit them. They themselves are neither concerned at all with the sins they commit, nor with what people say about them. These are the wicked ones who openly display their crimes. Such people do not have the honor of others refraining from back-biting them as has been reported from al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī and others. Regarding such people, there is no problem with inquiring about their affairs in order to establish the prescribed rulings against them. Some of our companions have explicitly stated this, using as evidence the statement of the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) to Unays ( رضي الله عنه ):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاغْدُ يَا أُنَيْسُ إِلَى امْرَأَةِ هَذَا فَإِنْ اعْتَرَفَتْ فَارْجُمْهَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">G<span style="color:#808000;">o in the morning, Unays, to the wife of this man (she was accused of adultery) and if she confesses, stone her.</span>[29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, regarding this type of people, intercession is not to be made on their behalf when taken to account even if the news has not reached the leader. Rather, they are left to have the prescribed penalties pronounced upon them so that their crime is known as a deterrent to others like them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Mālik said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever is not known for harming the people, yet may have made some errors or mistakes, then there is no problem with interceding and pleading on his behalf as long as his crimes have not already been conveyed to the leader. As for those who are known for their evil and corruption, I do not like that anyone should intercede or argue on their behalf. Rather they are left to have the sentences carried out upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn al-Mundhir</strong> and others have also reported this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Aḥmad</strong> also disliked that crimes should be raised up to the attention of the authorities in every circumstance because often they would not carry out the prescribed punishments as they should. For this he said, “If you know that the ruling will be (correctly) pronounced upon a person, then raise the matter (to the attention of the leaders).” It was mentioned that some people beat a man (as a punishment for a crime) until he died, while killing him was not permissible. If only the person would have repented from the time he committed the offense, it would have been better for him in that he repents for something between him and Allah, thereby concealing his own sin. As for his second offense, some people are of the opinion he should do the same—he should not disclose it. Still, others have said that even upon the first offense, a person should come to the leader and confess against himself in what requires a prescribed punishment so that he may be purified (of his crime).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] Authentic: Recorded by Ibn Mājah (no. 2546) and al-Albānī said it is authentic in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Ibn Mājah” (no. 2063).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] Authentic: Recorded by Abū Dāwūd (no. 4880) and Imam Aḥmad. al-Albānī said it is authentic (Hasan Ṣaḥīḥ) in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Abī Dāwūd” (no. 4083).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24] The ḥadīth collected by al-Tirmidhī (no. 2032) that Ibn Rajab is referring to is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا مَعْشَرَ مَنْ أَسْلَمَ بِلِسَانِهِ وَلَمْ يُفْضِ الإِيمَانُ إِلَى قَلْبِهِ، لا تُؤْذُوا الْمُسْلِمِينَ وَلا تُعَيِّرُوهُمْ وَلا تَتَّبِعُوا عَوْرَاتِهِمْ، فَإِنَّهُ </span><span style="color:#000000;"> مَنْ تَتَبَّعَ عَوْرَةَ أَخِيهِ الْمُسْلِمِ تَتَبَّعَ اللَّهُ عَوْرَتَهُ، وَمَنْ تَتَبَّعَ اللَّهُ عَوْرَتَهُ يَفْضَحْهُ وَلَوْ فِي جَوْفِ رَحْلِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Oh you who have accepted Islam with their tongue yet faith has not reached your hearts, do not harm Muslims. Do not humiliate them, and do not seek to discover their faults. Whoever seeks after the faults of his Muslim brother, Allah will certainly seek his faults. And if Allah seeks his faults, he will expose him even if he were in the innermost privacy of his own home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Albānī said this narration is authentic in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan al-Tirmidhī” (no. 1655).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25] Sūrah al-Nūr, 24:19.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[26] Authentic: This is a reference to the story in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) repeatedly refused to carry out the prescribed punishment upon a companion and kept asking for excuses for him. The ḥadīth is recorded by Muslim (no. 1695) from Sulaymān Ibn Buraydah who narrated from his father who said: Mā’iz Ibn Maalik ( رضي الله عنه ) came to the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and said, “Oh messenger of Allah, purify me (by establishing the prescribed punishment upon me).” He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) replied:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَيْحَكَ ارْجِعْ فَاسْتَغْفِرْ اللَّهَ وَتُبْ إِلَيْهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Woe to you. Seek forgiveness from Allah and repent to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then returned and later came back and said the same thing to which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) kept saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَيْحَكَ ارْجِعْ فَاسْتَغْفِرْ اللَّهَ وَتُبْ إِلَيْهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Woe to you. Seek forgiveness from Allah and repent to him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the fourth time, he ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) asked him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> فِيمَ أُطَهِّرُكَ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">For what should I purify you?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mā’iz said, “For committing adultery.” So Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) asked (others about the man):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَبِهِ جُنُونٌ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Is there madness in him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After being informed that the man is not crazy. He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) further asked:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَشَرِبَ خَمْرًا </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Did he drink alcohol?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man stood up to him but did not find the smell of alcohol from him. Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) asked him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> أَزَنَيْتَ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Did you (really) commit adultery?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied, “Yes.” He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) then instructed that he be stoned. So, the people differed amongst themselves about him into two groups: one saying, “He is ruined! His deeds are lost.” and another group saying, “What repentance could be better than the repentance of Mā’iz? He came (willingly) to the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ), put his hand in his hand, and said, ‘Kill me by the stone.’” So they remained in that state for two or three days. Then the messenger of Allah ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  came while they were sitting, greeted them and sat. He said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اسْتَغْفِرُوا لِمَاعِزِ بْنِ مَالِكٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Ask for forgiveness for Mā’iz Ibn Mālik.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they said, “May Allah forgive Mā’iz Ibn Mālik.” Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ تَابَ تَوْبَةً لَوْ قُسِمَتْ بَيْنَ أُمَّةٍ لَوَسِعَتْهُمْ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">He repented with such repentance that if it were divided among the entire nation, it would encompass them all.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) did similarly with the pregnant woman who also came to confess committing adultery with Mā’iz.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[27] Authentic: This story was narrated in the ḥadīth collected by al-Bukhārī (no. 6823), Muslim (no. 2764), and Abū Dāwūd (no. 4381). Anas Ibn Mālik ( رضي الله عنه ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was with Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) when a man came to him and said, “Oh messenger of Allah, I have transgressed the limit, so establish the punishment upon me.” Yet he ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) did not ask about him (his crime). The prayer time came and he prayed with the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ). When the he ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) finished the prayer, the man stood and again said, “Oh messenger of Allah, indeed I transgressed the limit so establish the book of Allah upon me.” He صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) ) replied:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَيْسَ قَدْ صَلَّيْتَ مَعَنَا </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Did you not pray with us?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered, “Yes.” He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) then told him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ قَدْ غَفَرَ لَكَ ذَنْبَكَ أَوْ قَالَ حَدَّكَ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Then indeed Allah has forgiven your sin (or he said:) your (transgression of the) prescribed law.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[28] Authentic: Recorded by Abū Dāwūd (no. 4375) and al-Albānī declared it to be authentic in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Abī Dāwūd” (no. 3679).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] Authentic: Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 2315), Muslim (no. 1698), al-Tirmidhī (no. 1433), and Ibn Mājah (no. 2549).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ḤADĪTH 1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>أتَانِي جِبْرِيْلُ ، فَقَالَ : يَا مُحَمَّدُ ، عِشْ مَا شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ ، وَأَحْببْ مَنْ شِئْتَ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَإِنَّكَ مُفَارِقُهُ ، وَاعْمَلْ مَا شِئْتَ فَإِنَّكَ مَجْزِيٌّ بهِ ، وَاعْلَمْ أَنَّ شَرَفَ الْمُؤْمِنِ قِيَامُ </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>اللَّيْلِ ، وَعِزَّهُ اسْتِغْنَاؤُهُ عَنْ النَّاسِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Jibrīl came to me and said, “Oh Muhammad, live how you like for you will certainly die. Love whom you like for you will certainly leave him. Do as you like for you will certainly be compensated for it. And know that the dignity of a believer is his standing at night (in prayer), and his honor is his managing himself without need of other people.”</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) reported that Allah’s messenger (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) asked:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> أَتَدْرُوْنَ مَا الْمُفْلِسُ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Do you know what a bankrupt person is?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They replied, “A bankrupt person among us is the one with no money or possessions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) continued:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الْمُفْلِسَ مِنْ أُمَّتِي يَأْتِي يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ بصَلاةٍ وَصِيَامٍ وَزَكَاةٍ، وَيَأْتِي قَدْ شَتَمَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">هَذَا.، وَقَذَفَ هَذَا ، وَأَكَلَ مَالَ هَذَا ، وَسَفَكَ دَمَ هَذَا ، وَضَرَبَ هَذَا ، فَيُعْطَى هَذَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">مِنْ حَسَنَاتِهِ ، وَهَذَا مِنْ حَسَنَاتِهِ ، فَإِنْ فَنِيَتْ حَسَنَاتُهُ قَبْلَ أَنْ يُقْضَى مَا عَلَيْهِ ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">أُخِذَ مِنْ خَطَايَاهِمْ فَطُرِحَتْ عَلَيْهِ ، ثُمَّ طُرِحَ فِي النَّارِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">The bankrupt person from my nation is the one who will come on the Day of Resurrection with prayer, fasting, and charity. But he had insulted this person, slandered that person, cheated this person out of money, spilled this person’s blood, and hit that person. Each of these people (he harmed) will then be given some of his good deeds. And if his good deeds run out before settling his affairs, their sins will be taken and put upon the man, then he will be thrown in the fire.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Jābir Ibn ‘Abdullah (رضي الله عنه) reported that the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اِتَّقُوْا الظُّلْمَ ، فَإِنَّ الظُّلْمَ ظُلُمَاتٌ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ، وَاتَّقُوْا الشُحَّ ، فَإِنَّ الشُّحَّ </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَهْلَكَ مَنْ كَانَ قَبْلَكُمْ ، حَمَلَهُمْ عَلَى أَنْ سَفَكُوْا دِمَاءَهُمْ وَاسْتَحَلُّوْا مَحَارِمَهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Beware of oppression because oppression will become darkness on the Day of Resurrection.

<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">5</span>] Ibn al-‘Uthaymīn, in Muṣṭalaḥ al-Ḥadīth, explained a marfū’ ḥadīth as one that is either raised to the status of being directly attributed to the prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) as his explicit statement, action, approval, or as a physical or character description, or it is determined for a number of reasons that the statement carries the ruling of being attributed to the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas (رضي الله عنه) reported in a marfū’ form:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهَ بعَبْدٍ خَيْرًا عَجَّلَ لَهُ العُقُوْبَةَ فِي الدُّنْيَا ، وَإِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهَ بعَبْدٍ شَرًّا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَمْسَكَ عَلَيْهِ ذُنُوْبَهُ حَتَّى يُوَافِيْهِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>When Allah wants good for a servant, He hastens his punishment (for his sins) in this life. And if Allah wants bad for a servant, he preserves his sins for him until he meets Him on the Day of Resurrection.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>When Allah wants good for a servant, He makes others pleased with him. It was asked, “And what is this pleasing respect others have for him, messenger of Allah?” He answered:</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">ḤADĪTH 7</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Uqbah Ibn ‘Āmir (رضي الله عنه) reported in a marfū’ form:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا رَأَيْتَ اللَّهَ يُعْطِي الْعَبْدَ مِنَ الدُّنْيَا عَلَى مَعَاصِيْهِ مَا يُحِبُّ ، فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ</span><span style="color:#000000;"> اسْتِدْرَاجٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">If you see that Allah provides for a servant in this life from what he likes because of his sins, it is only <em>Istidrāj </em>(allowing him to gradually increase in sin).</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger of Allah then recited the verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَلَمَّا نَسُوْا مَا ذُكِّرُوا بهِ فَتَحْنَا عَلَيْهِمْ أَبْوَابَ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ حَتَّى إِذَا فَرِحُوْا بمَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أُوْتُوْا أَخَذْنَاهُم بَغْتَةً فَإِذَا هُم مُّبْلِسُوْنَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So when they forgot what they had been reminded about, We opened to them the doors of every (good) thing until, when they rejoiced in that which they were given, We seized them suddenly, and they were (then) in despair.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullah Ibn ‘Amr (رضي الله عنه) said, “Once we were around Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) when someone mentioned tribulations.” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا رَأَيْتَ النَّاسَ قَدْ مَرِجَتْ عُهُوْدُهُمْ ، وَخَفَّتْ أَمَانَاتُهُمْ ، وَكَانُوْا هَكَذَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">(It will be) when you see people being unconcerned about their promises and their trustworthiness declines, and they (the people and tribulations) are like this—and he interlocked his fingers.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the ḥadīth narrators then stood and asked him, “What should I do at that time, may Allah ransom you with my life.” He (صلّى الله عليه و سلّم) answered:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الْزَمْ بَيْتَكَ ، وَأَمْلِكْ عَلَيْكَ لِسَانَكَ ، وَخُذْ مَا تَعْرِفُ ، وَدَعْ مَا تُنْكِرُ ، وَعَلَيْكَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">بأَمْرِ خَاصَّة نَفْسِكَ ، وَدَعْ عَنْكَ أَمْرَ الْعَامَّةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Remain in your house, preserve your tongue, take only what you know, leave what you are unsure about, be concerned only with your own affairs, and leave the affairs of the common people.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Whenever you make a sin, follow it up with a good deed which will erase it. I asked, “Is saying, ‘Nothing should be worshipped but Allah’ considered a good deed?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">هِيَ أَفْضَلُ الحَسَنَاتِ</span></h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">Allah (تبارك وتعالى) tests his worshipper with what He has given him.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#333300;">There are three things which destroy and three things which save. The three destructive things are: stinginess that is obeyed, desires that are followed, and a person being too amazed with himself. The three things which save: fearing Allah in both private and in open, moderation in both poverty and richness, and fairness when both angry and happy.</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Ibn Rajab al-Ḥanbalī’s book, “Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Ḥikam,” is an explanation of the forty-two famous ḥadīth collected by Imām an-Nawawī. The part of the  ḥadīth explained in this article is ḥadīth number twenty-four of that book.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا عِبَادِي إِنَّكُمْ لَنْ تَبْلُغُوْا ضُرِّي فَتَضُرُّوْنِي، وَلَنْ تَبْلُغُوْا نَفْعِي فَتَنْفَعُوْنِي</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“<span style="color:#993300;">Oh my servants, you will never be able to harm me, and you will never be able to benefit me</span>.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People are incapable of ever reaching a state in which they could benefit or harm Allah, for Allah is the Self-Sufficient, the Praiseworthy. He neither needs the obedience of his servants, nor does any benefit of such obedience reach him. It is only the servants who benefit from their obedience. Likewise, he is not harmed in any way by their disobedience, but it is they who harm themselves therewith. Allah ( تَعَالَى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلا يَحْزُنكَ الَّذِينَ يُسَارِعُونَ فِي الْكُفْرِ إِنَّهُمْ لَن يَضُرُّوا اللَّهَ شَيْئًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And do not be grieved by those who hasten into disbelief. They will certainly never harm Allah at all.</span>[Sūrah Āli ‘Imrān, 3:176]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَنقَلِبْ عَلَى عَقِبَيْهِ فَلَن يَضُرَّ اللَّهَ شَيْئًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And he who turns back on his heels will never harm Allah at all.</span>[Sūrah Āli ‘Imrān, 3:144]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah ( عَزَّ وَجَلَّ ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن تَكْفُرُوا فَإِنَّ لِلَّهِ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الأَرْضِ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَنِيًّا حَمِيدًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">But if you disbelieve, then to Allah belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on earth. And ever is Allah free of need, praiseworthy.</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā, 4:131]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says, quoting the prophet Moses:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ مُوسَى إِن تَكْفُرُوا أَنتُمْ وَمَن فِي الأَرْضِ جَمِيعًا فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَغَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And Moses said, “If you should disbelieve, you and whoever is on the earth entirely, indeed, Allah is Free of need, praiseworthy.”</span> [Sūrah Ibrāhīm, 14:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن كَفَرَ فَإِنَّ اللَّهَ غَنِيٌّ عَنِ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever disbelieves, certainly Allah free of need from all creations.</span>[Sūrah Āli ‘Imrān, 3:97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَن يَنَالَ اللَّهَ لُحُومُهَا وَلَا دِمَاؤُهَا وَلَٰكِن يَنَالُهُ التَّقْوَىٰ مِنكُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Neither their meat, nor their blood (e.g., of animals slaughtered for charity) reaches Allah; but what reaches him is piety from you</span>.[Sūrah al-Ḥajj, 22:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah ( تَعَالَى ) loves his servants to remain conscious of him and obey him, just as he dislikes them to disobey him. For this reason, Allah is happier with people’s repentance than the happiness felt by a person who, having lost his riding animal in a vast desert upon which are his food and drink, searches desperately for his mount to the point of exhaustion and finally, giving up all hope of ever finding it, gives in to certain despair that his life is as an end, and he abandons himself to death. As he succumbs to his exhaustion and sleeps, he later wakes up to find his riding animal standing right before him. This is one of the highest levels of happiness imaginable among creation.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">51</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah is even happier than such a person despite the fact that he is in no way in need of his servants’ obedience or their repentance. Rather, he returns the benefit thereof back to them out his generosity and kindness toward his servants and his love for their well-being and his desire to prevent harm from reaching them. And in return, he loves for his servants to know him, love him, fear him, remain constantly aware of him, and to obey him and exert effort in getting closer to him. He loves for them to know that no one else can forgive their sins and that he is fully capable of showing forgiveness for the sins of his servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration of this ḥadīth from ‘Abdul Raḥmān Ibn Ghanam from Abū Dharr, it is reported that Allah said, “<strong>Whoever among you knows that I am capable of showing forgiveness and were he to ask for my forgiveness, I would forgive him and would not mind at all</strong>.”</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا عِبَادِي لَو أَنَّ أَوَّلَكُمْ وآخِرَكُمْ وَإِنْسَكُمْ وَجِنَّكُمْ كَانُوْا عَلَى أَتْقَى قَلْبِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ مِنْكُمْ مَا زَادَ ذَلِكَ فِي مُلْكِي شَيْئًا، يَا عِبَادِي لَو أَنَّ أَوَّلَكُمْ وآخِرَكُمْ وَإِنْسَكُمْ وَجِنَّكُمْ كَانُوْا عَلَى أَفْجَرِ قَلْبِ رَجُلٍ وَاحِدٍ مِنْكُمْ مَا نَقَصَ ذَلِكَ مِنْ مُلْكِي شَيْئًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Oh my servants, if the first of you and the last of you, the people and jinn among you, were all to have hearts as righteous as the most righteous man among you, that would not increase my kingdom in anything. Oh my servants, if the first of you and the last of you, the people and jinn among you, were to have hearts as wicked as the most wicked man among you, that would not decrease my kingdom in anything.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows that the kingdom of Allah will not increase in anything even if all creatures were as pious and had hearts as the most righteous person among them. Similarly, his kingdom will never decrease by the sins of sinners even if all the jinn and humans were to be as cruel and evil, having hearts as evil as the most wicked person among them. Allah ( سُبْحَانَهُ ) is self-sufficient, having no need whatsoever of anyone else. There is absolute perfection in his self, his characteristics, and in his actions. His dominion and authority is also perfect with no weakness or flaws to diminish it in any way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people believe that the creations brought about by Allah – those present now – are the most perfect forms than had Allah created them in any other way. And the evil we witness among creation is a conditional type of evil dependent on some things within creation; it is not an absolute evil existing in creation such that its nonexistence would be better than its current existence under all circumstances. Rather, the fact that such aspects of evil are present is actually better than if they were not. They say that such an understanding is the meaning of Allah’s statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">بِيَدِكَ الْخَيْرُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">In your hand is all good.</span> [Sūrah Āli ‘Imrān, 3:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is the meaning of the prophet’s ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ) statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">الشَّرُّ لَيْسَ إِلَيْكَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">Evil is not to be attributed to you.</span> [Muslim (no. 771)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Absolute evil – that which the absent thereof would be better than its presence – is not present in your dominion. This kind of absolute evil is not to be found in Allah’s kingdom because Allah ( تَعَالَى ) brings about his creation and what it requires of wisdom and justice. Sometimes he distinguishes particular people (perhaps in this life or the next) with favors which he does not give others out of his justice and what that necessitates of complete wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet in such an understanding there is an issue which contradicts the point being made in the ḥadīth in that were all creations to have the best characteristics of piety and righteousness, that would not increase and improve his dominion at all. And were all the creations to have wicked characteristics that would lower the status and manner in which they were initially created, that would still not decrease the dominion of Allah in any way. [In other words, perhaps it is possible to become better or worse than one’s initial creation due to belief or disbelief in Allah, obedience or disobedience, etc.] And this (the fact that people have the choice to become better or worse) shows that Allah’s dominion and kingdom are still perfect in every way; it can neither be improved, nor perfected or completed even by obedience just as it cannot be decreased by disobedience. Nothing at all affects its perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These statement (of the ḥadīth) mentioning the heart also indicate that the source of righteousness and wickedness is the heart. When the heart is pious and conscious of Allah, the (actions of the) limbs will be righteous, and when the heart is evil, the limbs will be likewise.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">54</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this, the prophet (صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">التَّقْوَى هَا هُنَا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">Righteousness is right here.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he pointed to his chest.[Muslim (no. 2564)]</p>
<hr />
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">51</span>] This comparison is taken from a <em>ḥadīth</em> in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَلَّهُ أَشَدُّ فَرَحًا بِتَوْبَةِ عَبْدِهِ حِينَ يَتُوبُ إِلَيْهِ مِنْ أَحَدِكُمْ كَانَ عَلَى رَاحِلَتِهِ بِأَرْضِ فَلاةٍ فَانْفَلَتَتْ مِنْهُ وَعَلَيْهَا طَعَامُهُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَشَرَابُهُ، فَأَيِسَ مِنْهَا، فَأَتَى شَجَرَةً فَاضْطَجَعَ فِي ظِلِّهَا قَدْ أَيِسَ مِنْ رَاحِلَتِهِ فَبَيْنَا هُوَ كَذَلِكَ إِذَا هُوَ بِهَا قَائِمَةً عِنْدَهُ فَأَخَذَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">بِخِطَامِهَا ثُمَّ قَالَ مِنْ شِدَّةِ الْفَرَحِ: اللَّهُمَّ أَنْتَ عَبْدِي وَأَنَا رَبُّكَ! أَخْطَأَ مِنْ شِدَّةِ الْفَرَحِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allah is happier with the repentance of his servant when he repents to him than if one of you were traveling on his riding animal in a vast desert but it escapes while carrying his food and drink. After giving up all hope of catching it, the man then reclines in the shade of a tree, having despaired of finding his mount. While in such a state, he suddenly finds it standing right next to him so he takes its reins and cries out from sheer joy, “Oh Allah, you are my servant and I am your lord!” He makes such a mistake only from extreme happiness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by Muslim (no. 4939) and al-Bukāhrī” (no. 5863).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">54</span>] This point has been reported in a <em>ḥadīth </em>in al-Bukāhrī (no. 52) and Muslim (no. 1599) in which the prophet ( صلّى الله<br />
عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَلا وَإنَّ فِي الْجَسَدِ مُضْغَةً إذَا صَلَحَتْ صَلَحَ الْجَسَدُ كُلُّهُ ، وَإِذَا فَسَدَتْ فَسَدَ الْجَسَدُ كُلُّهُ ، ألا وَهِيَ القَلْبُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">There is within the body an organ, if it is pure the entire body will be purified, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupted. It is certainly the heart.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is Shirk?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may have already studied Tawḥīd. However, to truly understand Tawḥīd, its opposite, Shirk, must also be understood. The greatest thing Allah has commanded us to do is worship him alone, and the greatest sin he has forbidden is Shirk as He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Worship Allah and do not make Shirk with anything along with him.</span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is Shirk? Shirk (شِرْك) is an Arabic word which means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>sharing something with others that only Allah deserves</strong></span>. Worshipping others along with Allah is the main type of Shirk. The verse above means we must worship Allah and only him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever worships someone or something instead of Allah, he is a disbeliever in Allah who has refused to worship him alone. If someone worships Him but also worships someone else along with Allah, he is still a disbeliever in Allah, and it is this person who makes Shirk. As for someone who worships Allah alone, he is a Muslim who sincerely believes in Tawḥīd.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is the greatest sin against Allah and he says about it:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدِ افْتَرَى إِثْمًا عَظِيمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever makes Shirk with Allah has certainly made up a great sin</span>.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is also the worst of all major sins. Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) once asked his companions:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَلا أُنَبِّئُكُمْ بِأَكْبَرِ الْكَبَائِرِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Should I tell you the greatest of all major sins?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His companions said, “Of course, messenger of Allah.” He then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الإِشْرَاكُ بِاللَّهِ وَعُقُوقُ الْوَالِدَيْنِ وَشَهَادَةُ الزُّورِ أَوْ قَوْلُ الزُّورِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Making Shirk with Allah, disobeying parents, and lying.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was laying back when he said that, but then he sat up and began repeating that over and over because of how serious Shirk and those other major sins are in Islam. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was also asked, “What is the greatest sin?” He answered:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَنْ تَجْعَلَ لِلَّهِ نِدًّا وَهُوَ خَلَقَكَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">That you make something equal to Allah while he is the (only) one who created you.</span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Making someone or something equal to Allah is Shirk. It is to belittle Allah, believing him to be less than He is while believing others are equal to Him. About this, Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِرَبِّهِمْ يَعْدِلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Those who disbelieve think others are equal to their Lord.</span>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though Allah lets people choose to make Shirk and believe others are equal to Him, He does not like it and forbids us from doing so:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَلا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So do not make anything equal with Allah while you know (that he alone should be worshipped).</span>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is also to deny the very reason Allah created us which was to worship him alone as he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالإِنسَ إِلاَّ لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">I only created Jinn and people to worship me.</span>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever worships others along with Allah, believing they deserve to be worshipped, they have made the creation equal to its creator. This is the worse comparison because it is to believe that people who are helpless and in need are equal to Allah, the one who is able to do anything and who needs nothing from any of his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is the greatest crime of injustice and unfairness. This is because the greatest rights are the rights Allah deserves. Yet when people make Shirk, they are refusing to give him what he deserves most &#8211; Tawḥīd. This is the greatest form of injustice and unfairness just like Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الشِّرْكَ لَظُلْمٌ عَظِيمٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Shirk is certainly a great crime of injustice.</span>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk is also the greatest form of misguidance and straying from the right way of believing in Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلالاً بَعِيدًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever makes Shirk with Allah has certainly gone far astray.</span>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, Shirk is to share something that only Allah deserves with others such as worshipping others or describing others with Allah’s descriptions. It is the greatest sin against Allah.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">SHIRK IN TAWḤĪD OF LORDSHIP</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you learned about Tawḥīd, you may remember there are three main categories. Let us review the categories of Tawḥīd before moving on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Tawḥīd of Lordship: Allah is the only one who creates, owns, and controls everything.<br />
2. Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions: Allah is the only one who is described with his perfect names and descriptions.<br />
3. Tawḥīd of Worship: Allah is the only one who deserves worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship is to believe that others besides Allah create or share control over his creation. This belief means that someone other than Allah can make good things happen or keep bad things from happening.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One example of this type of Shirk is to believe something brings good luck. People often have “good luck” rings or similar items they believe will help good things happen to them. Others tie special strings around them or their children, believing that if they recite the Qur&#8217;aan over the strings, they will protect from bad things happening. However, only Allah can protect us from bad things and we should only seek his protection in ways he mentions in the Qur&#8217;aan or the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) taught us in the ḥadīth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another common example of Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship today is when people believe others like themselves who are created and have no control in Allah’s universe can control what happens. Such people even wait until the ones they believe in are dead before worshipping them by praying to them. The act of praying to dead people is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Worship (which we will cover shortly), but the belief itself is also Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship because when people pray to dead people, they believe the souls of humans can control things in this life even after their death. This is completely wrong because the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) told us:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When a person dies, his actions come to an end except for (receiving rewards for) three things: continuous charity, beneficial knowledge, or a righteous child who prays for him.</span> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While a person may still receive rewards from Allah for things he left behind after he died, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) clearly told us that after death, a human being’s actions stop. So how can dead people control whether good and bad things happen in life when they are not even in life anymore? Still, some people continue to pray to the dead, asking for their help in changing events in this life although only Allah can do this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if a dead person was a righteous worshipper of Allah, believing that dead people or anyone else controls things in this life is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship?<br />
2. Give an example of Shirk in Tawḥīd of Lordship.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>SHIRK IN TAWḤĪD OF NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions is to believe that Allah is the only one who deserves to be described with perfect names and descriptions. Shirk in this category of Tawḥīd is to believe that Allah can be described with descriptions of the creation, or to believe that others besides Allah share in his descriptions. So believing that Allah is like his creation or that his creation is like Allah is Shirk.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Describing Allah with Descriptions of His Creation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When people describe Allah with the descriptions of creation or they believe Allah is similar to people, they have made Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions. There are several ways this type of Shirk is made. One example is when people make statues or paintings of God, claiming they are images of Allah. By doing so, they have described Allah in the image or form of people although Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like him.</span> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, Christians fall into this type of Shirk when they believe Allah has a son. They believe the Messiah, Prophet Jesus the son of Mary, is his son. Allah knows they believe this and he says about this statement of Shirk and disbelief:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا اتَّخَذَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَلَدًا </span><span style="color:#000000;">لَّقَدْ جِئْتُمْ شَيْئًا إِدًّا </span><span style="color:#000000;">تَكَادُ السَّمَاوَاتُ يَتَفَطَّرْنَ مِنْهُ وَتَنشَقُّ الْأَرْضُ وَتَخِرُّ الْجِبَالُ هَدًّا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَن دَعَوْا لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ وَلَدًا  </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا يَنبَغِي لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَدًا  </span><span style="color:#000000;">إِن كُلُّ مَن فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ إِلَّا آتِي الرَّحْمَٰنِ عَبْدًا</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">And they say, “The Most-Merciful has a son.” You have said a terrible thing. The heavens are almost torn, the earth is split open, and the mountains almost fall in ruin because they claim the Most-Merciful has a son. But it is not suitable that the Most-Merciful has a son. There is no one in the heavens and earth except that will come to the Most-Merciful as a servant. </span>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah explains who Prophet Jesus truly is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا الْمَسِيحُ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Messiah, Jesus, the son of Mary, was only a messenger of Allah.</span> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions is when many Jewish people claim that Allah likes the Jews more than all other people – just because they were born to a Jewish parent. This belief of theirs means that Allah is prejudice and unfair just like some people are, and this is describing Allah with descriptions of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our belief in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions is that Allah is not like his creation. He alone deserves the highest descriptions. When someone believes that Allah is like his creation, they have made Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions by giving Allah the descriptions of his creation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Describing Creation with Allah’s Descriptions</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief that created beings or things share Allah’s names or descriptions is also Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions. This type of Shirk is when people raise other humans up to the level of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, some Christians describe people with Allah’s descriptions. They believe Prophet Jesus or saints can hear their prayers while Allah alone is the All-Hearing. Some Christians even believe Jesus was Allah in the form of a man. This is a form of describing Allah with descriptions of people as well as describing the creation with the descriptions of Allah. About this statement of Shirk and disbelief, Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ كَفَرَ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الْمَسِيحُ ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They have surely disbelieved who say, “Allah is the Messiah, the son of Mary.”</span> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By believing that someone is nicer than Allah, more merciful, more forgiving, or treats others more fairly than Allah, this is giving created people Allah’s descriptions and this is Shirk in Tawḥīd of Names and Descriptions.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">SHIRK IN TAWḤĪD OF WORSHIP</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawḥīd of Worship means we believe Allah is the only one who deserves worship. Since Shirk is the opposite of Tawḥīd, Shirk in Tawḥīd of Worship is worshipping others along with Allah. We must never share our worship with other than Allah. There are two types of Shirk in this category: Major Shirk and Minor Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to remember that both types of Shirk, major and minor, may be in other categories of Tawḥīd as well as Tawḥīd of Worship. We should not become overwhelmed or confused deciding if a statement or action is Shirk in this category of Tawḥīd or that one. Instead, we simply should concentrate on believing in, describing, and worshipping Allah alone as Islam instructs us. Still, we will discuss some differences between Major Shirk and Minor Shirk.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Major Shirk</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Major Shirk is any type of Shirk the Qur&#8217;aan or the ḥadīth explains that whoever does it is not considered a Muslim, not within the religion of Islam, and is not a true believer in Allah. Major Shirk dooms the person to live in Hell forever if he does not stop making Major Shirk before he dies. Any form of worship that is done for other than Allah is Major Shirk, such as praying to others besides Allah or hoping for things from others that only Allah can give (e.g. forgiveness, Paradise, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A common example of Major Shirk is when people pray to other people such as prophets or visit the graves of saints, believing those people hear or answer prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This form of Shirk is the greatest sin and the most unfair way to behave toward the Lord of all creation. We will mention some of the results of Major Shirk if a person dies while believing in it and doing acts of Major Shirk in worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Major Shirk Removes Hope of Entering Paradise</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says about the punishment for someone who dies while making Major Shirk:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ مَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَقَدْ حَرَّمَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ الْجَنَّةَ وَمَأْوَاهُ النَّارُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, whoever makes Shirk with Allah, Allah will make Paradise forbidden to him and his final home will be the fire.</span> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Major Shirk Guarantees Entrance into the Fire</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said about someone who meets Allah while making Shirk:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ لَقِيَ اللهَ لا يُشْرِكُ بِهِ شَيْئاً دَخَلَ الجَنَّةَ ، وَمَنْ لَقِيَهُ يُشْرِكُ بِهِ شَيْئاً دَخَلَ النَّار</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever meets Allah without making Shirk with him will enter Paradise, and whoever meets him making Shirk with him will enter the fire</span>. [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will meet Allah when we die, and one of the most common ways people make Major Shirk is by praying to and calling upon someone other than Allah. For this reason, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) clearly said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ مَاتَ وَهْوَ يَدْعُو مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ نِدًّا دَخَلَ النَّارَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever dies while calling upon anything other than Allah, making them equal to Allah (in worship), he will enter the fire.</span> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Major Shirk Ruins All Good Deeds</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone makes Major Shirk, all their good deeds may be ruined and lost. Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَوْ أَشْرَكُوا لَحَبِطَ عَنْهُم مَّا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And if they had made Shirk, whatever (good) they used to do would be ruined.</span> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">It has been revealed to you and to those before you, if you make Shirk, your deeds will be ruined and you will certainly be among the losers.</span>[20]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Minor Shirk</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Minor Shirk is any type of saying or action that the Qur&#8217;aan or ḥadīth describes as being Shirk but that the person who says or does it could still be considered a Muslim, still inIslam, and is still a believer in Allah. However, Minor Shirk does mean that the person’s belief in Tawḥīd may be incorrect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some actions or statements are considered Minor Shirk. For example, saying something like, “If it was not for Allah and you, something bad would have happened!” Someone once said to Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), “Whatever Allah wants and you want (to happen will happen).” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) explained that such things are not correct to say; he said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلْتَنِي مَعَ اللهِ عَدْلاً ؟ لا بَلْ : مَا شَاءَ اللهُ وَحْدَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Have you made me an equal with Allah? No, instead say: “Whatever Allah alone wants (to happen will happen).”</span> [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some common superstitions are also Minor Shirk. For example, if someone believes Allah will allow bad things to happen if he does not wear a certain ring or hang verses from the Qur&#8217;aan in his car, this is a form of Minor Shirk because Allah has not made those things ways to prevent bad things from happening. However, if someone believes those things themselves actually prevent bad things from happening instead of Allah, then this becomes Major Shirk. Such a wrong belief would then mean there are other things besides Allah that control creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another form of Minor Shirk is harder to recognize. This type of “hidden Shirk” is in a person’s intention, or the reason he does something. When someone does a good deed—which he should do for only Allah—yet he does his good deed just for people to think he is a good worshipper, this is a form of Minor Shirk. Examples of this may be if someone prays very well, raises his voice while remembering Allah or reading the Qur&#8217;aan, or gives charity but he does so only for people to think and say good things about him. About this type of showing off, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إنَّ أَخْوَفَ مَا أَخَافُ عَلَيْكُمْ الشِّرْكَ الأَصْغَرَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The thing I fear for you the most is Minor Shirk.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His companions asked, “What is Minor Shirk, messenger of Allah?” He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) answered:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الرِّيَاء ، يَقُوْلُ اللهُ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ : اِذْهَبُوْا إِلَى الَّذِيْنَ كُنْتُمْ تُرَاؤُوْنَ فِي الدُّنْيَا ،فَانْظُرُوْا هَلْ تَجِدُوْنَ عِنْدَهُمْ جَزَاءً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Showing off (riyā). Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) will say, <span style="color:#008000;">“Go to those you were showing off for during life and see if you can find any reward with them.”</span></span> [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Minor Shirk Ruins Good Deeds Done for Showing Off</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Good deeds will not be accepted if they are done for anyone other than Allah. While Major Shirk ruins all a person’s good deeds, Minor Shirk ruins only the deeds that were done for showing off. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) says about this Shirk in intention:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ اللَّهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى : أَنَا أَغْنَى الشُّرَكَاءِ عَنْ الشِّرْكِ ، مَنْ عَمِلَ عَمَلاً أَشْرَكَ فِيهِ مَعِي غَيْرِي تَرَكْتُهُ وَشِرْكَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allah ( تبارك وتعالى ) said,<span style="color:#008000;"> “I am in no need of Shirk. Whoever does a deed but does so for someone else besides me, I will reject him and his Shirk”</span>.</span> [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the prophet’s companions named Abū Mūsá al-‘Ash’arī ( رضي الله عنه ) said: The messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) once gave us a talk and said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ ، اتَّقُوا هَذَا الشِّرْكَ فَإِنَّهُ أَخْفَى مِنْ دَبِيبِ النَّمْلِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Oh people, be afraid of this Shirk because it is more hidden than a creeping ant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While Major Shirk is much worse than Minor Shirk, both are sins against Allah. For this reason, we should stay away from all forms of Shirk because Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah will not forgive that Shirk is made with him.</span> [24]</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">CONCLUSION</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not study Tawḥīd and Shirk simply to memorize detailed categories and types of Shirk. We learn Tawḥīd for the purpose of getting closer to Allah by believing in and worshipping him in the way he wants. And we do so only to make him happy with the hope of achieving his forgiveness and entering his Paradise. Similarly, we learn Shirk so we know what beliefs, statements, and actions make Allah unhappy. Remember, while learning the details of Tawḥīd and Shirk may help us know what Allah wants from us, he did not make our religion difficult upon us, he simply instructed us to:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْبُدُوا اللَّهَ وَلا تُشْرِكُوا بِهِ شَيْئً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Worship Allah and do not make Shirk with anything along with him.</span> [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The important thing to remember is that Allah is the only Lord, the only creator, owner, and controller of everything and everyone in the universe. He is the only one who we describe with the names and descriptions of perfection and we truly believe Allah is not like his creation and his creation is not like him. Allah tells us:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing equal or comparable to him.</span> [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because we believe Allah is the only Lord and only he deserves the highest descriptions, it only makes sense that we worship him and no one else. So do not let your study of Tawḥīd and Shirk become difficult or confusing. By simply reading about this knowledge, you have taken steps to get closer to Allah. Read what Allah says about those who try to come closer to Allah and those who avoid Shirk:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي شِبْرًا تَقَرَّبْتُ مِنْهُ ذِرَاعًا ، وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي ذِرَاعًا تَقَرَّبْتُ مِنْهُ بَاعًا ، وَمَنْ أتَانِي يَمْشِي أتَيْتُهُ هَرْوَلَةً ، وَمَنْ لَقِيني بِقُرَابِ الأرْض خَطِيئةً لا يُشْرِكُ بِي شَيئاً ، لَقِيتُهُ بِمِثْلِهَا مَغفِرَةً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever comes close to me a hand-span, I will come close to him an arm’s length; and whoever comes close to me an arm’s length, I will come close to him the distance of two outstretched arms. Whoever comes to me walking, I will come to him running. And whoever meets me with the earth full of sins but does not make Shirk in anything with me, I will meet him with as much forgiveness.” [27]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A PRAYER FOR PROTECTION FROM SHIRK</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) once said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الشِّرْكُ فِيكُمْ أَخْفَى مِنْ دَبِيْبِ النَّمْلِ ، وَسَأَدُلُّكَ عَلَى شَيْ ء إِذَا فَعَلْتَهُ أَذْهَبَ عَنْكَ صِغَارَ الشِّرْكِ وَكِبَارَهُ ، تَقُولُ : اللَّهُمَّ إِنِّي أَعُوْذُ بِكَ أَنْ أُشْرِكَ بِكَ وَأَنَا أَعْلَمُ ، وَأَسْتَغْفِرُكَ لِمَا لا أَعْلَمُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Shirk among you is more hidden than a creeping ant, but I will guide you to something that, if you do it, will remove from you Minor Shirk and its Major type. You should say, “<strong>Oh Allah, I ask for your protection from making Shirk with you while I know, and I ask your forgiveness for what I do not know</strong>.”</span> [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because our belief in Tawḥīd is that Allah is the only one who can help us and we only pray to him, we understand that only he can help us stay away from Shirk completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) taught us to ask his protection from knowingly making Shirk in belief, statement, or action. We must also ask for his forgiveness if we happen to make a mistake by believing, saying, or doing anything that is Shirk that we may not know.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Is the Basmalah (بِسْمِ اللهِ الرَّحْمٰنِ الرَّحِيْمِ) an actual verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah or Not?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh al-Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars hold differing opinions about this issue. Some say that it is definitely a verse from al-Fātiḥah and it should be recited aloud in those prayers which are recited out-loud. They believe it is not correct unless the Basmalah is recited since it is part of the entire chapter of al-Fātiḥah. Other scholars say that it is not a verse of al-Fātiḥah, but it is a separate verse from the book of Allah. This latter opinion is the correct one and is proven by other texts as well as the context of the chapter itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the textual proof, Abū Hurayrah ( رضي الله عنه ) narrated a ḥadīth in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="53610" data-permalink="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/12/16/is-the-basmalah-an-actual-verse-of-surah-al-fati%e1%b8%a5ah-or-not/i-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant/" data-orig-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png" data-orig-size="761,329" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="I have divided the prayer in two parts between myself and my servant" data-image-description="" data-image-caption="" data-medium-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=715" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-53610" src="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=715" alt="I have divided the prayer in two parts between myself and my servant"   srcset="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=550&amp;h=238 550w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=100&amp;h=43 100w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png?w=300&amp;h=130 300w, https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/I-have-divided-the-prayer-in-two-parts-between-myself-and-my-servant.png 761w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah ( تَعَالَى ) says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“I have divided the prayer in two parts between myself and my servant.” When the servant recites, &#8220;All praise and thanks are to Allah, the lord of all creations&#8221;, Allah says, “My servant has praised me.” And when he recites, &#8220;The Most-Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy&#8221;, Allah says, “My servant has honored me.” When he recites, &#8220;The owner of the Day of Recompense&#8221;, Allah says, “My servant has glorified me.” When he recites, &#8220;You alone we worship and from you alone we seek help&#8221;, Allah replies, “This is two parts between my servant and I.” When he recites, &#8220;Guide us to the straight path…&#8221; until the end of the chapter, Allah replies, “This is for My servant and he will have what he asks for.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by Muslim (no. 395)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a textual proof that the <em>Basmalah</em> is not an actual verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah (because it was not the first statement the servant says as mentioned in this ḥadīth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is another authentic statement of Anas ibn Mālik ( رضي الله عنه ) in “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim” in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>I prayed behind the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ), Abū Bakr, and ‘Umar and none of them used to mention “In the name of Allah, the Most-Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy” at the beginning of their recitations (of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah) nor at the end of it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by Muslim (no. 399)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant is that each of them used not to mention it aloud. The fact that there is a distinction between it not being recited aloud as the rest of al-Fātiḥah is recited indicates that it is not actually a part of the chapter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the proof from the context of the other verses’ meanings, Sūrah al-Fātiḥah consists of seven verses as is unanimously agreed upon. If you wanted to measure out seven verses as they pertain to the topics of the chapter, you will find that the middle verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You alone we worship and from you alone we seek help.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the same verse about which Allah says, “This is two parts between my servant and I” in the previous ḥadīth. This is because the first verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">All praise and thanks are for Allah, the Lord of all creations</span>. [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الرَّحْمَنِ الرَّحِيم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The owner of the Day of Recompense.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These three previous verses are all about the rights of Allah (his attribute, actions, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You alone we worship, and from you alone we seek help.</span>[Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the fourth verse and the half-way point and it too is even divided into two parts, one part for Allah (“You alone we worship…”) and one part for the servant (“…from you alone we seek help.”).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following verses are:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اهْدِنَا الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Guide us to the straight path.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is for the servant.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The path of those upon whom You bestowed Your grace.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also for the servant.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلا الضَّالِّينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Not of those who earned anger upon themselves, nor of those who are astray.</span> [Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, 1:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And finally, this last verse is also for the servant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, three verses are for Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) and they are the first three. And three verses are for the servant and they are the last three. One verse is between both the servant and his lord and it is the fourth and middle verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the proof from the context of the wordings, if we say that the <em>Basmalah</em> is a verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah, then the seventh verse would be very long – as long as two of the other verses (thus making the last and incomparably long verse, “The path of those upon whom you bestowed your grace, not of those who earned anger, nor of those who are astray.”). But it is known that the principle of the verses being similar to each other is also regarding their length.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">So, the correct opinion no doubt is that the <em>Basmalah</em> is not a verse of Sūrah al-Fātiḥah just as it is not a verse (at the beginning) of every other chapter in the Qur&#8217;an.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;"><em>Ibn Rajab al-Ḥanbalī’s book, “Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Ḥikam,” is an explanation of the forty-two famous ḥadīth collected by Imām an-Nawawī.  In this article, last part of the  twenty-fourth ḥadīth of that book explained.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَنْ وَجَدَ خَيْرًا فَلْيَحْمَدِ اللهَ، وَمَنْ وَجَدَ غَيْرَ ذَلِكَ فَلا يَلُوْمَنَّ إِلاّ نَفْسَهُ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“&#8230; So whoever finds good, let him thank Allah, and whoever finds other than that, let him blame only himself.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that anything good is from Allah as a favor from himself to his worshipper even though the latter may not actually deserve it. And anything evil is from the children of Adam, from following their inclinations and desires as Allah ( عَزَّ وَجَلَّ ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَّا أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ وَمَا أَصَابَكَ مِن سَيِّئَةٍ فَمِن نَّفْسِكَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">What comes to you of good is from Allah, but what comes to you of evil is from yourself.</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā, 4:79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alī ( رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ ) once said, “<strong>A worshipper should hope from none but Allah and should fear nothing but his own sins</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allah wants prosperity and guidance for someone, he facilitates a way for the individual to obey him, and this is a favor from Allah. But when Allah abandons someone, he entrusts all affairs of the person to the individual himself; Allah renounces the person by removing all connections between himself and the individual. So Satan is then able to deceive such a person so that he becomes negligent of remembering Allah. He follows his own inclinations and desires and consequently his affairs are lost and forsaken. All the while, this is still fair and just from Allah because the evidence has already been established upon the individual by the revelation of the Qur&#8217;aan and the sending of the messenger. So there is no excuse before Allah for any of mankind after the sending of the messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If what is meant by “<strong>So whoever finds good</strong>” is whoever finds good in this life, then such a person is obliged to thank Allah, especially for the good reward of one’s good deeds that may be hastened in this life as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ عَمِلَ صَالِحًا مِّن ذَكَرٍ أَوْ أُنثَى وَهُوَ مُؤْمِنٌ فَلَنُحْيِيَنَّهُ حَيَاةً طَيِّبَةً وَلَنَجْزِيَنَّهُمْ أَجْرَهُم بِأَحْسَنِ مَا كَانُوا يَعْمَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer, we will surely cause him to live a good life. And we will surely give such individuals their reward according to the best of what they used to do.</span> [Sūrah al-Naḥl, 16:97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (upon the understanding above) such a person would be obliged to blame himself for the negative consequences he may experience in the worldly life for the bad deeds he committed as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُم مِّنَ الْعَذَابِ الأَدْنَى دُونَ الْعَذَابِ الأَكْبَرِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And we will surely let them taste the nearer punishment short of the greater punishment that perhaps they will repent.</span> [Sūrah al-Sajdah, 32:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for a true believer, when he is afflicted with any hardship in life, he looks inward, holding himself responsible. This in turn encourages him to return back to Allah with repentance and asking for forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if what is meant by “So whoever finds good…whoever finds other than that” is in the hereafter, then this may be a way of Allah informing that those who find good in the hereafter will thank and praise Allah for that, and those who find otherwise should blame only themselves although at such a time blaming will be of no use. And this is an Arabic linguistic form in which the text is that of a command yet the meaning is actually to inform of a future event just as is the case with the ḥadīth in which the prophet ( صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ كَذَبَ عَلَيَّ مُتَعَمِّدًا فَلْيَتَبَوَّأْ مَقْعَدَهُ مِنْ النَّارِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>Whoever intentionally lies against me, let him occupy his seat in the fire.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[This ḥadīth is mutawātir, meaning that it has been narrated by so many different chains of narrators that it is considered authentic. See for example ḥadīth no.1841 of “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan al-Tirmidhī” by al-Albānī</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Whoever lies against me will indeed occupy his seat in the Hellfire. [The text is in the form of a command but is a way of informing of a future occurrence.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has also informed us that the people of Paradise will thank Allah for that which he provides them of his bounty; he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِم مِّنْ غِلٍّ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهِمُ الأَنْهَارُ وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي هَدَانَا لِهَذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِنَهْتَدِيَ لَوْلا أَنْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And we will have removed whatever is within their breasts of resentment, (while) flowing beneath them are rivers. And they will say, “Praise to Allah who has guided us to this, and we would never have been guided if Allah had not guided us.”</span> [Sūrah al-‘Arāf, 7:43]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي صَدَقَنَا وَعْدَهُ وَأَوْرَثَنَا الْأَرْضَ نَتَبَوَّأُ مِنَ الْجَنَّةِ حَيْثُ نَشَاءُ.</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And they will say, “Praise to Allah who has fulfilled his promise to us and has made us inherit the earth (so) we may settle in Paradise wherever we will.”</span> [Sūrah al-Zumar, 39:74]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he ( تَعَالَى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي أَذْهَبَ عَنَّا الْحَزَنَ إِنَّ رَبَّنَا لَغَفُورٌ شَكُورٌ  الَّذِي أَحَلَّنَا دَارَ الْمُقَامَةِ مِن فَضْلِهِ لا يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا نَصَبٌ وَلا يَمَسُّنَا فِيهَا لُغُوبٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And they will say, “Praise to Allah who has removed from us sorrow. Indeed, our lord is forgiving and appreciative – he who has settled us in the home of duration out of his bounty. There touches us therein no fatigue, and there touches us therein no weariness (of mind).”</span> [Sūrah al-Fāṭir, 35:34-35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the people of the fire, Allah informs us they will be blaming themselves, disgusted with and hating of their own souls. Allah ( تَعَالَى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَالَ الشَّيْطَانُ لَمَّا قُضِيَ الأَمْرُ إِنَّ اللَّهَ وَعَدَكُمْ وَعْدَ الْحَقِّ وَوَعَدتُّكُمْ فَأَخْلَفْتُكُمْ وَمَا كَانَ لِيَ عَلَيْكُم مِّن سُلْطَانٍ إِلاَّ أَن دَعَوْتُكُمْ فَاسْتَجَبْتُمْ لِي فَلا تَلُومُونِي وَلُومُوا أَنفُسَكُم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And Satan will say when the matter has been concluded, “Indeed, Allah had promised you the promise of truth. And I promised you, but I betrayed you. But I had no authority over you except that I invited you and you responded to me. So do not blame me, but blame yourselves.”</span> [Sūrah Ibrāhīm, 14:22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا يُنَادَوْنَ لَمَقْتُ اللَّهِ أَكْبَرُ مِن مَّقْتِكُمْ أَنفُسَكُمْ إِذْ تُدْعَوْنَ إِلَى الإِيمَاَانِ فَتَكْفُرُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, those who disbelieve will be addressed (in Hell), “The hatred of Allah was (even) greater than your hatred of yourselves when you were invited to faith, but you refused.”</span> [Sūrah Ghāfir, 40:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The righteous predecessors used to strive in doing good deeds, fearing the time when deeds will come to an end and they may then blame themselves for their shortcomings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was once said to Masrūq, “If only you would ease up with some of your worship in which you exert yourself.” He replied, “By Allah, even if he came to me and told me he would not punish me, I would exert myself in worship (of him).” He was asked, “Why is that?” to which he said: So that my own soul would pardon me if it entered the fire and so I would not have to blame it. Has there not come to you the statement of Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلا أُقْسِمُ بِالنَّفْسِ اللَّوَّامَةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And I swear by the self-reproaching soul</span>.[Sūrah al-Qiyāmah, 75:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will blame and reproach themselves when they reach Hell. When the angels of punishment embrace them and stand between them and what they desire, when their hopes are cut off, and when mercy is withheld from them, every one of them will begin blaming and reproaching his own soul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muṭraf Ibn ‘Abdullah used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Exert yourself in doing good deeds. If the decision is as we hope for—the mercy of Allah and his forgiveness—then for us will be levels (in Paradise). And if the decision is severe as we fear and of which we are cautious, let us not then say:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">رَبَّنَا أَخْرِجْنَا نَعْمَلْ صَالِحًا غَيْرَ الَّذِي كُنَّا نَعْمَلُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Our Lord, remove us; we will do righteousness other than what we used to do.”</span> [Sūrah Fāṭir, 35:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We will then say, “We did deeds but they did not benefit us.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Eight Event</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Allāh Judges Creation</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word commonly used here, مُحَاسَبَة (<em>muḥāsabah</em>) or حِسَاب (<em>ḥisāb</em>), “judging,” “reckoning,” or “taking to account” is when people will be called to recollect, admit, and be judged on the Day of Resurrection for the actions they did in this life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As far religious evidence for this event, it is confirmed by the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah, the consensus of mainstream Muslims, and even suggested by one’s intellect.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Qur&#8217;aan, Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ إِلَيْنَا إِيَابَهُمْ  ثُمَّ إِنَّ عَلَيْنَا حِسَابَهُم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Certainly, to us is their return, then certainly upon us is their reckoning</span>.[Sūrah al-Ghāshiyah, 88:25-26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Then as for he who is given his record in his right hand, he will be judged with an easy reckoning.</span> [Sūrah al-Inshiqāq, 84:7-8]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Sunnah, numerous ḥadīth have been authentically reported from the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) that Allah will judge his creations. For example, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) used to say in some of his prayers:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ حَاسِبْنِي حِسَابًا يَسِيْرًا </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Oh Allah, call me to account with an easy reckoning.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon hearing this, ‘Āishah (رضي الله عنها) asked, “What is an easy reckoning?” He answered:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَنْ يَنْظُرَ فِي كِتَابِهِ فَيَتَجَاوَزُ عَنْهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>That he looks into his book but pardons him (or finds in his book that he has been pardoned)</em>.</span>[86]</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the consensus among mainstream Muslims, the entire nation of believers has always agreed that Allah will judge creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the intellect, it is understood that Allah will judge us because we have been made responsible for actions: obligated to do some, obligated to avoid some, and obligated to hold certain beliefs. Intellect and wisdom dictates that anyone made responsible for something will be held accountable for it and judged for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">There are, however, some people who will be exempt from being judged;</span></strong> they will be allowed to enter Paradise without judgment or punishment. This has been confirmed in “Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī” and “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim.” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">عُرِضَتْ عَلَيَّ الأُمَمُ فَأَخَذَ النَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ مَعَهُ الأُمَّةُ وَالنَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ مَعَهُ النَّفَرُ وَالنَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ</span><span style="color:#000000;">مَعَهُ الْعَشَرَةُ وَالنَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ مَعَهُ الْخَمْسَةُ وَالنَّبِيُّ يَمُرُّ وَحْدَهُ ، فَنَظَرْتُ فَإِذَا سَوَادٌ كَثِيرٌ </span><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْتُ : يَا جِبْرِيلُ هَؤُلاءِ أُمَّتِي ؟ قَالَ : لا وَلَكِنْ انْظُرْ إِلَى الأُفُقِ ، فَنَظَرْتُ فَإِذَا سَوَادٌ </span><span style="color:#000000;">كَثِيرٌ ، قَالَ : هَؤُلاءِ أُمَّتُكَ وَهَؤُلاءِ سَبْعُونَ أَلْفًا قُدَّامَهُمْ لا حِسَابَ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلا عَذَابَ ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْتُ : وَلِمَ ؟ قَالَ : كَانُوا لا يَكْتَوُونَ وَلا يَسْتَرْقُونَ وَلا يَتَطَيَّرُونَ وَعَلَى رَبِّهِمْ </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">I was shown the nations (of prophets) and I saw a prophet with an entire nation with him, a prophet with only a single follower, a prophet with ten followers, a prophet with five, and a prophet with none. I then saw a huge crowd and asked, “Oh (Angel) Gabriel, is this my nation?” to which he replied, “No, but look to the horizon.” I then looked and saw a huge nation (of followers). Gabriel said, “This is your nation and in front of them are seventy thousand who will have no judgment and no punishment.” I asked, “Why?” He answered, “They did not practice cauterization, did not seek ruqyá (incantations, healings with Qur&#8217;aan recitations), did not believe in good or bad omens, and they relied exclusively on their Lord.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After hearing this, a companion named ‘Ukkāshah Ibn Miḥṣan stood and said to the prophet, “Pray to Allah to make me one of those.” So the prophet said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُمَّ اجْعَلْهُ مِنْهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Oh Allah, make him one of them.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then another man stood and he too asked, “Pray to Allah to make me one of them,” but the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) replied:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">سَبَقَكَ بِهَا عُكَّاشَةُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">‘Ukkāshah beat you to it.</span></em> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is even a narration recorded by Imam Aḥmad (5/280, 281) in which these seventy thousand will each have with them an additional seventy thousand, and all of them (70,000 x 70,000) will enter Paradise without judgment or punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The creations to be judged will also include the Jinn</span></strong>, the creatures created by Allah that are unseen by mankind, because they too are held accountable for their beliefs and actions. So like a human, a disbelieving Jinn will enter the fire:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ ادْخُلُوا فِي أُمَمٍ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِكُم مِّنَ الْجِنِّ وَالإِنسِ فِي النَّارِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Allah) will say, “Enter among nations which had passed on before you of Jinn and mankind into the fire.”</span> [Sūrah al-A’rāf, 7:38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">…and a believing Jinn will enter Paradise according to the opinion of most scholars, and this position is correct as indicated by the statement of Allah about two particular gardens given to those who will enter paradise:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فِيهِنَّ قَاصِرَاتُ الطَّرْفِ لَمْ يَطْمِثْهُنَّ إِنسٌ قَبْلَهُمْ وَلا جَانٌّ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">In them are women limiting (their) glances, untouched before them by man or Jinn. </span>[Sūrah al-Raḥmān, 55:56]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Here is a question: Will animals be judged and held accountable? </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is as far as judging between them to establish justice and fairness for what occurred between them, then yes, they will be judged because the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَتُؤَدُّنَّ الْحُقُوقَ إِلَى أَهْلِهَا يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ حَتَّى يُقَادَ لِلشَّاةِ الْجَلْحَاءِ مِنْ الشَّاةِ الْقَرْنَاءِ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">The rights of justice will be established among those who deserve them on the Day of Resurrection so much so that a ram without horns will be given its rights taken from it by a ram with horns.</span> </em>[Recorded by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But again, this is only for ensuring that complete fairness and justice is finally established. As far as being judged for actions they were responsible for carrying out, then no, animals will not be held accountable as they are not responsible for such actions. They will have neither reward nor punishment.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A Believer’s Judgment</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Describing the manner in which Allah will judge a believer and take him to account, Ibn ‘Umar (رضي الله عنهما) narrated that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) described the private counsel to be held between a true believer and his Lord:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُدْنِي الْمُؤْمِنَ فَيَضَعُ عَلَيْهِ كَنَفَهُ وَيَسْتُرُهُ ، فَيَقُولُ : أَتَعْرِفُ ذَنْبَ كَذَا أَتَعْرِفُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">ذَنْبَ كَذَا ؟ فَيَقُولُ : نَعَمْ أَيْ رَبِّ ، حَتَّى إِذَا قَرَّرَهُ بِذُنُوبِهِ وَرَأَى فِي نَفْسِهِ أَنَّهُ هَلَكَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ : سَتَرْتُهَا عَلَيْكَ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَأَنَا أَغْفِرُهَا لَكَ الْيَوْمَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Allah will draw a believer close, placing him under his care and screening him. Allah will say to him, “Do you remember this sin and that sin?” The person will answer, “Yes, my Lord.” After he is made to confess all of his sins and he sincerely believes he is ruined, Allah will say, “I concealed them for you in life and I forgive you for them today.”</span></em> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While speaking with his servant, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will screen him so that no one will see or hear him during their private conversation. This is a way of Allah (عزّ وجلّ) favoring and showing kindness to a true believer in him. When people make someone confess their crimes publicly in front of everyone, even if they pardon the individual for them, there is still an aspect of scandal and humiliation that remains. Yet if such proceedings were held privately, then this would be a better way of concealing and protecting people from that.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A Disbeliever’s Judgment</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Describing a disbeliever’s judgment, Ibn Taymiyyah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for a disbeliever, they will not be judged in the same manner as someone who has his good and bad deeds weighed. This is because those who disbelieve in Allah have no good deeds at all. Still, their deeds will be counted and they will be held responsible for them; they will be made to confess them and will be humiliated.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this has come in the same ḥadīth of Ibn ‘Umar previously mentioned in which the prophet spoke about how Allah will conceal a believer and speak privately with him. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا الْكُفَّارُ وَالْمُنَافِقُونَ فَيُنَادَى بِهِمْ عَلَى رُءُوسِ الْخَلائِقِ : هَؤُلاءِ الَّذِينَ كَذَبُوا عَلَى اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">But as for the disbelievers and hypocrites, they will be publicly called out in front of all creation and it will be announced, “These are the ones who lied against Allah.”</span> </em>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim,” Abū Hurayrah narrated that the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَلْقَى الْعَبْدَ فَيَقُولُ : أَيْ فُلْ أَلَمْ أُكْرِمْكَ وَأُسَوِّدْكَ وَأُزَوِّجْكَ وَأُسَخِّرْ لَكَ الْخَيْلَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَالإِبِلَ وَأَذَرْكَ تَرْأَسُ وَتَرْبَعُ ؟ فَيَقُولُ : بَلَى ، قَالَ : فَيَقُولُ : أَفَظَنَنْتَ أَنَّكَ مُلاقِيَّ ؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُ : لا ، فَيَقُولُ : فَإِنِّي أَنْسَاكَ كَمَا نَسِيتَنِي ،</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يَلْقَى الثَّانِيَ فَيَقُولُ : أَيْ فُلْ أَلَمْ أُكْرِمْكَ وَأُسَوِّدْكَ وَأُزَوِّجْكَ وَأُسَخِّرْ لَكَ الْخَيْلَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَالإِبِلَ وَأَذَرْكَ تَرْأَسُ وَتَرْبَعُ ؟ فَيَقُولُ.: بَلَى أَيْ رَبِّ ، فَيَقُولُ : أَفَظَنَنْتَ أَنَّكَ مُلاقِيَّ ؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُ : لا ، فَيَقُولُ : فَإِنِّي أَنْسَاكَ كَمَا نَسِيتَنِي ، </span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يَلْقَى الثَّالِثَ ، فَيَقُولُ لَهُ مِثْلَ ذَلِكَ ، فَيَقُولُ : يَا رَبِّ آمَنْتُ بِكَ وَبِكِتَابِكَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَبِرُسُلِكَ وَصَلَّيْتُ وَصُمْتُ وَتَصَدَّقْتُ وَيُثْنِي بِخَيْرٍ مَا اسْتَطَاعَ ، فَيَقُولُ : هَاهُنَا إِذًا ،</span><span style="color:#000000;">قَالَ : ثُمَّ : يُقَالُ لَهُ : الآنَ نَبْعَثُ شَاهِدَنَا عَلَيْكَ ، وَيَتَفَكَّرُ فِي نَفْسِهِ مَنْ ذَا الَّذِي يَشْهَدُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">عَلَيَّ ، فَيُخْتَمُ عَلَى فِيهِ ، وَيُقَالُ لِفَخِذِهِ وَلَحْمِهِ وَعِظَامِهِ : انْطِقِي ، فَتَنْطِقُ فَخِذُهُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَحْمُهُ وَعِظَامُهُ بِعَمَلِهِ ، وَذَلِكَ لِيُعْذِرَ مِنْ نَفْسِهِ وَذَلِكَ الْمُنَافِقُ وَذَلِكَ الَّذِي يَسْخَطُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Allah will meet with a servant, asking, “Oh so-and-so, did I not honor you, give you authority, give you a spouse, give you control over horses and camels, and made you a leader (or allowed you to live a comfortable life)?” The person will reply, “You did.” Allah will ask him, “Did you think you would ever meet me?” and he will answer, “No.” So Allah will say, “Then I will forget you as you forgot me.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Then Allah will meet with a second person and ask, “Oh so-and-so, did I not honor you, give you authority, give you a spouse, give you control over horses and camels, and made you a leader (or allowed you to live a comfortable life)?” The person will reply, “You did, my Lord.” Allah will ask him, “Did you think you would ever meet me?” and he will answer, “No.” So Allah will say, “Then I will forget you as you forgot me.”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">Allah will then meet with a third person and will ask him similarly as he did with the others, but this person will say, “My Lord, I believed in you, in your book, and in your messengers. I prayed, fasted, and gave charity.” And he will continue praising the good (he did) as much as he can. Allah will say, “(Stop) then. Now we will bring forth our witness against you.” The person will think to himself about who this witness could be to testify against him. His mouth will then be sealed and his legs, his flesh and bones will be told, “Speak.” His legs, flesh, and bones will then speak about what he did. That is the person who will have no excuse for himself; that is the hypocrite, and that is the one with whom Allah is angry.</span></em> [Recorded by Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the Day of Judgment, the first people to be judged will be this nation, the Muslims who followed Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), based on the prophet’s statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">نَحْنُ الآخِرُوْنَ السَّابِقُوْنَ يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ المَقْضِيُّ بَيْنَهُمْ قَبْلَ الخَلائِقِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">We are the last ones (in this life) but the first ones on the Day of Resurrection to have their accounts settled before the rest of creation.</span></em> [94]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, Ibn ‘Abbās (رضي الله عنهما) narrated that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">نَحْنُ آخِرُ الأُمَمِ وَأَوَّلُ مَنْ يُحَاسَبُ ، يُقَالُ : أَيْنَ الأُمَّةُ الأُمِّيَّةُ وَنَبِيُّهَا ؟ فَنَحْنُ الآخِرُونَ الأَوَّلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">We are the last religious nation (in this life) but the first to be judged. It will be said, “Where is the illiterate nation and its prophet?” So we are the last ones yet the first ones</span></em>.[95]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first thing for which a worshipper of Allah will be judged and called to account regarding the rights of Allah will be his prayer based on the statement of the prophet :(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَّلُ مَا يُحَاسَبُ بِهِ الْعَبْدُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ الصَلاة ، فَإِنْ صَلُحَتْ صَلُحَ سَائِرُ عَمَلِهِ ،  وَإِنْ فَسَدَتْ فَسَدَ سَائِرُ عَمَلِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>The first thing for which a worshipper will be judged on the Day of Resurrection will be prayer. If it is sound, the rest of his deeds will be sound, but if it is bad, the rest of his deeds will be bad</em>.</span> [96]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the first crimes to be judged regarding the rights of other people will be those pertaining to bloodshed as he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَّلَ مَا يُقْضَى بَيْنَ النَّاسِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فِي الدِّمَاءِ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">The first thing to be settled between people on the Day of Resurrection will be (crimes of) bloodshed.</span></em>[97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because prayer is the best bodily act of worship related to the rights of Allah, and bloodshed is the greatest violation of communal rights related to mankind.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[86] Recorded by Aḥmad (6/48) and Ibn Abī ‘Āṣim in “<em>Kitāb al-Sunnah</em>” (no. 885). al-Albānī said it is authentic in his checking of “<em>Kitāb al-Sunnah</em>” (2/429).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[94] Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim. In a similar ḥadīth, also recorded by them both, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">نَحْنُ الآخِرُونَ السَّابِقُونَ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ أُوتُوا الْكِتَابَ مِنْ قَبْلِنَا وَأُوتِينَاهُ مِنْ بَعْدِهِمْ ، فَهَذَا الْيَوْمُ الَّذِي اخْتَلَفُوا فِيهِ فَهَدَانَا اللَّهُ فَغَدًا لِلْيَهُودِ وَبَعْدَ غَدٍ لِلنَّصَارَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808000;">We are the last ones but the first ones on the Day of Resurrection. They were given the scripture before us and we were given it after them. So this is the day they differed about, but Allah has guided us. So tomorrow is for the Jews, and the day after is for the Christians.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[95] Recorded by Ibn Mājah, Aḥmad, and al-Bayhaqī. al-Albānī said it is authentic in “<em>Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Ibn Mājah</em>” (no. 3463).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[96] Recorded by al-Tirmidhī, al-Nasāī, Ibn Mājah, and al-Ṭabarānī. The text is from al-Ṭabarānī and al-Albānī said it is authentic in “<em>Ṣaḥīḥ al-Targhīb wal-Tarhīb</em>” (1/185).</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Seventh Event</strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Books of Deeds are Distributed</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People’s books of deeds will be distributed, open for them to read. An individual’s book of deeds is the register with every action he did in life written inside. These deeds are being written now by the angels entrusted with recording the actions of all the children of Adam. Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنَّ عَلَيْكُمْ لَحَافِظِينَ كِرَامًا كَاتِبِينَ يَعْلَمُونَ مَا تَفْعَلُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And indeed, (appointed) over you are keepers, honorable recorders. They know whatever you do.</span> [Surah al-Isrā, 82:10-12][69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These angels record in a book everything a person does because they are always with him. And on the Day of Resurrection, Allah will bring forth this book, making it known to the person as he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكُلَّ إِنسَانٍ أَلْزَمْنَاهُ طَائِرَهُ فِي عُنُقِهِ وَنُخْرِجُ لَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ كِتَابًا يَلْقَاهُ مَنشُورًا </span><span style="color:#000000;">اقْرَأْ كِتَابَكَ كَفَى بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Every person, we have imposed his fate upon his neck. And we will produce for him, on the Day of Resurrection, a record which he will find spread open. (It will be said to him,) “Read your book. You are sufficient today as a reckoner against yourself. </span>[Surah al-Isrā, 17:13-14.]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Recording of Good Deeds</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both good deeds and bad deeds are written in these books. As for the good deeds, the actions a person actually does are recorded, as are his good intentions and even those deeds he intends to do but may not have actually done them. So there are three types of rewarded behavior: 1) good deeds performed, 2) good intentions, and 3) good deeds intended but not performed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Good Deeds:</strong> </span>It is clear that a person’s good deeds are written.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Good Intentions:</strong></span> Intending to do a good deed is also recorded in a person’s favor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But a reward is given for only the intention and not necessarily the action intended. This is based on the hadith of a rich man who spends his wealth in charity and a poor man who says, “<strong>If I had wealth, I would do what he does</strong>.” About these two, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَأَجْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>He is rewarded for his intention, and the reward is the same for both</em>.</span>[71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So both the rich and poor are equally rewarded in intention but not in action. This is also confirmed by the narration in which the poor immigrants of Medina complained to the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) saying, “Oh messenger of Allah, the wealthy have overtaken us (in reward).” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said (as a way to catch up with the wealthy in rewards):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تُسَبِّحُونَ وَتُكَبِّرُونَ وَتَحْمَدُونَ دُبُرَ كُلِّ صَلاةٍ ثَلاثًا وَثَلاثِينَ مَرَّة</span></h2>
<p><em><span style="color:#808000;">Glorify Allah, declare his greatness, and thank him after each prayer thirty-three times.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when this advice reached the wealthy, they too did likewise. So the poor returned, complaining to the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) again that the rich are now doing both— giving charity and praising Allah after the prayers. He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَلِكَ فَضْلُ اللَّهِ يُؤْتِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>That is the favor of Allah he gives to whom he wishes. </em></span>[Recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet did not reply the second time that the poor, despite their sincere intentions, would have the same reward as the rich in deed. And this is fair because a man who does not perform a certain deed is not the same as the one who actually does it, yet he may still get a similar reward for the intention alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Good Deeds Intended but Not Performed:</strong> </span>The third type of rewarded behavior which a person may find written in his book of deeds is the actions he may sincerely intend to do but did not actually do them. The difference between this type and the second is that for these intentions, he does receive a reward for the action itself. These are the deeds that an individual may intend to do and perhaps he does as much as he is able to of such deed. Then something prevents him from completing the deed. In such case, a full good deed will be recorded based on the statement of Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَخْرُجْ مِن بَيْتِهِ مُهَاجِرًا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ ثُمَّ يُدْرِكْهُ الْمَوْتُ فَقَدْ وَقَعَ أَجْرُهُ عَلَى اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever leaves his home as an emigrant to Allah and his messenger and then death overtakes him, his reward has already become incumbent upon Allah.</span>[Surah al-Nisa, 4:100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this is also good news for students of religious knowledge. For example, if someone intends to study religious knowledge for the purpose of benefiting others with such information, defending the Sunnah of the messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and spreading Allah’s religion throughout the earth, yet he is unable to complete his studies—perhaps he dies in the process, for example—he will still have those good deeds recorded for him and he will achieve its rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even if a person has a habit of performing a particular good deed but for some reason he is unable to do it under certain circumstances, he still has the good deed recorded for him. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا مَرِضَ الْعَبْدُ أَوْ سَافَرَ كُتِبَ لَهُ مِثْلُ مَا كَانَ يَعْمَلُ مُقِيمًا صَحِيحًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>When a servant becomes sick or travels, whatever he used to do while residing at home or healthy will still be recorded for him.</em></span> [Recorded by al-Bukhari]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Recording of Bad Deeds</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for bad deeds, they are written against a person if: 1) he actually does a bad deed, 2) he intends and hopes to do the bad deed, and 3) he intends to do the bad deed and tries to commit it but for some reason he is unable to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Bad Deeds:</strong></span> This is clear; if someone does a bad deed, he has it recorded against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Bad Intentions:</strong> </span>Sins an individual intends or hopes to do are also written against him. But like good intentions, he has a bad deed recorded for the intention and not a full bad deed for the action intended. The proof of this is in the same hadith mentioned about good intentions. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) spoke about a person Allah had provided wealth but no knowledge so that he aimlessly wasted his wealth. A person Allah had given neither wealth nor knowledge then said, “If I had wealth, I would do what he does,” admiring the former’s wasteful spending. So the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَوِزْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>He is recorded for his intention, and the sin is the same for both of them.</em></span> [75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As for an individual intending to do a bad deed but refrains from it, this is of three types:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">1) If the person does not do the deed because he was unable though he tried to do it, he is just like a person who actually did the bad deed,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">2) If he refrains from doing the deed for the sake of Allah, he is rewarded, and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">3) If he simply decides not to do it (but not for the sake of Allah) or even if committing the deed did not seriously cross his mind, then he has neither sin nor reward written for him.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Bad Deeds Intended but Not Performed:</strong> </span>These are also recorded against a person as complete bad deeds if the person tried his utmost to do them based on the statement (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) of the prophet:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَا تَوَاجَهَ الْمُسْلِمَانِ بِسَيْفَيْهِمَا فَكِلاهُمَا مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#808000;"><em>If two Muslims face off with their swords (i.e. if they fight to the death), both of them are people of the fire.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After hearing this, the companions asked, “Messenger of Allah, we understand about the killer, but why the one killed too?” He replied:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّهُ أَرَادَ قَتْلَ صَاحِبِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>He also wanted to kill his opponent.</em></span>[Recorded by al-Bukhari and Muslim.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, if someone wanted to drink alcohol but something happened so that he was unable to do it, it is still recorded against him as a bad deed because he tried as much as he could to commit it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude this topic we must know that Allah rewards good deeds with rewards greater than the original good deed, but He recompenses a bad deed only equivalent to the original sin; He says (تعالى) :</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَن جَاءَ بِالْحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أَمْثَالِهَا وَمَن جَاءَ بِالسَّيِّئَةِ فَلا يُجْزَى إِلاَّ مِثْلَهَا وَهُمْ لا يُظْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><em>Whoever comes (on the Day of Judgment) with a good deed will have ten times the like thereof, and whoever comes with an evil deed will not be recompensed except the like thereof, and they will not be wronged.</em></span> [77]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Receiving the Books of Deeds</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the distribution of these books and the ways in which people will receive them, Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا وَيَنقَلِبُ إِلَى أَهْلِهِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَسْرُورًا وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ وَرَاءَ ظَهْرِهِ فَسَوْفَ يَدْعُو ثُبُورًا وَيَصْلَى سَعِيرًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Then as for he who is given his record in his right hand, he will be judged with an easy reckoning, and he will return to his people in happiness. But as for he who is given his record behind his back, he will cry out for destruction, and he will burn in a blaze.</span>[Surah al-Inshiqaq, 84:7-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِشِمَالِهِ فَيَقُولُ يَا لَيْتَنِي لَمْ أُوتَ كِتَابِيَهْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But as for he who is given his record in his left hand, he will say, “Oh, I wish I had never been given my record.” </span>[Surah al-Haqqah, 69:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the Day of Judgment, people will receive their books of deeds in different ways. Some will be given their books in their right hands – these are the believers. In this is also an indication that the right hand is more honorable and so a believer is given his book in his right hand. When the believer receives his book of deeds, he will take it with his right hand, rejoice, then cry out:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ فَيَقُولُ هَاؤُمُ اقْرَءُوا كِتَابِيَهْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So as for he who is given his record in his right hand, he will say, “Here,read my record!” </span>[Surah al-Haqqah, 69:19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for a disbeliever in Allah, he receives his book of deeds in his left hand or from behind his back. He will then cry out for destruction:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِشِمَالِهِ فَيَقُولُ يَا لَيْتَنِي لَمْ أُوتَ كِتَابِيَهْ وَلَمْ أَدْرِ مَا حِسَابِيَهْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But as for he who is given his record in his left hand, he will say, “Oh, I wish I had never been given my record and had never known what my account was.</span>[Surah al-Haqqah, 69:25-26.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the manner in which people receive their books of deeds is of three types: in the right hand, in the left hand, and behind the back. But these three types are only different in description and are not three separate ways books will be distributed. This is because if an individual receives his book of deeds from behind his back, he is at the same time given his book in his left hand—he takes it with his left hand, reaching his hand behind him. And since he receives his book with his left hand, he is known as one of the “People of the Left.” [82] He receives his book behind his back because during his life, he turned his back on the book of Allah. So it is only befitting that in return, he is given his book of deeds from behind his back, and Allah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude, Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكُلَّ إِنسَانٍ أَلْزَمْنَاهُ طَائِرَهُ فِي عُنُقِهِ وَنُخْرِجُ لَهُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ كِتَابًا يَلْقَاهُ مَنشُورًا </span><span style="color:#000000;">اقْرَأْ كِتَابَكَ كَفَى بِنَفْسِكَ الْيَوْمَ عَلَيْكَ حَسِيبًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Every person, we have imposed his fate upon his neck. And we will produce for him, on the Day of Resurrection, a record which he will find spread open. (It will be said to him,) “Read your book. You are sufficient today as a reckoner against yourself. </span>[Surah al-Isra, 17:13-14.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his fate (i.e. his deeds) imposed on his neck, this is the most befitting attachment for a person’s deeds – bound to his neck – because he will never be separated from them until he dies. He will find his book open; he neither expends effort nor does he find difficulty in opening it. &#8220;<strong>Read your book</strong>&#8221; Read what has been written for or against you. &#8220;<strong>Your own self is sufficient as a reckoner against you today</strong>&#8220;. This is the perfection of justice and fairness – that the individual will be responsible for taking himself to account.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have in front of us now a door we may close on every bad deed, every sin: repentance. Regardless of how great a sin may be, when someone repents to Allah, he will forgive him. Even if a person continuously repeated the same sin but he repents, Allah will forgive him. The matter is still within our hands, so we must ensure that nothing is written in this book except righteous deeds before Allah judges creation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[69] Surah al-Isrā, 82:10-12.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Surah Qaf, 50:17-18, Allah informs us that the angels are seated on the right and left of us:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذْ يَتَلَقَّى الْمُتَلَقِّيَانِ عَنِ الْيَمِينِ وَعَنِ الشِّمَالِ قَعِيدٌ مَّا يَلْفِظُ مِن قَوْلٍ إِلاَّ لَدَيْهِ رَقِيبٌ عَتِيدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">When the two receivers receive, seated on the right and on the left. Not a word does he utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[71] Recorded by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah and al-Albani said it is authentic in “Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi” (no. 1894).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The full text of the hadith is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ثَلاثَةٌ أُقْسِمُ عَلَيْهِنَّ وَأُحَدِّثُكُمْ حَدِيثًا فَاحْفَظُوهُ ، قَالَ : مَا نَقَصَ مَالُ عَبْدٍ مِنْ صَدَقَةٍ ، وَلا ظُلِمَ عَبْدٌ مَظْلَمَةً فَصَبَرَ عَلَيْهَا إِلاَّ زَادَهُ اللَّهُ عِزًّا ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَلا فَتَحَ عَبْدٌ بَابَ مَسْأَلَةٍ إِلاَّ فَتَحَ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ بَابَ فَقْرٍ &#8211; أَوْ كَلِمَةً نَحْوَهَا &#8211; وَأُحَدِّثُكُمْ حَدِيثًا فَاحْفَظُوهُ ، قَالَ : إِنَّمَا الدُّنْيَا لأَرْبَعَةِ نَفَرٍ : عَبْدٍ </span><span style="color:#000000;">رَزَقَهُ اللَّهُ مَالاً وَعِلْمًا فَهُوَ يَتَّقِي فِيهِ رَبَّهُ وَيَصِلُ فِيهِ رَحِمَهُ ، وَيَعْلَمُ لِلَّهِ فِيهِ حَقًّا فَهَذَا بِأَفْضَلِ الْمَنَازِلِ ، وَعَبْدٍ رَزَقَهُ اللَّهُ عِلْمًا وَلَمْ يَرْزُقْهُ مَالاً </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَهُوَ صَادِقُ النِّيَّةِ يَقُولُ : لَوْ أَنَّ لِي مَالاً لَعَمِلْتُ بِعَمَلِ فُلانٍ ، فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَأَجْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ ، وَعَبْدٍ رَزَقَهُ اللَّهُ مَالاً وَلَمْ يَرْزُقْهُ عِلْمًا فَهُوَ يَخْبِطُ فِي </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَالِهِ بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ لا يَتَّقِي فِيهِ رَبَّهُ وَلا يَصِلُ فِيهِ رَحِمَهُ وَلا يَعْلَمُ لِلَّهِ فِيهِ حَقًّا فَهَذَا بِأَخْبَثِ الْمَنَازِلِ ، وَعَبْدٍ لَمْ يَرْزُقْهُ اللَّهُ مَالاً وَلا عِلْمًا فَهُوَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَقُولُ : لَوْ أَنَّ لِي مَالاً لَعَمِلْتُ فِيهِ بِعَمَلِ فُلانٍ ، فَهُوَ بِنِيَّتِهِ فَوِزْرُهُمَا سَوَاءٌ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There are three things that I attest to; I will mention them so remember them. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">1) Charity will never decrease a person’s wealth, </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">2) no servant is wronged and patiently endures that except that Allah will increase him in honor, and </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">3) no servant opens the door of begging except that Allah will open the door of poverty (or he said similarly). </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color:#000000;">And I will mention something else so remember it. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The world is for four types of people: </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">1) a person Allah has provided with wealth and knowledge so he is conscientious of his Lord regarding them and thus gains his mercy therewith. He knows Allah has a right upon him with regards to them, and this is the best of the (four) types. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">2) A person Allah has provided with knowledge but not wealth, yet he is truthful in his intention when he says, “If I had wealth, I would do what so-and-so does (the first type of person).” So he is rewarded for his intention, and the reward is the same for both of them. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">3) A person Allah has provided wealth but no knowledge so that he aimlessly wastes his wealth without knowledge. He is neither conscientious of his Lord with it nor does he achieve his mercy. He does not even know that Allah has a right upon him regarding it, and this is the worst of the (four) types. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">4) A person Allah has provided no wealth and no knowledge. But he says, “If I had wealth, I would do what so-and-so does (the third type of person).” So he is also recorded for his intention, and the sin is the same for both of them.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[75] Recorded by al-Tirmidhi and Ibn Majah and al-Albani said it is authentic in “Sahih Sunan al-Tirmidhi” (no. 1894). See page 53 for the full hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[77] Surah al-Anaam, 6:160.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Evidence from the Sunnah of a ten-fold reward for a good deed and only a single recompense for a bad deed is the hadith recorded by Muslim in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يقول الله : مَنْ جَاء بالحَسَنَةِ فَلَهُ عَشْرُ أمْثَالِهَا أَوْ أزْيَد ، وَمَنْ جَاءَ بالسَيِّئَةِ فَجَزاءُ سَيِّئَةٍ سَيِّئَةٌ مِثْلُهَا أَوْ أغْفِرُ . وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي شِبْرًا تَقَرَّبْتُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">مِنْهُ ذِرَاعًا ، وَمَنْ تَقَرَّبَ مِنِّي ذِرَاعًا تَقَرَّبْتُ مِنْهُ بَاعًا ، وَمَنْ أتَانِي يَمْشِي أتَيْتُهُ هَرْوَلَةً ، وَمَنْ لَقِيني بِقُرَابِ الأرْض خَطِيئةً لا يُشْرِكُ بِي شَيئاً ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">لَقِيتُهُ بِمِثْلِهَا مَغفِرَةً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah says, “Whoever does a good deed will have ten times reward for it or even more. And whoever does a bad deed will have a single bad deed for it or I will forgive it. Whoever comes close to me a hand-span, I will come close to him an arm’s length; and whoever comes close to me an arm’s length, I will come close to him the distance of two outstretched arms. Whoever comes to me walking, I will come to him running. And whoever meets me with the earth full of sins but associated nothing with me in worship, I will meet him with as much forgiveness.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[82] A similar description is used in the Surah al-Waqi’ah, 56:8-9:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْمَيْمَنَةِ وَأَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ مَا أَصْحَابُ الْمَشْأَمَةِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Companions of the Right – what are the Companions of the Right? And the Companions of the Left – what re the Companions of the Left?</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of Verse 4 of Sooratul Faatiha</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"> إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ </span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">iyyāka na’budu wa iyyāka nasta’īn</span></strong></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">You alone we worship, and from you alone we seek help.</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;You alone&#8221; (iyyāka)</strong>: This is a case in grammar when the direct object comes before the verb, <strong>&#8220;we worship&#8221; (na’budu)</strong>. In Arabic grammar, when the direct object precedes the verb, it gives a sense of restriction, so the meaning would be, “<strong>We do not worship anyone or anything except you alone</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;we worship&#8221; (na’budu)</strong>: Meaning: We humble ourselves to you in complete humility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this way, you find the believers placing the most honorable part of their bodies (their faces) at the level of their feet in humility to Allah (عزّ وجلّ). They prostrate on the ground, covering their foreheads with dirt. This is from their humbleness before Allah. And if another person were to say, “I will give you the whole world and what it contains, just prostrate to me once,” you will never find true believers accepting this because this type of humility is a form of worship specifically for Allah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word “<strong>worship</strong>” includes doing everything Allah commands and avoiding everything he forbids. Whoever is not in accordance with this, not carrying out what he is commanded to do and avoiding what he is forbidden to do then he is not a true worshipper and servant. A worshipper is someone who obeys the one he worships in whatever he legislates. So, worship requires that mankind carry out everything they are commanded to do and avoid everything they are forbidden from doing. However, it is not possible to fulfill all of these duties without the help and assistance of Allah. Because of this, Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) then says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;and from you alone we seek help&#8221; (wa iyyāka nasta’īn)</strong>: Meaning, “We do not seek the help of anyone else in worship or in anything else.” This “seeking of help” is to request the help and assistance, and Allah combines between worship and the seeking of assistance or reliance in many places the noble Qur&#8217;an. This is because worship could not be completely established except with the help of Allah by entrusting one’s affairs to him, and relying on him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Points of Benefit of al-Fātiḥah, Verse 4:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From the virtues of this verse is the sincerity in worship that is due to Allah alone as he says, &#8220;<strong>You alone we worship</strong>&#8220;. It shows that this worship is due only to Allah by the direct object (“<strong>You</strong>”) coming before the verb (“<strong>we worship</strong>”) according to the rules of Arabic grammar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Another point is that seeking help is also sincerely and solely for Allah based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>and from you alone we seek help</strong>&#8220;. Likewise, the direct object precedes the verb indicating a sense of restriction just like in the first part of the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those points being said, what if someone asks:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">How is it that seeking help is exclusively for Allah alone when there has come in another verse:</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And help one another in righteousness and piety</span>.[Sūrah al-Māidah, 5:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, how do we understand the previous statements about seeking help only from Allah when, here in this verse, Allah confirms that seeking help from other than himself is permissible (rather it is a command here)? Also, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"> تُعِيْنُ الرَّجُلَ فِي دَابَّتِهِ، فَتَحْمِلُهُ عَلَيْهَا، أَوْ تَرْفَعُ لَهُ عَلَيْهَا مَتَاعَهُ صَدَقَةٌ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Helping someone onto his riding animal, carrying him on it, or lifting his belongings up to him while he is on it &#8211; all of these are (considered) acts of charity</span>. [Recorded by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 2891) and Muslim (no. 1009)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this question is that the act of seeking help and assistance is of two types. The first type is to request help while entrusting all affairs to the one you ask from. For example, you rely completely on Allah and you realize that any result you seek will not come from your own power or capability. This type of seeking help is specific for Allah ( تعالى ); he alone deserves this type.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second type is to request help or cooperation in something you want to accomplish. This type is permissible as long as the one being requested is living and capable of doing what is asked of him. This is not considered a form of worship. This is the type that Allah refers to when saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُوا عَلَى الْبِرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And help one another in righteousness and piety.</span> [Sūrah al-Māidah, 5:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is further asked, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">Is seeking help from the creation permissible at all times and in all situations?</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is no. Requesting help from the creation is only allowed when the one being asked is fully capable of what he is being asked for, otherwise seeking his help is not permissible. An example would be asking help from someone dead in his grave; this is prohibited, rather it is major Shirk (the associating of partners with Allah in worship)! This is because the person in his grave does not even have the ability to help himself, so how could he help someone else? Similarly, if someone seeks the help of another person who is not present with him such as a person believing that someone else in the far eastern part of the world could help him with something in his (the one seeking help) land – this is also major Shirk because the person whose help is sought is not capable of helping the seeker while they are in different lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is now asked, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">So, is it permissible to seek help from the creation if these conditions are met?</span>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is that it is better not to ask anyone for any help unless it is absolutely necessary or if it is known that the person would be happy to provide help. In this case, one could request his assistance in order to please him. The act that you seek another’s help in fulfilling must also not be something sinful and prohibited.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Fifteenth Event</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Believers See Their Lord</strong></span></h2>
<h2></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">وُجُوهٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ نَّاضِرَةٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّهَا نَاظِرَةٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">(Some) faces that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord</span>. [Sūrah al-Qiyāmah, 75:22-23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To explain the verse, &#8220;<strong>faces that day</strong>&#8221; means on the last day, the Day of Resurrection. &#8220;<strong>radiant</strong>&#8221; here includes beauty because the word used in the verse comes from the Arabic word نَضَارَة (naḍārah) which means beauty. This meaning is also indicated in the statement of Allah (in which a similar form of the same word is used):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَوَقَاهُمُ اللَّهُ شَرَّ ذَٰلِكَ الْيَوْمِ وَلَقَّاهُمْ نَضْرَةً وَسُرُورًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So Allah will protect them from the evil of that day and give them radiance and happiness.</span> [Sūrah al-Insān, 76:11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In other words: beauty in their faces and happiness in their hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;<strong>looking at their Lord</strong>&#8220;, it is real sight which occurs from the faces and by the eyes. This is different from insight that may occur within the heart (similar to the English usage, “I will look into it.”) which means thinking about or considering something. Here, however, the looking occurs from the faces and is directed toward the Lord (عزّ وجلّ) just as is explicitly indicated by &#8220;<strong>at their Lord</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble verse means that these radiant, beautiful faces will be looking directly at their Lord (عزّ وجلّ) and, consequently, will increase in beauty. Look at how these faces were prepared, made ready to look at Allah (عزّ وجلّ) – they will have been made bright and beautiful in preparation to look upon the face of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse is a clear proof that Allah will actually be seen with actual eyes and this is the position of mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah (<em>Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jamā’ah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have proven this with the same verses mentioned herein and they also learn this from the numerous statements of the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) transmitted to the companions and to their followers and so on. So these texts are explicitly clear as evidence confirming this (the believers seeing Allah in the hereafter) because they are within the book of Allah (تعالى) and the Sunnah of his messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and they are reported by many different chains of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah hold the belief that the looking, the sight mentioned here, is real. It does not mean “perception” or “complete awareness” because Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">لَّا تُدْرِكُهُ الْأَبْصَارُ وَهُوَ يُدْرِكُ الْأَبْصَارَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Vision does not perceive him. </span>[Sūrah al-An’ām, 6:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as knowing with one’s heart does not necessarily equate to perceiving his true reality. Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِهِ عِلْمًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">But they do not encompass him with knowledge. </span>[Sūrah ṬāHā, 20:110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know our Lord with our hearts yet we still do not know exactly how he is. Similarly, on the Day of Resurrection we will see our Lord with our own eyes, yet our sight will still not completely perceive him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second verse indicating that believers will see their Lord is the statement of Allah:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">عَلَى الْأَرَائِكِ يَنظُرُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">On thrones, looking. </span>[Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah did not mention in this verse specifically what they are looking at so it is general, including anything that is pleasing to look at. The greatest and most pleasing sight is to look upon Allah (تعالى) as he says in the very next verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَعْرِفُ فِي وُجُوهِهِمْ نَضْرَةَ النَّعِيمِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You will recognize in their faces the radiance of pleasure.</span> [Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the context of the verse is similar to the first one, &#8220;faces that day will be radiant, looking at their Lord&#8221; and they will be looking at everything that pleases them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third verse regarding the believers looking at Allah is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لِّلَّذِينَ أَحْسَنُوا الْحُسْنَىٰ وَزِيَادَةٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.</span> [Sūrah Yūnus, 10:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;the best&#8221;, it is Paradise and &#8220;even more&#8221; is the believers looking at the face of Allah. This is how the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) explained this verse as is confirmed in the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim and others:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا دَخَلَ أَهْلُ الْجَنَّةِ الْجَنَّةَ ، قَالَ : يَقُولُ اللَّهُ تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى : تُرِيدُونَ شَيْئًا أَزِيدُكُمْ.؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُونَ : أَلَمْ تُبَيِّضْ وُجُوهَنَا ؟ أَلَمْ تُدْخِلْنَا الْجَنَّةَ وَتُنَجِّنَا مِنْ النَّارِ ؟ قَالَ : فَيَكْشِفُ</span><span style="color:#000000;"> الْحِجَابَ فَمَا أُعْطُوا شَيْئًا أَحَبَّ إِلَيْهِمْ مِنْ النَّظَرِ إِلَى رَبِّهِمْ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When the people of Paradise have entered Paradise, Allah (تبارك وتعالى) will ask, “Do you want me to give you something more?” They will say, “Have you not brightened our faces? Have you not already admitted us into Paradise and saved us from the fire?” He will then remove the covering and they will not have been given anything more beloved to them than looking at their Lord (عزّ وجلّ)</span> [Recorded by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After saying that, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then recited the verse, &#8220;For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.&#8221; So this verse is evidence of seeing Allah as the messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) has explained, and no doubt, he is the most knowledgeable person of the Quran’s meanings. He explained that it means looking at the face of Allah and this is the &#8220;even more&#8221; reward the believers will be given in addition to the previous delights of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this blessing is not the same types of blessing as are well-known of Paradise. Many of the delights of Paradise are physical in nature: rivers to enjoy, physical rewards, fruits, pure spouses, etc. Then the blessings and pleasures of the heart follow. But looking at Allah is a direct delight pleasing to the heart. The people of Paradise will have never seen anything more enjoyable or satisfying than that. We ask Allah to make us those who see him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This blessing is in no way comparable to anything else, not the fruits of Paradise, its rivers, or anything else. Because of this, Allah said &#8220;For those who have done good is the best (reward) and even more.&#8221; because it is in addition to even the best rewards of Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth verse is:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">لَهُم مَّا يَشَاءُونَ فِيهَا وَلَدَيْنَا مَزِيدٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There they will have all that they desire and with us is even more.</span> [Sūrah Qāf, 50:35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many scholars have explained &#8220;but with us is even more&#8221; just how the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) explained it – that it is looking at the face of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those are the four verses the author (Ibn Taymiyyah) mentions as proof of the believers seeing Allah. There is also a fifth verse from which Imam al-Shāfi’ī deduced that the believers will see Allah. It is the statement of Allah (تعالى) about the wicked sinners:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">كَلَّا إِنَّهُمْ عَن رَّبِّهِمْ يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّمَحْجُوبُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">No! Surely, they will be veiled from (seeing) their Lord that day.</span> [Sūrah al-Muṭaffifīn, 83:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point he makes from the verse is that since such people will be veiled from Allah due to his anger with them, then it can be understood that those with whom he is pleased will not be veiled. So if the people who gain his anger are veiled from Allah then the people who gain his pleasure will see Him (عزّ وجلّ)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This deduction of Imam al-Shāfi’ī is definitely very strong because if everyone was going to be veiled, prevented from seeing their Lord, then there would have been no reason to specifically mention only the wicked people in the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also believe that seeing Allah in this life is impossible. This is because the current nature and condition of humans is one that cannot bear looking at Allah (عزّ وجلّ). How could it when the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) told us about his Lord:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حِجَابُهُ النُّورُ ، لَوْ كَشَفَهُ لأَحْرَقَتْ سُبُحَاتُ وَجْهِهِ مَا انْتَهَى إِلَيْهِ بَصَرُهُ مِنْ خَلْقِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">His veil is light. If he were to remove it, the splendor of his face would burn his creation, consuming it as far as his sight reaches.</span>[Recorded by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for seeing Allah in the hereafter, it is certainly possible because people that day will be in a different world. Their nature and condition will be different than they are in this life. And this is known from all the texts of the Quran and Sunnah that tell about how people will be, what they will experience during the events of the resurrection and of their final abode in either the home of bliss or Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About the believers seeing their Lord, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was once with his companions on a night when the full moon was out. He looked up at the moon and said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّكُمْ سَتَرَوْنَ رَبَّكُمْ كَمَا تَرَوْنَ هَذَا الْقَمَرَ ، لا تُضَامُونَ فِي رُؤْيَتِهِ ، فَإِنْ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَنْ  لا تُغْلَبُوا عَلَى صَلاةٍ قَبْلَ طُلُوعِ الشَّمْسِ وَصَلاةٍ قَبْلَ غُرُوبِ الشَّمْسِ فَافْعَلُوا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">You will certainly see your Lord just as you can see this moon; you will have no trouble in seeing him. So if you can avoid missing a prayer before the sun rises and a prayer before it sets, then do so.</span> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement, “You will certainly see your Lord” is addressed to the believers. As for “just as you can see this moon,” this is a real, actual seeing because when we see the moon, it is actual sight with our eyes. The comparison here is between the sight of the moon and the sight of Allah, and it is not a comparison between the moon and Allah because there is nothing like or comparable to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) would sometimes try to bring the meaning of what he is talking about closer to people by mentioning what they understand of perceptible things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, Abū Razīn al-‘Uqaylī, a companion of the messenger, once asked him, “Messenger of Allah, will each one of us see his Lord, individually on the Day of Resurrection? And what is a sign similar to that among his creation?” He ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم .) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَبَا رَزِينٍ ، أَلَيْسَ كُلُّكُمْ يَرَى الْقَمَرَ لَيْلَةَ الْبَدْرِ مُخْلِيًا بِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Abū Razīn, do you not each individually see the full moon?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Razīn answered, “Yes.” The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) then told him:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَاللَّهُ أَعْظَمُ ، فَإِنَّمَا هُوَ خَلْقٌ مِنْ خَلْقِ اللَّهِ ، فَاللَّهُ أَجَلُّ وَأَعْظَمُ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Allah is even greater. That (the moon) is only a single creation from Allah’s creation, but Allah is even more exalted and greater.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Recorded by Imām Aḥmad (4/11) and Abū Dāwūd (no. 4731). al-Albānī said it is authentic in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan Abī Dāwūd” (3957)</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for “<strong>you will have no trouble in seeing him</strong>” in the earlier ḥadīth, different wordings have come in similar narrations, but the point is that no one will prevent another from seeing Allah due to crowding or anything else. Each person will see him ( (سبحانه وتعالى while he is in the utmost state of tranquility and peace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for “<strong>So if you can avoid missing a prayer before the sun rises and a prayer before it sets, then do so</strong>,” the prayer before sunrise is Fajr, the morning prayer, and before sunset is ‘Aṣr, the afternoon prayer. ‘Aṣr is even better than Fajr because it is the middle prayer which Allah has specifically told us to safeguard after mentioning prayers in general.[167] But Fajr is better than ‘Aṣr from a different perspective in that it is the prayer that is specifically witnessed by the angels as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَقِمِ الصَّلَاةَ لِدُلُوكِ الشَّمْسِ إِلَىٰ غَسَقِ اللَّيْلِ وَقُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ ۖ إِنَّ قُرْآنَ الْفَجْرِ كَانَ مَشْهُودًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Keep up prayer from the declining of the sun till the darkness of night and the morning recitation; surely the morning recitation is witnessed</span>. [Sūrah al-Isrā, 17:78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There also occurs in an authentic ḥadīth:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَنْ صَلَّى الْبَرْدَيْنِ دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ </span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever prayers the two cool ones will enter Paradise.</span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two cool prayers are Fajr and ‘Aṣr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What practical benefit do we gain from knowing these verses (and ḥadīth) about the believers seeing their Lord in Paradise? There is no greater effect on a person’s behavioral approach and direction in life than this. When anyone realizes that his main objective, the height of his reward is to look upon the face of his Lord, this life and everything in it then becomes almost worthless to him in comparison. Nothing else would compare or be as precious to him as reaching that moment of seeing Allah (عزّ وجلّ). It is the goal of every seeker; it is the final achievement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you know that you will one day see your Lord with your own eyes, then by Allah this life would not mean a thing to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything of this world is nothing in comparison because the sight of Allah’s face is the prize for which the competitors compete, the goal to which the racers race, and it is the greatest triumph of everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you know this, will you strive to reach it or not?</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[167] This occurs in Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:238:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حَافِظُوا عَلَى الصَّلَوَاتِ وَالصَّلَاةِ الْوُسْطَىٰ وَقُومُوا لِلَّهِ قَانِتِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Attend constantly to prayers and (in particular) to the middle prayer, and stand up truly obedient to Allah.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Our Lord&#8217;s Descent</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said in an authentic ḥadīth:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَنْزِلُ رَبُّنَا تَبَارَكَ وَتَعَالَى كُلَّ لَيْلَةٍ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ الدُّنْيَا حِينَ يَبْقَى ثُلُثُ اللَّيْلِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">الآخِرُ ، يَقُولُ : مَنْ يَدْعُونِي فَأَسْتَجِيبَ لَهُ ؟ مَنْ يَسْأَلُنِي فَأُعْطِيَهُ ؟ مَنْ يَسْتَغْفِرُنِي </span><span style="color:#000000;">؟ فَأَغْفِرَ لَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Our Lord, the blessed and exalted, descends every night to the sky of this world when the last third of the night remains. He asks, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him? Who is asking for my forgiveness so I can forgive him?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by al-Bukhārī (no. 1145) and Muslim (no. 758)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This ḥadīth is a proof confirming the descent of Allah to the lowest heaven, the sky of this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people of knowledge said this ḥadīth has come with many different chains of narration, and the scholars have always agreed that it is one of the famous ḥadīth often mentioned by the scholars of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) says,  &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends every night to the sky of this world</strong>.&#8221; Allah’s descent is real and actual because, as we have mentioned before, anything mentioned with a pronoun that refers back to Allah, it must be attributed to him in a real, actual manner.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we should believe in it and accept it as truth, saying just as the ḥadīth says, “<strong>Our Lord descends to the sky of this world</strong>,” to the lowest heaven closest to the earth. There are seven heavens, and Allah (عزّ وجلّ) descends at this time during the night to be near his worshippers just as he does during the afternoon on the Day of ‘Arafah (during the pilgrimage), praising and boasting to the angels about his worshippers. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">41</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;<strong>every night</strong>&#8221; it is general to include every single night of the year. &#8220;<strong>when the last third of the night remains</strong>&#8220;. In Islamic legislation, the night begins at sunset and this is unanimously agreed upon. The difference (among scholars) however comes with regards to when the night ends. Does it end with the appearance of first light or the actual rising of the sun? Apparently, the night, according to legislation, ends with the appearance of first light, and the common, “astral” night ends with sunrise. Allah asks, &#8221; “Who is calling on me…”. This is a question yet really intended as an encouragement and motivation rather than expecting an actual answer. It is like his statement (in the Qur&#8217;an):</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">هَلْ أَدُلُّكُمْ عَلَى تِجَارَةٍ تُنجِيكُم مِّنْ عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Shall I guide you to a transaction that will save you from a painful punishment?</span> [Sūrah al-Ṣaf, 61:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…calling on me…</strong>” saying, “Oh Lord…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…so I can answer him?</strong>” This is the result and reward for doing the first part – calling on Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> “<strong>Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him?</strong>” such as saying, “I ask You for Paradise,” or similar things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>Who is asking for my forgiveness…</strong>” saying, “Oh Allah, forgive me,” or “I seek your forgiveness, Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>…so I can forgive him?</strong>” Forgiveness means to conceal one’s sins and overlook them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this, it should be clear to every person who reads this ḥadīth that what is meant by “<strong>descends</strong>” here is that Allah Himself descends. We do not even need to say He descends “<strong>personally</strong>” because as long as the verb is associated with Him, then He himself does it. Still, some scholars did say, “He personally descends.” They resorted to saying that, compelled to adding “personally” only because there are those people who twist the meaning of ḥadīth, claiming that what really descends is the decision and decree of Allah. Others say it is Allah’s mercy that descends, and even others say it is one of his angels that descends.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these are incorrect. For one thing, Allah’s decision and decree are constantly descending, and not only during the last third of night as he ( تعالى ) says generally:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يُدَبِّرُ الأَمْرَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ إِلَى الأَرْضِ ثُمَّ يَعْرُجُ إِلَيْهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">He arranges each matter from the heaven to the earth then it will ascend to him</span>.[Sūrah al-Sajdah, 32:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِلَيْهِ يُرْجَعُ الأَمْرُ كُلُّهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And to him the matter will return, all of it</span>.[Sūrah Hūd, 11:123]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their statement that it is really only the mercy of Allah that descends to the worldly sky when the last third of night remains, Allah is above such deficiencies and insults! Mercy does not descend except at that time?! Allah ( تعالى ) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا بِكُم مِّن نِّعْمَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whatever you have of blessing, it is from Allah</span>. [Sūrah al-Naḥl, 16:53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every blessing and favor is from Allah, and they are the results of his mercy; they can be witnessed at all times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We could then ask: What good does it do for us if mercy descends only down to the sky (and no further)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who say it is really only an angel that descends, we ask: Does it make sense that an angel would say, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me for anything…”?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that these claims are distorted meanings, they are incorrect and proven so by the ḥadīth itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, such people who claim these things do not know more about Allah than Allah’s messenger, they are certainly not more sincere in advising the servants of Allah than his messenger, and they are not more precise and eloquent in speech than the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people also ask: How can you say Allah descends? If He does so, then what about His being high above everything? What about His being over the throne? If He descends, this would involve movement and relocation. Also, if He descends, this would be an action that happens and anything that happens must have a cause.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To this we say: This is baseless and pointless arguing. There is no reason not to say that Allah’s descent is real. Do you know what Allah deserves (of characteristics and descriptions) more than the companions of the messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The companions never made any of these false assumptions and conjectures. Instead they listened, they believed, they accepted, and they trusted it as absolute truth. Yet now, you people come and challenge the meanings, arguing for the sake of falsehood, asking, “How? Why?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say Allah descends, and we do not delve into asking, “What about his throne? Does this mean he leaves it or not?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his being above, we say he descends and yet he is still high above his creation because “descent” here does not necessarily mean that he is surrounded by the lowest heaven to which he descends while the other heavens are above him. Rather, he is not contained within anything of his creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah actually descends in a real manner while he is actually high above in a real manner, and nothing is similar to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rising over the throne is an action, not a permanent, personal characteristic. We should not, as far as I am concerned, begin asking whether he leaves the throne or not. Instead, we should keep silent about it just as the companions did, may Allah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the scholars of those who follow the Sunnah take one of three positions regarding the issue of whether Allah leaves his throne during his descent. Some say he leaves the throne, others say he does not leave it, and others say we should remain silent and not delve into the issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah says in his <em>al-Risālah al-‘Arshiyyah</em> that Allah does not leave the throne (during his descent) because the evidence confirming he is on the throne is strong and explicit just as this ḥadīth is also a strong, explicit proof of his descent. The actions and characteristics of Allah (عزّ وجلّ) are not to be measured by those of creation. So we should leave the texts of his being on the throne confirmed as they are just as we leave the text of his descent confirmed as it is. We say he is established on his throne and yet he still descends to the sky of this world; Allah alone knows the “how” of it. Our minds are too deficient and incomplete to know everything about Allah, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second position is that Allah leaves the throne during his descent and the third position is to remain silent – in other words, not to say whether he does or does not leave his throne.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people more recently bring up yet another point of confusion. <strong>Since the earth is round and revolves around the sun, they ask how Allah can descend during the last third of the night when the last third is a constant time</strong>. For example, when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia leaves this time, Europe and surrounding countries enter it. So is Allah constantly and forever descending?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reply, we say: First and foremost, you should simply believe and accept that Allah descends during this specific time. If you do believe in it, then there is nothing else required from you. Do not go into asking, “How?” Instead, accept that when the last third of night remains in Saudi Arabia, then Allah descends, and when it remains in America, Allah also descends. And His descent finishes when the light of morning appears in any place, respective to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To conclude, our position is that we believe and accept everything that has come to us from Allah’s messenger, Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) in that Allah comes down to the sky of this world, the lowest heaven, when the last third of night remains and he asks, “Who is calling on me so I can answer him? Who is asking me (for anything) so I can give (it to) him? Who is asking for my forgiveness so I can forgive him?”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Beneficial Points We Learn from This Ḥadīth</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>This amazing ḥadīth:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah is high above creation based on the words, &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah does actions by his choice and will—these are known as “action” characteristics (see footnote no. 7 of the <a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2012/06/22/in-the-company-of-allaah-confirming-that-allaah-is-with-his-creation-shaykh-ibn-al-uthaymeen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">main article</a>)—based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>Our Lord descends…when the last third of the night remains.</strong>.&#8221;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms that Allah speaks based on the statement, &#8220;<strong>He asks…</strong>&#8220;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Confirms Allah’s kindness and generosity based on his questions, <strong>“Who is calling on me…? Who is asking me…? Who is asking for my forgiveness…?”</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People should take advantage of this part of the night, asking for whatever they need from Allah, calling upon him, and asking his forgiveness as he asks, “Who is calling on me…? Who is asking me…? Who is asking for my forgiveness…?” And again, the word “Who” here is presented in the form of a question but is actually intended to motivate rather than ask.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we should take advantage of this chance because nothing that has passed of your life is in your favor except the times you spent in obedience to Allah. Perhaps more days may pass you by, but when death comes it will be as if you were only born that minute. At that time, everything of one’s past life will mean nothing to him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">41</span>] The ḥadīth about this is recorded by Muslim (no. 1348). The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَا مِنْ يَوْمٍ أَكْثَرَ مِنْ أَنْ يُعْتِقَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ عَبْدًا مِنْ النَّارِ مِنْ يَوْمِ عَرَفَةَ وَإِنَّهُ لَيَدْنُو ثُمَّ يُبَاهِي بِهِمْ الْمَلائِكَةَ ، فَيَقُولُ :  مَا </span><span style="color:#000000;"> أَرَادَ هَؤُلاءِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">There is no day on which Allah frees more servants from the fire than the Day of ‘Arafah. He comes near (them) and praises and boasts about them to the angels, saying, “What do these want?” (or “Anything they want!”)</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Day of Resurrection: The Tenth Event</strong></span></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Bridge</strong></span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word صِرَاط (Ṣirāṭ) is the bridge stretched over Hell over which people will cross to get to Paradise. About it, Allah ( تعالى ) says:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِن مِّنكُمْ إِلَّا وَارِدُهَا ۚ كَانَ عَلَىٰ رَبِّكَ حَتْمًا مَّقْضِيًّا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And there is none of you except that he will pass over it. This is with your Lord a decree which must be accomplished</span>.[Sūrah Maryam, 19:71]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullāh Ibn Mas’ūd, Qatādah, and Zayd Ibn Aslam explained this verse to mean the crossing of the bridge. Others, including Ibn ‘Abbās, explained that it describes those who will enter the fire but will be saved from it.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ يُضْرَبُ الْجِسْرُ عَلَى جَهَنَّمَ ، وَتَحِلُّ الشَّفَاعَةُ وَيَقُولُونَ : اللَّهُمَّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the bridge will be placed over Hell and intercession will be permitted. They (the messengers) will say, “Oh Allah, save (us), save (us).” [<span style="color:#ff0000;">113</span>]</p>





<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars have differed as to the exact nature of this bridge. Some say it is a wide path over which people will cross according to the deeds they did in this life. They say it is wide because the word “bridge,” taken at face value, means just that and because Allah’s messenger ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) described it as being slippery and elusive. They understood that the bridge must be somewhat wide because a very narrow path would not be described with the specific Arabic words (slippery and elusive) that the prophet used. When asked about the bridge, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">مَدْحَضَةٌ مَزِلَّةٌ عَلَيْهِ خَطَاطِيفُ وَكَلالِيبُ وَحَسَكَةٌ مُفَلْطَحَةٌ لَهَا شَوْكَةٌ عُقَيْفَاءُ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><span style="color:#808000;">It is slippery, elusive with hooks and grapples, and broad spikes and curved thorns</span>.</span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the ḥadīth narrated by Abū Hurayrah, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَبِهِ كَلالِيبُ مِثْلُ شَوْكِ السَّعْدَانِ غَيْرَ أَنَّهَا لا يَعْلَمُ قَدْرَ عِظَمِهَا إِلاَّ اللَّهُ فَتَخْطَفُ </span><span style="color:#000000;">النَّاسَ بِأَعْمَالِهِمْ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">It has hooks like the thorns of al-Sa’dān (a place in Najd) except that no one but Allah knows the huge size of them. They will seize people according to their deeds</span>.[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Other scholars said no, it is actually a very narrow bridge just as has come in a ḥadīth narrated by Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رضي الله عنه ) in which he said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">بَلَغَنِي أَنَّ الصِّرَاطَ أَحَدُّ مِنَ السَّيْفِ وَأَدَقُّ مِنَ الشَّعْرَةِ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">He informed (or: It has reached) me that the bridge is sharper that a sword and thinner than a hair.</span>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">116</span>]</p>
<p>

</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Here we come to a question: How is it possible for people to actually pass over a bridge like this? The answer is that the events and things to occur in the hereafter cannot be compared to or measured based solely on what we know of things of this life. Allah is capable of anything, and we do not know exactly how people will cross it. Will they cross in groups or one at a time? Allah knows best.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">But regarding this issue—whether the bridge is wide or narrow—it is not incumbent on people to accept one position over the other because both groups of scholars have strong points.</p>



<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Crossing the Bridge</span></strong></h3>



<p style="text-align:justify;">No one will cross the bridge except the believers. As for the disbelievers, they will be taken straight to the fire. The believers will cross it according to their deeds based on the ḥadīth narrated by Abū Sa’īd al-Khudrī ( رضي الله عنه ) that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَمُرُّ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ كَطَرْفِ الْعَيْنِ وَكَالْبَرْقِ وَكَالرِّيحِ وَكَالطَّيْرِ وَكَأَجَاوِيدِ الْخَيْلِ  </span><span style="color:#000000;">وَالرِّكَابِ فَنَاجٍ مُسَلَّمٌ وَمَخْدُوشٌ مُرْسَلٌ وَمَكْدُوسٌ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The believers will cross: some as fast as the blink of an eye, some like lightning, some like the wind, some like a bird, some like horses, and some as fast as camels. Some people will be safe a secure, some will be scratched but delivered, and others will fall into the fire of Hell</span>.[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The speed at which a person crosses is obviously not by his choice. If it were, naturally everyone would want to cross quickly. Rather, the passage across is according to the speed at which he used to accept religious teachings in this life. So whoever was always quick to accept the teachings of the messengers, he will pass quickly over the bridge. Whoever was slow to accept them will pass slowly over the bridge. It is a suitable reward and the reward is according to the deed.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people will be seized by hooks that are on the bridge and, again, this will only be according to their deeds. As for the prophet’s statement, “others will fall into the fire of Hell,” it is understood that the fire into which sinners will fall is the same fire the disbelievers will be in. However, these believing sinners will still not experience the same punishment as disbelievers will. Some scholars have even said that this fire will be cool and safe for them just as the fire was cool and peaceful on Prophet Abraham. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">118</span>]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what is more apparent is that this is not the case; the fire will likely be hot and painful but not as intense as the heat the disbelievers in Allah will experience. As a side note, the points on the body upon which believers prostrate during prayer will never be touched by the fire just as it has been reported by the prophet in “Ṣaḥīḥ al- Bukhārī” and “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim.” [<span style="color:#ff0000;">119</span>] The places of prostration are those that touch the ground: the forehead, nose, palms, knees, and the toes.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">In a ḥadīth in “Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim,” the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) also said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">تَجْرِي بِهِمْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ وَنَبِيُّكُمْ قَائِمٌ عَلَى الصِّرَاطِ يَقُولُ : رَبِّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ حَتَّى تَعْجِزَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَعْمَالُ الْعِبَادِ حَتَّى يَجِيءَ الرَّجُلُ فَلا يَسْتَطِيعُ السَّيْرَ إِلاَّ زَحْفًا</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Their deeds will carry them (over the bridge) while your prophet is standing on the bridge saying, “My Lord, save (them), save (them).” Some servants’ deeds will hinder them so much that a man will be unable to pass over except while crawling.</span> [Recorded by Muslim.]</p>





<p style="text-align:justify;">And in “Ṣaḥīḥ al-Bukhārī:”</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">حَتَّى يَمُرَّ آخِرُهُمْ يُسْحَبُ سَحْبًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">…until the last of them crosses being dragged.</span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of the prophets to cross the bridge will be Muhammad ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and the first of all religious nations will be his nation as the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَأَكُونُ أَنَا وَأُمَّتِي أَوَّلَ مَنْ يُجِيزُهَا ، وَلا يَتَكَلَّمُ يَوْمَئِذٍ إِلاَّ الرُّسُلُ ، وَدَعْوَى الرُّسُلِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَئِذٍ : اللَّهُمَّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">I and my nation will be the first to be allowed to cross it. On that day, no one will speak except the messengers and the prayer of the messengers that day will be, “Oh Allah, save (us), save (us)!</span> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah says, “After they cross, they will stop at a bridge/platform between Paradise and the fire and they will settle any unresolved issues between themselves.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">This area is a small bridge or platform, and this settling of disagreements between them is not the major settling of affairs and retribution that occurs between people on the Day of Resurrection. Instead, this particular reconciliation is to resolve any bad feelings, grudges, or anger that may still remain in people’s hearts. So in a sense, this is a period of purification because the major settling of disagreements does not necessarily remove all feelings of resentment within people’s hearts.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">So this bridge or platform between Paradise and Hell is to purify the hearts so that the believers enter Paradise having no bad feelings for one another as Allah ( تعالى ) says:</p>





<h2><span style="color:#000000;">ادْخُلُوهَا بِسَلَامٍ آمِنِينَ وَنَزَعْنَا مَا فِي صُدُورِهِم مِّنْ غِلٍّ إِخْوَانًا عَلَىٰ سُرُرٍ مُّتَقَابِلِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Enter it with peace, safe and secure. And we will remove whatever is in their breasts of resentment, (so they will become) brothers, on thrones facing each other</span>.[Sūrah al-Ḥijr, 15:46-47]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">About this bridge before Paradise, the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا خَلَصَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ مِنَ النَّارِ ، حُبِسُوا بِقَنْطَرَةٍ بَيْنَ الْجَنَّةِ وَالنَّارِ ، فَيَتَقَاصُّونَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَظَالِمَ كَانَتْ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي الدُّنْيَا ، حَتَّى إِذَا نُقُّوا وَهُذِّبُوا أُذِنَ لَهُمْ بِدُخُولِ الْجَنَّةِ ،</span><span style="color:#000000;">فَوَالَّذِي نَفْسُ مُحَمَّدٍ بِيَدِهِ لأَحَدُهُمْ بِمَسْكَنِهِ فِي الْجَنَّةِ أَدَلُّ بِمَنْزِلِهِ كَانَ فِي الدُّنْيَا</span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When the believers are delivered from the fire, they will be detained at the bridge between Paradise and the fire to settle whatever injustices may have occurred between them in life. When they have all become refined and purified, entrance into Paradise will be granted. And I swear by the one in whose hand is Muhammad’s life, each individual will recognize his home in Paradise even more so than he does his home in this life.</span> [Recorded by al-Bukhārī]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[113] Recorded by by al-Bukhārī and Muslim. The wording of Muslim is above; the wording of al-Bukhārī is:</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يُضْرَبُ جِسْرُ جَهَنَّمَ ، فَأَكُونُ أَوَّلَ مَنْ يُجِيزُ ، وَدُعَاءُ الرُّسُلِ يَوْمَئِذٍ : اللَّهُمَّ سَلِّمْ سَلِّمْ</span></h2>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">The bridge of Hell will be placed and I will be the first to be permitted. The supplication of the messengers that day will be, “Oh Allah, save (us), save (us).”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[116] Recorded by Imām Aḥmad in a marfū’ form meaning some ḥadīth scholars accept it as being “raised” to the status of an actual statement of the prophet himself ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ). Imam Muslim also mentioned it in his authentic collection as a comment to another ḥadīth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[118] This is when the disbelieving people attempted to burn Abraham for destroying their idols. About this, Allah says in Sūrah al-Anbiyā, 21:68-69:</p>
<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color:#000000;">قَالُوا حَرِّقُوهُ وَانصُرُوا آلِهَتَكُمْ إِن كُنتُمْ فَاعِلِينَ قُلْنَا يَا نَارُ كُونِي بَرْدًا وَسَلَامًا عَلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ</span></h2>
<p>

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">They said, “Burn him and support your gods if you are to act.” We (Allah) said, “Fire, be coolness and safety upon Abraham.”</span></p>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[119] The ḥadīth, recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim, is:</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ رَحْمَةَ مَنْ أَرَادَ مِنْ أَهْلِ النَّارِ أَمَرَ اللَّهُ الْمَلائِكَةَ أَنْ يُخْرِجُوا مَنْ كَانَ يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ فَيُخْرِجُونَهُمْ وَيَعْرِفُونَهُمْ بِآثَارِ السُّجُودِ وَحَرَّمَ </span><span style="color:#000000;">اللَّهُ عَلَى النَّارِ أَنْ تَأْكُلَ أَثَرَ السُّجُودِ</span></h2>
<p>

</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">When Allah wants mercy for someone from the people of the fire, he commands the angels to take out whoever used to worship Allah. So they (the angels) will recognize them by the marks of prostration because Allah has forbidden the fire from destroying the marks of prostration.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Sixth Event</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Scales are Placed &amp; Deeds are Weighed</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one of the verses that proves the scales will be setup on the Day of Resurrection, Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And those whose scales are heavy </strong>(with good deeds)<strong>, it is they who will be successful</strong></span>.[Sūrah al-Muminūn, 23:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verse contains a conditional clause; the condition is &#8220;<strong>those whose scales are heavy</strong>&#8220;, and if that condition is met, the consequence is &#8220;<strong>it is they who will be successful</strong>.&#8221; By &#8220;<strong>scales are heavy</strong>&#8220;, what is meant is that one’s good deeds outweigh his bad. &#8220;<strong>Successful</strong>&#8221; here describes an individual who achieves what he hopes for and is saved from what he fears. So he is given safety from what he hates and rewarded with what he loves. Allah also says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ فِي جَهَنَّمَ خَالِدُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But those whose scales are light, it is they who have lost their souls. In Hell they will abide forever</strong></span>. [Sūrah al-Muminūn, 23:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who do not believe in Allah will <strong>&#8220;have lost their souls</strong>.&#8221; They will lose themselves, their families, and the possessions they hold dear:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ الْخَاسِرِينَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُمْ وَأَهْلِيهِمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ ۖ أَلا ذَلِكَ هُوَ الْخُسْرَانُ الْمُبِينُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say: Indeed, the losers are the ones who will lose themselves and their families on the Day of Resurrection. Unquestionably, that is the clear loss</span></strong>.[Sūrah al-Zumar, 39:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for a believer in Allah whose behavior was righteous, he will have succeeded, gaining his soul, his family, and his possessions, having benefited from all of them. People who do not believe in Allah (or disbelieve in Allah’s “oneness”) will lose themselves because they will have not benefited from their very existence in life. In fact such people, despite what they presumably achieve in life, actually achieve no true benefit and gain only harm (in the hereafter). In a sense, they even lose their wealth in life as they gain no real benefit from it. Even when they may share it with others among creation, such charity does not benefit the givers. Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا مَنَعَهُمْ أَن تُقْبَلَ مِنْهُمْ نَفَقَاتُهُمْ إِلَّا أَنَّهُمْ كَفَرُوا بِاللَّهِ وَبِرَسُولِهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And nothing prevents their spending from being accepted from them except that they disbelieved in Allah and in his messenger</strong></span>.[Sūrah al-Tawbah, 9:54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also lose their families because their families will either be in the fire with them, or if their families are in Paradise, such disbelievers will still have lost them because they themselves will be in the fire. Any individual who dies while disbelieving in Allah will never again enjoy the company of his family. Such enjoyment will be locked out from a disbeliever as soon as he is locked in his coffin, and each one will imagine no one else is receiving a harsher punishment than he.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">whose scales are light</span></strong>&#8220;, this means his bad deeds will outweigh his good or he will have no good deeds whatsoever. This is the meaning if we accept the position that disbelievers will have their deeds weighed which seems apparent from the verse in Sūrah al-Muminūn, 23:103 and others like it. And this position is one of the two held by religious scholars. The other opinion, that disbelievers will not have their deeds weighed, is the second position and it is based on the verses:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ هَلْ نُنَبِّئُكُم بِالْأَخْسَرِينَ أَعْمَالً الَّذِينَ ضَلَّ سَعْيُهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا وَهُمْ يَحْسَبُونَ أَنَّهُمْ يُحْسِنُونَ صُنْعًا أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَلِقَائِهِ فَحَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَلَا نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَزْنًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Say: Shall we inform you of the greatest losers as to (their) deeds? Those whose effort is lost in the worldly life while they thought they were doing good work. Those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and in (their) meeting him. So their deeds have become worthless, and we will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any weight.</span></strong> [Sūrah al-Kahf, 18:103-105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the two positions, whether disbelievers will have their deeds weighed or not, Allah knows best which is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word for scales used in some verses, ( مَوَازِيْن <em>mawāzīn</em>), has been reported in other texts in both the singular and plural forms. As for the plural form, Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَنَضَعُ الْمَوَازِينَ الْقِسْطَ لِيَوْمِ الْقِيَامَةِ فَلَا تُظْلَمُ نَفْسٌ شَيْئًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And we place the scales of justice for the Day of Resurrection, so no soul will be treated unjustly in any way. </strong></span>[Sūrah al-Anbiyā, 21:47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَالْوَزْنُ يَوْمَئِذٍ الْحَقُّ ۚ فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ وَمَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ فَأُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ خَسِرُوا أَنفُسَهُم بِمَا كَانُوا بِآيَاتِنَا يَظْلِمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And the weighing (of deeds) that day will be true. So those whose scales are heavy, it is they who will be successful. And those whose scales are light, they will lose themselves for what injustice they were doing toward our verses.</span> </strong>[Sūrah al-‘Arāf, 7:8-9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the singular form, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color:#000000;">كَلِمَتَانِ حَبِيبَتَانِ إِلَى الرَّحْمَنِ خَفِيفَتَانِ عَلَى اللِّسَانِ ثَقِيلَتَانِ فِي الْمِيزَانِ : سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are two statements beloved to the Most Merciful, light on the tongue but heavy on the scale: “Glorified is Allah and all thanks are for him,” and “Glorified is Allah the greatest.”</strong> </span>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">59</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this ḥadīth, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) mentioned the singular form, ( مِيْزَان <em>mīzān</em>), “scale.” So how do we understand the Quran verses which mention “scales” and this ḥadīth which mentions “scale?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps it is mentioned in the plural form only as a way of speaking about what is weighed – deeds – which is plural. Then it is mentioned in the ḥadīth in singular form because the scale is actually one. It could also be because perhaps there is one scale for each nation or even that the prophet meant “heavy in weight” when he said, “heavy on the scale.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, what is apparent—and Allah knows best—is that the scale is actually one but is mentioned in plural form with regards to what is weighed (i.e., deeds). This linguistic usage can also be seen in the verse:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8230; فَمَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So those whose scales are heavy&#8230;</strong></span>[Sūrah al-A’rāf, 7:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this verse, it is not actually the scales that are heavy, rather it is a form of Arabic speech in which one word (e.g. scales) is used to mean another word relating to the former (e.g. deeds).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a related issue but one into which people have not delved: Will there be a single scale setup for all nations, all mankind, or will there be one for each nation (e.g., one for Muhammad’s nation, one for Jesus’ nation, one for Moses’, etc.)? This question may be relevant because some texts indicate the rewards for deeds vary for different nations. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">61</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These texts, taken at face value, are apparent in that the scale will be real and tangible as this is exactly how the word “scale” is commonly understood. This is because the principle of understanding religious texts reported in the Quran or Sunnah is that they are to be understood upon the commonly known, real and actual meanings of their words unless there is clear evidence that they should be understood differently (i.e. metaphorically). The commonly understood meaning to all Muslim teachers, writers, and lecturers ever since the Quran was revealed up until today is that the scale is real. However, some misguided sects have differed in understanding. For example, those who incorrectly believe any texts can be figurative, having metaphorical meanings instead of what the words actually mean, they claim that there will not be a real scale setup on the Day of Resurrection. They insist that there is really no need for an actual scale to weigh actions because Allah already knows the deeds of his servants and their worth. Instead, they claim that “scale” is allegorical and it really means Allah’s “fairness” or “justice.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt, the claim of such people is incorrect because it contradicts the outward, apparent meaning of the word and the consensus of all the righteous predecessors who understood the word to mean what the word actually means – scale. If we say the meaning is figurative and it really means fairness or justice, then there is little meaning in the several texts which mention “scale,” they would simply say “justice” (as other texts do) because the characteristics of fairness and justice are closer to and speak more directly to people’s souls than the word “scale” anyway. For this reason, Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَأْمُرُ بِالْعَدْلِ وَالْإِحْسَانِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Indeed, Allah orders justice and good conduct.</span></strong>[Sūrah al-Naḥl, 16:90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The correct understanding is to take the word “scale” on its intended, actual meaning. We say that the correct understanding is the same one revealed – scale. The “<strong>Ḥadīth of the Card</strong>” (to be mentioned soon) also proves that it is a real, actual scale with weighing pans. This ḥadīth mentions that scrolls of bad deeds placed in one pan will be lighter than a single card placed in the other pan which will be heavier. So it is clear, what is correct is what was revealed – the scale is real.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actions of the servants will then be weighed. And with that, there are two points of discussion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first point is this:</strong> How will deeds be weighed when it is known that a deed is simply a description or action of the one who performed it, and a deed has no physical form? The answer is that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will make these deeds into actual, physical forms. This should not be unbelievably strange when considering the capability of Allah (عزّ وجل). As an analogy, death will be made into the form of a ram on the Day of Judgment and it will be slaughtered between Paradise and Hell [<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>] while death now is simply a concept and not a physical form. And to clarify a side-note, the Angel of Death is not the one slaughtered here; it is actually death that Allah (تعالى) will make into a physical form everyone will witness and see. Similarly, Allah (عزّ وجل)جلwill turn deeds into actual forms that will be actually weighed with this actual scale.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second point:</strong> Deeds will actually be weighed, both good and bad. This is the apparent understanding as Allah (تعالى) says in the Quran:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصْدُرُ النَّاسُ أَشْتَاتًا لِّيُرَوْا أَعْمَالَهُمْ  فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُ وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>That day, people will depart, separated (into categories) to be shown their deeds. So whoever does an atom’s weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom’s weight of evil will see it.</strong></span> [Sūrah al-Zalzalah, 99:6-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is clear that deeds will really be weighed whether they are good or bad. Also, as has previously been mentioned, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)said, “There are two statements beloved to the Most Merciful, light on the tongue but heavy on the scale&#8230;” This ḥadīth is also clear, even explicit, in that actions will actually be given form and weight and then weighed, and there are several other texts that prove this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are other reliable texts that indicate that it may not be the actual deeds weighed but rather the records of deeds. An example of this type is the “Ḥadīth of the Card” in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« إِنَّ اللَّهَ سَيُخَلِّصُ رَجُلاً مِنْ أُمَّتِي عَلَى رُءُوسِ الْخَلائِقِ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ فَيَنْشُرُ عَلَيْهِ </span><span style="color:#000000;">تِسْعَةً وَتِسْعِينَ سِجِلاًّ كُلُّ سِجِلٍّ مِثْلُ مَدِّ الْبَصَرِ ثُمَّ يَقُولُ.: أَتُنْكِرُ مِنْ هَذَا شَيْئًا ؟ </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَظَلَمَكَ كَتَبَتِي الْحَافِظُونَ ؟ فَيَقُولُ : لا يَا رَبِّ ، فَيَقُولُ : أَفَلَكَ عُذْرٌ ؟ فَيَقُولُ : لا يَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">رَبِّ ، فَيَقُولُ : بَلَى إِنَّ لَكَ عِنْدَنَا حَسَنَةً فَإِنَّهُ لا ظُلْمَ عَلَيْكَ الْيَوْمَ ، فَتَخْرُجُ بِطَاقَةٌ فِيهَا </span><span style="color:#000000;">أَشْهَدُ أَنْ لا إِلَهَ إِلاَّ اللَّهُ وَأَشْهَدُ أَنَّ مُحَمَّدًا عَبْدُهُ وَرَسُولُهُ ، فَيَقُولُ : احْضُرْ وَزْنَكَ ، </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَيَقُولُ : يَا رَبِّ مَا هَذِهِ الْبِطَاقَةُ مَعَ هَذِهِ السِّجِلاَّتِ ؟ فَقَالَ : إِنَّكَ لا تُظْلَمُ ، قَالَ : </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَتُوضَعُ السِّجِلاَّتُ فِي كَفَّةٍ وَالْبِطَاقَةُ فِي كَفَّةٍ فَطَاشَتْ السِّجِلاَّتُ وَثَقُلَتْ الْبِطَاقَةُ فَلا </span><span style="color:#000000;">يَثْقُلُ مَعَ اسْمِ اللَّهِ شَيْءٌ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allah will single out a man from my nation at the head of all the creations on the Day of Resurrection. Ninety-nine scrolls (of bad deeds) will be spread out before him, each as far as the eye can see. He will be asked, “Do you deny doing any of this? Did my recording, guardian angels wrong you in any way?” The man will answer, “No, my Lord.” He will be asked, “Do you have any excuse?” to which he will again reply, “No, my Lord.” It will then be said, “Rather you certainly do have a good deed with us and there will be no injustice on you today.” A card will then be brought out, written on it: “I testify there is nothing deserving of worship but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is his servant and messenger.” The man will be told, “Present yourself for your weighing.” He will ask, “My Lord, what is this card compared to all these scrolls (of bad deeds)?” He (Allah) will tell him, “You will certainly not be wronged.” So the scrolls will be placed in one pan (of the scale) and the card in the other, and the scrolls will be lighter and the card heavier as nothing is heavier than the name of Allah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Recorded by al-Tirmidhī, Ibn Mājah, and Aḥmad. al-Albānī said it is authentic in his “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan al-Tirmidhī” (no.2127)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this ḥadīth, it is apparent that it is the written records of deeds weighed instead of the deeds themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are other texts that indicate what is weighed is the person who does the deeds. For example, Allah says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِ رَبِّهِمْ وَلِقَائِهِ فَحَبِطَتْ أَعْمَالُهُمْ فَلَا نُقِيمُ لَهُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ وَزْنًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Those are the ones who disbelieve in the verses of their Lord and in </strong>(their)<strong> meeting with him, so their deeds have become worthless. And we will not assign to them on the Day of Resurrection any weight</strong></span>.[Sūrah al-Kahf, 18:105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But it has been said that the meaning of &#8220;weight&#8221; in the verse could mean “significance” or “importance” instead of weight. Another indication that it may be the person himself that is weighed is the ḥadīth of Abū Hurayrah ( رضي الله عنه)in which he narrated that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« إِنَّهُ لَيَأْتِي الرَّجُلُ الْعَظِيمُ السَّمِينُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ لا يَزِنُ عِنْدَ اللَّهِ جَنَاحَ بَعُوضَةٍ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A huge, fat man will be brought on the Day of Resurrection and he will not weigh in the sight of Allah even as much as a gnat’s wing</strong> </span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The understanding that it is the person who will be weighed is also indicated by the ḥadīth of Ibn Mas’ūd ( رضي الله عنه)when he was once trying to break a siwāk branch from a tree. He used to have thin legs and the wind blew and started to move him. Because of this, other companions ( رضي الله عنه)مbegan laughing at him. So the prophet ( صلّى الله ) عليه وسلّمasked them, “What are you laughing at?” They answered, “At the skinniness of his legs.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)then said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« وَالَّذِي نَفْسِي بِيَدِهِ ، لَهُمَا أَثْقَلُ فِي الْمِيزَانِ مِنْ أُحُدٍ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I swear by the one in who hand is my soul (Allah), they (his legs) are both heavier in the scale than Mt. Uḥud.</strong></span> [Recorded by Aḥmad (1/421) and al-Albānī classed its chain of narrators as ḥasan in “Sharḥ al-A’qīdah al-Ṭaḥāwiyyah.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So to conclude, we have texts indicating three things that will be weighed in the scale: the deeds, the records of deeds, and the person who performed the deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars said the way to understand these together is simply that some people will have their deeds weighed, some will have their records of deeds weighed, and others will be weighed themselves. Other scholars said that when texts mention deeds being weighed, what is really meant is the records of deeds, and as for a person being weighed, this is specific to certain individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other scholars have combined these texts with the understanding that in reality only the records of deeds are weighed, but they will be heavy or light based on the merit and greatness of the deeds written in them. So in essence, it is as if the deeds are weighed. But after reflecting on the texts relevant to this issue, we find most of them indicate that it is the deeds that are weighed. Yet some people will be exclusively chosen to have their records of deeds weighed or even the individual himself. As far as the ḥadīth of Ibn Mas’ūd or the “Ḥadīth of the Card,” it could be that these are specific situations for which Allah chooses whomever he wants from his servants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the scales are placed, people’s deeds are weighed, then the books of deeds are distributed.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">59</span>] Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim. The transliteration of these two statements:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>SubḥānAllahi al-‘Aẓīm SubḥānAllahi wa biḥamdihi</strong></span><br />
Glorified is Allah the greatest Glorified is Allah and all thanks are for him</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another ḥadīth which mentions “scale” in the singular form and indicates the greatness of this scale is classified as authentic by al-Albānī in “Silsilah al-Aḥādīth al-Ṣaḥīḥah” (no. 941). In it, the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« يُوْضَعُ المِيْزَانُ يَوْمَ القِيَامَةِ فَلَوْ وَزِنَ فِيْهِ السَّمَوَاتِ وَالأَرْضَ لَوَسَعَتْ فَتَقُوْلُ المَلائِكَةُ : يَا رَبّ لِمَنْ يَزِنَ هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُوْلُ اللهُ تَعَالَى : لِمَنْ </span><span style="color:#000000;">شِئْتُ مِنْ خَلْقِي . فَتَقُوْلُ المَلائِكَةُ : سُبْحَانَكَمَا عَبَدْنَاكَ حَقَّ عِبَادَتِكَ . وَيُوْضَعُ الصِّرَاطُ مِثْلَ حَدِّ المُوْسَى فَتَقُوْلُ المَلائِكَةُ : مَنْ تَجِيْزُ عَلَى </span><span style="color:#000000;">هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُوْلُ : مَنْ شِئْتُ مِنْ خَلْقِيْ . فَيَقُوْلُوْنَ : سُبْحَانَكَمَا عَبَدْنَاكَ حَقَّ عِبَادَتِكَ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The scale will be set up on the Day of Resurrection, and if the heavens and the earth were to be weighed in it, it would be sufficient to hold them. The angels will ask, “Oh Lord, who is this for?” Allah will reply, “For whomsoever I want among my creations.” The angels will then say, “Glory to you, we have not worshipped you as you rightfully deserve to be worshipped.” And the bridge will be placed (over Hell) and it will be like the edge of a razor. The angels will ask Allah, “Who will be saved from this?” to which Allah will again reply, “Whomsoever I want among my creations.” They will say, “Glory to you, we have not worshipped you as you rightfully deserve to be worshipped.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">61</span>] One example of such texts is the ḥadīth recorded by al-Bukhārī in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)said comparing Muslims to Jews and Christians:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« مَثَلُكُمْ وَمَثَلُ أَهْلِ الْكِتَابَيْنِ كَمَثَلِ رَجُلٍ اسْتَأْجَرَ أُجَرَاءَ فَقَالَ : مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ غُدْوَةَ إِلَى نِصْفِ النَّهَارِ عَلَى قِيرَاطٍ ؟ فَعَمِلَتْ الْيَهُودُ ، ثُمَّ قَالَ : مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ نِصْفِ النَّهَارِ إِلَى صَلاةِ الْعَصْرِ عَلَى قِيرَاطٍ ؟ فَعَمِلَتْ النَّصَارَى ، ثُمَّ قَالَ : مَنْ يَعْمَلُ لِي مِنْ الْعَصْرِ إِلَى أَنْ تَغِيبَ الشَّمْسُ عَلَى قِيرَاطَيْنِ ؟ فَأَنْتُمْ هُمْ ، فَغَضِبَتْ الْيَهُودُ وَالنَّصَارَى فَقَالُوا : مَا لَنَا أَكْثَرَ عَمَلاً وَأَقَلَّ عَطَاءً ؟ قَالَ : هَلْ نَقَصْتُكُمْ مِنْ حَقِّكُمْ ؟ قَالُوا : لا ، قَالَ : فَذَلِكَ فَضْلِي أُوتِيهِ مَنْ أَشَاءُ »</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Your example compared to those of the two former scriptures can be likened to a man who hires a number of laborers. He asks, “Who will work for me from morning until midday for a certain sum?” The Jews are the ones to work at this time. Then he asks, “Who will work from midday to the late afternoon for the same sum?” The Christians are the ones to work at this time. Then he asks, “Who will work from the late afternoon until sunset for double that sum?” You (Muslims) are these people. This angers the Jews and Christians who ask, “Why did we have to work more only to receive less?” He answers, “Have you been cheated of any of your rights?” They answer, “No.” He then says, “This is my favor that I give to whom I please.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>] The proof is the ḥadīth recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim in which the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">« يُؤْتَى بِالْمَوْتِ كَهَيْئَةِ كَبْشٍ أَمْلَحَ فَيُنَادِي مُنَادٍ : يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ ، فَيَشْرَئِبُّونَ وَيَنْظُرُونَ ، فَيَقُولُ : هَلْ تَعْرِفُونَ هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ : نَعَمْ هَذَا الْمَوْتُ ، وَكُلُّهُمْ قَدْ رَآهُ ، ثُمَّ يُنَادِي : يَا أَهْلَ النَّارِ ، فَيَشْرَئِبُّونَ وَيَنْظُرُونَ ، فَيَقُولُ : هَلْ تَعْرِفُونَ هَذَا ؟ فَيَقُولُونَ : نَعَمْ هَذَا الْمَوْتُ ، وَكُلُّهُمْ قَدْ رَآهُ ، فَيُذْبَحُ ، ثُمَّ يَقُولُ : يَا أَهْلَ الْجَنَّةِ خُلُودٌ فَلا مَوْتَ وَيَا أَهْلَ النَّارِ خُلُودٌ فَلا مَوْتَ ، ثُمَّ قَرَأَ : &#8220;وَأَنْذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْحَسْرَةِ إِذْ قُضِيَ الأَمْرُ وَهُمْ فِي غَفْلَةٍ &#8220;وَهَؤُلاءِ فِي غَفْلَةٍ أَهْلُ الدُّنْيَا &#8220;وَهُمْ لا يُؤْمِنُونَ »&#8221;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Death will be brought in the form of a black and white ram and a caller will call out, “Oh people of Paradise!” and they will stretch their necks and look. They will be asked, “Do you know what this is?” to which they will answer, “Yes, that is death,” and each of them will be able to see it. Then it will be called out, “Oh people of Hell!” They will also stretch out their necks and look. They will be asked, “Do you know what this is?” and they too will say, “Yes, it is death,” and each of them will see it. It will then be slaughtered. Then it will be said, “Oh people of Paradise, eternity and no death. Oh people of Hell, eternity and no death.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)recited:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَأَنْذِرْهُمْ يَوْمَ الْحَسْرَةِ إِذْ قُضِيَ الأَمْرُ وَهُمْ فِي غَفْلَةٍ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And warn them of the Day of Regret, when the matter will be concluded. And yet they are in heedlessness.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And these people are headless, people of this life</strong></span>,” and finished the verse:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And they do not believe</strong></span>. [Sūrah Maryam, 19:39]</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Sunan an-Nasaaee”</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">an-Nasaaee authored a collection which he titled: “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>as-Sunan al-Kubraa</strong></span>” in which he gathered authentic <em>Hadeeth</em> as well as those with defects in their chains. He then summarized his collection which is known as “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>as-Sunan as-Sughraa</strong></span>” although he actually called it “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>al-Mujtabaa</strong></span>”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this summarized collection, he gathered only those Hadeeth which he considered to be authentic; it is this collection that is referred to when a Hadeeth is generally attributed to anNasaaee. “al-Mujtabaa” has the least number of weak Hadeeth out of the other four collections (excluding “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim”). It also contains the least amount of chains including narrators that have been criticized (regarding their Hadeeth narrating). It occupies a status right after “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim”. From the point of only relying upon narrators that are completely void of any criticism, this collection exceeds “Sunan Abu Daawood” and “Sunan at-Tirmithee” due to an-Nasaaee’s severe scrutiny of narrators within his writings. al-Haafith Ibn Hajar said, “How numerous are the narrators that Abu Daawood and atTirmithee relied on, yet an-Nasaaee shunned recording their Hadeeth. He even avoided recording Hadeeth from some of the narrators relied upon in the two authentic collections (“Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim”).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, the conditions of an-Nasaaee in “al-Mujtabaa” are the strongest after the two authentic collections.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">an-Nasaaee</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is ‘Abdur-Rahmaan Ahmad Ibn Shu’ayb Ibn ‘Alee an-Nasaaee, and it is said his name is anNaswee, referring to Nasa, a famous place in Khuraasaan. He was born in 215 Hijrah in Nasa. He then traveled in search of Hadeeth, eventually hearing from and studying from the people of the Hijaaz (lands such as Syria, Palestine, etc.), Khuraasaan, ash-Shaam, the Arabian Peninsula and other lands. He resided for a long time in Egypt and his writings spread throughout there. Later he journeyed to Damascus where he met with trials and tribulations. He died in 303 Hijrah in Ramlah, Palestine when he was eighty-three years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He left behind him many great works of Hadeeth and the study of their defects. May Allaah have mercy on him and reward him on behalf of his contribution to the Muslims.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Day of Resurrection <br />The Third Event</strong></span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Sun is Brought Near</strong></span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The sun will be brought near to mankind, as close as a “<strong>mile</strong>,” the Arabic word used for mile here being <strong>مِيْل</strong> (mīl). Whether it is the mile we know to be the common unit of distance or the eye-pencil to apply kohl (as the word could imply in Arabic), whatever the case the sun will be very close to people.[<span style="color:#ff0000;">29</span>] If the sun’s heat is as we know it here in this life while there is such a great distance between it and us, then how will it be when it is a “mile” above our heads?</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is a question: It is well-known that if the sun were to move even a hair from its position, it would burn the earth, incinerating it completely. So how is it possible on that day for the sun to be that close and not burn creation? The answer is that although people will be resurrected on that day with their previous bodies, they may not be recreated in the same exact state and with the same capability as they have now. Rather, they will be stronger and greater in what they can withstand.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if people were to remain for fifty days in direct sunshine with no shade, no food, and no water, they would be unable to do so; they would die. But on the Day of Resurrection, they will remain in such a state for fifty thousand years [<span style="color:#ff0000;">30</span>] without food,water, or shade except those to whom Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) shades. In addition, they will witness other terrifying events but they will be made to withstand them.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">As an example of this greater capability to bear situations without dying, look at how the people of the fire will withstand such seemingly unbearable circumstances:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا بِآيَاتِنَا سَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِمْ نَارًا كُلَّمَا نَضِجَتْ جُلُودُهُم بَدَّلْنَاهُمْ جُلُودًا غَيْرَهَا لِيَذُوقُوا الْعَذَابَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Indeed, those who disbelieve in our verses, we will drive them into a fire. Every time their skins are roasted through, we will replace them with other skins so they may taste the punishment. </strong></span>[Surah An-Nisa 4:56]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Will anyone be saved from the heat of the sun on the Day of Resurrection? Yes, there are types of people whom Allah will shade from the sun. The prophet ( صلّى اللّه عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are seven (types of people) whom Allah will shade in his shade on a day when there will be no shade except his shade: a just ruler; a youth who grew up in the worship of Allah; a man whose heart is attached to the mosques; people who love each other for Allah’s sake, meeting for his sake and parting for his sake; a man who is called by a woman of beauty and position (for adultery), but he says: “(No) I fear Allah;” a man who gives in charity and hides it so much so that his left hand does not know what his right hand gives in charity; and a man who remembered Allah in private so much that his eyes shed tears. </strong></span>[Recorded by al-Bukhārī, Muslim, and al-Tirmidhī]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also other types of individuals Allah will shade on that day. And by, “when there will be no shade except his shade,” it means no shade except the shade Allah creates. And it is not as some people think that it is the shade of Allah himself because that would necessitate that the sun would be above Allah ( عزّ وجلّ)</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">In this life, we can take shelter in shade ourselves, but on the Day of Resurrection, there will be no shade except the shade Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) makes so that whoever he wills can take shelter in his shade when the sun is brought near.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the closeness of the sun, people will sweat so much that it will rise.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Fourth Event</span></strong></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Sweat Rises</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the sun’s heat, people will sweat profusely in proportion to their deeds. For some, the sweat will rise to their ankles, some to their knees, some to their waists, and for some, the sweat will rise up to their mouths. So individuals will be at different levels regarding their sweat. They will sweat from the intense heat and the extremely uncomfortable situation: crowdedness, extreme hardships, and at close distance to the sun. Still, although people will sweat from the circumstances of that day, their sweat will only be according to their deeds in this life. [<span style="color:#ff0000;">33</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is a question: How will they be of varying degrees in sweat if people are all together in one place? To answer, we must return to a basic principle of belief. It is that when dealing with affairs of the unseen, events that authentic texts confirm will take place in the future, it is incumbent upon us to believe in them, trusting them to be true without persisting in asking, “How? Why?” These are things beyond the extent of our own intellects; it is not yet possible for us to perceive or fully understand it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imagine two people buried in a single grave, one a believer and the other a disbeliever. The believer will still experience the enjoyment that he deserves, and the disbeliever will experience the punishment he deserves even though they are in the same grave. Likewise, we believe the sweat will rise on the Day of Judgment as foretold.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now are we saying that Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) will gather together someone whose sweat will reach his mouth in a particular place, someone with sweat to his ankles in a different place, and others with sweat rising to their knees or waist in other places? No, not necessarily but Allah knows best. What we are saying is that it is possible for the individual with sweat reaching only to his ankles to be next to someone with his sweat up to his mouth because Allah is capable of doing anything. This is comparable to the fact that light will encompass believers all around them, yet at the same time, disbelievers in Allah will be surrounded by darkness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So regarding the Day of Resurrection, we must believe in it and all that is to occur on that day. As for the “How?” and “Why?” of the exact nature, that is not our right to know. As people suffer on the Day of Resurrection, standing in their own sweat, they will anxiously wait for judgment to begin. And this will only occur by “The Greatest Intercession.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">29</span>] The prophet ( صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ ) said in the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim confirming this:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>» تُدْنَى الشَّمْسُ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ مِنْ الْخَلْقِ حَتَّى تَكُونَ مِنْهُمْ كَمِقْدَارِ مِيلٍ «</strong></span></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>On the Day of Resurrection, the sun will be brought close to creation so much that it will be a “mile” from them.</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the narrators of the ḥadīth, Sulaym Ibn ‘Āmir, said, “By Allah, I do not know if he meant by <em>mīl</em> the distance of land or the <em>mīl</em> that is used to apply kohl to the eye.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">30</span>] The scholar is perhaps alluding to the verse in Sūrah al-Ma’ārij (70:4) in which Allah says,</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">تَعْرُجُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ وَالرُّوحُ إِلَيْهِ فِي يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ</span></strong></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The angels and the spirit will ascend to him during a day the extent of which is fifty thousand years.</strong></span></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the prophet ( صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ) said in a ḥadīth recorded by Muslim:</p>



<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">مَا مِنْ صَاحِبِ كَنْزٍ لا يُؤَدِّي زَكَاتَهُ إِلاَّ أُحْمِيَ عَلَيْهِ فِي نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ فَيُجْعَلُ صَفَائِحَ فَيُكْوَى بِهَا جَنْبَاهُ وَجَبِينُهُ حَتَّى يَحْكُمَ اللَّهُ بَيْنَ عِبَادِهِ فِي  </span></strong><strong><span style="color:#000000;">يَوْمٍ كَانَ مِقْدَارُهُ خَمْسِينَ أَلْفَ سَنَةٍ ثُمَّ يَرَى سَبِيلَهُ إِمَّا إِلَى الْجَنَّةِ وَإِمَّا إِلَى النَّارِ</span></strong></h2>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>There is no owner of treasure who does not pay its zakāh (obligated charity), but it will be heated in the fire of Hell and made into plates with which his sides and forehead will be branded until Allah passes judgment between his slaves on a day the length of which will be like fifty thousand years. Then he will be shown his path, whether it leads to Paradise or to Hell.</strong></p>





<p>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">33</span>] This is established by the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim in which the prophet ( صلّى اللّه عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَيَكُونُ النَّاسُ عَلَى قَدْرِ أَعْمَالِهِمْ فِي الْعَرَقِ ، فَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَكُونُ إِلَى كَعْبَيْهِ ، وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَكُونُ إِلَى رُكْبَتَيْهِ ، وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يَكُونُ إِلَى حَقْوَيْهِ ، وَمِنْهُمْ مَنْ يُلْجِمُهُ الْعَرَقُ إِلْجَامًا</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>The people will be in sweat in accordance with their deeds. For some, it will rise to their ankles, some to their knees, some to their waists, and for some of them, the sweat will reach their mouths.</strong></p>

<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Point:</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">It should not be understood that “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim” encompass every authentically reported statement of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم). Rather, there are many authentic Hadeeth collected by other scholars that neither one of them (al-Bukhaaree &amp; Muslim) recorded in their collections.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>an-Nawawee said:</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">“The intent of both al-Bukhaaree and Muslim was only to collect a large number of authentic Hadeeth just as a book of Fiqh [2] may collect texts pertaining to many different issues, not encompass every possible issue. However, if there is a Hadeeth having an authentic chain of narration that one of them may have left out, or even both of them, then they would have had a reason to do so or they may have recorded a similar Hadeeth in its place. From what is well-known from them, it may be assumed that perhaps they felt it better not to record it, or perhaps they even forgot. They also may have left certain Hadeeth out in order not to make their collections even longer than they are, or they felt what they have recorded was sufficient pertaining to a certain topic. They may have had other reasons as well.”</p>



<p class="has-background has-very-light-gray-background-color" style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Point:</strong></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars unanimously agree and consider “Saheeh al-Bukhaaree” and “Saheeh Muslim” to be the most authentic written works of Hadeeth. Regarding this, the famous scholar, Ibn Taymiyyah, said, “There is no Hadeeth they both agree to be authentic except that it is undoubtedly authentic.” He also said, “The vast majority of their narrations, the scholars of Hadeeth know with certainty that the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) actually said them.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Title: “I Have Forbidden Oppression”<br />
شرح األربعني النبوييه :Title Original<br />
Author: Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Ḥadīth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Dharr al-Ghifārī (رضي الله عنه) reported that the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) narrated that his lord said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Oh my servants, I have forbidden oppression even for myself, and I have made it forbidden among you as well, so do not oppress one another.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Explanation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, <strong>“Oh my servants, I have made oppression forbidden even for myself,”</strong> and He (Azza wa Jal) may make something forbidden upon himself because the decision is His. As for us, we make nothing forbidden for Him, but He may forbid something upon Himself as he wishes just as He may obligate and decree something upon Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Read the statement of Allah (تعالى ) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “To who belongs whatever is in the heavens and earth?” Say, “To Allah.” He has decreed upon himself mercy.</span></strong>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he pledged upon himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“My mercy surpasses my anger.”</strong></span> [5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has also made oppression forbidden among us as he says, “And I have made it forbidden among you as well.” This includes a person oppressing himself or others. However, the second meaning is more apparent as he then says, “So do not oppress one another.” Meaning: None of you may oppress another individual. Still, it is known that oppression may occur against oneself or against another;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;And we did not oppress them, but they oppressed themselves.&#8221;</strong></span> [6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word for oppression, ظُلْم ẓulm, often revolves around failing to give someone else his or her rights or it could linguistically mean “shortcomings” as in the following verse as Allah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Each of the two gardens produced its fruit and did not fall short thereof in anything.&#8221;</strong></span>[7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This understanding of oppression—failing to give others their rights—is of two types: 1) refusing to fulfill an obligation to another person, and 2) unlawfully forcing another person to do something which he should not have to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of the first type would be if you were to refuse to repay a debt to someone or to even postpone payment based on the prophet’s statement (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;A rich person’s (one with means to repay) postponement (of repaying) is oppression.&#8221;</strong></span> [8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And an example of the second type would be if you claimed someone owed you something and you deceitfully produced evidence of the claim so that the individual was forced to pay – this is oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">By Allah’s command, “So do not oppress one another,” is there any exception to this order?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, oppression is forbidden under all circumstances, no exceptions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is it permissible for us to take the wealth or possessions of the Muā’had?</strong></span> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, it is neither permissible for us to take the wealth and possessions of those with whom we have an understood agreement of peace, nor is it permissible for us to take their blood. The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever murders a Muā’had will not even smell the fragrance of Paradise although its fragrance can be smelled from forty years away</span></strong>. [10]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah for his help.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, we know the extent of the aggression, oppression, and utter misguidance of those arrogant individuals who hostilely transgress in taking the wealth and possessions of Muā’had unbelievers regardless of whether they are non-Muslims living peacefully with you in your land or if you were in their lands. We hear of some youths in non-Muslim lands claiming there is nothing wrong with taking wealth or ruining the possessions of disbelievers. You find them breaking street lights, destroying shops, and smashing cars. This is impermissible in Islam. Glorified is Allah! A nation of people accepts you as guests into their lands, you are under their authority and their agreement of trust and yet you betray them. This is the severest form of misrepresenting and dishonoring Islam; it is slandering and disgracing Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the dishonor and disgrace is not actually against Islam. Rather it is against those individuals themselves – those who claim ascription to Islam. For that, it is incumbent to know that the wealth of non-Muslims under a trust or agreement of peace is sacred regardless of whether they are living peacefully among you or you with them in their lands. It is forbidden to show aggression and hostility against them because that is oppression.</p>

Original Title: فتح المجيد<br />
Original Author: ‘Abdur-Raḥmān Ibn Ḥasan Āli-Shaykh<br />
Translator: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison ( hafidhahullaah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Contents:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Verse:</strong> That is only Satan who frightens (you) of his supporters<br />
The Types of Fearing Others Besides Allah<br />
<strong>The Second Verse:</strong> The mosques of Allah are only to be maintained by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day<br />
<strong>The Third Verse:</strong> &#8220;And of mankind are some who say, “We believe in Allah,” but if they are made to suffer for the sake of Allah…&#8221;<br />
<strong>The Ḥadīth:</strong> “Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah by angering people, Allah will suffice him regarding people.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The First Verse:</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">That is only Satan who frightens (you) of his supporters. So do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are indeed believers.</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear is one of the most dignified and important religious principles. Fear of Allah summarizes all forms of worship which must be made solely and sincerely for Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says (about His messengers):</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">And they, from fearing Him, are frightened.</span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (تعالى ) says (about the angels):</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">They fear their Lord above them.</span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (تعالى ) says (about the believers):</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">But whoever has feared standing before his Lord will have two gardens</span>.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">So fear only Me.</span>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">So do not fear people, but fear Me.</span> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many verses in the Quran similar to these.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Fear of other than Allah can be divided into three types.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The first type of fear is an inward, spiritual fear. This type is the religious fear one has of other than Allah such as fearing idols and false gods, being afraid that they may afflict him with something he dislikes. An example is the verse in which Allah narrated that the people of Prophet Hūd said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">“We only say that some of our gods have possessed you with evil.” He said, “Indeed, I call Allah to witness, and you witness yourselves, that I am free from whatever you associate with Allah.”</span> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah also says about this type of fear:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">And they threaten you with those (they worship) other than Him.</span> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is exactly the same type of fear those who worship grave inhabitants have as well as idol worshippers; such people fear these false gods. They threaten the people who believe only in Allah with the punishment of such false deities when the believers criticize their misplaced worship, encouraging them to instead sincerely worship Allah alone. This type of fear completely invalidates tawḥīd – the worship of Allah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The second type of fearing others besides Allah is when one chooses not to do what he is religiously obligated to do out of fear of other people. This type of fear is impermissible and it is a form of associating others with Allah which contradicts complete tawḥīd. And it is this type of fear for which the opening verse was revealed; Allah (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Those to whom hypocrites said, “The people have certainly gathered against you, so fear them.” But it (only) increased them in faith and they said, “Sufficient for us is Allah and (He is) the best disposer of affairs.” So they returned with favor from Allah and bounty, no harm having touched them. They pursued the pleasure of Allah, and Allah is the possessor of great bounty. That is only Satan who frightens (you) of his supporters. So do not fear them, but fear Me, if you are indeed believers.</span> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, in a ḥadīth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah (تعالى ) will ask a worshipper on the Day of Resurrection, “What prevented you, when you saw some wrongdoing, from changing it?” The person will answer, “My Lord, the fear of people.” He will say, “I was more deserving that you fear Me.”</span> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The third type of fearing others besides Allah is the natural fear. It is the instinctive fear of an enemy, a wild animal, or similar things. There is nothing wrong with this type of fear as Allah (تعالى ) said relaying the story of Prophet Mūsá ( عليه السلام) :</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">So he escaped it (the city), fearful and anticipating (apprehension). He said, “My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people.”</span> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the meaning of &#8220;That is only Satan who frightens (you) of his supporters&#8221; in the opening verse,12 it means he tries to make you afraid of his allies. And as for &#8220;So do not fear them, but fear Me&#8221;, this is a commandment from Allah (تعالى ) to believers that they must not fear others besides Him. It is an order that they should limit their emotion of fear to Allah alone, fearing none other. This is the complete sincerity and devotion Allah requires from his worshippers and with which He is pleased. So when they ensure their fear is for none other than Allah, as well as all other aspects of worship, He will in return give them what they hope for and keep them safe and secure from the fears of this life and the hereafter as He (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">Is Allah not sufficient for His servant? And yet they threaten you with other than Him.</span>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar Ibn al-Qayyim ( رحمه الله  تعالى ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Part of the plot of the enemy of Allah is that he tries to frighten believers with his soldiers and supporters. He does so in order that the believers will be too scared to oppose and strive against them, too scared to encourage his supporters to do good or forbid them from doing evil. As such, Allah, the Most High, informs us that this is all part of the plot and deception of Satan and his intimidation and frightening (of believers). Yet He has forbidden us from fearing them by saying—and this is the interpretation of most interpreters—that Satan is only trying to make the believers scared of his supporters. Qatādah says, “He (Satan) makes them (his supporters) seem greater, more significant in the believer’s hearts.” So whenever a worshipper’s faith in Allah becomes stronger, the fear of Satan’s supporters becomes less, and when his faith weakens, his fear of them becomes greater. Therefore, this verse shows that sincerity in fear is one of the conditions of complete faith.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Second Verse</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">The mosques of Allah are only to be maintained by those who believe in Allah and the Last Day and establish prayer and give charity and fear none other besides Allah. It is expected that those will be of the rightly guided.</span>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, Allah tells us the mosques of Allah are to be maintained only by people of faith in Allah and the last day (the Day of Judgment). They are those who both believe with their hearts and worship with their limbs, and they make their fear sincerely and exclusively for Allah and no other. For these, He has confirmed the maintenance of places of worship after He forbade it for those who worship others besides Him. This is because the establishment and care of such places of worship is to be done with obedience (to Allah) and righteous actions. As for one who worships other than Allah, even if he were to perform a seemingly righteous action:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Their deeds are like a mirage in a desert which a thirsty one thinks is water until, when he comes to it, he finds it is nothing but finds Allah before him.</span> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Or:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">Their deeds are like ashes which the wind blows forcefully on a stormy day.</span>[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Considering that, true goodness does not result from such action or person. So places of worship, the mosques, should be maintained and populated with only true faith, the most dignified of which is tawḥīd and righteous deeds free of all forms of deficiency such as the worship of other than Allah and unfounded religious innovation. All of that is included in the meaning of the word “faith” (īmān) according to mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About &#8220;and (they) fear none other besides Allah&#8221; in the verse, Ibn ‘Aṭiyyah says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It means the type of fear which is based on honor, worship, and obedience. And while it may be inevitable that people are afraid of worldly dangers, they must ultimately fear the decree and control of Allah alone regarding (the consequences) of such worldly dangers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim ( رحمه الله ) says,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Fear is worship of the heart, and it is not fitting to be given to others besides Allah, similar to repentance, love, reliance, hope, and other aspects of worship of the heart.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for &#8220;It is expected that those will be of the rightly guided&#8221;, Ibn Abī Ṭalḥah reported that Ibn ‘Abbās ( رضي الله عنه ) ماsaid, “He is saying, ‘They are the rightly guided.’ Any time the Arabic word ‘( عَسَىasá – “perhaps,” “it is expected,” etc.) is used in the Quran, it means it is something destined to happen.” [17]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The Third Verse</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And of mankind are some who say, “We believe in Allah.” But if they are made to suffer for the sake of Allah, they consider the trial of mankind as (if it were equal to) the punishment of Allah.</span> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Kathīr ( رحمه الله ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) informs us about the characteristics of some people who dishonestly claim to believe, but their belief is only with their tongues and not firm in their hearts. For such people, when a trial or tribulation comes to them in this life, they believe it is from the resentment and wrath of Allah and then leave Islam. Ibn ‘Abbās ( رضي الله عنه ما ) said, “It becomes a tribulation from which he leaves his religion when harmed for the sake of Allah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn al-Qayyim ( رحمه الله ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When people are sent a messenger, they become one of two types of individuals: those who respond, “I believe,” and those who do not. Those who refuse continue on with their sin and disbelief. As for he who says he believes, he is then tested by his Lord with trial and affliction; the affliction is only a test however. This is to distinguish the truthful from the untruthful. As for those who do not believe (in the messenger), he should not think that Allah is incapable (of testing him), or that he will escape from Him. As a consequence, whoever believes in the messengers and obeys them, the messengers’ enemies will begin to show enmity toward him and afflict him with whatever will harm him (in this life). And those who neither believe in the messengers nor obey them, they will be recompensed in this life and in the hereafter and will still eventually experience what harms them. Yet their harm is greater and more lasting than that experienced in life by the messenger’s followers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So even though every soul will experience some type of harm, whether it believes or refuses belief, a believer is hurt in this life only as a trial for him then he will be rewarded for it both in this life and in the hereafter. But he who refuses to believe, he may experience his delight in this life, again only as a trial for him, then he experiences a permanent harm and everlasting pain (in the hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone must live among others and people have their own ideas and plans. People want other individuals to agree and conform to them in their plans. If one does not agree with them, choosing instead to contradict them, they seek to harm and punish him. Even if he were to conform to them, he would still be harmed, sometimes by the very people he agrees with, sometimes by others. For example, if a person of religion who is conscientious of Allah is among sinful or oppressive people, he may feel he has no way of escaping their wickedness and oppression except by either agreeing and conforming to what they are upon or at least by remaining silent regarding their evil. Were he to support them or remain silent, he may save himself from their evil and tribulations. But they will then have gained influence and power over him, humiliating him and perhaps harming him with affliction even greater than he had feared had he criticized them and differed from them. Even if he were safe from them, he may simply be humiliated and harmed by other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The solution is to remember what the Mother of the Believers, ‘Āishah ( رضي الله عنها ), said to Muā’wiyah ( رضي الله عنه ): Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah by angering people, Allah will suffice him regarding people. And whoever seeks the pleasure of people by angering Allah, Allah will entrust him to people.” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allah guides an individual, inspiring within him His guidance and saving him from the evil of his own soul, such a person would refuse to support and agree with others in sinful acts. He would patiently bear whatever enmity they show him for it. He will then have his reward in this life and the hereafter as did the messengers and their followers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (تعالى ) then informs us about those who enter the faith without true insight. When he is harmed for the sake of Allah, he considers the tribulation of people—and it is the hurt he feels from them and their hatred which the messengers and their followers always experience from those who oppose them—he makes such tribulation of people, by his fleeing from it and avoiding whatever upsets them, equal to the punishment of Allah from which believers should more rightfully flee with true faith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">True believers with complete insight, however, flee from the punishment of Allah toward belief in Him. They bear patiently with whatever temporary harm they may suffer (from people) for Him, harm from which they will soon escape. But the other individual (who refuses to differ from sinful people), from his weak insight and unclear understanding of faith, flees from the harm of those who oppose the messengers toward agreeing with them and following them. In doing so, he flees from the punishment of people and into the punishment of Allah. He equates the harm of people, by his action of fleeing from it in what angers Allah, with the punishment of Allah. How unbefitting it is that he seeks safety and refuge (from people’s harm) in the scorching fire, running away from the pain of an hour to the pain of eternity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in this verse is a refutation of the Murjiah Karrāmiyah sect (who claim that merely expressing faith with the tongue is sufficient to be saved). This is because such peoples’ statement, “We believe in Allah,” as mentioned in the verse, did not benefit them when they refused to patiently bear the harm of those who would hurt them for the sake of Allah. So proclaiming faith alone is of no benefit without actions. True religious faith of any person is only correct when it combines three aspects: belief in the heart and its actions (emotions in accordance with faith), statements with the tongue, and actions with the limbs. That is the position of all mainstream Muslims who follow the Sunnah, past and present, and Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such action (conforming to sinfulness, refusing to differ from it) is a form of flattering the creation despite the truth, and the only one saved from such action is one whom Allah saves.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Ḥadīth</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Āishah ( رضي الله عنه ) reported that Allah’s messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah by angering people, Allah will suffice him regarding people. And whoever seeks the pleasure of people by angering Allah, Allah will entrust him to people.”</span> [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Ḥibbān recorded this ḥadīth with that wording and al-Tirmidhī recorded it by way of a man from Medina who said that Mu’āwiyah ( رضي الله عنه ) wrote to ‘Āishah ( رضي الله عنها) : “Write and advise me but be concise.” She replied, greeting him with “Peace be on you,” then wrote that she heard the messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) say, “Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah by angering people, Allah will suffice him regarding people. And whoever seeks the pleasure of people by angering Allah, Allah will entrust him to people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholar of Islam (Ibn Taymiyyah) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Āishah wrote this ḥadīth to Mu’āwiyah and it has been reported from her in a marfū’ form [21] that she said, “Whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah by angering people, Allah will suffice him regarding people. And whoever seeks the pleasure of people by angering Allah, they will not protect him from Allah in any way.” That is the marfū’ form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been reported in a mawqūf form [22] that she said, “Whoever pleases Allah at the expense of angering people, Allah will be pleased with him and cause people to be pleased with him too. But whoever pleases people at the expense of angering Allah, He will make those who praise him revert back to criticizing him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the greatest understanding of religion. Whoever seeks to please Allah, even if it means angering people, he has rightfully feared Allah and has become His righteous worshipper. Allah in return assumes the responsibility of protecting the righteous and He is sufficient for his worshipper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever fears Allah, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty), and He will provide him from (sources) he could never imagine</span>.[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah will certainly suffice him from having to rely on people. As for trying to please all people, that is impossible anyway.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for, “seeking the pleasure of people by angering Allah,” in doing this, the person gives preference to people’s acceptance and happiness over that of Allah. This happens when the honor and respect for Allah and His greatness has not settled in his heart. If it had, it would have prevented him from seeking to gain the pleasure of the creation by gaining the anger of his creator, his Lord, and owner – the very One who controls all hearts, removes all difficulties, and forgives all sins. Based on this, such a choice (preferring to please people by angering Allah) is a form of associating others in worship with Allah because he considers pleasing the creation a higher priority than pleasing Allah. He seeks to get closer to creation by way of displeasing Allah. And no one is saved from this except one whom Allah saves and for whom He gives the success of truly knowing Him. This is attained by knowing what befits Allah by believing in His characteristics and rejecting any false notions which reduce His perfection and knowing tawḥīd of His lordship and sole right to worship. With Allah alone is success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab ( رحمه الله ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one realizes that anyone of creation on earth—and the earth is merely dirt—is himself (created) from dirt, then why would someone give preference to obeying someone from dirt over obeying the Lord of lords? How can he please dirt by angering the Owner, the Bestower? That is certainly an amazing thing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this ḥadīth, there is a severe reprimand for whoever fears people, preferring their acceptance and pleasure over Allah. And perhaps his punishment for doing so may even be a test or affliction in his religion—we seek refuge with Allah from that—as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So He punished them with hypocrisy in their hearts until the day they will meet Him because they failed Allah in what they promised Him and because they used to lie</span>. [24]</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">A FRIDAY SERMON BY: Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Muslims, there is a certain well known pastime of tribulation and temptation into which many people fall today. Unfortunately, this issue does not negatively affect only the individuals who fall into it. Rather, its consequences affect others as Allah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Beware of a trial which will not afflict only those who have transgressed among you exclusively, and know that Allah is severe in penalty.</strong></span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims, the tribulations to which I refer are temptations pertaining to (the unlawful admiration of) women, and it is such trials about which the messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I will not leave behind a trial more harmful to men than (the temptations of) women.</span></strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a trial which the shameful ones readily partake in, one that affects their desires, blinds their eyes, and destroys their judgment. This eventually leads them to following women around in the streets and shopping malls, flirting with them, whistling at them and whispering to them. They may even go so far as to touch or grope women in public as if they are completely unconcerned with others around them. Perhaps they see others as insignificant as if they were cattle. This is because such people are immersed in their own lust. They belittle morality and they defy societal norms. They are fearless before Allah (Azza wa Jal) as they choose ways (to support their desires) other than the respectable ways of sensible people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must, as a believing Muslim people, renounce these activities perpetrated by such immoral individuals. We detest these types of behaviors because they contradict the characteristics and qualities of believers in Allah and the last day. We disapprove of such actions because they are means leading one closer to adultery or fornication about which Allah (تعالى)  says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And do not approach adultery, fornication. Certainly, it has always been immoral and an evil way</span></strong>.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We condemn this behavior (of chasing after women, watching them desirously, flirting with them, etc.) because it infringes upon personal safety and security, and it could lead to community fear, panic (among women), and societal disorder. And we criticize it because it may inevitably bring about a swift, overwhelming and inclusive punishment. Allaah (azza wa jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">When we intend to destroy a town, we command its affluent ones, but they defiantly disobey. So the word comes into effect upon it, and we destroy it with complete destruction.</span></strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, <strong>&#8220;We command&#8221;</strong> is a type of universal responsibility befitting those of affluence and power (to enforce change in society). Allah mentions the <strong>&#8220;affluent ones&#8221;</strong> because it is often the rich and powerful who immerse themselves in sin. And if they refuse to change, <strong>&#8220;The word comes into effect upon it, and we destroy it with complete destruction.&#8221;</strong> After mentioning His punishment for adultery and fornication (among other sins), Allah then speaks about the exception, those who will avoid punishment, the true worshippers of the Most-Merciful:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever does that incurs sin. The punishment will be multiplied upon him and he will abide therein disgraced, except for those who repent, believe, and do righteous deeds. For them, Allah will replace their bad deeds with good ones and Allah is ever forgiving, merciful.</span></strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Muslims, You who try to safeguard your dignity and protect the women in your care, immoral qualities and shameful behaviors such as these to which some people degenerate—and such behavior was not prevalent in our society until recently—weaken your religion, weaken your honorable protectiveness of women, and spread the means leading to tribulations and societal problems.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Weakening of One’s Religion</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the weakening of one’s religion, these people who follow women around, being tested with admiring and flirting with them, had they been strong in religion, they would not dare do the kinds of things they do with women. Such actions result in their sinning against Allah (azza wa jal)  and preoccupying themselves with and giving preference to the creation instead of the creator. Allah (azza wa jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Tell the believing men to lower their gazes and protect their private parts. That is purer for them. Allah is certainly aware of everything they do.</span></strong> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Weakening of One’s Honorable Protectiveness of Women</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the weakening of one’s honorable protectiveness – the praiseworthy type of respectful jealousy one should have of women – individuals afflicted with this temptation to “chase women,” had they had the complete respectful honor for women, they would not dare chase after the women of their brothers (in faith), the women (sisters, daughters, mothers) of their fellow citizens, thereby putting those women into the same types of temptations and tribulations. The type of religious brotherhood we have obliges men to respect and honor his brothers’ womenfolk and those of his fellow citizens, having the same kind of commendable jealousy for their honor and chastity as he has for his own female relatives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would ask these men: Would you be happy to know that someone chases after your own wife out of desire for her? Or your daughter, your sister, or other female relatives? Would you like people flirting with them? If he would hate such behavior with his own women, why would he allow his own desires to tempt him into doing the same things with other women? I warn these individuals who have been afflicted with such admiration of women from the very actions which would allow another man to gain influence over his own women. I advise them to prevent his relatives from becoming afflicted with such trials.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Spreading of Tribulations &amp; Societal Problems</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tribulations and temptations to admire and chase after women are many. Such behavior (because of its popularity and influence) leads to various forms of widespread media, including audio, visual, and written publications, being placed in the hands of our young men and women. They have newspapers and magazines filled with images and articles that arouse their desires, stimulate their emotions, and kindle the fires of passion. Even worse than this media is that which comes to our land from abroad, or sometimes even from our own citizens. We ask Allah to guide them and to protect us from their evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another way this tribulation may spread is by the very blessings which Allah has bestowed on this land: the comfort of its society, its excess wealth, good food, and the overall security and prosperity of our society. Oftentimes, such luxuries lead one’s heart to become empty and the body to become idle from inactivity or unemployment. This is why you almost always find these young men to be one of two types. They are often unsuccessful men who have no careers to occupy their time or attention. They live off the prosperity of other wealthy, successful men. They neither know a skill, nor try to learn one. They do not work towards a specific occupation or official career. Thus, his desires get the better of him and leave him in a perpetual downfall.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or they may often be men who may work but they waste the results of their labor, wasting their earnings, unconcerned with its value or what results from the bad consequences of their actions. But as for a dignified, determined believer, he does not allow his personality to deteriorate to the point of such shallow yet despicable behavior. Other ways these temptations spread is what some women of immoral conduct themselves perpetrate in their choice of clothing, their appearance, and lustful behaviors. By these choices, they are inclined to promote this type of tribulation. Such conduct was foreign to our righteous predecessors. Some women go to shopping centers to flaunt themselves, to exhibit their beauty with the most attractive clothing they own. They may then throw over it a thin cloak but one that might be shortened or raised up so that her attractive clothing underneath is displayed. They are dressed yet still appear naked, wearing the types of garments the women of Hell wear. The prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two types of the people of Hell that I have never seen: (1) People with whips like the tails of cattle with which they beat people, and (2) women who are dressed but appear naked, walking with an enticing strut with their heads looking like the humps of camels. They will never enter Paradise, nor even smell its fragrance although its scent can be perceived from such and such a distance. [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some women also frequent shopping centers adorned with gold jewelry or elegant watches, walking in such a manner and revealing her hands (in an attractive, seductive way) to entice those who see her even though Allah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They (believing women) should not strike their feet in such a manner that the adornment they hide may be known</strong></span>. [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other women go out perfumed, sometimes choosing to wear the strongest, most fragrant perfume so that almost every man she passes who smells her scent, she allures him with it. The prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said about this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Any woman who has been around incense should not join us in the last evening prayer.</span></strong> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>A woman, if she wears perfume and then passes by a gathering (of men), she is this and that (meaning: a type of adulterer, fornicator).</strong> </span>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other women frequent the malls unveiled or wearing a thin veil that barely conceals her face. Perhaps it is even worn as a way of beautifying her face, or just to hide some blemish on her face. Still other women may cover their faces yet they wear the veil so tightly that their nose, eyebrows, and cheeks are shown. These are no doubt temptations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You also find women roaming shopping centers in a strutting, swaying manner and joke and giggle with their girlfriends. Sometimes they visit shops, with or without need, to chat with the salesman, prolonging their conversation. Perhaps she requests an item stored in the back of the shop that she actually does not want; she just wants to keep chatting with the salesman. Yet Allah (Azza wa Jal) told the prophet’s wives and they were considered the “mothers of the believers,” they were the most pure and farthest from any behaviors or situations of temptation – Allah told them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do not be soft in speech (to men) for fear that he in whose heart is a disease should desire (you), but speak in an honorable manner.</strong></span> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims, we have described some things regarding the sickness but is there a cure? The answer is yes and there are several types of medicine thanks to Allah. We are a Muslim nation practicing the religion of Islam, and Allah (Azza wa Jal) has clarified the general responsibilities a man has regarding his family members and the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has spoken about this as well. As for Allah (Azza wa Jal) He says in His noble book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You who believe, protect yourselves and your families from a fire whose fuel is people and stones over which are (appointed) angels, stern and severe. They do not disobey Allah in what He commands them but do as they are commanded.</strong></span>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Sunnah, the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Each of you is a shepherd and each of you is responsible for his flock. The leader is a shepherd and responsible for his flock (i.e., citizens). A man is a shepherd over his family and responsible for his flock. A woman is a shepherd in her husband’s home and responsible for her flock. And a servant, worker is a shepherd over the property of his master, boss. So each of you is a shepherd and is responsible for his flock.</strong></span>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Worshippers of Allah, fear Allah and fulfill your responsibilities. Continuously prevent and discourage the women in your care from visiting shopping centers to behave in manners that contradict religious rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah to help us and you with regards to the medicine of integrity and honor, to guide us and guide others with us for He is capable of all things. All thanks are for Allah, the lord of the worlds, and may Allah send peace and prayers on our prophet, Muhammad, and upon his family and companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Ibn al-‘Uthaymīn continues in the second part of his Friday sermon…</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh Muslim brothers. You, men who are caretakers of women, men who are responsible for your families, fear Allah with respect to yourselves and families. Cultivate in them respectable manners and praiseworthy characteristics, and discourage them from becoming the very means which lead to temptations and tribulations. You are men and they are women and men have been charged with taking care of women because of what Allah has given one over the other and because men (are obliged to) spend their wealth to support them. [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man should neither be (helpless, having no influence) as if he were simply a rock in his house, nor should he be as if he is one of the women. Rather, he must act like a man in every sense of the word. Be shepherds; be responsible and influential so that you live among your families as men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people go to great measures to ensure their financial stability, carefully watching their expenses, their checkbooks and bookkeeping. Yet they neglect their family members for whom they are personally and immediately responsible. Such a man, were he to lose a single sheep from his flock (a single coin, for example), he would search right and left for it until it is found. All the while, he remains unconcerned that his family members, his sons and daughters, are losing their manners and good character.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Men are protectors and maintainers of women by what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend (to support them) from their wealth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fulfill the obligations Allah has placed over you. This is my advice I present to you as I remind you that you are responsible for your families because Allah told you this and the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has charged you with this. Do you want to waste this trust you have been given? Do you want to be unable to answer when you are made to stand in front of Allah and asked about this trust?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear Allah and take seriously the obligations Allah has placed on you. Do not neglect and waste your chances at raising your family. If you fail in the upbringing of your family and this man fails his family and that man fails, soon the entire society becomes corrupt. Society is a conglomeration made up of individuals, so when the individuals become corrupt the entire population is corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I conclude this speech of mine asking Allah (Azza wa Jal) to assist us and you all in fulfilling our responsibilities we have regarding the safeguarding of our families. Oh Allah, help us care for our families, providing the best care for them.</p>

<p>[11] <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>None of you should die except while he is having good thoughts about Allah</strong></span> (عزّ وجلّ)</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>al-Nawawī’s Explanation</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is again from al-Nawawī’s explanation of Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the statement of the prophet » None of you should die except while he is having good thoughts about Allah « scholars have said that this is a warning against losing hope and despairing (of Allah’s mercy) and an encouragement to have hope especially at the time of death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه وتعالى) also said in the previous ḥadīth » “<strong>I am as my servant thinks of Me</strong>.” « and (considering both ḥadīth) scholars explain that » <strong>having good thoughts about Allah</strong> « means that an individual should expect Allah to have mercy on him and pardon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars have also said that during times of wellbeing and health, an individual should have both hope and fear in Allah and these two feelings should be equally balanced. Others say that one’s fear should be more, but when the signs of death approach, a person’s hope in Allah’s mercy should become stronger. This is because the very purpose of having fear of Allah is to prevent oneself from committing sins and ugly deeds and to increase in obedience and good deeds. And those things are most often not possible during that situation (i.e., during the last moments of one’s death).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Instead, in that situation, assuming good thoughts about Allah is preferable which would cause one to have feelings of destitution and submission and to feel oneself in total need of Allah (تعالى).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ḥadīth mentioned by Imām Muslim right after this one also supports this understanding:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« يُبْعَثُ كُلُّ عَبْدٍ عَلَى مَا مَاتَ عَلَيْهِ »</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Every servant will be resurrected according to what he died upon</strong>.[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars explain that it means each individual will be resurrected in the same state in which he died. The next ḥadīth (in Imām Muslim’s authentic collection) also supports this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« إِذَا أَرَادَ اللَّهُ بِقَوْمٍ عَذَابًا أَصَابَ الْعَذَابُ مَنْ كَانَ فِيهِمْ ثُمَّ بُعِثُوا عَلَى<br />
أَعْمَالِهِمْ.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When Allah intends to punish an entire group of people, the punishment afflicts them all, but then each is resurrected according to (his individual) deeds</strong></span>.[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the ḥadīth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« إِنَّمَا يُبْعَثُ النَّاسُ عَلَى نِيَّاتِهِمْ »</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>People will only be resurrected upon their (individual) intentions.</strong></span> [14]</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>al-Manāwī’s Explanation</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following explanation is from al-Manāwī’s, Fayḍ al-Qadīr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) statement » None of you should die except while he is having good thoughts about Allah « means: Let none of you die under any circumstance except while in the state of thinking good about Allah (تعالى) in that He will be merciful with you and pardon you. This is because when a person’s time of passing arrives and his journey comes to an end, his fear (of Allah) has no real purpose (to prevent him from bad deeds during life). It would perhaps lead him to despair and to a feeling of restriction of (Allah’s) mercy and bounties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever at that time, even if his heart were laden with major sins, begins expecting the best (of his Lord) and increases in hope, he has then perfected his provisions for his arrival to his Lord…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Ṭībī said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) instructs one to ensure he does not die in any state other than expecting and assuming good about Allah. And this does not mean one can change destiny or fate. Rather, what is intended is that an individual is commanded to have good thoughts (about Allah) so that when death overcomes him, he is in such a state.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Selections [1] from Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Ḥikam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[1] Taken from Ibn Rajab al-Ḥanbalī’s book Jāmi’ al-‘Ulūm wal-Ḥikam, an explanation of the forty-two famous ḥadīth collected by Imām al-Nawawī. The ḥadīth explained in this article is number nineteen.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:<br />
<span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;<strong>Know Allah in prosperity, He will know you in adversity</strong></span>.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a worshipper is conscious and fearful of Allah in times of ease and wellbeing, preserving His rules and paying careful attention to His rights upon him, he begins to know Allah. There is then established between him and his Lord a special relationship. In return, his Lord will remember and know His worshipper during his times of hardship. He will preserve and take care of such person’s relationship with Him in difficult times. Because of this relationship, Allah saves his worshipper from his difficulties. This special relationship brings an individual close to his Lord and ensures His love for him and His answering of his prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A person’s “knowing his Lord” is of two types:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A general knowledge. When a person is familiar with Allah is this manner, he simply accepts that He exists, affirms correct belief in Him, and has faith in Him. All believers in general know Allah in this way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A specific knowledge and relationship. When a person truly knows Allah, he turns his heart completely to Him, devotes himself to Him, and feels at ease with Him. He is comforted when Allah is mentioned although he is still shy before Him and fears Him. Those who truly know Allah focus on this specific type of “knowing Him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Similarly, Allah’s “knowing his servant” is of two types.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A general knowledge. This is Allah’s knowledge of all His servants, His observation of everything they conceal or make apparent, as He ( تعالى ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And indeed We have created mankind, and We know what his own self whispers to him.&#8221; </strong></span>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of this general type of Allah knowing His creation is His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;He was most knowing of you when He produced you from the earth and when you were fetuses in the wombs of your mothers</span></strong>.&#8221; [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A specific knowledge and relationship. This type of “knowing His servant” is when Allah loves His worshipper, brings him close to Him, answers his prayers, and helps him out of difficulties. This is the type of relationship the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) refers to when he said that Allah says (in a ḥadīth qudsī):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“My servant continues to come close to Me with extra acts of worship until I love him. When I love him, I become his ears with which he hears, his eyes with which he sees, his hand with which he strikes, and his leg with which he walks. Were he to ask Me for anything, I would certainly give it him, and were he to seek My help, I would certainly help him.”</strong></span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Illustrating this specific type of Allah knowing His servants, there is a report that when al-Ḥasan was fleeing the oppression of al-Ḥajjāj, he came to the house of Ḥabīb Ibn Muḥammad. Ḥabīb said to him, “Abū Saī’d, is there no relationship between you and your Lord by which you could pray to Him to hide you from these people? Come into the house.” al-Ḥasan went inside, and al-Ḥajjāj’s soldiers went in after him but could not see him. When that was mentioned to al-Ḥajjāj, he said, “He was inside the house but Allah blinded your eyes so that you could not see him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, whoever shows Allah constant, respectful fear and obedience during times of ease and prosperity, Allah will show him gentleness and assistance during times of difficulty and adversity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Tirmidhī recorded a ḥadīth from Abū Hurayrah ( رضي الله عنه ) that the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever would like Allah to answer him during hardships and difficulties then let him increase in supplication during times of wellbeing.&#8221; </strong></span>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most difficult hardship a servant faces in this life is death; what comes after it is even more severe if the servant’s final destination is not good (Paradise). So it is necessary for a believer to prepare for death and what follows it during times of ease and wellbeing by remaining constantly conscious and fearful of Allah and doing righteous deeds (during life). Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Oh you who believe, fear Allah and let every soul look to what it has put forth for tomorrow. And fear Allah, indeed Allah is aware of what you do. And do not be like those who forgot Allah so He made them forget about their own souls. Those are the defiantly disobedient ones</strong></span>.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever remembers Allah while in good health, in times of ease and comfort, and prepares himself for his meeting with Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ) upon death and afterwards, Allah will in return remember him during these hardships (associated with death). He will be with the person during such difficulties. Allah will be gentle with him as He assists him, takes care of him, and keeps him firm upon the worship of Allah alone (when he dies). Allah will then meet the person while being happy with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, whoever forgets Allah during times of ease and comfort (in life) and fails to prepare for his meeting with Him, Allah will forget him during these hardships (of death). And the “forgetting” here means Allah will abandon the person and disregard him.[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when death comes to a true believer in Allah, one who has prepared for it and has good expectations of his Lord, and the good news of Allah comes to him, he then would love to meet Allah and Allah would love to meet him. However, a wicked person is just the opposite of that (i.e., he hates to meet Allah so Allah hates to meet him).[9] The believer is then filled with happiness with what he put forth before him (in life) and with what he is about to arrive at (Paradise). As for someone who is negligent (who forgot about his own soul), he is filled with regret, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Oh, how I regret what I neglected regarding Allah</strong></span>.<strong>&#8220;</strong> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This is part of a longer ḥadīth recorded by Aḥmad, al-Bayhaqī, and al-Lālakāī and Shaykh Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī said it is authentic in his al-Jāmi’ al-Saghīr wa Ziyādatuh (5272).<br />
[3] The Quran, Sūrah Qāf (50:16)<br />
[4] Sūrah al-Najm (53:32)<br />
[5] Recorded by al-Bukhārī<br />
[6] Recorded by al-Tirmidhī (no. 3382) and al-Albānī said it is ḥasan in Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan al-Tirmidhī (no. 2693).<br />
[7] Sūrah al-Ḥashr (59:18-19)<br />
[8] About this type of “forgetting” them, Allah says in Sūrah al-‘Arāf (7:51):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">So today We will forget them just as they forgot the meeting of this day of theirs and for having rejected Our verses.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His ( سبحانسَه وتعالى ) frightening verses in Sūrah ṬāHā (20:124-126):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;">And whoever turns away from My remembrance, he will certainly have a depressed life, and We will gather him on the Day of Resurrection blind. He will say, “My Lord, why have you raised me blind while I used to see?&#8221; (Allah) will answer, “Likewise Our signs came to you but you forgot them, so likewise you will today be forgotten.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] About this, the messenger of Allah ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said (recorded by al-Bukhārī):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, “<span style="color:#339966;">If my servant loves to meet Me, I love to meet him, and if he hates to meet me, I hate to meet him</span>.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Muḥammad Ibn Ṣāliḥ al-‘Uthaymīn’s Explanation: [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>[10] The selections here are from Ibn al-‘Uthaymīn’s explanation of Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn. Since the chapter in Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn where the ḥadīth under discussion appears includes preceding verses of the Quran related to lowering one’s gaze, his explanation of those verses have also been included here for the benefit it contains and its relevancy to this translated work.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The chapter in al-Nawawī’s Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn (in which the ḥadīth under discussion appears) begins with the following verses.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;Tell the believers to lower their gaze.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[Sūrah al-Nūr (24:30)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Looking at non-relative women is forbidden as the author رحمه الله says and that is because Allah commanded that we lower our gaze as He says &#8220;<strong>Tell the believers to lower their gaze and preserve their private parts. That is purer for them. Allah is certainly aware of what you do</strong>.&#8221; He instructs us to lower our gaze and guard our private parts, and this indicates that when someone does not restrain his gaze, that becomes the very means by which he may fail to preserve his private parts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person is liberal with his eyes, allowing them to roam freely, his heart becomes infatuated with women. He continues to look at them until he may approach a woman, speak to her, carry on a conversation with her, arrange a date with her, and then finally the immorality (of adultery) happens. We seek protection with Allah from this. This is why the look has been called “the messenger” or “delivery” of adultery; it invites to illegal sexual activity, and this is why Allah commands us to lower our gaze.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He عز وجلalso says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;He knows the eyes’ deceit and what the breasts conceal&#8221;</strong><br />
[Sūrah al-Ghāfir (40:19)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8220;eyes’ deceit&#8221; is the visions a person’s sight may steal (when looking at impermissible things). In other words, a person may secretly look at something forbidden when people cannot observe him. However, Allah certainly knows what he is doing because &#8220;He knows the eyes’ deceit&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah جل وعلى also knows &#8220;what the breasts conceal&#8221; of both good and bad intentions. He even knows the ideas a person’s own soul may inwardly suggest to him and what he accepts of those suggestions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah تعالى also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;Surely the hearing, the sight, and the heart – of each of those one will be questioned&#8221;</strong><br />
[Sūrah al-Isrā (17:36)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person is accountable for his hearing and will be questioned about it. What did he listen to with his ears? Did he listen to impermissible speech or to a woman, enjoying the sound of her voice? Likewise an individual is accountable for his sight and heart so it is critical that a person safeguards himself (regarding his senses). As for a woman relative or someone to whom it would be forbidden for him to marry anyway, there is no problem with looking at her. He may see her face, her head, her hands, her arms, her legs and feet; there is no problem with any of this unless there is some sort of temptation he fears for himself. If he feels there would be some temptation for him, then he should not even look at women that are religiously considered as his female kin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if a man had a “sister” because his mother breastfed another girl in infancy who was originally unrelated to him, if such a woman was considered beautiful in his eyes, then looking at her would not be permissible even though a sister of breastfeeding is considered by the religion to be of the same status of an actual, related sister. If he feels some kind of temptation by looking at her, he must then lower his gaze when with her. She must also cover up when she is with him because the origin and purpose behind the ḥijāb (the religious covering) is to prevent temptations. So if she finds some sort of temptation, then she too must cover her face even in front of related men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if there is no such temptation present and a person is chaste with a normal, sound and un-perverted heart, then he is only forbidden to look at nonrelative women not in his immediate family, for example his cousins, his sisters-inlaw, etc. In conclusion, the important point is that a man may look at women religiously considered to be his immediate relatives as long as no sort of temptation is there. As for looking at unrelated women, they are never permissible for him to look at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following ḥadīth, with the wording from Ṣaḥīḥ Muslim, is the one mentioned in Riyāḍ al-Ṣāliḥīn (and the same one mentioned on pg. 2-3 of this work).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abū Hurayrah رضي الله عنه narrated that the prophet صلّى الله عليه وسلّم said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It has been written upon the Son of Adam his share of adultery which he will indulge in; there is no escaping it. The two eyes, their adultery is looking (at what is forbidden). The two ears, their adultery is listening. The tongue, its adultery is speaking. The hand, its adultery is the touching, and the foot, its adultery is walking (toward adultery). The heart desires and hopes (for adultery) but the private parts either confirm that or deny it. » which he will indulge in; there is no escaping it « means every individual will carry out and realize his inevitable share of adultery, and there is no escape from it unless Allah protects him from doing so.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet صلّى الله عليه وسلّم then mentioned some examples such as,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The two eyes, their adultery is looking « When a man looks at unrelated women, even if it is without desire, it is a form of adultery – adultery of the eye.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The two ears, their adultery is listening « A man may listen to a woman speaking and become moved by her voice; this is the adultery of the ear. Similarly,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The hand, its adultery is the touching « which is anything physically done with the hand like touching or similar physical actions.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» the foot, its adultery is walking « and this includes when someone walks to any place wherein immorality and sexual activity is being committed. It could also be when a man hears a woman’s voice and he walks over to her or sees a woman whom he then approaches. These are all types of adultery – adultery of the foot.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» The heart desires « and may be inclined toward adultery, becoming infatuated with women and this is the adultery of the heart.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>» but the private parts either confirm that or deny it « In other words, if a person commits adultery with his private parts—we seek protection with Allah from that—he has then actualized the adultery of all his other senses and limbs. In contrast, if he does not commit adultery with his private part, choosing instead to safeguard and preserve himself, he then denies his other senses their forms of adultery.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This ḥadīth shows the extreme caution required to prevent one’s heart from being attached to women. A man must avoid becoming obsessed with their voices, looking at them, touching them, or approaching them. He has to prevent his own heart’s infatuation with the allure of women as all of these are types of adultery, and we seek protection from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every individual of sound intellect and chastity must beware and take precautions to ensure nothing of his senses or body parts become obsessed with women. Anytime a person senses himself being allured to any of that, he must retreat and keep far away (from actualizing any forms of adultery) because Satan courses through the Son of Adam like blood runs through him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the initial glance can be a poisonous arrow from Iblīs. For example, a man may glance at a woman while unconcerned with her at first sight. However, with the second look then the third he finds his heart becoming attached to her, Allah forbid. He may become so in love with that woman that he thinks of nothing but her. Standing, sitting, when he sleeps and when he wakes up, he thinks of her. And this is how the evil and temptation begins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah for wellbeing and all success is from Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">The Explanation of:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>وَبَارِكْ لِي فِيمَا أَعْطَيْتَ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>“Bless me in what You have given…”</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic word <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>بَرَكَة</strong></span> (<strong>barakah</strong>) “<strong>blessing</strong>” literally means an abundance of anything good that is continuous. The scholars even trace this word and its meaning back to the word <strong>بِرْكَة</strong> (<strong>birkah</strong>) which means a large amount of water or any wide container or gathering of water that is constantly filled with water. Similarly, the word blessing means a continuously large amount of good. So the meaning of this statement is: <strong><em>Send blessings down upon everything you have given me.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wording, “…in what you have given…” is comprehensive including anything Allah has given us of wealth, children, knowledge, and anything else Allah ( سبحانه وتعالى ) has bestowed upon us. So you ask Allah to put blessings in all of that. If Allah does not put blessings in what he has given you, you would surely be prevented from a great amount of good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">How many people have a wealth in abundance, yet it is as if they live in poverty?</span></strong> This is because they gain no real benefit from their wealth; they simply collect it and never benefit from it. This is the result of the blessings being removed from it. Likewise, many people have lots of children and grandchildren, yet their children do not benefit their parents in anything due to their disobedience and ungratefulness. Such people have not been blessed in their children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>You also find some people to whom Allah has given a great amount of knowledge, yet it is as if he is illiterate.</strong></span> You see no traces of knowledge upon him in his worship, in his character, in his manners, nor in the way he treats others. Rather, his knowledge may even increase him in arrogance and considering himself to be above the rest of Allah’s worshippers, belittling and humiliating them. Such a person does not realize the one who bestowed this knowledge upon him is none other than Allah. You see that he never benefits people with his knowledge, neither with lessons, nor advice, nor with writings. On the contrary, he is exclusively centered only upon himself. This is without doubt a great loss, even though religious knowledge is one of the most blessed things Allah gives to a servant. One reason for this is that when you teach others and spread this knowledge among people, you are rewarded from several different perspectives:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. When you spread this religious knowledge, you are spreading the religion of Allah ( عزّ وجلّ ). So you work for the sake of Allah, opening people’s hearts with knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. From the blessings of spreading knowledge and teaching it is that by doing so, there is the preservation and protection of Allah’s legislation (religious laws). If it weren’t for the passing on of knowledge, the legislation would not have been preserved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Also from the blessings of spreading knowledge is that when you teach others, you do them a great deal of good. You give them insight into the religion of Allah. And when that person then worships Allah with knowledge and insight, you are rewarded with similar rewards he is given because it was you who directed him towards a particular good deed, and the one who directs another to do something good is just like the one who actually does it. [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Also, by spreading and teaching religious knowledge, one’s own knowledge increases. It is known that anyone who teaches a particular knowledge to people, his knowledge in that subject will increase. This is because in teaching, one is recalling what he previously learned and memorized as well as learning new things that he must prepare. To this meaning, there is a famous (Arabic) proverb regarding wealth, “It increases by spending it often, and it decreases if held in a tight fist.” Similarly, if knowledge is withheld and not taught, it will eventually decrease.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] A proof of this is the ḥadīth recorded by Muslim (no. 1893), al-Tirmidhī (no. 2671), Abū Dāwūd (no. 5129), and by Aḥmad in which the prophet ( صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَنْ دَلَّ عَلَى خَيْرٍ فَلَهُ مِثْلُ أَجْرِ فَاعِلِهِ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>Whoever directs someone to do something good, he will have a reward like the one who actually did it.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Explanation of: اللَّهُمَّ اهْدِنِي فِيمَنْ هَدَيْتَ</strong><br />
<strong> “Oh Allah, guide me with those You have guided.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Guide me to the truth and assist me in acting in accordance with it. Complete, beneficial guidance is that in which Allah combines for a servant both knowledge and action. Guidance without action is of no real benefit. Rather it is even harmful because if a person does not act in accordance with what he already knows, his knowledge becomes evidence against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of guidance in the form of knowledge but with no action is the verse of Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>As for Thamūd, we guided them but they preferred blindness over guidance.</strong></span> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: We clarified the path to them and we conveyed the knowledge to them. However, they preferred blindness over guidance, and from this we seek refuge with Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from this type of guidance – simply giving the knowledge and clarifying the truth – is the statement of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى)to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And certainly, you guide to the straight path.</strong></span>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: You direct the people to the straight path and teach them about it. As for the other type of guidance which is the granting of success, an example of this type is the verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Indeed, you can’t guide whoever you like</strong></span>.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type is the guidance of granting one success in their deeds. In this case, the messenger ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) is never able to grant someone the success of their good actions as this type of guidance is specific to Allah alone. If the prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) were capable of that type of guidance, he would have guided his uncle, Abū Ṭālib. He did try to guide his uncle and even when he was about to die, the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Oh uncle, say, “There is nothing worthy of worship except Allah,&#8221; – a statement by which I will testify on your behalf before Allah.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the decree of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) had already passed that the prophet’s uncle would be from the inhabitants of the Fire, and from this we seek refuge with Allah. So Abū Ṭālib neither said nor believed that nothing has the right to be worshipped except Allah. The last thing he said before dying was that he would remain upon the religion of ‘AbdulMuṭṭalib.8 Despite this, Allah allowed his messenger ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) to intercede for Abū Ṭālib, not just because he was the prophet’s uncle, but because he used to continually defend the prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) and Islam (even though he did not personally accept Islam). So the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) interceded for Abū Ṭālib and as a result of this intercession, he ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) said about his uncle:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is in the lowest part of the fire, and if it were not for me, he would have been in the lowest, deepest part of the fire.[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) also said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Perhaps my intercession will benefit him on the Day of Resurrection so that he will be put into the lowest part of the fire, it reaching only to his ankles, yet from which his brain will boil.</strong></span> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when we say in the Du’ā of Qunūt, “Guide us with those you have guided,&#8221; we are asking Allah for both types of guidance: the guidance of knowledge and the guidance of being successful in our actions. As an example, the following verse also includes both of these types of guidance:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Guide us to the straight path.</strong></span> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when anyone says this du’ā he should sincerely call to mind that he is asking for both types of guidance: the guidance of the correct knowledge and the guidance of acting in accordance with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the wording, “…with those you have guided,&#8221; this is a way of seeking nearness to Allah by mentioning his favors on others in that he guided them. So we also ask him to bestow the same favor upon us and guide us. In other words, we ask you (Allah) for guidance, and receiving it is only by virtue of your mercy, your wisdom, and your past favors as you have guided others</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: What is the Islamic position of political strikes, demonstrations, and protests in mosques because some people claim to base these actions of theirs upon a religious verdict that has supposedly come from you, as they claim. They allege that during  some past circumstances in Algeria, you allowed these actions with the conditions that no rioting would result and no armed resistance or similar evils. So what is the ruling of this in your opinion and what is your advice for us?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: There are some people who are confused with regards to obeying the authorities. Some say that (1) giving the pledge of allegiance is only to be done to the main leader of all the Muslims in the world. Others say that (2) nothing is binding of obedience upon them because they did not personally go and pledge allegiance before the ruler, while others claim that (3) such obedience is only to the king and not to  others of (lesser) authority. What do you say about this?</p>

جوابا على من يقول : اخلروج على احلاكم مسألة اجتهادية :Original Title<br />
Author: Ṣāliḥ al-Fawzān<br />
Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: What do you say, may Allah preserve you, about a person who states that the issue of rebelling and opposing the ruler (king, president, government, etc.) is only a matter of Ijtihād (independent, personal interpretation) and says that there is a  difference of opinion regarding the issue among the Salaf. Therefore, it is not permissible  to accuse those who differ in this regard (those who allow political revolution and opposition) of being innovators or sinners.</p>

الفتاوى الشرعية يف القضايا العصرية :Original Title<br />
Author: ‘Abdul-Azīz Ibn Bāz<br />
Translator : Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some young people today think that showing enmity towards disbelievers, those who reside in Islamic lands or those visiting here, is sanctioned by the Islamic legislation. For this reason, some of them even think it is permissible to kill them or kidnap them if they see from them something they detest.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It’s <strong>forbidden</strong> to kill a non-Muslim resident or anyone who legitimately and legally entered the country with the permission of the government under a contract of safety (indicated by the issuance of a visa). Showing any type of aggression towards them is also <strong>impermissible</strong>. Any criminal actions that occur from them must be reported to the legitimate Islamic authorities.[1]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Those Who Commit Suicide in the Name of “Jihad” are Actually Followers of Satan<br />
املنتحرون باسم اجلهاد أتباع للشيطان :Original Title<br />
Author: Ṣāliḥ Ibn Fawzān al-Fawzān<br />
Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison – <a href="http://www.authentic-translations.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">authentic-translations.com</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar, Dr. Ṣāliḥ Ibn Fawzān al-Fawzān, a member of Saudi Arabia’s council of senior scholars and the Permanent Committee of scholars, describes those who claim they are performing “Jihad” for the sake of Allah by committing suicide are actually fighting for the sake of Satan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Those people who fall into this type of corruption never sought the council of any Islamic scholars, never learned anything from them. Instead, they isolate themselves from mainstream Muslims and privately accompany people who act as the worst “human idols.” Such people then began brain washing individuals until they eventually harbor enmity towards the public and thus carry out these types of attacks. They consider Muslims to be disbelievers, they murder them, blow up buildings indiscriminately killing both the young and old, male and female, Muslims and those non-Muslims guaranteed safety and living peacefully under Muslim laws (in Muslim nations) – all because of this corrupt ideology.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end result of all those who turn to wicked people for guidance and to the very callers and propagators that the messenger ( مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ) told of when he was asked about certain trials and tribulations that will occur toward the end of time; he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» دُعَاةٌ عَلَى أَبْوَابِ جَهَنَّمَ مَنْ أَطَاعَهُم قَذَفُوْهُ فِيْهَا «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Callers at the doors to Hell; whoever obeys them, they will cast him into it (Hell).</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is exactly the state of affairs now and it only confirms this statement of the messenger (.مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ). When such people align themselves with callers to misguidance, those callers lead others into it (misguidance or Hell). Everyone condemns them and hates their actions – both non-Muslims and believers. And no one supports their actions except those like them and those on the same methodology. This issue (of suicide attacks) is certainly a great tribulation and evil, and it is crucial that Muslims carefully understand the issue and not rush to act. Anyone (confused about the issue) should ask the people of religious knowledge to clarify the correct position and then ask Allah for guidance. People should not simply trust others with regards to this issue without knowing the reality of such propagators and whether they are established upon truth or not even though they may outwardly show good conduct, religious fervor, and honor for Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for everyone who outwardly shows good and truth yet is religiously ignorant, we must not hasten to him and give him our trust and reliance until we know the reality of him, his character, and his behavior. This only happens due to giving such a person the benefit of the doubt yet without really looking into his affairs or asking the people of knowledge, intellect, and good advice. As a result, these groups are formed because of people simply hastening to act and because of religious ignorance and mixing with evil people, trusting in them, relying on them and staying away from the mainstream Muslims and their scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Such people (suicide bombers) are always those who avoid religious lessons and the scholars so they naturally fall into these types of things. Similarly, they usually isolate themselves from their families and homes.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is incumbent especially on the Muslim youth to take a lesson from such people, for the successful people are those who learn lessons from the actions of others. We must learn from these incidents that we have to stick to our religious limits and stick to the main body of Muslims and their leader and not split off from them and turn to others (for guidance).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[1] This article was published in the Arabic newspaper, “Okaz,” on Thursday, April 23, 2009, issue no. 2867. For the full Arabic text, see: <a href="http://www.okaz.com.sa/okaz/osf/20090423/Con20090423272492.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">http://www.okaz.com.sa/okaz/osf/20090423/Con20090423272492.htm</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Recorded by al-Bukhārī and Muslim. The full text of the ḥadīth is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ḥudhayfah Ibn al-Yamān said: People used to ask Allah’s messenger about good things, but I used to ask him about bad circumstances fearing that I may fall into them. So I said, “Oh messenger of Allah, we used to live in evil during the times before Islam then Allah brought us this good (Islam), so will there be more evil times after these good times?” He ( مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ) replied, “Yes.” I further asked, “And will there then come good after that evil?” He answered, “Yes, but it will be tainted.” I asked, “Why will it be tainted?” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» قَوْمٌ يَهْدُوْنَ بِغَيْرِ هَديي، تَعْرِفُ مِنْهُم وَتُنْكِرُ «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There will be people who will guide with other than my guidance. You will recognize some things from them and reject other things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked, “And will there be after that good even more evil?” He replied:<br />
» نَعَم، دُعَاةٌ عَلَى أَبْوَابِ جَهَنَّمَ، مَنْ أَجَابَهُم إِلَيْهَا قَذَفُوْهُ فِيْهَا «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, there will be callers at the doors of Hell; whoever answers their call, they will cast him into it (Hell).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then said, “Oh messenger of Allah, describe them for us.” He said:<br />
» هُمْ مِنْ جِلْدَتِنَا وَيَتَكَلَّمُوْنَ بَأَلْسِنَتِنَا «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will be from our skin (Arab) and speak our tongue (language). I asked, “So what do you instruct me to do if I reach those times?” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» تَلْزِمُ جَمَاعَةَ املُسْلِمِيْنَ وَإِمَامَهُم «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stick with the mainstream group of Muslims and their leader.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“What if there is no main group and no leader?” The prophet ( مّوسل عليه اهلل ىّصل ) then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">» فَاعَتَزِلْ تِلْكَ الفِرَقَ كُلَّهَا وَلَوْ أَنْ تَعُضًّ بِأْصِلِ شَجَرَةٍ حَتَّى يُدْرِكُكَ املَوْتُ وَأَنْتَ عَلَى ذَلِكَ «</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Stay away from all of those sects even if you have to bite onto the root of a tree and remain in that state until death comes to you.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Terrorism: Its Causes &amp; Cures and a Muslim’s Position from Such Tribulations</span></strong><br />
اإلرهاب أسبابه وعالجه وموقف املسلم من الفنت :Original Title<br />
Author: Dr. Ṣāliḥ Ibn Sa’d al-Ṣuḥaymī <em>hafidhahullaah</em><br />
Translated by: Abu az-Zubayr Harrison <em>rahimahullaah</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of all mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise and thanks are due to Allah alone and may He send prayers and peace upon him (Muhammad) after whom there will never be another prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (عزّ وجل) has honored us with the greatest blessing by sending His prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).By him, Allah brought us out of darkness and into light, honoring us by him after our humiliation, and uniting us by him after our division. He made us brothers for the sake of Allah, loving and supporting one another, none having preference over another except by Taqwá as Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, the most noble among you with Allah is the one with the most Taqwá (constant fearful consciousness of Allah).</span> [Sūrah al-Ḥujurāt, 49:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says, favoring us with this blessing and reminding us of our previous condition before Islam:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْتَصِمُواْ بِحَبْلِ اللّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلاَ تَفَرَّقُواْ وَاذْكُرُواْ نِعْمَتَ اللّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ إِذْ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">كُنتُمْ أَعْدَاء فَأَلَّفَ بَيْنَ قُلُوبِكُمْ فَأَصْبَحْتُم بِنِعْمَتِهِ إِخْوَانًا وَكُنتُمْ عَلَىَ شَفَا حُفْرَةٍ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">مِّنَ النَّارِ فَأَنقَذَكُم مِّنْهَا كَذَلِكَ يُبَيِّنُ اللّهُ لَكُمْ آيَاتِهِ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And hold fast, all of you together, to the rope of Allah (the Quran), and be not divided among yourselves, and remember Allah&#8217;s favor on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His grace, you became brothers. And you were on the brink of a pit of fire, and He saved you from it. Thus Allah makes His signs clear to you, that you may be guided.</span> [Sūrah Āli-‘Imrān, 3:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims were living under this great blessing and rejoicing in it during the time of the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) until the seed of division was first sown when ‘Abd Allah Ibn Saba and his followers rallied people together against ‘Uthmān (رضي الله عنه). However, the very core of the Khawārij first appeared with Dhū al-Khuwaysarah al-Tamīmī when he objected to the way in which the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) distributed the war gains after the battle of Ḥunayn. He (Dhū al-Khuwaysarah) said to him, “Be fair, Muhammad, for you have not been fair!” He also said, “This is, for sure, a distribution by which Allah’s face was not sought!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Beware. Who would be fair if I would not? Do you not trust me when I am trusted by the One in the heavens?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When ‘Umar (رضي الله عنه) wanted to kill him, he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Leave him. There will come from his progeny a people whom you will consider your prayer compared to their prayer as insignificant and your fasting compared to theirs as insignificant. They will recite the Quran, yet it will not go beyond their throats. They will go out of the religion just as an arrow passes through its target.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tribulations were then kindled against ‘Uthmān (رضي الله عنه) as the causes of biased factionalism (Ḥizbiyyah) and opposition emerged, casting tribulations and division among the people, striking the very heart of Islam. Its heat was only further increased with the killing of Dhū al-Nūrayn (‘Uthmān)[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>]. The matter dangerously worsened and the trials and tribulations increased. Division and discord broke out – at the head of this was the Khawārij sect. They killed ‘Alī and considered the blood of Muslims lawful to spill and their wealth lawful to steal. They caused terror and fear among people, thereby waging war against Allah and His messenger. ‘Alī fought against their evil and, afterwards, found this same Dhū al-Khuwaysarah among those killed from them. They then plotted to kill many of the companions of the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and were successful in murdering ‘Alī (رضي الله عنه).</p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><em>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">01</span>] Dhū al-Nūrayn literally means “The Possessor of the Two Lights.” He was given this nickname because he married two of the prophet’s daughters, each at different times. – T.N.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since then, their evil and tribulations have continued up until this day, sometimes apparent, and other times discreet. They will continue in this way right up to the appearance of the Anti-Christ (towards the end of time) just as the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) informed of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In recent times, Allah had placed in authority of our land, the peninsula, King ‘Abd al-‘Azīz – may Allah grant him prosperity. With him, Allah united the various factions of this nation together after long generations overshadowed with wars and enmity. In those times, ignorance prevailed and tribalism cropped up amongst the people. Many people returned back to Shirk and to the law of the jungle, by which the strong eats the weak. So Allah destined for this leader (King ‘Abd al-‘Azīz) to unite the people under the banner of Tawhīd. Safety and comfort spread. Religious knowledge thrived and the darkness of ignorance dispersed. The brotherhood of Islam prevailed, established upon the actualization of Tawhīd and upon the guidance of the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The peninsular was again secured by the supporters of the land. Its children followed in the same footsteps, adhering to this methodology, seeking Allah’s help and applying the rule of Allah in all matters. So safety, security, and well-being prevailed under the rule of Islam. The people of this land were as the heart of a single person – the ruler and the ruled. The young people were firmly connected to their scholars and leaders. They exemplified one united group, not diverse sects; upon one united methodology, and not diverse methodologies. Their unity was strong, far removed from the methodology of extremism. This was manifested by curricula and studies which firmly instill the moderate fundamentals which the Quran and Sunnah call to, as Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَلِكَ جَعَلْنَاكُمْ أُمَّةً وَسَطًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And thus, We have made you a middle nation.</span> [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:143]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: a just nation, chosen among other nations. So these lands became a prime example of adhering to the middle path, the path between extremism and negligence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there has appeared during these latter times voices, writings, and cries from some insignificant, minor people calling to the shamefulness of biased factionalism. They began to decay the bones of this (Muslim) nation with their invitations away from the unity of a single, interdependent group to the strictness of several diverse sects. They call to the radically choosing of sides and extremism by such ornamented, yet obviously deceptive, means, leading to nothing but division among the ranks of this nation. They try by various ways to persuade some of our young people to their rebellious, revolutionary ideologies which make it possible for the enemies of Islam to take commodities such as oil under the slogan of human rights sometimes, or the call to update and change the school curriculum other times, claiming they are the causes for this very extremism found among such groups and individuals.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The propagation by those with these ideologies to spread their falsehood is done in numerous ways. From these ways are the following:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Belittling the affair of calling to Tawhīd, claiming that the ‘Aqīdah is generally known to most people. Some of them say that it is possible to understand ‘Aqīdah in as little as ten minutes. Rather, some have even stooped so low as to say that this (the persistence in the call to Tawhīd and the correction of ‘Aqīdah) actually causes division amongst the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Turning away from the scholars, abandoning taking knowledge from them, and distorting their statements, claiming they do not fully comprehend the current affairs. They claim the scholars are not qualified to solve the problems facing the Islamic nation today and that they refuse to stand up to face its true issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The distancing of the young people far away from the religious knowledge based on the Quran and Sunnah. They preoccupy them with such things as enthusiastic, fiery Nashīds (so-called “Islamic” songs) or whatever other issues are spread here and there of the various attractive ways, whether written, seen, or by audio.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The belittlement of the leaders and those in authority and the public exposing of their faults or what some people assume to be their faults. They do this publicly on their pulpits (while delivering lectures in the mosques) and on the questionable satellite channels. They distort the texts commanding the obedience to the leaders to mean that such obedience referred to in these texts is only given to the main leader who has authority over all the Muslims in the world (and not the various individual leaders of each country). They forget, or pretend to forget, that all of the scholars and Imams unanimously agreed that this obedience is also incumbent during times of the existence of various separate Islamic countries. Even though each country may possess its own wealth, with its own rights and obligations dependent upon its respective leader; obedience to such a leader is still an obligation and revolting and rebelling against him is forbidden as long as he establishes the rights of Allah. This is an agreement that all of the scholars of Islam were united upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Rallying together those with these theoretical thoughts who call to revolutionary and rebellious ideas. They assemble the young people, brainwashing them in private gatherings set up in places of rest and recreation. They focus on separating the young people from their scholars and leaders, instead connecting them with personalities that follow methodologies of rebellion and Takfīr (declaring Muslims to be disbelievers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. They call to their imaginary “Jihad” which is actually the declaring of a Muslim’s blood and wealth to be lawful for the taking. They encourage devastation and bombings and the blowing up of structures property, all the while claiming that the land of the Muslims is now a land of war, fighting being justified therein. This ideology is spread by means such as the inspirational Nashīds. The danger has even reached the level of some youths being trained to use all sorts of weapons in far secluded places within the country, and in other questionable foreign countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The circulation of books, fliers, pamphlets, and cassettes that call to this defiant, radical ideology. They promote making Takfīr, especially against the scholars and leaders. We will mention some of the books that call to this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a. The writings of Sayyid Qutb. The most dangerous of these are those books that make the blanket Takfīr against most of the Muslim nations in this time, those that defame the Companions of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), and even books that defame the Prophets. Examples of these are “Fī Ẓilāl al-Qurān” (In the Shade of the Quran), “Kutub wa Shakhṣiyyāt” (Books and Personalities), “al-‘Adālah al-Ijtimā’iyyah” (Social Justice), and “Ma’ālim fī al-Ṭarīq” (Milestones).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b. The books of Sayyid Abul A&#8217;la Maududi.<br />
c. The books of Hassan al-Banna.<br />
d. The books of Sa’īd Hawá.<br />
e. The books of ‘Isām al-‘Iṭār.<br />
f. The books of Abū al-Fatḥ al-Bayānūnī.<br />
g. The books of Muḥammad Ibn ‘Alī al-Ṣābūnī.<br />
h. The books of Muḥammad Ḥasan Hanbakah al-Maydānī.<br />
i. The books of of al-Turābī.<br />
j. The books of al-Ḥuḍaybī.<br />
k. The books of al-Tilmisānī.<br />
l. The books of Aḥmad Muḥammad al-Rāshid (a pen name). The most dangerous of his books are “al-Maṣār” (The Path), al-‘Awā`iq (The Obstacles), “al-Munṭaliq” (The Starting Point, or Liberated), and “al-Raqā`iq”.<br />
m. The books of ‘Iṣām al-Bashīr.<br />
n. The books, pamphlets, and tapes of Muḥammad Surūr Zayn al-‘Ābidīn, the head of the Muntaḍá organization in London.<br />
o. Other books than these mentioned that are widespread in our bookstores that are filled with this ideology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is incumbent for us to dry up this fountain (of deviation) by warning against these books, preventing their circulation, and by supervising those publishing companies and bookstores who are lenient in distributing these books or selling them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When these books are read by young people whose own ideas have not yet matured and who have no knowledge-based protection against the effects of such books, they (such books) corrupt their intellect, and ideas, causing them to follow fantasies. This way, the youth are prepared to carry out whatever is requested of them – even something like suicide or the killing of others from among Muslims or non-Muslims that should be guaranteed safety. They do such things to achieve a certain objective – “martyrdom for the sake of Allah and the triumph of entering paradise.” These theorists have made the youth imagine that this is the correct way leading to this destination and to the victory of gaining Allah’s pleasure. So Takfīr, bombings, mass destruction in the lands of Muslims, and abandoning the methodology of the righteous predecessors (al-Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ) have all now become “the path of guidance” as perceived by such people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Another way that such deviant ideologies have spread is by the emergence of inspirational activists from these groups of Takfīr such as the sect “al-Ikhwān alMuslimūn,” or the “Muslim Brotherhood” and other groups that originated from them that are found in our schools, institutes, and universities. They have distorted and transformed many of our children by planting and cultivating among them the methodology of Takfīr by student get-togethers and recreational trips as well as with exaggerated religious narrations and those containing blatant lies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the means by which these people were successful in corrupting many of our youth, making them unaware of the correct methodology, their scholars, and their leaders. They made the truth appear to them to be only what they themselves were upon and everyone else was upon nothing (of guidance). The negligence of realizing these means by which they use has allowed this alien ideology to spread in our religion and nation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now comes the question: “How do we protect our youth from this?”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">To safeguard from such innovated ideologies of Takfīr, we must individually and collectively take the following steps:</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Call the youth back to adherence to the Quran and Sunnah and to refer back to them both under all circumstances. Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاعْتَصِمُواْ بِحَبْلِ اللّهِ جَمِيعًا وَلاَ تَفَرَّقُواْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And hold fast, all of you together, to the rope of Allah (the Quran), and be not divided among yourselves.</span> [Sūrah Āli-‘Imrān, 3:103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِن شَيْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And if you differ in anything, its decision is for Allah.</span>[Sūrah al-Shūrá, 42:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So referring back to the Book of Allah and adhering to it is the protection and the foundation by which Allah preserves one from falling into destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. We must make sure to understand the Quran and Sunnah according to the methodology of the righteous predecessors (al-Salaf al-Ṣāliḥ). This will not be achieved unless the Muslims seek such understanding from the sincere and knowledgeable scholars who, by the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), they refute the distortion of the extremists, the false assumptions of the deniers, and the misinterpretations of the ignorant ones. Allah (عزّ وجل) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فَاسْأَلُواْ أَهْلَ الذِّكْرِ إِن كُنتُمْ لاَ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So ask the people of the scripture if you don’t know.</span>[Sūrah al-Anbiyā’, 21:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذَا جَاءهُمْ أَمْرٌ مِّنَ الأَمْنِ أَوِ الْخَوْفِ أَذَاعُواْ بِهِ وَلَوْ رَدُّوهُ إِلَى الرَّسُولِ وَإِلَى</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">أُوْلِي الأَمْرِ مِنْهُمْ لَعَلِمَهُ الَّذِينَ يَسْتَنبِطُونَهُ مِنْهُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If there comes to them a matter of safety or fear, they (immediately) publicize it. If only they had referred it to the messenger and to those charged with authority among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them (directly).</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā’, 4:83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The terrorists are those who spread corruption on earth, following religious verdicts given without knowledge. They are those who shun the listening to the main scholars of the nation, describing them with evil characteristics that are more rightly attributed to these terrorists themselves. So if the youth turn instead to the inheritors of prophethood (the major scholars), those who are firmly-grounded in knowledge, then this will be their defense, if Allah wills, against these terrorists who rant and rave about things they know nothing about, spreading false rumors. They claim there is no other place for the youth to turn to and connect themselves with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. We must also remain far away from the places of such Fitnah (trials, afflictions, and tribulations) to avoid their evil effects. Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاتَّقُواْ فِتْنَةً لاَّ تُصِيبَنَّ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُواْ مِنكُمْ خَآصَّةً</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">And fear the Fitnah which not only afflicts those among you who do wrong particularly (but may rather afflict everyone)</span>. [Sūrah al-Anfāl, 8:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is done by taking the initiative to do righteous deeds by which Allah’s servants protect themselves against the Fitnah. The messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Take the initiative to do righteous deeds before a Fitnah comes like patches of a dark night. Due to it, a man will be a believer at night and disbelieve by morning, or be a believer in the morning and disbelieve by nightfall. He will sell his religion for a mere portion of this worldly life.”</span> [Imam Aḥmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abū Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) said that Allah’s messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“There will come a Fitnah during which the one who sits will be better than the one who stands, and the one who stands will be better than the one who walks, the one who walks will be better than one who runs. Whoever exposes himself to it will be overcome by it. Whoever finds a refuge or resort (from it) then let him seek it for protection.”</span> [al-Bukhārī &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. We must strive in worshipping Allah and try to remain constantly and fearfully conscious of Him (عزّ وجل) – having Taqwá. This is done by carrying out what He has commanded and remaining away from what He has forbidden. This is the way of success from every hardship as Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِ يُسْرًا</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever has Taqwá of Allah, He will make his affairs easy for him</span>.[Sūrah al-Ṭalāq, 65:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">َمَن يَتَّقِ اللَّهَ يَجْعَل لَّهُ مَخْرَجًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever has Taqwá of Allah, He will make for him a way to get out (of every difficulty).</span> [Sūrah al-Ṭalāq, 65:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So having this Taqwá of Allah, remaining firm on His legislation, and performing deeds that please Him is the way to achieve every success and victory in both lives (this life and the Hereafter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. We must stop the widespread open sinning amongst ourselves, because whatever of Fitnah, evils, or disagreements that afflict the Muslims, it only stems from sins becoming prevalent among the people and disobedience to Allah. Whatever calamities afflict them is only due to what they themselves have earned as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَلَمَّا أَصَابَتْكُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَدْ أَصَبْتُم مِّثْلَيْهَا قُلْتُمْ أَنَّى هَـذَا قُلْ هُوَ مِنْ عِندِ أَنْفُسِكُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">When a disaster afflicts you, although you struck (your enemies) with one twice as great, you say: “From where does this come to us?” Say, “It is from your own selves (because of your evil deeds).”</span> [Sūrah Āli-‘Imrān, 3:165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ظَهَرَ الْفَسَادُ فِي الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِي النَّاسِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Corruption has appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of men have earned (by sins, evil deeds, etc.).</span> [Sūrah al-Rūm, 30:41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. We must stick to the main body of Muslims and their leader and we must reinforce the understanding that it is obligatory to obey those in authority in goodness. Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ أَطِيعُواْ اللّهَ وَأَطِيعُواْ الرَّسُولَ وَأُوْلِي الأَمْرِ مِنكُمْ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Oh you who believe, obey Allah and obey the messenger, and those who are in authority among you.</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā’, 4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Indeed, Allah is pleased for you three things and is displeased with three things. He is pleased for you that you worship Him without associating anything as partners with Him, that you hold all together to the rope of Allah and not split into groups, and that you give sincere advice to whomever Allah puts in charge of your affairs.”</span> [Muslim &amp; Aḥmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“There are three things which the heart of a Muslim should never object to: sincerity in doing deeds solely for the sake of Allah, giving sincere advice to those in authority of affairs, and sticking to the main body of Muslims.”</span> [Ibn Mājah &amp; Aḥmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Whoever sees something from his leader which he hates, then let him be patient with it, for indeed the one who splits away from the group by even a hand-span and then dies, he does not die except the death of Jāhiliyyah (the pre-Islamic period of ignorance).”</span> [al-Bukhārī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Bukhārī also records in his authentic collection a long Ḥadīth from Ḥudhayfah (رضي الله عنه) in which he asks the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم):</p>
<p>“What do you instruct me to do if that (Fitnah) reaches me?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Stick to the main group of Muslims and their leader.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Ḥudhayfah) further asked, “What if there is neither a main group nor a leader?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Then stay away from all of those sects even if you have to bite onto the trunk of a tree until death comes to you while you are in that state.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Bukhārī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Seeking help by remaining patient during times of hardship. Patience extinguishes much Fitnah as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ اسْتَعِينُواْ بِالصَّبْرِ وَالصَّلاَةِ إِنَّ اللّهَ مَعَ الصَّابِرِينَ</span></h2>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">Oh you who believe, seek help through patience and prayer. Indeed, Allah is with the patient ones.</span> [Sūrah al-Baqarah, 2:153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَاصْبِرْ عَلَى مَا أَصَابَكَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And bear with patience whatever may befall you</span>.[Sūrah Luqmān, 31:17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“The affair of a believer is amazing – all of his affairs are good for him. If he experiences good, he is thankful and that is good for him. And when hardship befalls him, he is patient and that is good for him. This is not the case of anyone except a believer.”</span> [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. We have to resolve our issues with tolerance and forbearance and not be so hasty in judging and passing religious verdicts. We must refrain from becoming excited and angry – all of these traits are the characteristics of the Prophets and Messengers and their followers. Allah (عزّ وجل) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ إِبْرَاهِيمَ لَحَلِيمٌ أَوَّاهٌ مُّنِيبٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed, Ibraaheem (Prophet Abraham) was certainly forbearing, humbly invoking (Allah), and repentant.</span>[Sūrah Hūd, 11:75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said to Ashajj Banī ‘Abd al-Qays:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“There are two qualities within you that Allah and His messenger love: tolerance and forbearance.”</span> [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. We must adorn ourselves with gentleness, good behavior among ourselves, and kindness when resolving our problems. The messenger of Allah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Gentleness is not in anything except that it beautifies it and it is not removed from anything except that it renders it defective.”</span> [Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Indeed, Allah loves kindness and gentleness in all matters.”</span> [al-Bukhārī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. We must fully comprehend whatever issues face us as they actually are, understanding and perceiving them and delve deep into their root causes. We must give this great significance because any ruling passed on a matter is greatly dependant upon how that matter is first understood. So a Muslim should not be misled by only the outward appearance of any issue. Rather, it is incumbent upon a believer to be careful of everything happening around him and not be deceived by first impressions. This must be done, however, by confirming the evidences and without leaving the true methodology. Passing rulings and judgments must not be rushed into and religious issues must not be delved into with no basis of knowledge as Allah says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلاَ تَقْفُ مَا لَيْسَ لَكَ بِهِ عِلْمٌ إِنَّ السَّمْعَ وَالْبَصَرَ وَالْفُؤَادَ كُلُّ أُولـئِكَ كَانَ عَنْهُ مَسْؤُولاً</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And do not follow that of which you have no knowledge. Certainly, the hearing, sight, and heart – of each of those you will be questioned.</span> [Sūrah al-Isrā’, 17:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. We must confirm and verify anything we hear and not simply give an ear to rumors, especially what is broadcast on the various media means and the questionable satellite channels. Often such announcements result in commotion among the Muslims, causing them to differ in their goals and weaken their unity. Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِن جَاءكُمْ فَاسِقٌ بِنَبَأٍ فَتَبَيَّنُوا أَن تُصِيبُوا قَوْمًا بِجَهَالَةٍ </span><span style="color:#000000;">فَتُصْبِحُوا عَلَى مَا فَعَلْتُمْ نَادِمِينَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Oh you who believe, if a wicked evil person comes to you with news, verify it, lest you harm people in ignorance, and afterwards you become regretful for what you have done.</span> [Sūrah al-Ḥujurāt, 49:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Beware of suspicion, for suspicion if the most deceitful of speech.”</span> [al-Bukhārī &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. We have to return back to the fundamentals of our faith and our religion when passing any judgments of others as being disbelievers, sinners, or innovators. We only make such rulings based on the criteria found in the Quran and Sunnah. We do not pass a blanket ruling of disbelief on Muslims without deliberation and confirmed evidence due to the seriousness of this matter. It is forbidden for a Muslim to accuse his brother, a specific individual Muslim, of being a disbeliever even if he does an action of disbelief, unless and until all of the applicable conditions have been met and all excuses and explanations have been removed. Allah (عزّ وجل) says:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُواْ إِذَا ضَرَبْتُمْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللّهِ فَتَبَيَّنُواْ وَلاَ تَقُولُواْ لِمَنْ أَلْقَى </span><span style="color:#000000;">إِلَيْكُمُ السَّلاَمَ لَسْتَ مُؤْمِنًا تَبْتَغُونَ عَرَضَ الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا فَعِندَ اللّهِ مَغَانِمُ كَثِيرَةٌ </span><span style="color:#000000;">كَذَلِكَ كُنتُم مِّن قَبْلُ فَمَنَّ اللّهُ عَلَيْكُمْ فَتَبَيَّنُواْ إِنَّ اللّهَ كَانَ بِمَا تَعْمَلُونَ خَبِيرًا</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Oh you who believe, when you go in the cause of Allah, verify (the truth), and say not to anyone who greets you with peace: “You are not a believer,” thereby seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There are much more profits and goods with Allah. Even as he is now, so were you yourselves before Allah conferred on you His favors (guided you to Islam). therefore, be cautious in discrimination. Allah is ever well aware of what you do.</span> [Sūrah al-Nisā’, 4:94]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) also warned against this saying in the Ḥadīth of Abū Dharr (رضي الله عنه):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“No man accuses another of being a sinner or accuses him of disbelief except that it is applied back to himself if his companion is actually not like that.”</span> [al-Bukhārī &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abd Allah Ibn ‘Umar ( رضي الله عنه) narrated that Allah’s messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Any man that says to his brother, ‘Oh disbeliever!’ then it falls back to one of them.”</span> [al-Bukhārī &amp; Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Daqīq al-‘Īd says regarding the meaning of this Ḥadīth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is a sever threat to the one who accuses anyone of the Muslims as being a disbeliever while he is really not. It is a very serious matter in which many of the speakers have fallen into and others who falsely ascribe themselves to the Sunnah and the people of Ḥadīth. This is because of their differing in the correct ‘Aqīdah beliefs so they are harsh with those who oppose them, judging them as disbelievers.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The famous scholar of Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah, endorsed this saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I’m one of the harshest persons in forbidding one from accusing a specific individual of disbelief, wickedness, or sin unless he knows for certain that all the religious proofs and evidences have been established upon him – those proofs indicating that whoever opposes them is in fact a disbeliever, defiantly disobedient one, or a sinner. And I also affirm that Allah may choose to forgive the sins of this entire (Muslim) nation, the spoken sins and mistakes and the actions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some of the issues that every Muslim must pay close attention to during such depressing times of trials and tribulations. And it is incumbent upon all Muslims, individually and collectively, the rulers and the ruled, the scholars and students, to consolidate their efforts in order to eradicate these tribulations, uprooting them from their very origins especially today’s problems of Takfīr which have led some people to the extent of accepting that other Muslims’ blood and wealth are lawful to take. Such people corrupt others to the point that they are willing to carry out such measures as of destruction, and bombings. They do this by means of questionable organizations, paid publications, and misguiding verdicts which lead to such terrifying incidents carried out by people with stupid misconceptions. Thereby, they convert themselves into corruptors, murderers of Muslims and non-Muslims who have been promised safety. They violate the sanctity of others’ wealth and structures, calling this “Jihad.” This is the age-old crime of naming something with other than its true name…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every single Muslim is required, as much as he can, to expose their (the terrorists’) lies and to make known their deviation to prevent their evil and corruption from spreading and calamity from dangerously worsening. It is forbidden to hide or conceal anyone of them because this would be cooperating with them in sin and transgression and Allah (عزّ وجل) said:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَتَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى الْبرِّ وَالتَّقْوَى وَلاَ تَعَاوَنُواْ عَلَى الإِثْمِ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And cooperate together in righteous and Taqwá, and do not cooperate in sin and transgression.</span> [Sūrah al-Māi’dah, 5:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever supports and accommodates them, defends them, or accepts there actions, then he shares in the sin of killing innocent souls who have committed no crime deserving of this from among the Muslims and those who are under the trust of safety from among the non-Muslims living in the Muslim lands. The Ḥadīth of the prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) is applied to such supporters of them when he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“The curse of Allah is upon anyone who supports an innovator.”</span> [al-Bukhārī]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah, the Generous, the Lord of the great throne, by His perfect names and by His magnificent attributes to preserve and protect all the Muslims in general, and these (Muslim) lands in particular – their religion, safety, and security. And we ask Him to guide the misguided ones from the Muslims and return them back to their religion with a goodly return. We ask Him to unite them all in their goals upon the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last of our call is that all praise and thanks are due to Allah, the Lord of all creations and may He send prayers and peace upon our prophet, Muhammad, his family, and his companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Sudanese brothers living in the kingdom (of Saudi Arabia) in the city of Bāḥah asks: The people of the Sunnah and the mainstream community of Muslims state that the final destination of those who worship Allah with <em>Tawḥīd</em> – the Muslim monotheists – will eventually be Paradise. Yet there have come examples in some <em>ḥadīth </em>(prophetic narrations) that:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لا يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ قَاطِعُ رَحْم</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;">“Someone who breaks ties of kinship will not enter Paradise.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">لا يَدْخُلُ الجَنَّةَ نَمَّامٌ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;">“A slanderer will not enter Paradise.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, will the Muslim monotheists who happen to fall into these two groups never enter Paradise as is apparent from these texts, or how do we understand them?</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh al-Uthaymeen:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These texts pertaining to threats and others similar to them, whether from <em>ḥadīth</em> or verses of the Qur&#8217;aan, are what led the <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/khawaarij/">Khawārij</a> </strong>and <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/mutazilah/">Mu’tazilah</a> </strong>sects to state that anyone who commits a major sin will remain forever in the fire (of Hell). This is because they take these general texts and forget other general ones that conflict (and must be taken along) with these. And there are many proofs that state that Muslim monotheists or those with faith in their hearts even equal to a seed’s worth will not remain in the fire forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the generality of the texts pertaining to hopes and promises that mention that believers will enter Paradise led the <strong><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/innovated-groups-sects/al-murjiah/">Murjiah</a> </strong>sect to disregard the texts of threats. They said that any believer, even if he were a wicked sinner, would never enter the fire. So, these people take only these general texts and those others sects take only the general texts of threats.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, Allah has guided the people of the Sunnah and the main community of Muslims to the middle, moderate belief that combines the understanding of both evidences in conjunction. This belief is that someone who commits a major sin does not thereby completely leave his faith. He may be deserving of punishment but Allah could simply forgive him and not put him into the fire, or perhaps someone else could pray for him and as a result Allah may not punish him. His punishment could also be expiated by other means. However, if no means are present whereby he can avoid punishment, then he may be punished in the fire according to the extent of his action, and after that he would be in Paradise. This is the methodology and understanding of the people of Sunnah and the community of mainstream Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this understanding, the general <em>ḥadīth</em> of threats like those the questioner mentioned: “<span style="color:#808000;">Someone who breaks ties of kinship will not enter Paradise</span>,” and “<span style="color:#808000;">A slanderer will not enter Paradise</span>,” <span style="color:#0000ff;">are understood to mean that such people will not enter Paradise by a perfect, absolute entrance without punishment</span>. Rather, punishment may precede that (his entrance to Paradise) if nothing wipes out that sin like Allah’s forgiveness or something else. So the meaning is he will not enter Paradise absolutely and perfectly without some sort of punishment preceding that; by this meaning all the evidences are understood together (with no contradiction).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: Noble Shaykh, may Allah grant you success. We are a group of police officers and we would like to direct a question to you since we have been entrusted in this country with investigating those who wish to disturb the peace or oppose and reject obedience to the leader of affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we have heard of a religious verdict stating that it is impermissible to track these people down to pursue them and fight them because they are “Mujāhidūn” (people making religious Jihad), and because they want to expel the nonbelievers who fight Muslims in other countries such as Iraq. So, what is the correct opinion regarding this,may Allah grant you success.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">From the signs of happiness and joy is that whenever a worshipper increases in knowledge, his humbleness and mercy increases. Whenever he increases in acts of worship, his fear and caution increases. Whenever he increases in age, his greed decreases. Whenever he increases in wealth, his generosity and spending increases. And whenever he increases in status and position, his nearness to the people increases as does his fulfilling their needs and being humble with them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">And from the signs of misery is that whenever a worshipper increases in knowledge, his pride and arrogance increases. Whenever he increases in acts of worship, his bragging increases as does his belittling of people while always giving himself the benefit of the doubt. And whenever he increases in status and position, his arrogance and ego increases.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these things are trials from Allaah and a test by which He tests His servants, and because of them, some people attain happiness and others become miserable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, some things people honor and admire are also trials like possessions, authority, and wealth. Allaah says about His prophet, Sulaymaan, when he saw the throne of Bilqees in front of<br />
him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;هَذَا مِنْ فَضْلِ رَبِّي لِيَبْلُوَنِي أَأَشْكُرُ أَمْ أَكْفُرُ &#8220;</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This is from the favor of My Lord to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful</strong></span>. [Soorah An-Naml, 27:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, blessings are tests from Allaah that make apparent the gratitude of the grateful, and the ingratitude of the ungrateful. In the same way, hardhips are also trials from Him سُبْحَانَه .He tests by way of blessings and hardships.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;فَأَمَّا الإِنْسَانُ إِذَا مَا ابْتَلاهُ رَبُّهُ فَأَكْرَمَهُ وَنَعَّمَهُ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّي أَكْرَمَنِ وَأَمَّا إِذَا مَا ابْتَلاهُ فَقَدَرَ عَلَيْهِ<br />
رِزْقَهُ فَيَقُولُ رَبِّي أَهَانَنِ &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And as for man, when his Lord tests him and is generous to him and favors him, he says, “My Lord has honored me!” But when He tests him and restricts his provision, he says, “My Lord has humiliated me!”</strong></span> [Soorah Al-Fajr, 89:15-16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In other words, it’s not the case that everyone I increase with honor and blessings, that’s My way of honoring him. And everyone I tighten his sustenance and test him, it’s not necessarily that I’m humiliating him.</p>

<p>From “Aḥkām al-Janāiz” by Muḥammad Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This article is comprised of a single ḥadīth that, when presented with the various wordings and additions, illustrate with clear descriptions the distinction between a believer and a disbeliever at the time of death. This ḥadīth, though recorded in earlier ḥadīth collections, was translated from “Aḥkām al-Janāiz wa Bidau’hā” (no. 105, pp. 198-202) by Muḥammad Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Albānī with the scholar’s accompanying notes included.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;">The Ḥadīth</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">The First Way: Hopeful Supplication</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">The Second Way: Asking Allah for Forgiveness</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">The Third Way: Tawḥīd</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas Ibn Mālik (<em>radhi Allaahu anhu</em>) said: I heard Allah’s messenger (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allah ( تعاىل ) said, </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘Oh son of Adam, as long as you call on me and hope in me, I  will forgive you for whatever (sins) you have and I will not mind. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Oh son of Adam, if your sins were to reach the clouds in the sky and then were you to ask for my forgiveness, I would forgive you and I would not mind. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Oh son of Adam, if you were to come to me with sins as much as the earth and then you meet me not worshipping anything else along with me, I would come to you with as much forgiveness.’”</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Recorded by at-Tirmidhī (no. 3540). Shaykh al-Albānī said it is authentic in “Ṣaḥīḥ Sunan at-Tirmidhī” (no. 2805)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: Some biased and questionable people these days are promoting by way of the internet and calling the youth of this country to disregard obedience to the leaders/government of the country and to instead oppose them. They also call the youth not to listen to the scholars in this regard. So, we ask for your counsel and comments on this.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: These days, we find written in some newspapers people calling others to boycott American products, not to buy or sell them. It was even written today in a newspaper that Muslim scholars themselves call for such boycotts and that doing this is an obligation upon every single Muslim. It is said that to purchase even one item from these products is forbidden and that anyone who does so commits a major sin and is assisting them and the Jews in killing Muslims. We hope you will clarify this matter since there’s a dire need for such clarification. Also, would a person ever be rewarded for doing this (boycotting)?</p>
