										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ibaanah Magazine , Issue No.3 &#8211; Dhul-Qa’dah 1416H / April 1996<br />
Shaykh Abu Anas Hamad al-’Uthman [1].<br />
From An-Nubadh fî Âdâbit-Talabil-’Ilm (pp.61-66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hudayfah &#8211; <em>radiallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>anhu</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allâh <em>sallallâhu </em> <i> ’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> related two matters to us. I have seen one of them, and I am waiting for the other. He informed us: <i> “Trustworthiness was sent down in the depths of the heart of the people, then they learnt it from the Qur‘ân, and then they learnt it from the Sunnah.”</i> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hâfidh Ibn Hajr (825H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“His saying: <i> “then they learnt it from the Qur‘ân, then they learnt it from the Sunnah.”</i> So it occurs in this narration with the repetition of “then”, which contains an indication that they would learn Qur‘ân before learning the details of the <i>Sunnah</i>. And what is meant by the details of the <i>Sunnah</i> is anything that they would learn from the Prophet <i>sallallâhu ’alayhi wa sallam</i> &#8211; whether it was obligatory or recommended.” [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Maymûnî said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I asked Abû ’Abdullâh (Imâm Ahmad) which is more beloved to you, that I should begin teaching my son the Qur‘ân or the Hadîth? He said: “No! The Qur‘ân.” I said: Shall I teach him all of it? He replied: “Unless that is difficult, in which case teach him some of it.” Then he said to me: “If he begins reciting first, then he will learn correct recitation and will persevere in it.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Muflih &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Upon this are the followers of Imâm Ahmad right up until our time.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taymiyyah (d.728H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for seeking to memorise the Qur‘ân, then this is to be given preference over many of the things that the people consider to be knowledge, but are &#8211; in reality &#8211; either totally useless, or having little benefit. It is also to be given precedence in learning especially by those who wish to acquire knowledge of the <em>Dîn</em>, its principles and its particulars. Since what is prescribed for such a person at this time is that he should begin by memorising the Qur‘ân, as it is the foundation of the branches of the knowledge of the <em>Dîn</em>. This is contrary to what is done by many of the people of Innovation from the non-Arabs and other than them, in that one of them will pre-occupy himself with superfluous parts of knowledge; such as <em>kalâm</em> (rhetorical speech) and argumentation; or very rare matters of differences; and blind-following; which there is no need for; or very strange and rare <i>ahadîth</i>, which are not established, nor of benefit; and many discussions which do not establish proofs. And he abandons memorising the Qur‘ân which is more important than all of this.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad ibn al-Fadl said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I heard my grandfather say: I asked my father for permission to study under Qutaybah so he said: “First learn the Qur‘ân and then I will give you permission.” So I memorised the Qur‘ân by heart. So he said to me: “Remain until you have led the people in prayer with it (i.e for Tarawîh Prayer).” So I did so, then after the ’Îd he gave me permission, so I left for Marw.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ’Abdul Barr (d.463H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Seeking knowledge is of levels and is of different stages which should not be skipped over. Whoever skips over them altogether, then he has overstepped the path of the Salaf &#8211; may Allâh have mercy on all of them. Whoever deliberately takes a path other than this has seriously deviated. However, whoever oversteps due to an <em>ijitihâd</em> (a knowledge based judgment that a qualified Scholar makes, intending to reach the truth), then such a person has erred. So the first knowledge is memorisation of the Book of Allâh and seeking to understand it. And it is obligatory to seek everything which will aid in understanding it. However, I do not say that is obligatory to memorise all of the Qur‘ân, but I do say that it is obligatory and essential for anyone who wishes to become a scholar &#8211; not that it is something obligatory in itself.” [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khatîb al-Baghdâdî (d.463H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is fitting for a student that he begins with the memorisation of the Book of Allâh &#8211; <em>the Mighty and Majestic</em>. Since it is the greatest of the branches of knowledge and that which should be placed first and given precedence.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hâdfidh an-Nawawî (d.676H) &#8211; <em>rahimahullâh</em> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the first thing he should begin with is memorisation of the mighty Qur‘ân, which is the most important branches of knowledge. And the <em>Salaf</em> did not use to teach Hadîth or Fiqh, except to one who memorised the Qur‘ân. So when he has memorised it, then let him beware of pre-occupying himself from it with Hadîth, Fiqh or other things, to the extent that it leads him to forget anything of the Qur‘ân, or makes that likely.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seeking Knowledge in Due Amounts</strong> [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh, the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“</b><strong>And this is a Qur‘ân which We have divided into parts, in order that you recite it to men at intervals. And we have sent it down in stages.” </strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam </em>said to ’Abdullâh ibn ’Amr ibn al-’Âs <em>radiallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>anhumâ</em>: “<i>Read the Qur‘ân in every month.” </i>I said: I find that I have more strength than that. <i>“Recite it in every twenty nights.”</i> I said: I find that I have more strength than that. <i>“Then recite it in every seven days and do not increase upon that.”</i> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Abdullâh ibn ’Amr ibn al-’Âs <i>radiallâ</i><em>hu </em><i>’</i><em>anhumâ </em>also related from the Prophet <em>sallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam </em>that he said: <i>“He does not understand the Qur‘ân who recites it in less than three days.”</i> [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Umar ibn ’Abdul-Wâhid &#8211; a companion of al-Awzâ’î &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We read <i>al-Muwatta</i> to Mâlik (d.179H) in forty days, so he said: “A book that took me forty years to compile, you take from me in forty days! How little you understand of it.” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khatîb al-Baghdâdî said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is fitting that he take care in acquiring knowledge and that he should not take too much in one go. Rather, he should take a little at a time, such that he can bear it, memorize it and be able to understand it. Because Allâh &#8211; <i>the Most High </i>&#8211; says: <strong>“And those who disbelieve say: Why is the Qur‘ân not sent down to him all at once? Thus (is it sent down in parts) that We may strengthen your heart thereby. And We have revealed it to you gradually, in stages.” </strong>[16]” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Khatîb &#8211; <i>rahimahullâh</i> &#8211; also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And know that the heart is an organ from the organs. It is able to bear some things and unable to bear others &#8211; just like the rest of the body. Thus, some people are able to carry one-hundred pounds, whereas others are unable to carry even twenty. Some people are able to walk a number of mites in a day without tiring, whereas others are unable to even walk a mile in a day before they become tired&#8230; So let each person limit himself to what he is able without expending all his energies, because that will better aid him in learning with a good mind, from a arm and proficient teacher.” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Supplicating for an Increase in Knowledge</strong> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh &#8211; the Most High &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say: My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.</strong><strong>”</strong> [Sûrah Tâ Hâ 20:114]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umm Salamah &#8211; <i>radiallâhu ’anha </i>&#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allâh&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> used to supplicate in the morning Prayer: <i>“O Allâh! I ask you for beneficial knowledge, righteous action and pure sustenance.” </i>[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Atlas bin Mâlik &#8211; <i>radiallâhu ’anhu</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allâh&#8217;s Messenger <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> supplicated: <i>“O Allâh! Benefit me with knowledge. Teach me that which will benefit me, and provide me with knowledge from which I can derive benefit.” </i>[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Bakr Muhammad ibn Ja’far said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">l heard Ibn Khuzaymah (d.311H) being asked: From where did you acquire this knowledge? So he said: “Allâhs Messenger <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> said: <i>“Zam-zam water is that for which it is drunk.” </i>[22] So when I drunk the Zam-zam water, I supplicated to Allâh for beneficial knowledge.” [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-lslâm Ibn Taymiyyah said: [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The reality of this matter is that the servant differs in what he asks of knowledge and guidance, and of what he seeks to ask. So with remembrance of Allâh and turning towards Him, Allâh guides such a person &#8211; as He said &#8211; : <strong>“O My servants! All of you are misguided, except whomsoever I guide. So seek your guidance from Me.”</strong> [25] And as the Prophet <em>sallallâhu </em><i>’</i><em>alayhi wa sallam</em> used to say: <i>“O Allâh! Lord of Jibrîl, Mikaîl and Israfîl. The Originator of the heavens and the earths. Knower of the Unseen and the apparent. You judge between Your servants in that which he differs. So guide me in that which I differ from the truth</i> &#8211; <i>by Your permission. Indeed, You guide whomsoever You please, to a path that is straight</i>.<i>”</i> [26]</p>

Al-Ibaanah Magazine &#8211; Issue No.2 &#8211; Rabî’ul-Awwal 1416H / August 1995</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect, Most High &#8211; said:<b>&#8220;O you who Believe! Have taqwaa (fear) of Allaah and believe in His Messenger; and He will bestow upon you a double portion of His Mercy and He will provide you with a light by which you will walk.&#8221;</b>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah &#8211; the Most High &#8211; also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O you who Believe! If you have taqwaa of Allaah, He will give to you a Furqaan (criterion to judge between right and wrong).&#8221;[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">AI-Haafidh Ibn Katheer (d.777H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas, as-Suddee, &#8216;Ikrimah, ad-Dahhaak, Qataadah and Muqaatil ibn Hayyaan all said about Furqaan &#8220;that it means: a way out (from difficulty).&#8221; Mujaahid added: &#8220;A way out (from difficulty) both in this world and in the Hereafter.&#8221; In a narration from Ibn &#8216;Abbaas he said it means: salvation; and in another narration from him: being helped. Muhammad ibn Ishaaq said that it means: &#8220;a criterion to judge between truth and falsehood.&#8221; This explanation from Ibn Ishaaq is the most general of what has already preceeded and it is a necessary consequence of it. Since whoever has taqwaa of Allaah by obeying His command and abandoning what He has prohibited, will be given the ability to recognise truth from falsehood. This will be the cause for his salvation, his being helped; and the cause for his worldly affairs being made easier and his happiness on the Day of Judgement. It will also be the cause for his sins to be expiated by Allaah, and his being granted forgiveness and Allaah shielding him from the people. It will likewise be the cause of him being the recipient (if a great reward from Allaah, as He &#8211; the Most High &#8211; says: &#8216;O you who Believe! Have taqwaa (fear) of Allaah and believe in His Messenger; and He will bestow upon you a double portion of His Mercy and He will provide you with a light by which you will walk.'[4]&#8221;[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">lbn Mas&#8217;ood &#8211; radiallaahu anhu &#8211; said: &#8220;Indeed I hold that a person forgets knowledge that he used to know because of sins that he commits.&#8221;[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wakee&#8217; (d.197H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said: &#8220;I seek help in memorization by abandoning sin and disobedience.&#8221;[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik (d.179H) said to ash-Shafi’ee when they first met: &#8220;Indeed I see that Allaah has placed a light upon your heart so do not extinguish it with the darkness of disobedience and sin.&#8221;[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shaaf&#8217;ee (d.204H) &#8211; rahimahullaah &#8211; said:&#8221;Whosoever loves that Allaah Should open up his heart for him and grant light to him, then let him abandon speech about that which does not concern him, and abandon sins and turn away from acts of disobedience. Then there will be between him and Allaah a hidden treasure of good actions. So if this is done, then Allaah will open up such knowledge for him, that will pre-occupy him. And indeed in death is the greatest pre-occupation.&#8221;[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul- Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah (d .728 H) said: &#8220;Allaah &#8211; the Most Perfect &#8211; has made as a punishment for people&#8217;s sins, the absence of guidance and beneficial knowledge, as He says: &#8220;They say: Our hearts are wrapped-up (and we do not understand). Rather, Allaah has put a seal upon their hearts because of their disbelief.&#8221;[10] And He said: &#8220;They say: Our hearts are wrapped-up (and we do not understand). Rather, Allaah has cursed them for their disbelief. &#8221; [11] And He said: &#8220;And we shall turn their hearts and their sight away from guidance, as they refused to believe therein for the first time.&#8221; [12] And Allaah says: &#8220;In their hearts is a disease, and Allaah increases their disease.&#8221; [13] And He says: &#8220;So when they turned away, AlIaah turned their hearts away.&#8221; [14]&#8221; [15]</p>
