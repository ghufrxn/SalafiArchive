<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Great Importance Given to the <em>’Aqeedah</em> in the Madinan Period</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and his Companions migrated to al-Madeenah, and the Islamic state was established through the efforts of the <em>Muhaajirs</em> and the <em>Ansaar</em>, and upon the foundation of <em>tawheed</em>, then the greatest importance continued to be given to <em>tawheed</em>. The <em>Aayaat</em> of the Qur&#8217;aan continued to be sent down with it, and the directions and the orders of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  revolved around it.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  did not suffice even with all this. Rather he used to take pledge of allegiance from the greater Companions, not to mention the others, upon it from time to time. Whenever the opportunity arose, he would take their pledge of allegiance upon it. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ إِذَا جَاءَكَ الْمُؤْمِنَاتُ يُبَايِعْنَكَ عَلَىٰ أَن لَّا يُشْرِكْنَ بِاللَّهِ شَيْئًا وَلَا يَسْرِقْنَ وَلَا يَزْنِينَ وَلَا يَقْتُلْنَ أَوْلَادَهُنَّ وَلَا يَأْتِينَ بِبُهْتَانٍ يَفْتَرِينَهُ بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِنَّ وَأَرْجُلِهِنَّ وَلَا يَعْصِينَكَ فِي مَعْرُوفٍ ۙ فَبَايِعْهُنَّ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لَهُنَّ اللَّهَ ۖ إِنَّ اللَّهَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">When the Believing women come to give you their pledge that they will not associate anything in worship with Allaah; nor steal; nor commit fornication; nor kill their children; nor attribute to their husbands children which are not theirs; nor disobey you, O Muhammad </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(</span><span style="color:#008000;">صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, in that which is good and commanded by Allaah; </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(and not wail over the dead)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, then accept their pledge and ask Allaah to forgive them. Indeed Allaah forgives those who repent to Him and is Most Merciful to them.</span>”</strong><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]  </a>Soorah al-Mumtahinah (60):12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though this <em>Aayah</em> is with regard to the women’s pledge, Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  also used to take pledge from the men upon its contents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ’Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em>) was in an assembly (of his Companions) and said, ‘Swear allegiance to me with the pledge that you will not associate anything in worship with Allaah, and that you will not steal, nor commit fornication, nor kill your children, (and upon the Aayah which was taken as a pledge from the women [60:12]). So whoever fulfills this pledge from you, then he will be rewarded by Allaah. And whoever falls into sin with any of that and is punished for it, then it is an expiation for it. And whoever falls into any of these sins and Allaah conceals his sin, then it is up to Allaah: if He wills He may forgive him, and if He wills He may punish him.’” </em><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Ibn Katheer quotes a large number of <em>ahaadeeth</em> that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to take pledge from the women upon that which this <em>Aayah</em> contains.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> From these <em>ahaadeeth</em> is that of ’Aa’ishah; the <em>hadeeth </em>of Umayyah bint Ruqayqah;<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> the <em>hadeeth</em> of Umm ’Atiyyah;<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> the <em>hadeeth</em> of Salmaa bint Qays, one of the maternal aunts of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ;<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6)</a> and the <em>hadeeth </em>of Raa’itah bint Sufyaan al-Khuzaa’iyyah.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Then he (i.e. Ibn Katheer) said, “<strong>And Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to take this pledge from the women repeatedly</strong>.” Then he quoted the <em>hadeeth</em> of Ibn ’Abbaas,<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> and other <em>ahaadeeth</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also used to take this pledge repeatedly from the men. This is indicated by the <em>hadeeth</em> of ’Ubaadah ibn as-Saamit which has preceded, and also by the <em>hadeeth</em> of ’Auf ibn Maalik al-Ashja’ee, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“We were with Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em>)  and numbered nine, eight or seven people, so he said, ‘Will you not give your pledge to Allaah’s Messenger?’ So we said, ‘We have already given you our pledge, O Messenger of Allaah!’ Then he said, ‘Will you not give your pledge to Allaah’s Messenger?’ So we stretched out our hands and said, ‘We will indeed give you our pledge, O Messenger of Allaah, but what will our pledge be?’ He said, ‘That you will worship Allaah and not worship anything else besides Him; the five obligatory Prayers; that you obey (and he said a word quietly); and that you do not ask the people for anything.’ So I have as a result seen some of those people, their whip would fall down from their hand (while riding) and he would not ask anyone to pick it up for him.” </em><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  used to send callers, teachers, judges and governors, to kings and tyrants, and to various areas, calling to <em>tawheed</em>. From Anas, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>the servant of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  sent letters to Kisraa (Chosroes), and Caesar, and the Najaashee (Negus) and to every tyrant ruler calling them to Allaah. And this Negus was not the one whom the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  prayed Funeral Prayer for.”<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This point is shown very clearly by the text of his letter to the Caesar, and that his purpose was to call to <em>tawheed</em>. Its text is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Muhammad, the Slave of Allaah and His Messenger, to Hiraql, the Emperor of the Byzantines.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace and safety are for those who follow the Guidance. To proceed. I invite you with the call of Islaam. Accept Islaam and you will be safe, and Allaah will grant you a double reward. But if you turn your back upon it, then you will carry the burdens of the sins of your subjects.”<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, “Whoever calls to guidance then there is for him a reward similar to the reward of those who follow him, nothing being reduced from their reward. And whoever calls to misguidance, then there is a burden of sin upon him similar to the sin of those who follow him, nothing being reduced from their sins.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O People of the Book, come to a word of justice between us, that we will single Allaah out with all worship and will not worship anything besides Him and disassociate ourselves from everything that is worshipped besides Him. Nor will we take one another as lords besides Allaah by obeying one another in that which involves disobedience to Allaah. So if they turn away, then say, ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims, submitting to Allaah and making our worship purely and sincerely for Him and not worshipping anything else besides Him.’”</strong><a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the letter reached the Caesar he sent for Aboo Sufyaan ibn Harb and some riders of Quraysh. They were at that time trading in the area of Palestine/Syria, and were within the time of the truce period agreed between Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and the unbelievers of Quraysh. So they came to Caesar at Jerusalem and he asked Aboo Sufyaan a number of questions. From them was that he asked, “What does he (i.e. Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ) command you?” Aboo Sufyaan said, “I replied, ‘He says, “<em>Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything else besides Him and abandon the saying of your fathers. He orders prayer, truthfulness, chastity and joining ties of relationship</em>.”’”<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Furthermore he used to organise armies to fight <em>Jihaad</em> in the path of Allaah in order to establish and raise high the word of <em>tawheed</em>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He who fights in order that Allaah’s Word is the highest then he is the one who is fighting in the Path of Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Buraydah ibn al-Husayyib, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu</em>, who said, “When Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  appointed the chief of a raiding party or an army, he used to counsel him to have taqwaa of Allaah concerning himself and with regard to good treatment of the Muslims with him, and he said, ‘When you meet your enemy from the mushriks then call them to accept one of three things, whichever of them they agree to, then accept it and leave them alone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) Invite them to accept Islaam. If they accept that then accept it from them, and leave them alone. Invite them in that case to leave their homes and to migrate to the land of the Muhaajirs&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) But if they refuse (to accept Islaam), then ask them to pay the <em>jizya</em> tax. If they agree to that then accept that from them and leave them alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) But if they refuse then seek the aid of Allaah and fight them. And if you besiege a fortified place and they ask you to allow them to surrender upon the judgement of Allaah, then do not allow them to surrender upon that since you do not know what Allaah’s judgement concerning them is. Rather allow them to surrender in accordance with what you judge in the matter. Then decide as you wish concerning them.’”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the <em>hadeeth</em> of Buraydah is the <em>hadeeth</em> of an-Nu’maan ibn Muqarrin al-Muzanee, <em>radiyallaahu</em> <em>’anhu, </em>which is indicated by Muslim, Aboo Daawood and Ibn Maajah, who all said, “’Alqamah said: I narrated it to Muqaatil ibn Hayyaan. He said: Muslim ibn Haysam narrated to me, from an-Nu&#8217;maan ibn Muqarrin from the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  with its like.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) Furthermore he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  sent Mu’aadh to Yemen as a Governor, a judge and a teacher. Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“You are a going to a people from the People of the Book, so let the first thing you call them to be the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, (and in a narration: that they should single Allaah out with all worship), and I am the Messenger of Allaah. So if they obey you in that, then inform them that Allaah has made five Prayers obligatory upon them in each day and night. So if they obey you in that, then inform them that Allaah has obligated upon them a charity which is to be taken from their rich and given to their poor. If they obey you in that, then beware of taking the best parts of their wealth, and beware of the supplication of the oppressed, because there is no screen between it and Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that he used to give this same advice to all the callers, governors and judges whom he sent out.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) <em>Jihaad </em>was prescribed for the establishment of <em>tawheed</em> and to purify the earth from the scourge of <em>shirk</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَقَاتِلُوهُمْ حَتَّىٰ لَا تَكُونَ فِتْنَةٌ وَيَكُونَ الدِّينُ لِلَّهِ ۖ فَإِنِ انتَهَوْا فَلَا عُدْوَانَ إِلَّا عَلَى الظَّالِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Fight the <em>Mushriks</em> until there remains no worship of anything besides Allaah, and all worship is for Allaah alone and His religion is uppermost. So if they desist from <em>shirk</em> and enter into Islaam then let there be no transgression except those that worship others along with Allaah”</span> </strong><a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>  [Soorah al-Baqarah (2):193]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer (at-Tabaree),<em> rahimahullaah</em>, said in his <em>Tafseer</em> (2/194-195):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah, the Most High, says to His Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم),  Meaning: &#8220;so that there is no <em>shirk</em> with Allaah, and no one besides Him is worshipped; and worship of the idols, false gods and those set up as rivals is extinguished. And worship and obedience is for Allaah alone to the exclusion of idols and images&#8230; Qataadah said, ‘So that there is no <em>shirk</em>.’ He quotes his chain of narration with this explanation from Qataadah, Mujaahid, as-Suddee and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas. He said, ‘What is meant by <em>Deen </em>(religion) which Allaah mentions in this place is: Worship and obedience to Allaah in what He orders and forbids.’ He said, ‘With this meaning there occurs the saying of al-A’shee: He caused the (tribes of) ar-Ribaab to submit and become obedient when they hated obedience &#8211; Achieving it through continual fighting and attacks.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he quoted his chain of narration of ar-Rabee’ who said concerning,  Meaning: “Until none but Allaah is worshipped,” which is the meaning of <em>laa ilaaha illallaah</em> (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). That is what Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  fought for and called to.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Aboo Hurayrah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they say laa ilaaha illallaah (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). So whoever says: laa ilaaha illallaah, then his wealth and his person is safe from me, except due to any right of it, and his reckoning is with Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the Chief of the Believers &#8216;Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said to Aboo Bakr, the <em>Khaleefah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) , when he resolved to fight the apostates and also those with them who refused to hand over the <em>zakaat</em>, ’Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said, “How can you fight those people when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, ‘I have been ordered to fight the people until they testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, so whoever says this then his wealth and his person are safe from me except due to any right of it, and his reckoning is with Allaah.’” So Aboo Bakr, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>said, “By Allaah, I will fight those who seek to separate between the Prayer and the <em>zakaat</em>. Indeed the <em>Zakaat</em> is a right due upon wealth. By Allaah, were they to hold a single young goat from me which they used to pay to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) , I would fight them for it.”<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jaabir ibn ’Abdillaah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they say, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.’ So when they say that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah then their blood and their property are safe from me except due to a right pertaining to it, and their reckoning is with Allaah.” </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he recited,<strong> </strong></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَذَكِّرْ إِنَّمَا أَنتَ مُذَكِّرٌ  لَّسْتَ عَلَيْهِم بِمُصَيْطِرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed We have only sent you, O Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم), as an admonisher to them. You are not to force them to believe against their will</span>.”  [Soorah al-Ghaashiyah (88):21-22] <a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a>, <a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa, </em>who said that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“I have been ordered to fight the people until they bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, and they establish the Prayer, and pay the zakaat. So if they do that then their blood and their wealth are safe from me except due to its right, and their reckoning is with Allaah.”</em><a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it may be noticed that the <em>ahaadeeth</em> of ’Umar, Aboo Bakr, Aboo Hurayrah and Jaabir are restricted to mentioning the matter of <em>tawheed</em> and do not mention the other matters. So perhaps the reason for this is the very great concern which the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  gave to this matter so that he would mention it to them time after time on its own, as an indication of its greatness and importance. Also because of the fact that he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  realised that they understood that all the other affairs of Islaam follow on from it, and are required by it and are from its rights, particularly the pillars of Islaam and <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say, because of the fact that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  often used to mention only that which related to <em>‘aqeedah</em>, &#8216;Umar used this saying as an evidence. Then the reply of Aboo Bakr to support his stance, was to make a direct analogy between the <em>Zakaat</em> and the Prayer, “By Allaah, I will fight anyone who makes a difference between the Prayer and the <em>Zakaat</em>&#8230;” So if he knew the narration as it was reported by Ibn ’Umar he would have used that as a clear and decisive proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also if ’Umar knew of the narration as reported by his son he would not have raised any objection to the saying of Aboo Bakr. Then if those present at the time, included Aboo Hurayrah, knew the naration of Ibn ’Umar, then they would have mentioned it to the two <em>Shaykhs</em>.<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a> So perhaps the reason behind this was indeed as we have said, the great importance which the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  gave to <em>’aqeedah</em>, and his propogation of it, and the frequency with which he spoke about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then also because the most prominent and most important aspect of the teachings which the Prophets conveyed from their Lord was <em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah</em> (singling out Allaah with all worship), and this was the greatest reason for strife between the Prophets and their enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore the most significant of the aspects of falsehood and misguidance, against which the Prophets (<em>’alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam</em>) fought, and which the <em>Mushriks</em> who denied the truth of their message furiously fought to defend, in every nation was: the worship of images and idols, and the building of tombs upon the graves of the pious and the Prophets, and veneration of them, and making offerings to them, and attachment of people’s hearts to them, both of the rulers and the ruled, an attachment of hope and fear, desiring and anticipating that they would intercede for them with Allaah, enabling the accomplishment of their wishes. This was indeed major <em>shirk</em> which will not be forgiven, so we must mention, along with that which we have already quoted whilst speaking about the methodology of the Prophets, particularly when we spoke concerning Ibraaheem, the <em>Imaam</em> of the Pious and the destroyer of the worthless idols, something about the full scale war which Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  waged against major <em>shirk</em> which was seen in his smashing the idols physically and by blocking up all the ways which Satan uses to lead his followers to worshipping them and taking them as rivals to Allaah, by using the terms ‘gods’ or <em>awliyaa</em>&#8216; (pious ones beloved to Allaah) or hiding beneath any of the misleading titles they use.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from this war which is clearly seen in the Qur&#8217;aan and was waged by the Messenger of the One Who sent the Qur&#8217;aan, is the saying of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أَفَرَأَيْتُمُ اللَّاتَ وَالْعُزَّىٰ  وَمَنَاةَ الثَّالِثَةَ الْأُخْرَىٰ  أَلَكُمُ الذَّكَرُ وَلَهُ الْأُنثَىٰ  تِلْكَ إِذًا قِسْمَةٌ ضِيزَىٰ  إِنْ هِيَ إِلَّا أَسْمَاءٌ سَمَّيْتُمُوهَا أَنتُمْ وَآبَاؤُكُم مَّا أَنزَلَ اللَّهُ بِهَا مِن سُلْطَانٍ ۚ إِن يَتَّبِعُونَ إِلَّا الظَّنَّ وَمَا تَهْوَى الْأَنفُسُ ۖ وَلَقَدْ جَاءَهُم مِّن رَّبِّهِمُ الْهُدَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Have you seen, O <em>Mushriks</em>, (the idols:) <em>al-Laat</em>, <em>al-’Uzzaa, </em>and the other one <em>Manaat</em>, the third of them</strong></span>.<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> You prefer and love the male offspring for yourselves and then falsely attribute daughters, which is something you hate for yourselves, to Allaah. This is indeed an unjust division. Rather these idols are mere names which you <em>Mushriks</em> and your forefathers have invented. Allaah has sent down no proof for that. Rather they follow only conjecture and their own deisres, even though clear guidance has come to them from their Lord proving the futility of worshipping these idols and that worship is the right of Allaah alone.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24"><span style="color:#008000;">[24]</span></a><span style="color:#008000;"> </span>[Soorah an-Najm (53):19-23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a clear statement of contempt for the idols which they worshipped, and war against them. Also, Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">ذَٰلِكَ وَمَن يُعَظِّمْ حُرُمَاتِ اللَّهِ فَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُ عِندَ رَبِّهِ ۗ وَأُحِلَّتْ لَكُمُ الْأَنْعَامُ إِلَّا مَا يُتْلَىٰ عَلَيْكُمْ ۖ فَاجْتَنِبُوا الرِّجْسَ مِنَ الْأَوْثَانِ وَاجْتَنِبُوا قَوْلَ الزُّورِ  حُنَفَاءَ لِلَّهِ غَيْرَ مُشْرِكِينَ بِهِ ۚ وَمَن يُشْرِكْ بِاللَّهِ فَكَأَنَّمَا خَرَّ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ فَتَخْطَفُهُ الطَّيْرُ أَوْ تَهْوِي بِهِ الرِّيحُ فِي مَكَانٍ سَحِيقٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So shun the filth of worshipping idols and shun false speech. Worshipping Allaah alone in <em>tawheed</em> making worship purely for Him, and not worshipping anything besides Him. And whoever worships anything else along with Allaah, then he is like one who fell down from the sky and was ripped to pieces by the birds, or like one cast by the wind in a far distant place.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a> [Soorah al-Hajj (22):30-31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّمَا الْخَمْرُ وَالْمَيْسِرُ وَالْأَنصَابُ وَالْأَزْلَامُ رِجْسٌ مِّنْ عَمَلِ الشَّيْطَانِ فَاجْتَنِبُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, intoxicants, gambling, stone altars erected for sacrifice and divining-arrows are an abomination from the handiwork of Satan. So shun all of that so that you may be successful.”</span> </strong><a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a> [ Soorah al-Maa’idah (5):90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from ’Amr ibn ’Abasah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>and his <em>hadeeth</em> has preceded, and in it there occurs, <em>“I said, ‘Did Allaah send you as a Messenger?’ He said, ‘Yes,’ I asked, ‘With what message did he send you?’ He replied, ‘That Allaah should be singled out and worshipped in tawheed, and that nothing should be worshipped besides Him, and to smash the idols and to join ties of relationship.’”</em><a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the <em>hadeeth </em>of Ja’far which has preceded there occurs, “&#8230;until Allaah sent a Messenger to us from amongst us. We knew his lineage and his truthfulness and his chastity. He called us to single out Allaah in <em>tawheed</em> and to worship Him alone, and to renounce the stones and idols and whatever we and our fathers used to worship besides Him&#8230;”<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>hadeeth </em>of Aboo Sufyaan and his conversation with Heraclius, the King of the Byzantines, there occurs, “He says, (i.e., the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ), <em>‘Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything along with Him, and renounce what the forefathers say&#8230;’”</em><a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>hadeeth</em> of Aboo Umaamah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>there occurs, <em>“Indeed Allaah sent me as a mercy for the worlds, and as a guide for the worlds, and my Lord, the Mighty and Majestic, ordered me to destroy all musical instruments and flutes, and idols and the cross, and such things from the days of Ignorance&#8230;”</em><a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the leaders of Quraysh went out of their minds in anger, unable to put up with the attack of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  against their idols, whether it was concerning the Qur&#8217;aan sent down to him, or his <em>da’wah</em> in secret, or his <em>da’wah</em> in the open. This was something about which there could be no indulgence, and it was something which had to be due to his true and sincere call.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn ’Abbaas, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa,</em> who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“When Aboo Taalib became ill a group of Quraysh entered upon him, amongst them Aboo Jahl, and they said, ‘The son of your brother abuses our gods, and does such and such, and says such and such. So if only you were to send a message forbidding him.’ So he sent a message and the Prophet (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   came and entered the house&#8230; Aboo Taalib said to him, ‘O son of my brother! Why is it that your people complain about you? They claim that you abuse their idols and say such and such?!’ They spoke a great deal against him, and Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   spoke and said, ‘O Uncle! I only desire that they should say a single phrase which if they say it, then the Arabs will become obedient to them and the non-Arabs will pay the Jizyah tax to them.’ So they were very surprised at what he said and they said, ‘A single phrase? Yes, by your father, even ten.’ So they asked, ‘And what is it?’ Aboo Taalib said, ‘And which saying is it, O son of my brother?’ So he (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   said, ‘None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.’ So they stood up, shaking their clothes saying, ‘Does he declare that worship should be for a single God?! this is something bizarre.’”</em><a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also from Jaabir, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Quraysh gathered together one day and said, ‘See who is the most knowledgeable of you with regard to sorcery, divining and poetry, then let him go to this man who splits our united body, causes schism between us and abuses our religion. So let him speak to him and see how best to reply to him.’ So they said, ‘We do not know anyone but ’Utbah ibn Rabee’ah.’ So they said, ‘Then it is to be you O Abul-Waleed.’ So ’Utbah went to him and said, ‘O Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ! Are you better or ’Abdullaah?’<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a> Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  remained silent. ‘Are you better or ’Abdul-Muttalib?’<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> Again Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  remained silent. So he said, ‘If you claim that they are better than you, then they certainly worshipped the idols which you abuse. If however you claim that you are better than them, then speak so that we may hear what you have to say. Indeed we have never seen a youngster who has boded evil for his people more so than yourself. You have split our unity and caused schism in our affair, and you have abused our religion and shamed us in front of the Arabs. It has spread amongst them that there is a sorceror within Quraysh, and a diviner within Quraysh. By Allaah we do not expect that we will have to wait for the time it takes a new-born to cry out before we will fight amongst oursleves with swords and wipe oursleves out. O man, if it is poverty that is your problem, then we will gather wealth for you until you will be the richest man of Quraysh. If it is that you have a need to marry, then choose whichever of the women of Quraysh you like and we will marry you ten of them.’ So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said, ‘Have you finished?’ He said, ‘Yes.’ So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until he reached</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">حم  تَنزِيلٌ مِّنَ الرَّحْمَٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ&#8230;.  فَإِنْ أَعْرَضُوا فَقُلْ أَنذَرْتُكُمْ صَاعِقَةً مِّثْلَ صَاعِقَةِ عَادٍ وَثَمُودَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. <em>Haa Meem</em>. This Qur&#8217;aan is the Revelation sent down by the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy &#8230;. So if these <em>mushriks</em> turn away from the proof which We have made clear to them, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , then say, ‘I warn you of a terrible punishment like that which befell ’Aad and Thamood.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>  [Soorah Fussilat (41):1-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">’Utbah said, ‘Enough! Enough! Do you have nothing other than this?’ He said, ‘No.’ So he returned to Quraysh and they said, ‘What has occurred?’ He said, ‘I didn&#8217;t leave anything which I thought that you would wish to say except that I said it to him.’ They said, ‘Did he respond to you?’ He said, ‘No, by the one who caused the <em>Ka’bah</em> to be built, I did not understand anything which he said except that he warned you of a terrible punishment like that of ’Aad and Thamood.’ They said, ‘Woe to you, the man speaks to you in Arabic and you don&#8217;t understand what he says?!’ He said, ‘No, by Allaah, I did not understand anything that he said except for his mention of the terrible punishment.’”<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this war was fought with words and the soul, with biting attacks and belittlement and derision, by overcoming the falsehood and ignorance of the <em>Mushriks. </em>At the same time, establishing the proof against them so that whoever went to destruction did so aware of the clear proof, and those who lived did so upon the clear proof. So from the results of this war, and from the results of this clear declaration was that Allaah guided many of the Arabs from the Quraysh and from the other tribes, and from <em>Aws</em> and the <em>Khazraj</em>. Allaah granted them clear discernment and they realised the reality of <em>tawheed</em> and its status. They also knew the vileness of committing <em>shirk</em> with idols or anything else, and also, at the same time, its seriousness and evil consequences for the <em>Mushriks</em> in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these were the great and good fruits which came as a result of the <em>Jihaad</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and his Companions and their steadfastness in the field of true <em>da’wah</em> to Allaah, and their intensive striving against the idols and false objects of worship. Then when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  took <em>tawheed</em> to a new practical level which was to physically annihilate, smash and eradicate the idols and purify the earth from them, being fully aware of their seriousness, since they are the primary source of danger for every generation of mankind since the dawn of history until the end of history, just as the leader of those upon the true and straight religion said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ قَالَ إِبْرَاهِيمُ رَبِّ اجْعَلْ هَٰذَا الْبَلَدَ آمِنًا وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَن نَّعْبُدَ الْأَصْنَامَ رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرًا مِّنَ النَّاسِ ۖ فَمَن تَبِعَنِي فَإِنَّهُ مِنِّي ۖ وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَإِنَّكَ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols, O my Lord, they have indeed caused the misguidance of many people.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>  [Soorah Ibraaheem (14):35-36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore the greatest Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  resolved to carry out the task of purifying the earth from idols, and to level the graves since tombs are the partner of the idols in causing the misguidance of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ’Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  entered Makkah and there were three hundred and sixty idols erected around the <em>Ka’bah</em>. So he began striking them with a stick which he had in his hand and was saying, ‘<em>The truth has arrived and falsehood has perished. The truth has arrived and falsehood cannot begin or return</em>.’”<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  prepared an attachment to go from al-Madeenah to the tribe of Khath’am to attack Dhul-Khalasah, which they did. From Jareer ibn ’Abdullaah, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said, “There was a house<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a> called Dhul-Khalasah, or the <em>Yemeni Ka’bah</em> or the <em>Shaamee Ka’bah</em>, and the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  said to me, <em>‘Will you not relieve me of Dhul-Khulasah?’</em> So I set out with a hundred and fifty riders of the Ahmas tribe. So we broke it down and killed whomever we found there. Then I came to the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  and informed him, so he made supplication for blessing for us and for the tribe of Ahmas.”<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The wording used by al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and Ahmad is, <em>“Will you not relieve me of Dhul-Khalasah?”</em> See the wording used by the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) ?! It was as if the existence of idols deprived him of sleep and disturbed him, so that he could not settle or be at ease.<a href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79"></a></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref23" name="_ftn23">[23]</a> <strong>Translator’s Note:</strong> <em>Al-Laat</em> had its origin in a man of the tribe of <em>Thaqeef</em> who used to mix gruel for pilgrims in the times of ignorance near to a certain rock in <em>Taa’if</em>. Then after his death the people built a tomb around the rock, upon his grave. They then worshipped this and gave it the name <em>al-Laat</em> which they invented by twisting the name of Allaah. Allaah’s Messenger (*) sent al-Mugheerah ibn Shu’bah and Aboo Sufyaan to destroy it. They did so and in its place the mosque of Taa’if was built.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>al-’Uzzaa</em>, then it was in the form of a tree surrounded by a curtained building in a palm grove between Taa’if and Makkah. The Quraysh used to venerate it. An-Nasaa’ee reports in his <em>Tafseer</em> (2/357 no.567) that when Allaah’s Messenger (*) conquered Makkah he sent Khaalid ibn al-Waleed to it. He found that it was built around three trees, so he cut them down and destroyed the building. He then went to the Prophet (*) and informed him, but he said, “Return for you have done nothing.” So he returned and saw the keepers of the idol fleeing into the hills saying, “O <em>&#8216;Uzzaa</em>!” So Khaalid came and found a naked female with dishevelled hair, throwing dust upon her head. So he struck her with his sword and killed her, then he returned to the Prophet (*) and informed him. So he said, “That was <em>al-’Uzzaa.</em>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>Manaat</em> then it was situated at <em>Mushallal,</em> near to Qudayd, between Makkah and al-Madeenah. It was venerated by various tribes in the times of ignorance. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (*) sent ’Alee to demolish it in the year of the Conquest of Makkah. Ibn Ishaaq said in his <em>Seerah</em>, “The Arabs took other structures besides the <em>Ka’bah</em>, buildings which they worshipped and venerated just as they honoured the <em>Ka’bah</em>. These shrines had keepers and guards, and offerings would be made to them just as with the <em>Ka’bah</em>. The people would also make <em>tawaaf</em> around them and make sacrifices there&#8230;” (<em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> and <em>Tayseerul-’Azeezil-Hameed</em>, (p.177)).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <em>Dawah</em> of Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The noblest of all the Prophets and the last of them, Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdullaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم). The one sent with the greatest, most complete and most comprehensive message. The one whom Allaah sent as a mercy for the worlds, and as a bringer of good tidings and a warner, and as a Caller to Allaah with His permission, and a shining light. He did not leave anything good except that he guided his <em>ummah</em> to it and pointed it out to them, nor anything evil except that he warned them against it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So which of the fundamentals of Islaam did this exalted Prophet begin with? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">What was the starting point for his <em>da’wah</em>? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began with what all the Prophets began with, and started where they started in their <em>da’wah</em>: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>calling to the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and calling for all worship to be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone</strong></span>. He began with the testification, “None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah,” (<em>Laa ilaaha illallaah Muhammadur Rasoolullaah</em>). Can it be imagined that he or any of the other Prophets would begin with anything but this great principle, the foundation of all the divine Messages?! Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began with this fundamental principle, so the first thing which the people heard was, &#8216;Witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.&#8217; So the proud and haughty said.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلَ الْآلِهَةَ إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عُجَابٌ  &#8211; وَانطَلَقَ الْمَلَأُ مِنْهُمْ أَنِ امْشُوا وَاصْبِرُوا عَلَىٰ آلِهَتِكُمْ ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ يُرَادُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The unbelievers said, ‘Has he made all that is to be worshipped a single God, who alone is to be called upon and hears all invocations. This is a very curious thing which we have not heard of.’ So the leaders amongst them went off saying to one another, ‘Continue in what you are upon and persist in worshipping your idols. He only says this to gain ascendancy over us.’”  </strong></span>[Soorah Saad (38):5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He continued calling to this lofty principle and highest goal throughout the Meccan period of his Messengership, for thirteen years. He did not become weary or languid. He patiently bore all types of harm to propagate this principle, since no religious duties or pillars of Islaam were obligated upon him, except for the Prayer which was obligated in the tenth year of Prophethood, and apart from the excellent manners of keeping ties of relationship, truthfulness and chastity which he commanded his people with. However the core of his <em>da’wah</em> and the cause of dispute and opposition to him was that great fundamental principle. So Allaah charged this noble Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) with the particular duty of establishing this great principle. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّا أَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ الْكِتَابَ بِالْحَقِّ فَاعْبُدِ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ الدِّينَ  &#8211; أَلَا لِلَّهِ الدِّينُ الْخَالِصُ ۚ وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed We have sent down the Book to you, O Muhammad, with the truth, so worship Allaah alone making all religion purely and sincerely for Him. Indeed the religion that is free of all taint of <em>shirk</em> is alone what is acceptable to Allaah. As for those who take and invoke helpers and protectors besides Allaah, then they say, ‘We only worship them so that they should intercede for us and bring us nearer to Allaah.’ Indeed Allaah will establish judgement between them regarding the matters of religion about which they dispute.”</span>  [</strong>Soorah az-Zumar (39):2-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنِّي أُمِرْتُ أَنْ أَعْبُدَ اللَّهَ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ الدِّينَ  &#8211; وَأُمِرْتُ لِأَنْ أَكُونَ أَوَّلَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ &#8211;  قُلْ إِنِّي أَخَافُ إِنْ عَصَيْتُ رَبِّي عَذَابَ يَوْمٍ عَظِيمٍ &#8211; قُلِ اللَّهَ أَعْبُدُ مُخْلِصًا لَّهُ دِينِي</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Allaah has commanded that I should worship Him alone, purely and sincerely, not associating anything with Him, and I am commanded to be the first of this nation who submits to Him as a Muslim, making all worship purely for Him.’ Say, O Muhammad, ‘I fear should I disobey my Lord in this, the torment of a great Day.’ Say, ‘It is Allaah alone that I worship, making all of my worship purely and sincerely for Him, and not worshipping anything else besides Him.’”</span></strong>[Soorah az-Zumar (39):11-14]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ إِنَّ صَلَاتِي وَنُسُكِي وَمَحْيَايَ وَمَمَاتِي لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ &#8211; لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ ۖ وَبِذَٰلِكَ أُمِرْتُ وَأَنَا أَوَّلُ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">, ‘Indeed my Prayer, my sacrifice, my living and my dying are all purely and solely for Allaah, Lord of all the Worlds. There is no share of any of that for other than Him. That is what My Lord ordered me, and I am the first of this nation to submit to Allaah as a Muslim.’”</span></strong>[Soorah al-An’aam (6):162-163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also commanded him to call all of the people to fulfil and implement this principle, and to proceed upon it. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ &#8211; الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O Mankind, single out your Lord with worship; He who created you and all those who came before you so that you may be of those who seek to avoid Allaah’s punishment and anger; those whom Allaah is pleased with. He Who has made the earth a resting place for you and has made the sky a canopy, and sent down rain from the sky, and brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provision for you. So do not set up rivals with Allaah in your worship whilst you know that you have no Lord besides Him.”</span>  </strong>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):21-22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِلَٰهُكُمْ إِلَٰهٌ وَاحِدٌ ۖ لَّا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الرَّحْمَٰنُ الرَّحِيمُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“The God Who alone has the right to be worshipped is a Single God. So do not worship anything besides Him, nor associate anything in worship with Him, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy.”</span>  </strong>[Soorah al-Baqarah (2):163]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا الَّذِي لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۖ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ يُحْيِي وَيُمِيتُ ۖ فَآمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ النَّبِيِّ الْأُمِّيِّ الَّذِي يُؤْمِنُ بِاللَّهِ وَكَلِمَاتِهِ وَاتَّبِعُوهُ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad </strong>(صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)<strong>, to all of the people, ‘I am the Messenger of Allaah to you all. Allaah, to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and everything therein. None has the right to be worshipped but Him. He Who alone gives life and death. So affirm true faith in Allaah and in His sole right to worship, and believe in His Messenger, the Unlettered Prophet </strong>(Muhammad صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</span><span style="color:#008000;">)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> who believes in Allaah and His Words, and follow him, so that you may be rightly guided.’”</span></strong>[Soorah al-A’raaf (7):158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Aayaat </em>in this regard are very many, and what we have quoted is an example showing the methodology of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   in calling to <em>tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the<em> Sunnah</em>, there are many things clearly showing that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) began his <em>da’wah</em> with <em>tawheed</em> and completed it with it, and continued calling to it from the beginning to the end, throughout his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) ’Amr ibn ’Abasah as-Sulamee, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“During the times of Ignorance I used hold that the people were upon error and futility, and they used to worship the idols, then I heard of a man in Makkah who received revelation. So I set out upon my riding beast and came to him. At that time he was in hiding due to oppression of his people. So I behaved in a way that enabled me to gain access to him in Makkah, which I did. So I said to him, ‘What are you?’ He replied, ‘I am a Prophet.’ So I said, ‘And what is a Prophet?’ He said, ‘Allaah has sent me as a Messenger.’ So I said, ‘And what is it that He has sent you with?’ He said, ‘I have been sent to order the joining of ties of relationship, to break the idols, so that Allaah is worshipped alone and nothing at all is associated in worship along with Him.’ So I said, ‘And who is with you upon this?’ He said, ‘A free man and a slave.’ He said, ‘And at that time Aboo Bakr and Bilaal were with him from those who believed in him&#8230;’“ </em></p>
<p>[Reported by Muslim (Eng. trans. 2/395 no.1812) and Ahmad in <em>al-Musand</em> (4/112)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) When ’Amr ibn al-’Aas and ’Abdullaah ibn Rabee’ah al-Makhzoomee went to an-Najaashee, the ruler of Abyssinia, to speak to him in order to incite him against the Muslims who had emigrated to Abyssinia, they said, ‘O king, some of our foolish youths have abandoned their religion and come to your land. They have split away from their own people and have not entered your religion. Rather they have come up with an innovated religion which is not known either to us or to you&#8230;’ So the Najaashee asked the Muslims, ‘What is this religion which you have split from your people and not entered my religion or the religion of any of these nations?!’ So Ja’far ibn Abee Taalib was the one who replied, and he said to him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘O king, we were a people from the people of ignorance who worshipped idols, and we ate unslaughtered meat and committed foul acts, and we cut off ties of relationship, treated our neighbours in an evil manner and the strong amongst us used to devour the weak. So we were upon that until Allaah sent a Messenger to us from amongst us. We knew his lineage, his truthfulness, his trustworthiness and his chastity. <strong>So he called us to Allaah, that we should single Him out and worship Him alone and renounce everything which we and our fathers used to worship besides Him, all stones and idols</strong>; he commanded us to speak the truth and to fulfil trusts; to join ties of relationship; to live in a good manner with our neighbours; to avoid forbidden acts and shedding blood; and he forbade us from foul acts and from falsehood; and he forbade us from unlawfully devouring the wealth of orphans and falsely accusing chaste women. <strong>He ordered us to worship Allaah alone and not to worship anything along with Him&#8230;</strong>’ He said, ‘So he told him the affairs of Islaam,’ &#8216;So we attested to his truthfulness and believed him and followed him in that which he came with. So we worshipped Allaah alone, and did not worship anything else besides Him, and we made forbidden that which He forbade us, and declared lawful that which He allowed for us. So our people became enemies to us and tortured us and tormented us to turn back from our religion to the worship of idols, and so that we should allow the filthy actions which we used to allow. So when they oppressed us, treated us cruelly and made it unbearable for us, and came between us and our religion, then we left and came to your land, and we preferred you to others and wished to live in your company, and we hoped that we would not be oppressed while with you&#8230;’” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Also amongst the questions which Hirqal (Heraclius) asked Aboo Sufyaan, at the time of the peace of Hudaybiyyah, about Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) was that he asked Aboo Sufyaan, “What does he command you?” So Aboo Sufyaan replied, “He says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Worship Allaah alone and do not worship anything else along with Him, and abandon what your fathers say. And he orders Prayer, charity, chastity and the joining of ties of relationship.</strong>’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 1/7/no. 6) and it is a long <em>hadeeth]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these <em>ahaadeeth</em> clearly show us what the <em>da’wah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  was in both the Makkan and Madinan periods.</p>

Ahmad said, “Ya’qoob (meaning Ibraaheem ibn Sa&#8217;d az-Zuhree) narrated to us (reliable): My father narrated to us, from Muhammad ibn Ishaaq: Muhammad ibn Muslim ibn ’Ubaydillaah ibn Shihaab narrated to me: from Aboo Bakr ibn ’Abdir-Rahmaan ibn al-Haarith ibn Hishaam al-Makhzoomee:from Umm Salamah bint Abee Umayyah (meaning the Mother of the Believers, <em>radiyallaahu ’anha</em>).” It is a chain of narration that is fully <em>saheeh</em>, except for Muhammad ibn Ishaaq, but he clearly states that he heard it directly and so his narration is <em>hasan</em> (good and acceptable).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Moosaa, the one to whom Allaah spoke directly, the strong and trustworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We see that his call was directed to <em>tawheed</em> and carried the lights of guidance and wisdom. Moosaa was brought up and was raised in the palaces of the greatest tyrant who claimed divinity. He knew the various types of corruption, unbelief, tyranny, injustice and despotism from what he witnessed in the palaces. He saw things which it is difficult to imagine or think possible. He also saw the enslavement of his people, the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>, and their humiliation, and their women taken as slaves, and the killing of their children, to such an extent that it surpassed any oppression known to mankind. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Pharaoh exalted himself haughtily in the land, and divided its people into castes. He enslaved a group of them (i.e., the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>), killing their sons and letting their women live. He was indeed one of the corrupt evil-doers.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Pharaoh were also people of <em>shirk</em> and idol-worship without a doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">So how did Moosaa begin? Was his call directed to correction of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of this idolatrous nation? Or did it begin with a demand for the restoration of the rights of the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>, and a struggle to gain rulership and authority from the hands of the tyrant, and at the head of them Pharaoh, who claimed divinity for himself?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call of Moosaa was just like the call of his forefathers and brothers from the earlier Prophets. His Lord instructed him and inspired him with the principle of <em>tawheed</em>, and chose him to carry his revelation, and to establish worship of Him. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Has not the story of Moosaa come to you? When he saw a fire and said to his family, ‘Remain where you are for I have seen a fire. Perhaps I can bring a fire-brand from it or find someone who can show us the way.’ So when Moosaa came to the fire his Lord called him, ‘O Moosaa, I am your Lord. Remove your shoes, indeed you are in the purified valley of <em>Tuwaa</em>. I have chosen you as My Messenger, so listen to and heed what I reveal to you. Indeed I am Allaah. None has the right to be worshipped but Me. So worship Me and do not worship anything else besides Me, and establish Prayer for My remembrance. Indeed the Final Hour is certainly coming, which I keep hidden from all except Myself, in order to reward each soul according to its good or bad deeds.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was the beginning of his Messengership; he was inspired and ordered with the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>. He was ordered to establish it in himself and to represent it in his life. Then he was entrusted with the duty of calling to this sublime principle and was sent by Allaah to the Pharaoh. Allaah furthermore explained to him the correct manner of giving <em>da’wah</em> and the wise way in which he was to face the Pharaoh. Allaah, the Most High, said:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Go to Pharaoh who has transgressed all bounds in his haughtiness, pride, unbelief, and say, ‘Will you not purify yourself from the sin of unbelief and be obedient to your Lord? And that I guide you to the worship of your Lord, so that you may submit fearfully to Him and obey Him.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also supported him with his brother Haaroon in order for the proof to be established to the utmost, and He taught them to use gentleness and mildness in <em>da’wah</em> since that is the best way to attain the guidance of those whom Allaah wishes to guide:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Go both of you to Pharaoh, indeed he has transgressed beyond all bounds, and speak mildly with him that he might accept admonition and fear and be obedient to his Lord.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they carried out the order of their Lord and called him to Allaah, hoping for him to be guided and purified, so that he should be one of those who fear Allaah and fear and beware of the evil consequences of <em>shirk</em> and oppression. But he did not respond to this wise and composed call. So Moosaa manifested the great signs and clear proofs of his Prophethood and the truthfulness of his Messengership. But the despotic tyrant Pharaoh merely increased in his transgression and rejection of the truth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“But Pharaoh denied the signs which Moosaa came with and disobeyed his order for him to fear and obey his Lord. Then he turned away from what he ordered him (i.e., obedience to his Lord) and instead worked evil and corruption, and he gathered his people and his followers and said, ‘I am your lord, the most high.’ So Allaah seized him with punishment for his latter and his earlier saying.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Escalation of the Tyranny of the Pharaoh and how Moosaa and his People Faced it with Patient Perseverance and Forbearance</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The chiefs of Pharaoh’s people said, ‘Will you leave Moosaa and his people to cause mischief in the land when they have abandoned worship of you and worship of your gods?’ He said, ‘We will kill their sons and let their women live, and will have full power over them.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what was the sin of Moosaa and his people in the view of these criminals? No crime except that they called to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to remain firm upon it, and to disbelieve in Pharaoh and his idols. Then what was the response of Moosaa with respect to these disgraceful and outrageous transgressions which exceeded all bounds in its barbarity and ferocity?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His response was to remain firm upon correct belief, and to have patience and forbearance, and to seek the aid of Allaah in facing these calamities. Then he awaited the good outcome, and victory as a consequence and a good fruit of this remaining firm and this patient perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Moosaa said to his people, ‘Seeks Allaah’s help and be patient, the earth is Allaah’s, He gives it as a heritage to whom He pleases from His servants. The final outcome is in favour of those who fear Allaah by avoiding disobedience of Him and doing what He orders.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then when no hope that the Pharaoh and his people would believe remained, and the suffering which the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em> were subjected to increased in severity, the sole request which Moosaa made to the Pharaoh was that he should allow the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em> the freedom to leave the land of Egypt and emigrate to wherever Allaah willed that they should go, in order to save them from the torment inflicted upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“So go to the Pharaoh, saying, ‘We are the Messengers sent by your Lord, to order you to free the Children of <em>Israa’eel</em>. So release them and cease tormenting them. Indeed we bring you a clear sign from your Lord, and peace and safety from Allaah’s punishment are for those who follow the guidance.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was a sublime call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah containing light and wisdom. It was also accompanied by an eager desire for the guidance of those who were being called, and that they should be purified. It also contained a clear example of the utmost patience and forbearance in enduring great harm, and in facing tyranny and haughty oppression. It also shows the way to face the most difficult situations with wisdom and forbearance, whilst having the strongest hope in Allaah, that He will assist and grant victory to the Believers and destroy the unbelieving oppressors. Including clear lessons for those who make their call purely seeking the Face of Allaah and desire to rectify mankind and to turn to their Lord, and for them to be guided to His Straight Path.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>The Importance of <em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah<br />
</em>(Singling out Allaah with all Worship)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will discuss <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah with regard to worship (<em>Tawheedul-Uloohiyyah) </em>and its importance because of two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Firstly</span></strong>, that it is the most important part of the call of the Messengers presented to us in the Qur’aan, and because it was the reason for the continual struggle between them and their enemies, the proud and haughty, and the obstinate, in every nation. It has continued as the reason for conflict until this day, and perhaps it will continue as such until the Day of Resurrection, as a trial and test for the inheritors of the Messengers, and in order to raise their station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Secondly</span></strong>, the most severe and dangerous deviation afflicting the Muslims in the east and the west is with regard to it, and this affects the majority of the ignorant amongst the Muslims and many of those who are educated and those who associate themselves with knowledge. So we will begin by presenting the calls of the Prophets in general, and then present the call of some of them in particular.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“We sent a Messenger to every nation ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, and that they should avoid everything worshipped besides Allaah. So from them there were those whom Allaah guided to His religion, and there were those who were unbelievers for whom misguidance was ordained. So travel through the land and see the destruction that befell those who denied the Messengers and disbelieved.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“We did not send any Messenger before you, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , except that We revealed to him that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, so make all of your worship purely for Him.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, says after mentioning a number of stories of the Prophets, <em>alayhimus-salaatu was-salaam:</em><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“This religion of yours is a single religion, and I am your Lord, so worship Me alone.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a><em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O Messengers, eat from the food which Allaah has made lawful, and do correct and righteous deeds. Indeed, I am fully aware of whatever you do. Indeed this religion of yours is a single religion, and I am your Lord so keep yourselves safe from My punishment by obeying Me.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer said, “Mujaahid, Sa’eed ibn Jubayr, Qataadah and Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Zayd ibn Aslam said about the saying of Allaah, the Most High,  which means, <strong>‘Your religion is one.’</strong>”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a> Then the meaning of these two <em>Aayaat </em>occurs in the <em>Sunnah</em> in his (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   saying, <strong><em>“I am the closest of the people to &#8216;Eesaa ibn Maryam in this world and the Hereafter. The Prophets are brothers, their mothers are different, but their religion is one.”</em></strong><a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Allaah, the Most High, says about the Messengers who were firmest in determination (<em>oolul-&#8216;adham</em>), <em>alayhimus-salaatu was -salaam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Your Lord prescribed for you O people, the same religion which He prescribed for Nooh, and that which We revealed to you O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> ), and which He prescribed for Ibraaheem, and Moosaa, and ’Eesaa, that you should establish the religion, acting upon what is prescribed, and not split into sects with regard to it. It is intolerable to the polytheists that you call them to sincerely worship Allaah alone and reject worship of all else besides Him. But Allaah chooses for His religion whomever He pleases and He guides those who turn to Him in repentance and obedience, to act in obedience to Him, and to follow the guidance with which He sent His Messenger.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the call of all the Prophets, and at the head of them the Messengers who were firmest in determination. So the Prophets who numbered <strong>one hundred and twenty four thousand</strong> <a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a> followed a single methodology in their call, and began from a single starting point which is <em>tawheed</em>, the greatest issue and most important principle which they conveyed to all mankind, throughout the ages and despite their varying societies, lands and times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a proof that this is the single way which must be followed in calling the people to Allaah, and it is something laid down by Allaah to be followed by all of His Prophets and their true and sincere followers. It is not permissible to change or replace it, nor to turn away from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Examples From the Calls of Some of the Messengers</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, has informed us about some of the individuals from the greater Prophets, and how they faced their people. We see that all of them proceeded upon the universal way laid down for them by Allaah and they followed the methodology established for all of them by Allaah. Not a single one of them is at variance with it. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And We sent Nooh to his people saying, ‘I am a clear warner sent to you, that you should worship none besides Allaah. Indeed, if you do not make all your worship purely for Him I fear for you the torment of a painful Day.’ The chiefs of the disbelievers amongst his people said, ‘We see that you are but a man like ourselves and we do not see you followed except by the lowest of the people, in what is apparent to us. Nor do we see that you have any excellence over us, rather we think that you are a liar.’”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong style="color:#008000;">“And to ’Aad We sent Hood, saying, ‘O my people worship Allaah, making all of your worship purely for Him, since there is none besides Him having the right to be worshipped by you. Will you not fear your Lord?’ The leaders of those who disbelieved amongst his people said, ‘We see you upon error </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(due to your abandonment of our religion and worship of our gods)</span><strong style="color:#008000;"> and we think that you are a liar </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in claiming to be a Messenger from the Lord of the Worlds).</span><strong style="color:#008000;">’ He said, ‘O my People, I am not upon error, I am indeed a Messenger sent by the Lord of the Worlds. I convey to you the Message of my Lord and am sincere in my advice and faithful to my trust. Do you wonder that Allaah should send admonition for you through a man from amongst you, warning you of Allaah’s punishment and to fear Him? And remember the blessings of Allaah upon you in that He made you successors to the people of Nooh </strong><span style="color:#008000;">(after drowning them for their unbelief and denial of their Messenger)</span><b style="color:#008000;">, and He increased you in height and size. So remember the </b><span style="color:#008000;"><b>favours</b></span><b style="color:#008000;"> bestowed upon you by Allaah, so that you may be successful.’ They said, ‘Do you come to us warning us of punishment from Allaah for that which we practise as religion, so that we should instead worship Allaah alone and forsake what our fathers used to worship? We will not do that, so bring us the punishment which you threaten us with if you are truthful.’ He said, ‘Allaah’s punishment and wrath have become unavoidable for you. Do you dispute with me about mere idols which you and your fathers have given names to, things which can neither bring harm nor benefit, and Allaah has given no proof or excuse for their worship? Then wait for Allaah’s judgement between us, I too shall wait.’ So We saved Hood and those with him through Our Mercy </b><span style="color:#008000;">(due to their eemaan and their worship of Allaah alone)</span><b style="color:#008000;">, and we annihilated those who rejected Our signs and were not Believers.”</b><a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the call of the Messengers, all of them followed this methodology in their <em>da’wah</em> to Allaah: they called first to the <em>tawheed </em>of Allaah, and that He alone must be singled out with all worship. Then their people opposed them because of this, except those whom Allaah guided, facing them with mockery, charging them with being liars and seeking to ridicule them. As Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Many Prophets were sent to the earlier peoples, and no Prophet came to them except that the people met him with mockery.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing more severe and hurtful to lofty believing souls than accusations of falsehood, ridicule and mockery. These things are more hurtful to them than being struck with swords and imprisonment and punishment. This fact is mentioned by the Arab poet who said, “<strong>Being harmed by close relatives is more painful to the soul than being struck with a sharpened sword</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">’Aa’ishah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhaa, </em>asked the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“Has there been a day more severe upon you than the Day of Uhud?” So he said, “Your tribe has troubled me greatly, and the most troublesome thing which I experienced from them was on the day of ’Aqabah when I presented myself to ’Abd Yaaleel ibn ’Abd Kulaal and he didn&#8217;t respond as I had hoped. So I returned overwhelmed with sorrow and did not recover until I reached Qarnuth-Tha’aalib.</em><a style="color:#333399;" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a><em> I raised my head and saw a cloud shading me, then I looked and saw Jibreel in it, and he called me saying, ‘Allaah has heard what your people said to you and their reply, and Allaah has sent the Angel of the mountains to you, for you to order him to do whatever you wish.’ So the Angel of the mountains called me and greeted me with salaam and then said, ‘O Muhammad, Allaah has heard what your people said to you, and I am the Angel of the mountains, and my Lord has sent me to you for you to order me as you wish. So what do you wish?’ So Allaah’s Messenger (</em><em>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</em><em> )   said, “No, rather I hope that from their offspring will come those who will worship Allaah alone and not worship anything else besides Him.”</em></span><a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>hadeeth</em> clearly shows the <em>da’wah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (ﷺ) and his perseverance in that, and his mildness with his people. See how he was patient with them and asked for them to be spared from destruction which would have wiped them out. He instead hoped for good from Allaah, and hoped that from their offspring would come those who worshipped Allaah alone, not worshipping anything besides Him. Indeed what a noble and lofty goal, which is not realized except by those who taste the blessing of <em>tawheed</em> and know its station.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of <em>Seerah</em><a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a> detail some of the answers given by those who mocked him and their scornful stance when he invited them to Islaam. They mention that he went to a number of the nobles and leaders of the tribe of Thaqeef, and they were three brothers, ’Abd Yaleel, Mas&#8217;ood and Habeeb&#8230; and he sat with them and called them to Allaah and asked them to support Islaam and stand with him against those of his people who opposed him. So one of them said, “If it is actually true that Allaah has sent you, then He is tearing down the covering of the Ka’bah.” The second said, “Could Allaah not find anyone to send but you?” The third said, “By Allaah, I will never speak with you. If you are truly a Messenger from Allaah as you claim, then you are more serious than to have me reply to your words, and if you are lying against Allaah then it is not proper that I should ever speak to you.” So Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   left having despaired of good from Thaqeef.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we see from the <em>hadeeth</em> and the stroy is that mockery and scorn and harm caused by the foolish idolaters was more severe to the Prophets than any other trouble, even more so than the fierce battles in which lives are spent and the blood of their pure companions is shed. Indeed on the Day of Uhud more than seventy Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   were martyred.<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a> Amongst them: Mus’ab ibn ’Umayr,<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> and Hamzah ibn ’Abdil- Muttalib<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> the paternal uncle of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   was injured in the face and his incisor was broken.<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> He also suffered along with his Companions at the hands of the hypocrites, and suffered great harm and hardship before that in Makkah, and at Badr and other battles. Yet despite all of this, the severest trouble which he faced was on the Day of Taa’if because of the mockery and contempt which he faced to such a degree that it is unbearable for pure souls. Furthermore Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   said, <em>“<strong>Those who suffered the severest trials are the Prophets, then those who are most like them, then those who are most like them after that.</strong>”</em><a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who are most like them, and then those who are next closest are those who proceed upon their methodology in calling to Allaah, and called to what they called to, i.e. to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and that He is to be singled out with all worship, and to rejection of all <em>shirk</em> (attribution of any form or part of worship to anyone besides Allaah). Such people will suffer similar harm and trials as suffered by the Prophets who are their example. It is because of this fact that you see many of the callers departing away from this difficult methodology, and this rugged path, since the caller who follows it will have to face opposition from his mother, his father, his brother, his friends and those whom he loves. He will be opposed by the society which will treat him as an enemy and seek to mock and harm him. So many callers divert their attention to other aspects of Islaam which do have their place, and are not denied by anyone who truly believes in Allaah, except that those aspects do not involve that difficulty and hardship and do not bring about mockery and harm particularly in Islamic societies. This is because the majority of the people of the <em>ummah</em> of Islaam are willing to gather around these type of callers, and they throw praise and honour upon them instead of mockery and harm, unless they pose a threat to the rulers and are a danger to their positions, in which case they suppress them brutally. For example political parties which oppose the rulers and threaten to dethrone them. In such a case the rulers will show no love to relatives or friends, Muslims or disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in any case we say to those callers: no matter how much noise they make, and no matter how high they raise their voices in the name of Islaam, restrain yourselves because you have left the way prescribed by Allaah and His Straight Path, upon which the Prophets and their followers proceeded in calling to <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to making the religion purely for Him. So no matter how much you speak and raise your voices in the name of Islaam, you are still deviating from the methodology of the Prophets which was laid down by Allaah. No matter how much effort you expend, and how much you manage to extend your <em>da’wah</em> and your own methodology, you are still preoccupying yourselves with the means to the exclusion of the goal. Then what use are the means<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a> if they merely harm the goal, and they themselves grow at its expense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed woe to those callers who obstinately persist upon the methodologies which they themselves have innovated, those who fight against the methodology of the Prophets in calling to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, beneath dazzling banners and slogans which captivate the simple minded and those ignorant of the methodology and way of the Prophets.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)   suffered the worst forms of torture because of their adherence to the correct <em>‘aqeedah, </em>and their making all worship purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, and their rejection of <em>shirk</em> and <em>kufr</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From ’Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu, </em>who said, “The first people to openly proclaim their Islaam were seven: Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  , Aboo Bakr, ’Ammaar and his mother Sumayyah, Suhayb, Bilaal and al-Miqdaad. So as for Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)  , Allaah gave him protection through his uncle Aboo Taalib. As for Aboo Bakr, Allaah gave him protection through his people. But as for the rest of them, the <em>Mushriks</em> would take hold of them and dress them in iron armour and place them to scorch and roast in the sun. There was not one of them except that they responded to them except Bilaal, for his soul became as nothing to him for Allaah’s sake, and his people had no respect for him. So they gave him to the children who used to drag him around the streets of Makkah and he would say repeatedly, ‘<strong>(He who has the right to worship is) One, One.</strong>’”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the <em>Seerah</em> of Ibn Hishaam [2] there occurs: ’Umayyah ibn Khalf used to take him (Bilaal) out in the midday heat of the sun, and throw him down upon his back, on the ground of the flat valley bed of Makkah, and he would order for a large rock to be placed on his chest. Then he would say, “By Allaah, you will stay like this until you die, unless you disbelieve in Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم)   and you worship <em>al-Laat</em> and <em>al-’Uzzaa</em>.” So he would say, whilst he was in that condition, “<strong>(He who alone has the right to worship is) One, One</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sumayyah was tortured until death because of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em> not becasue she was a political leader. So from Mujaahid who said, “<strong>The first martyr in Islaam was Sumayyah the mother of ’Ammaar. Aboo Jahl thrust a spear into her abdomen.</strong>”[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Sa&#8217;d said, “She accepted Islaam early on in Makkah and she was one of those who was tortured to force them to abandon their religion. But she bore and endured it until Aboo Jahl came to her and thrust a spear into her abdomen and she died.”[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by al-Haakim in <em>al-Mustadrak </em>(3/284) and he declared it <em>saheeh</em> and adh-Dhahabee mentioned it in <em>Siyar A’laamin-Nubalaa</em> (1/348) and he said, “It has a <em>saheeh</em> chain of narration&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <em>Seerah</em> of Ibn Hishaam (1/318).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] <em>At-Tabaqaat</em> of Ibn Sa’d (8/264/265). He said, “Ismaa’eel ibn ’Umar, Abul-Mundhir related to us that Sufyaan ath-Thawree narrated to us from Mansoor from Mujaahid who said&#8230;” This is a <em>saheeh</em> chain of narration to Mujaahid.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Yoosuf (عليه السلام)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The noble one, son of the noble one, son of the noble one.[1] About whom Allaah sent down a long <em>Soorah</em> relating his noble life to us, and its stages, from his childhood to his death, and how his circumstances changed, and the difficulties that he faced, and how he faced everything with the Strength of Prophethood and his patient perseverance, wisdom and mildness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>saw the corrupt outlook of the Pharaohs in Egypt and their oppression, and he knew the beliefs of the nation amongst whom he lived. He knew the corruption of their beliefs and their idolatry, which led them to take idols and cattle as gods to worship besides Allaah. The stroy of this noble Prophet, <em>‘alayhis-salaam, </em>is long, and from it, we will examine the story of his imprisonment and his <em>da’wah</em> at that time. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And two young men entered the prison along with him. One of them said, ‘I saw in a dream that I was pressing grapes,’ and the other one said, ‘I saw in a dream that I was carrying bread upon my head and birds were eating from it.’ ‘Inform us of the interpretation of this for indeed we see that you are one of the doers of good.’ He said, ‘No food will come to you to eat except that I will inform you about it fully before it comes to you. This is from the knowledge which my Lord has taught me as I have remained free of the religion of a people who do not believe in the oneness of Allaah and who are disbelievers in the Hereafter. Rather I follow the religion of my fathers, Ibraaheem, Ishaaq and Ya&#8217;qoob. It is not fitting that we should worship anything else along with Allaah. This is from Allaah’s favour upon us and upon the people, yet most of the people do not give thanks for Allaah’s favours. O my two companions in the prison, is it better that you worship many different lords, or that you worship only Allaah, the One, Who subdues and has full power over everything? You do not worship besides Allaah except idols which you call gods, which you and your forefathers give names to, for which Allaah has sent down no authority. Authority is for Allaah alone. He ordered that you worship none but Him, that is the Straight and true religion, yet most of the people do not know (and are people of <em>shirk)</em>.’”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This noble Prophet, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>lived in their palaces and was therefore well aware of the corruption of their administration and their rulers. He experienced at first hand their plots, their oppression, their unjust persecution and imprisonment by them. Furthermore he lived amongst an idolatrous nation who worshipped idols, cattle and stars. So where was correction to begin? What was the starting point?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff9900;">Did he begin calling to Allaah, whilst he was wrongfully imprisoned along with others who were oppressed like him, by inciting them and rousing them against the despotic and tyrant rulers? This would be without a doubt a political response, and was an opportunity open to him. Or did he begin his call from the starting point adopted by his noble forefathers, and at the head of them Ibraaheem, the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah and the <em>Imaam</em> of the call to <em>tawheed</em>; which was the starting point for all the Messengers of Allaah? There is no doubt that the single way of correction and rectification in every time and place is the way of calling to correct <em>‘aqeedah</em> and <em>tawheed</em> and that all worship should be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore Yoosuf began from this starting point, following his noble fathers, proud of their <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and deriding and exposing the foolishness of the idolaters and their practice of taking idols, cattle and stars as lords to be worshipped besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after clearly explaining this, and openly calling to <em>tawheed</em> and to rejection of <em>shirk</em>, he emphasised his call and his argument by his saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Authority and command is for Allaah alone.”</strong>[3], [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he explained this authority and command to mean the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and that He alone is to be worshipped:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“&#8230;That is the Straight and true reigion, yet most of the people do not know (and are people of <em>shirk)</em>.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>attained the highest position in this state[6] whilst calling to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and establishing the clear proofs for his call and his Prophethood. Allaah, the Most High, says, in explanation of this,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The king of Egypt said, ‘Bring him to me, I will make him my personal servant.’ So when he spoke to Yoosuf, he said, ‘Verily, this day you have with us a position of rank and full trust.’ He said, ‘Place me in charge of the storehouses and wealth of the land, indeed I will guard them faithfully and with full knowledge.’”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said, giving thanks to his Lord and Protector,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O my Lord, You have bestowed upon me something of dominion and have taught me the interpretation of dreams. O Originator and Creator of the heavens and the earth, You are my Lord and Protector in this world and the Hereafter. Cause me to die as a Muslim and join me with the righteous.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore Allaah says in explanation of his <em>da’wah</em>, upon the tongue of the Believer from the family of the Pharaoh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And Yoosuf came to you previously (before Moosaa) with clear signs yet you have not ceased doubting about what he came to you with. Until when he died you said, ‘Allaah will not send any Messenger after him.’ This is the state of those whom Allaah leads astray, those who are disbelievers in Him and doubt the truthfulness of the Messengers.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from the knowledge to be learned from the life-story of Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>which is presented to us in those noble <em>Aayaat</em> is that the call to <em>tawheed</em> is something very essential. Furthermore there is to be no leniency or relaxation in fighting against <em>shirk</em>, it is not permissible to keep silent about it, whatever the circumstances of the caller to Allaah; rather it is not permissible for any Muslim to ever accept it or be relaxed about it. So this shows the high station of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and its importance with Allaah, and with His Prophets and His Messenger. It also shows the very great difference and the distance between it and the details of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for the Muslim, particularly the caller, to take up any position which violates his <em>‘aqeedah</em> or is contrary to it, or that he is a fortune-teller, those who are <em>Mushriks</em>, or that he is a custodian of their idols. If he does any of this then he is one of the misguided <em>Mushriks.</em> With regard to the legislative aspect, if the Islamic state is established, it must apply the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah, otherwise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the ones guilty of unbelief.”</strong>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The unbelief (<em>kufr</em>) here is explained in detail by the scholars of Islaam, from the Companions and others, that it may be major <em>Kufr</em>, when the person disdains the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah and declares it lawful to judge by something else, and it may be lesser <em>Kufr</em> (i.e., that which does not take a person out of Islaam) when he does not declare it lawful to judge by other than it, but gives in to his desires and because of that judges by other than what Allaah sent down.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However when the Islamic state has not been established, then Allaah does not a burden a soul with more than it is capable of. So the Muslim may take up a position in a non-Muslim state with the condition that he establishes justice, and that he does not obey them ina matter which involves disobedience to Allaah, and does not judge by other than what Allaah sent down. This was what the Prophet of Allaah, Yoosuf, did. He took up a position as a deputy for a unbelieving king, and he did not judge according to his laws:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He could not have taken and kept his brother according to the king’s law.”</strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, he established justice between the subjects and called them to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah. So this contains a decisive reply to those who give little importance to the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>Tahweed</em>. Those who gloss over and accomodate when it comes to the <em>shirk</em> which has filled the world, and they regard the callers to <em>tawheed</em> and the enemies of <em>shirk</em> with contempt and scorn. They turn up their noses and are too proud to ‘lower’ themselves to the level of the callers to <em>tawheed</em>, and they are very wily and astute concerning political affairs, but nothing is more burdensome and disagreeable to their hearing and their hearts than listening to or saying a word regarding <em>tawheed</em> or <em>shirk.</em> These types of callers have caused themselves to fall into a deep abyss, whilst they think that they have reached the highest peaks. Can a people ever prosper whose stance with regard to the call of the Prophets is like this, unless they sincerely repent to Allaah from what they are upon?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] As indicated in the <em>hadeeth</em> of Ibn ’Umar, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhumaa, </em>from the Prophet (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) that he said, “<strong>The noble one, son of the noble one, son of the noble one: Yoosuf the son of Ya’qoob, the son of Ishaaq, the son of Ibraaheem, </strong><em><strong>’alayhis-salaam.</strong>” </em>Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 4/390/596), and Ahmad in <em>al-Musnad</em> (2/96), and also the <em>hadeeth</em> of Aboo Hurairah, <em>radiyallaahu ’anhu, </em>that Allaah’s Messenger (sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) was asked about the noblest of the people, so he said, <em>“Those most pious and obedient to Allaah.” They said, “It is not this that we are asking about.” He said, “Then the noblest of the people is Yoosuf, the Prophet of Allaah, son of the Prophet of Allaah, son of the Prophet of Allaah, son of the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah.” They said, “It is not this that we are asking about.” He said, “Then is it about the origins of the Arabs that you ask? Then the people are of various origins. The best of them in the times of ignorance are the best of them in Islaam when they attain knowledge and understanding in the religion.”</em> Reported by al-Bukhaaree (Eng. trans. 4/390/597).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Soorah Yoosuf (12):40.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] This <em>Aayah</em> is one of the basic principles from the principles of <em>tawheed</em>, as Allaah has explained upon the tongue of Yoosuf, <em>’alayhis-salaam. </em>What is most unfortunate is that you see that many of the political reformers have explained it in a way that is far removed from its primary meaning, that all worship is to be made purely and sincerely for Allaah alone, and have instead explained it to have a political meaning, which is establishment of the state which they claim will establish Allaah’s <em>Sharee’ah</em> upon the earth as His deputies/vicegerents. Then they go beyond bounds in this direction till they cause the people to forget the principal meaning of the <em>Aayah</em>, and they understand nothing from it except this new meaning, and there is no action and no ability except by the will of Allaah. They do the same with all or most of the <em>Aayaat</em> of <em>tawheed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Soorah Yoosuf (12):40.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>rahimahullaah, </em>said in <em>al-Hisbah</em> (p.7), “Likewise Yoosuf the truthful and honest, was a minister for the Pharaoh of Egypt, and he and his people were <em>mushriks</em>. So Yoosuf performed whatever justice and good he was able to and called them as far as possible to correct <em>eemaan</em>.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibraaheem</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Father of the Prophets and the Leader of those who worship Allaah alone, upon the true religion, Ibraaheem, the Chosen and Beloved Friend of Allaah (<em>Khaleelullaah</em>), who was such that Allaah ordered the best of the Messengers and the final Prophet, and his <em>ummah</em>, to emulate him, to take his call as an example, and to follow his way and methodolgy.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And remember when Ibraaheem said to his father Aazar, ‘Will you take idols for worship? Indeed I see that you and those who worship idols along with you are upon clear error.’ Likewise We showed Ibraaheem the heavens and the earth (and how they are a proof that the Creator alone should be worshipped), so that he should be one of those who have Faith with certainty. So when the night covered him with darkness he saw a star and said, (as an argument to show his people the error of worshipping anything besides Allaah), ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?!’ Then when it set, he said, ‘I do not love that which passes away.’ Then when he saw the moon rising up he said, ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?!’ Then when it set he said, ‘If my Lord did not keep me firm upon the guidance then I would surely be one of the misguided.’ Then when he saw the sun, he said, ‘This is (what you claim to be) my Lord?! This is greater than the others.’ Then when it set he said, ‘O my people, I am free from all that you associate as partners in worship with Allaah. Indeed I have turned my face in worship to Him who has created the heavens and the earth, making all worship purely for Him, and I am not from those who worship anything besides Allaah.’”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was a fervent, vigorous and incessant call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to make all of religion purely for Him, and to the elimination and rejection of <em>shirk</em>. It begins with the family and extends to the nations, waging war upon <em>shirk</em> and the idols and shaking the very foundations of attribution of any worship to the stars. So the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah proceeded upon the soundest way in debating and arguing in order to establish Allaah’s Proof and to refute <em>shirk</em> and to show its fallacy and reject the doubts used to support it. So his use of the word ‘idols’ shows contempt for their phoney and supposed gods, and an exposure of their foolishness. He observed the aforementioned celestial bodies one after the other, each one succeeded the previous one which set and became absent, in order to use their condition as a clear proof of the fallacy of their having any divinty or right to worship as his people claimed. Who was it who protected and guarded them and controlled their affairs and the affairs of the creation when they passed and set?! Therefore they must reject the false divinity and right to worship which they claimed for them and disbelieve in that. It was upon them to wash their hands of them and turn instead to their true God, He Who created and brought into existence the heavens and the earth. He Who does not pass away or depart. He Who knows all about their condition and is fully aware of all their movements and periods of rest. He Who protects and preserves them and controls their affairs. They were strong proofs extracted from the situation they experienced and the visible creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And recite to your people from the Book (the Qur’aan), O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , about Ibraaheem. He was one who was fully truthful and one sent as a Prophet by Allaah. When he said to his father, ‘Why do you worship that which cannot hear, nor see, nor benefit you, nor remove any harm from you at all?! O my father, Allaah has given me knowledge which has not come to you, so accept the sincere advice I give you, and I will show you the Straight Way, upon which you will not go astray. O my father, do not worship Satan (by obeying him in his call for you to worship the idols) &#8211; indeed Satan is one disobedient to the Most Merciful (Allaah). O my father, I fear for you, knowing that if you die upon attribution of partners to Allaah in worship, and upon worship of Satan, that Allaah’s punishment and torment will be upon you, and that you will merely be a companion of Satan in the Hell-fire.’ He replied, ‘Do you reject my gods, O Ibraaheem? If you do not cease abusing and reviling them I will certainly revile you. Go away from me if you wish to remain safe from me.’ Ibraaheem said, ‘But you are safe from me harming you, I will rather ask my Lord to guide you and forgive your sins. He has always been most Gracious and Kind to me. I shall keep away from you and all that you worship besides Allaah, and I will worship and invoke my Lord, making all of worship purely for Him. I hope that I shall not be one unblest in my worship and supplications.’ So when he separated himself from them and all that they worshipped besides Allaah, We gave him a family who were better than them, Ishaaq and Ya&#8217;qoob, and we made all of them Prophets, and we bestowed our mercy upon them all, and granted them renown and praise upon the tongues of the people.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this was a fervent call to <em>tawheed</em>, established firmly upon knowledge, reason and intellect, and upon good and sound manners. Guiding the misguided to the Straight Path. It was opposed by blind bigotry and partisanship, based upon desires, ignorance, stubborness and obsinate pride: otherwise how could anyone worship and humble themselves to those who cannot hear, nor see, nor help them in any way?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the knowledge of <em>tawheed</em>, O reader, is that knowledge which all the Prophets were honoured with, and with it they assaulted falsehood, ignorance and shirk. So ignorance of this knowledge, the knowledge carried by the Prophets, which guides to the truth and saves from misguidance and shirk, ignorance of this is fatal and is a deadly poison which kills the intellect and the ability to think.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O my Father, Allaah has given me knowledge which has not come to you, accept the sincere advice which I give to you, and I will show you the Straight Way, upon which you will not go astray.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after these robust efforts in <em>da’wah</em> expended by Ibraaheem in calling to Allaah, calling the family and the nation, establishing the irrefutable proofs upon his father and his people, after this he took this great call and confronted that haughty and tyrannical ruler who claimed divinity, he faced him with the full strength and bravery. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Do you not consider the one (Namrood) who, because Allaah had granted him an extended kingdom disputed with Ibraaheem about his Lord. Ibraaheem said to him, ‘It is my Lord (Allaah) Who gives life and death.’ He said, ‘I give life and cause death.’ Ibraaheem said, ‘Allaah causes the sun to rise from the east, so if you are truthful then cause it to rise from the west.’ So the unbeliever was confounded, and Allaah does not guide the unbelievers to find proof against the people of truth.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ibraaheem called this tyrant and claimant to divinity to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to <em>eemaan</em> in His Lordship. But he exceeded all bounds in his arrogance and haughtily refused to accept the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to give up on his claims to Lordship. So Ibraaheem debated with him in this brilliant manner whose proof was clear. Ibraaheem said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“It is my Lord (Allaah) Who gives life and death.”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the stupid tyrant replied that he too could give life and death &#8211; meaning that he killed whom he pleased and spared whom he pleased. This answer of his was merely a pretence and a means of fooling the ignorant, and was a way of avoiding the question, since what Ibraaheem referred to was the fact that his Lord created mankind, animals and plants and gave them life, and brought them into existence from nothing. Then He causes them to die with His Power, and that He gives the humans and animals death at the end of their appointed life-spans, due to visible causes which He shows and without visible causes. So when Ibraaheem saw that he tried to create a pretence to evade the issue, which might fool some of the ignorant and common folk, he then said, as a means of showing the futility of what his saying entailed, that if you are as you claim, then,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“‘Allaah causes the sun to rise from the east, so if you are truthful then cause it to rise from the west.’ So the unbeliever was confounded.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the unbeliever was left confounded and at a loss for words. His argument was overthrown, he was silenced, struck dumb and falsehood was rendered futile as is always the case. So this contains a lesson for those who listen attentively and witness it, that the call to <em>tawheed</em> represents the peak of sincerity, wisdom and intelligence; it proceeds in the due and correct manner, and as Allaah has willed, not merely struggling for kingship, nor seeking to fight for leadership.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the goal of Ibraaheem had been to attain rulership and authority he would have taken a different methodology to this, and he would have found people who gathered around him and supported him. But Allaah refuses, and His Prophets and the pious callers from the true followers of the Prophets in every time and place, they all refuse except to follow the way of guidance and truth, and to clearly proclaim the truth and to establish the proof against the proud and obstinate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ibraaheem established this great obligation in the best and most complete manner. He established the proof upon his father and his people, upon those who governed them and upon all of his nation. Then when he saw that they were persisting in their <em>shirk</em> and their unbelief and were established upon falsehood and misguidance, he resorted to censure and correction by means of the hand and use of strength. So where did his change and correction begin, and what was the correct and rightly guided means for correction of the dire situation which had beset his nation? Did he seek to overthrow the state because it was the root of all the evils and corruption and the source of <em>shirk</em> and misguidance?! How can that be denied when the ruler claimed lordship for himself and persisted in that claim? So why did Ibraaheem not consider a revolution against this unbelieving government, and at the head of it a tyrant who claimed divinity, and by so doing wipe out all the forms of corruption and <em>shirk</em>, and establish in its place the divinely-guided state headed by Ibraaheem, ’<em>alayhis-salaatu was-salaam</em>?! The answer is the Prophets were far removed from following any such way or even considering it, since this is the way of the oppressors, the ignorant and the foolish, those who seek after this world and strive for authority in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the Prophets were callers to <em>tawheed</em> and pioneers guiding to the truth, and seeking to save the people from falsehood and <em>shirk</em>. So when they applied themselves to correction and changing the state of affairs, and they were the most knowledgeable and intelligent of the people, then they necessarily began with striking at the true sources of <em>shirk</em> and misguidance. This is what Ibraaheem, the mild, wise and rightly guided, the heroic and brave, did. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We guided Ibraaheem to the truth at a young age before the time of Moosaa and Haaroon, and We knew that he was fitting for that and was a person of true and certain <em>eemaan</em> who would worship Allaah alone and not associate any partner with Him. When he said to his father and his people, ‘What are these idols which you worship and are devoted to?!’ They said, ‘We found our fathers worshipping them and have followed them in that.’ He said, ‘Both you and they in worshipping the idols are in clear error.’ They said, ‘Are you serious in your saying that you have come with the truth, or are you merely being frivolous?’ He said, ‘Rather, I bring you the truth. Your Lord, other than Whom none has the right to be worshipped, is the sole Lord and Creator of the heavens and the earth, He Who created you all, not any of the idols to which you are devoted. I am a witness to the fact that none but Him is deserving of your worship.’ Ibraaheem said in secret (but was overheard by a single man from his people), ‘By Allaah, I intend to destroy their idols when they go off to their festival.’ So he broke them to pieces except for the largest of them (upon which he tied the axe with which he had broken the others), so that they might take heed and abandon worship of their idols after witnessing their weakness and futility. The people said, ‘Who has done this to our gods?! Whoever has done it is certainly a criminal.’ Those who had heard the saying of Ibraaheem said, ‘We heard a youth speaking, he is called Ibraaheem.’ They said, ‘Bring him before the eyes of the people, that they may testify against him.’ They said, ‘Is it you who did this to our gods, O Ibraaheem?’ He said, ‘Rather this one, the largest of them did it. Ask the idols who had it done to them, if it is that they can speak.’ So they turned to themsleves and said, ‘You know that they are unable to speak.’ He said, ‘Then will you worship besides Allaah that which cannot benefit you at all, nor harm you. Woe to you and the idols which you worship besides Allaah. Have you no sense to see the futility of your worship of the idols?’ They said, ‘Burn him and aid your gods, if you do indeed wish to aid them and continue to worship them.’ We said, ‘O fire, be cool and safe for Ibraaheem.’ They wished to cause harm to him, but it was they whom We caused to be the losers.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah guided Ibraaheem to the truth knowing that he was fitting for that. This wise and rightly-guided Prophet faced corruptions in beliefs (<em>’aqeedah</em>) and corruption in rule and authority. A nation whose thinking was degenerate, people whose minds were astray, so that they worshipped idols in the form of pieces of wood, rocks and stars. They were also ruled by a corrupt and evil government lead by a tyrant who claimed divinity, yet the people submitted to his leadership. So where was Ibraaheem to begin his correction? Should he have begun by attacking the ruler, since for certain he had ruled by other than the revelaed Law of Allaah and ruled by the laws of ignorance. There is no doubt about that. He also openly claimed Lordship and the right to make and lay down the law. Or should he have begun with correction of beliefs (<em>‘aqeedah</em>). Correcting the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of the nation and the <em>‘aqeedah </em>of the government of ignorance?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur’aan informs us that this rightly-guided Prophet, the <em>Imaam</em> of the Prophets, began with correction of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, that is the call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to make all worship purely and sincerely for Him alone, and fighting and wiping out <em>shirk</em>, and demolishing its causes, and tearing it out from the roots. So that is what he did: he called them to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah, and to renounce the worship of everything besides Him. He argued with them about this matter and they argued with him. But he refuted them with powerful arguments and clear proofs, and he stripped them of everything they sought to use as a proof until they admitted their wrongdoing, misguidance, and their blind-following and stubborn and fatal acceptance of the ways of their forefathers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘We found our fathers worshipping them and have followed them in that.’”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Ibraaheem saw obstinate following of desires and intellects as hard as rock, he made a wise and brave plan to destroy their idols. He carried out this plan with full vigour, bravery and courage. Then this heroic act[10] incited the government and the nation against him, and they called him for judgement in public and laid down the charge before him,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Is it you who did this to our gods, O Ibraaheem?”</strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he responded to them in a mocking and sarcastic manner,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Rather this one, the largest of them did it. Ask the idols who had it done to them, if it is that they can speak.”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this mocking reply was like a thunder-bolt striking their imbecilic minds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Then they relapsed and said, ‘You know that they are unable to speak.’”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he had divested them of the weapon of argument, they resorted to using force, the weapon used by everyone lacking proof in every time and place,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘Burn him and aid your gods, if you do indeed wish to aid them and continue to worship them.’”</strong>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But Allaah saved His chosen and beloved friend, Ibraaheem, and He threw back the plot of the unbelievers upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We said, ‘O fire, be cool and safe for Ibraaheem.’ They wished to cause harm to him, but it was they whom we caused to be the losers.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the fact that Ibraaheem was saved from harm in that huge fire, which Allaah caused to become cool and safe for Ibraaheem, was a very great sign, indeed one of the greatest of Allaah’s signs proving his Prophet hood, his truthfulness, and the correctness of what he came with, i.e., <em>tawheed</em> and the declaration of the fultility of the <em>shirk</em> and misguidance which his people were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah rewarded Ibraaheem, <em>’alayhis-salaam, </em>for this wise <em>da’wah</em>, and this outstanding <em>jihaad</em> and sacrifice,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We saved Ibraaheem and Loot from their enemies and took them to the land which We have blessed for all the worlds. And We bestowed upon him Ishaaq (his son) and Ya&#8217;qoob (his grandson) as an extra favour upon him. And We made all of them those who acted in obedience to Allaah and avoided what He forbade. And We made them leaders to be followed, guiding the people according to Our orders and calling them to worship and obey Allaah. And We inspired in them the doing of those deeds which are good, and establishment of the Prayer, and payment of the <em>Zakaat</em>. And they were worshippers of Us alone.”</strong>[16]</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] As indicated by the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Then We revealed to you, O Muhammad (*), that you should follow the religion of Ibraaheem who was a Muslim upon the true religion and was not one of those who worshipped idols and associated partners with Allaah.”</strong> [Soorah an-Nahl (16):123].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, O Muhammad (*): Allaah has indeed spoken the Truth, so follow the religion of Ibraaheem who was upright, upon the religion of Islaam, and he did not make any share of his worship for any created being.”</strong> [Soorah Aal-’Imraan (3):95].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Soorah al-An’aam (6):74-79.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Soorah Maryam (19):41-50.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Soorah Maryam (19):43.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Soorah al-Ambiyaa (21):51-70.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Soorah al-Ambiyaa (21):53.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] The great heroic action and the wise call to <em>tawheed</em> and to the elimination of <em>shirk</em>, is counted by many of the callers to correction these days as being an example of preoccupying onesself with minor and insignificant matters. And there is no action nor power except by the will of Allaah. Indeed it is not the eyes that are blind, but rather the hearts. They think that <em>da’wah</em> must begin with a call to the correction and rectification of rulership and government, not correction of <em>’aqeedah</em>. In this view Ibraaheem and all the other Prophets were in error with regard to the correct methodology of <em>da’wah</em>. (al-Fawzaan).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Nooh (عليه السلام)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nooh was the second father of all mankind, and the first of the Messengers (<em>Rusul</em>) to the people of the Earth. This great Prophet lived a very long life: he called his people for nine hundred and fifty years to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to making all worship purely for Him. He did not become weary of this, nor lose interest. He called them night and day, in private and in the open. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed We sent Nooh as a Messenger to his people ordering him to warn his people before a painful punishment should come to them. He said, ‘O my People, I am a plain and clear warner to you, that you should worship Allaah alone, avoid disobedience to Him and obey me. If you do so He will forgive you your sins and grant you respite until an appointed term. Indeed when the term decreed by Allaah comes it cannot be delayed, and if you knew you would submit to and obey your Lord.’ Nooh said, ‘O my Lord, I have called my people day and night to worship You alone and warned them of Your punishment but my calling them to the truth only results in them turning away from it.</strong>[1]<strong> Whenever I call them to worship You alone and to obey You, and to disassociate themselves from the worship of everything but You, so that You may forgive them, they thrust their fingers in their ears and cover themselves up with their garments, so as not to hear. Then they persist in their disbelief and arrogantly and obstinately refuse to follow and submit to the truth. Then I called them loudly and openly, and I called them individually and privately. I said to them, ‘Ask your Lord to forgive your sins and repent to your Lord from your unbelief and association of others in worship with Him, and make your worship sincerely and purely for Him, then He will forgive you, indeed He greatly forgives those who turn to Him in repentance and seek His forgiveness. He will then send you rain in abundance, and grant you increase in wealth and children, and provide you with gardens and rivers. What is wrong with you that you do not have awe and fear of Allaah, when it is He that created you in successive stages? Do you not see how Allaah has created the seven heavens one above the other, and has placed the moon therein as a light and has made the sun a lamp? Allaah it is who created you and brought you from the earth, and He it is who will return you to it, and then resurrect you from it. Allaah &#8211; it is Who spread out the earth for you, so that you may travel about upon wide roads.’’ Nooh said, ‘O my Lord, they have rejected my call and opposed it, and have instead followed the call of those whose wealth and children only increase them in error and take them further away from their Lord. Furthermore the leaders have plotted a mighty plot, and they have said, “Do not abandon your gods. Do not abandon <em>Wadd</em>, nor <em>Suwaa</em>, nor <em>Yaghooth</em>, nor <em>Ya&#8217;ooq</em>, nor <em>Nasr</em>.” Indeed many have gone astray due to the idols. O Allaah, grant no increase to the transgressors except in error.</strong>[2]<strong> Due to their sins they were drowned in the Flood and entered into the Fire, and they could find no one to save them from Allaah’s punishment.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what did the <em>da’wah</em> of this noble Messenger comprise of, and Allaah has told us the summary of his noble <em>da’wah</em> which continued for nine hundred and fifty years?! Indeed it was an earnest and painstaking call to the <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah and to make all worship purely for Him. It was a tireless effort and he used every possible means available to him to convince them of his call. He called them privately and individually, and he called them openly. He encouraged them and warned them, informing them of the promise of good for the obedient, and evil for the disobedient. He gave them practical and intellectual proofs, from themselves and their lives, and what they saw before them with regards to the heavens and the earth, and the clear signs and lessons contained in them. All of this failed to benefit them and did not cause them to accept. Rather they persisted in their disbelief and error, and they rejected all this obstinately and arrogantly. They persisted in their adherence to the idols and false and futile objects of worship. So the result of this persistence and obstinancy was destruction and annihilation in this world, and everlasting torment in the Hell-fire in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this point we may ask: why did this great Prophet continue for such an extremely long period of time, expending huge efforts, untiringly and without languidness, calling to the starting point of <em>tawheed</em>?! Why did Allaah praise him so highly, and cause him to be remembered, and make him one of those Messengers who were the firmest of all in their determination (<em>oolul-&#8216;adhm</em>)? Does the call to <em>tawheed</em> deserve all this esteem? Is this methodology an establishment of this procedure for this noble Prophet in opposition to logic, wisdom and intellect? Or is it pure and certain wisdom, and what is demanded by correct logic and sound and perceptive intellect? Why did Allaah approve of following this methodology in <em>da’wah</em> for 950 years, and commend him, and cause his name and his story to endure, and impose it as a duty upon the greatest of the Messengers and the one having the greatest intellect of all the people, that he should take him as an example to follow in his <em>da’wah</em> and his perseverance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The just answer, established upon intellect and wisdom, and upon understanding the status and position of Prophet hood, and having the greatest trust in it and giving it its due respect, is that the call to <em>tawheed</em> and striving to wipe out <em>shirk</em> and to purify the earth from it, does indeed deserve all of this. It is indeed wisdom itself and is demanded by natural inclination and intellect. It is furthermore, a binding obligation upon every caller to Allaah that they understand this methodology, this great and divinely inspired <em>da’wah</em> and great goal, and that they devote all their effort and energy to its attainment and its being propagated throughout all of Allaah’s earth. Furthermore that they work together, cooperate and unite, and sincerely attest to each others’ truthfulness. Just as the Messengers, the callers to <em>tawheed</em>, were: the earlier ones telling of the coming of the later ones and the later ones attesting to the truthfulness of the previous ones and promoting their call, and following the same way. It is also binding upon us to believe that if there was any other methodology better and more correct than this methodology, that Allaah would have chosen that for His Messengers and would have favoured them with it. So is it fitting for any Believer to turn away from it and choose a different methodology for himself, and to arrogantly seek to attack this divinely laid down methodology and its callers?!</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[1] At-Tabaree reports from Qataadah, “It has reached us that a man would take his son to Nooh and say to his son, ‘Beware of this man, don&#8217;t let him lead you astray, for I remember when I was your age, my father brought me to him and warned me against him just as I am warning you.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[2] This supplication of Nooh against them came after he was informed by Allaah that they were not going to be Believers, as explained by al-Baghawee.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">FOREWORD</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on His Messenger. This book you have before you is a translation of a small pamphlet that was prepared, printed and distributed by Maktabah Al-Idreesee from San&#8217;aa, Yemen concerning &#8220;<em>The Scholars&#8217; Praise for Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise was also made available over the Internet as a downloadable file in such sites as rabee.net and alsalafia.com. This is where we obtained our source for this current translation. So we encourage all readers who wish to access the Arabic source for this book to go to the above mentioned web sites and download the file called &#8220;<em>Shifaa-ul-&#8216;Aleel fee Thanaa-il-&#8216;Ulamaa &#8216;alaa Ash-Shaikh Rabee</em>&#8216;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were many reasons for selecting this current book for translation and publishing. <strong>The first and most important</strong> of them was to allow the Muslims to become acquainted with who the scholars of our time are and to get a first hand look at how the scholars of Ahl-us-Sunnah praise and commend one another. <strong>Secondly</strong>, in recent times there have been big debates amongst the Muslims, especially those of them who adhere to the way of the Salaf, on certain issues concerning this noble Shaikh. We felt that this is largely due to their being unaware of who Shaikh Rabee&#8217; is and what the scholars have said about him. Shaikh Rabee&#8217;, as indicated by Shaikh AlAlbaanee, is in our current times, the leading personality in the field of Al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel (i.e. declaring who is reliable, trustworthy and upon the correct way from those who are unreliable and on a deviant way). At times, this field requires those specialized in it to speak about certain popular and renowned figures in order to clarify their mistakes or expose their deviations. So no doubt, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; has spoken against some callers and teachers in the Muslim world that are esteemed by many. But this was only part of his sincere advice, as he was fulfilling his duty of clarifying to the ummah the mistakes of certain people so that the Muslims will not follow them in that. But unfortunately the result of this at times is that the Muslims do not readily accept from him and question his authority, and even go further and ridicule and belittle him. So we felt that it was important, especially amidst the rumors and lies being spread about this noble scholar, to present our Muslim readers with the present treatise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, we ask Allaah to reward all those brothers in charge of putting the book together in its Arabic form, namely the brothers in Yemen. They have also included several footnotes, which add clarification to certain issues and they have categorized the treatise into easy to read and access sections. So may Allaah reward them with the best of rewards and may He make this treatise a source for strengthening and putting light to this blessed da&#8217;wah of the Way of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Written by abu maryam isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, all praise is due to Allaah, we praise Him, we seek His assistance and we ask for His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Him from the evils of our souls and the evils of our actions. Whoever Allaah guides, no one can lead him astray and whoever is caused to go astray, there is no one that can guide him. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah &#8211; alone with no partners. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe, fear Allaah as He ought to be feared and do not die except while you are Muslims.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O mankind, fear Allaah who created you from a single soul (Adam) and from that, He created its mate (Eve). And from them He brought forth many men and women. And fear Allaah to whom you demand your mutual rights. Verily, Allaah is an ever AllWatcher over you.&#8221;</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe, fear Allaah and speak a word that is truthful (and to the point) &#8211; He will rectify your deeds and forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger has achieved a great success.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 70-71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the best of speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. And the worst of matters are those that are newly invented, for every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is a misguidance and every misguidance is in the Hellfire. To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah had indeed promised us that He would protect His Religion and that He would preserve His Book and His Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, We have revealed the Dhikr (Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah) and surely We will preserve it.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hijr: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Allaah&#8217;s way of preserving His Religion &#8211; as well as His mercy for His servants &#8211; is that He has prepared for it men who will continue to pass it down to those that come after them, in its pure and unadulterated form, free from any defects. These are the individuals who recorded the Knowledge and the Religion in books while preserving that in their hearts &#8211; not growing weak or tired of doing that until they reached their graves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people are the scholars &#8211; the adherents to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Hadeeth and the inheritors of the Prophets, who defend Allaah&#8217;s Religion and fight to clarify His Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has given the scholars a high and lofty position in Islaam, as well as an honorable rank amongst mankind, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah will raise those who believe amongst you and who have been given knowledge, many levels.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Say: Are those who have knowledge equal to those who do not have knowledge?&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Mujaadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has commanded us to refer our questions to them and to turn back to their sayings. And He made that like a certification on their part, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And We have not sent before you except men whom We gave revelation to. So ask the people of dhikr (remembrance, i.e. knowledge) if you don’t know.&#8221;</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of dhikr are the scholars &#8211; those who have knowledge of what Allaah revealed to His prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ad-Dardaa, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu, reported:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, say: &#8216;Whoever treads a path, by which he seeks knowledge, Allaah will pave a way for him to Paradise because of it. Verily, the angels lower their wings out of contentment for the seeker of knowledge. And indeed, everything in the heavens and in the earth &#8211; even the fish in the sea &#8211; asks forgiveness (from Allaah) for the scholar. The virtue of the scholar over the worshipper is like the virtue of the moon over all the stars. Truly, the scholars are the inheritors of the prophets. And indeed the prophets do not leave behind any deenar or dirham (currency) for inheritance, but rather they only leave behind knowledge as inheritance. So whoever takes hold of it, then he has taken hold of an abundant share (of inheritance).'&#8221;</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ayaat, ahaadeeth and athaar (narrations from the Salaf) concerning their high virtue are many. So they have the greatest share and the loftiest portion in terms of virtue and status. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Brother, listen to the great words of the Imaam of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah, Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, when he spoke on the characteristics of the scholars and their effect on the people and the people&#8217;s effect on them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#3366ff;">&#8220;All praise be to Allaah who placed in every era, after the period of the messengers, remnants from the people of knowledge, who call those who deviated to guidance and who have patience with their harm. And with the Book of Allaah, they revive the dead and with the light of Allaah, they cause the blind to see. So how many people, whom the Devil has killed, have they revived? And how many people, who were lost and astray have they guided? So what a great effect do they have upon the people! And what an ugly effect do the people have on them! They (i.e. the scholars) take away from the Book of Allaah, the distortions of the extremists, the false claims of the liars and the wrong interpretations of the ignorant &#8211; those who hold high the banners of innovation and unleash the outbreaks of mischief (fitnah). So they are in disagreement with the Qur&#8217;aan, they are in opposition to the Qur&#8217;aan and they unanimously agree with one another to withdraw themselves from the Qur&#8217;aan. They say things about Allaah and about the Book of Allaah without knowledge. They talk about the ambiguous matters in speech and they deceive the ignorant people on matters that are obscure to them. We seek refuge in Allaah from the fitan (trials) of the misguided ones.&#8221;</span> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So look at the biographies of the noble and distinguished Scholars and Muhadditheen throughout the history and generations, from the time of the righteous Sahaabah and their Successors (Taabi&#8217;een), then those that came after them from the eminent Imaams, to this current day of ours. You will find that they sacrificed their lives, their wealth and their time for the sake of being sincere to Allaah, His Book, His Messenger, the Muslim leaders and their common folk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the right that these scholars possess over others is that they (the people) do not mention them except with goodness. And whoever mentions them in an evil way, then he is on other than the Correct Path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is from the principles of Ahl-us-Sunnah and from the requirements of their beliefs, that it is an obligation to love the People of the Sunnah, to praise and speak highly of them and to not criticize them. This is such that the Salaf, may Allaah have mercy on them, considered the criticizing of Ahl-us-Sunnah and those who defend the Sunnah to be from the signs of the people of innovation and misguidance. In fact, they would consider a person to be from the people of innovation by just him criticizing the scholars (alone).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, rahimahullaah, said: <strong>&#8220;If you see a man slander Hamaad Ibn Salamah then have doubt about his Islaam, for indeed he (Hamaad) was harsh against the innovators.&#8221;</strong> [AsSiyar (7/447)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Zur&#8217;ah, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you see a man from Koofah speak vilely about Sufyaan Ath-Thawree and Zaa&#8217;idah, then no doubt he is a Raafidee. And if you see a person from Shaam speak vilely about Mak-hool and AlAwzaa&#8217;ee, then no doubt he is a Naasibee. And if you see a person from Khurasaan speak vilely about &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Al-Mubaraak, then no doubt he is a Murji&#8217;ee. And know that all of these groups are united in their hatred for Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, because there is no one amongst them except that he has in his heart an arrow (ready) for him, which cannot be recovered from.&#8221; [Tabaqaat-ul-Hanaabilah (1/199-200)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Na&#8217;eem Ibn Hamaad, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you see a man from Iraq speak (badly) about Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, then have doubt about his Religion. And if you see a person from Basrah speak (badly) about Wahb Ibn Jareer, then have doubt about his Religion. And if you see a man from Khurasaan speak (badly) about Ishaaq Ibn Raahawaih, then have doubt about his Religion.&#8221; [Taareekh Baghdad (6/438) and Taareekh Dimashq (8/132)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ja&#8217;far Ibn Muhammad Ibn Haaroon Al-Mukhramee, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you see a man attacking Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, then know that he is an innovator, a deviant.&#8221; [Taqdimah Al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel (pg. 308-309) and Taareekh Dimashq (5/294)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Haatim Ar-Raazee, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you see a person from Rayy or anyone else hating Abu Zur&#8217;ah, then know that he is an innovator.&#8221; [Taareekh Baghdad (10/329) and Taareekh Dimashq (38/31)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Haatim, rahimahullaah, also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>A sign of the people of innovation is their battling against the people of Narrations</strong>.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee (1/179)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu &#8216;Uthmaan As-Saaboonee, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The signs of the people of innovation are clear and obvious. The most apparent of their signs is their severe enmity for those who carry the reports of the Prophet.&#8221;</strong> [&#8216;Aqeedat-us-Salaf (pg. 101)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Safaareenee, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And we are not focusing on mentioning the virtues of the people of Hadeeth, for indeed their virtues are well known and their merits are many. So whoever belittles them, then he is despicable and lowly. And whoever hates them, then he is from the backward party of the Devil.&#8221; [Lawaa&#8217;ih-ul-Anwaar (2/355)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among these distinguished scholars and eminent Mujaahideen is the Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, Abu Muhammad Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee &#8216;Umair Al-Madkhalee, may Allaah continue to let him remain in defense of His Religion and cause us to benefit from this prolonging of his life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah preserve him, has truly worked hard to clarify the Sunnah, and he has struggled intensely to explain what the Correct Way is. All of this is from his sincerity to Allaah, His Book, His Messenger, the Muslims leaders and their common folk. So how many confused people did he cause to see, and how many people who went astray did he direct to the way of guidance? So we ask Allaah to grant him the best reward for what he has done on behalf of Islaam and the Muslims. And we ask Allaah to place him, as well as us, in the company of the prophets, the siddeeqeen (those who believed in the prophets), the martyrs, and the righteous &#8211; and what a great company they are.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there is no doubt that for every good blessing that exists (for someone) there is someone envious of it, and for every truth, there is someone who rejects or denies it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-Lateef Aali Shaikh, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;From the natural habit of the people of innovation is that when they are broke of possessing any proofs and the avenues (of arguing) have become constricted for them, they cast faults and blemishes on the Ahl-us-Sunnah and criticize them, while praising themselves.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Raafidah (group) met their ruin at the hands of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions, and so did the people of the Great Slander (against &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah). And likewise, Ahmad Ibn Abee Duwaad and others from the Mu&#8217;tazilah met their destruction with Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. And Ibn Makhloof AlMaalikee met his ruin at the hands of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah. As-Subkee met his ruin at the hands of Al-Haafidh Adh-Dhahabee and so did Ibn Dihlaan and his followers from the Sufis at the hands of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab, as well as all the other followers of the Shaytaan who met their fate at the hands of the followers of Ar-Rahmaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this was due to Allaah testing His servants from Ahl-us-Sunnah to know who the truthful and believing ones were from the lying and hypocritical. And it was so Allaah could increase the reward of these servants of His, due to the criticism they receive from those who are astray and lead others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to clarify the truth and to advise the ummah, we decided to distribute and spread these words and recommendations that the noble scholars have given to Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee AlMadkhalee. This is so that one who is unaware (of the Shaikh) could know his status and so that the hearts of the believers could be at rest and tranquility and so that someone who is ruined at his hands does not fall into such a circumstance without first being informed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise be to the One, through whose grace, all good deeds are completed. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Muhammad and on his family and Companions. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A BIOGRAPHY OF SHAIKH RABEE’ IBN HAADEE AL-MADKHALEE [5]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Name and Lineage:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah , the Muhaddith, Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Ibn Muhammad ‘Umair AlMadkhalee from the tribe of Mudaakhala, a well-known tribe in the Jaazaan district in the southern part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This is one of the tribes of Banoo Shabeel. Shabeel was Ibn Yashjab Ibn Qahtaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Birth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in the village of Jaraadiyah, which is a small village to the west of the town of Saamitah, close to three kilometers away from it. Now, the village is connected to that town. He was born in the year 1351H, towards the last part of the year. His father passed away almost a year and a half after his birth, so he was raised and brought up in the house of his mother, may Allaah have mercy on her. She supervised him and took charge of raising him in the best possible manner, and she taught him good characteristics, such as honesty and trustworthiness and to be motivated about making the prayers. She would make him go pray, while under the supervision of his paternal uncle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Educational Upbringing:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Shaikh reached the age of eight, he joined the study circles of the village. There, he learned proper handwriting and recitation (of the Qur’aan). From those who taught him handwriting, were Shaikh Shaibaan Al-‘Areeshee and Al-Qaadee Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Jaabir Al-Madkhalee. He also learned under a third person, called Muhammad Ibn Husain Makkee from the town of Sibyaa’. He studied the Qur’aan under Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Muhammad Jaabir Al-Madkhalee, as well as the subjects of Tawheed and Tajweed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards he studied in the Salafee School of Saamitah. From the teachers whom he studied under in this school, were: the knowledgeable, Shaikh Naasir Khaloofah At-Tiyaash Mubaarakee, rahimahullaah, who was a famous scholar from the major students of Shaikh Al-Qar’aawee, rahimahullaah. He studied the books Buloogh Al-Maraam and Nuzhat-un-Nadhr of Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr under him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he joined the educational institute in Saamitah after that, and there he studied under a number of noble Mashaayikh, the most famous of whom, generally speaking, were: Shaikh Haafidh Ibn Ahmad Al-Hakamee &#8211; the well-known great scholar, rahimahullaah, and his brother, Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Al-Hakamee. He also studied under the great scholar, the Muhaddith, Ahmad Ibn Yahyaa An-Najmee, may Allaah preserve him, and the Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, Dr. Muhammad Amaan Ibn ‘Alee Al-Jaamee, rahimahullaah. He also studied under the Shaikh, the Faqeeh Muhammad Sagheer Khameesee the book Zaad Al-Mustaqni’ with regard to the subject of Fiqh. And there are many others whom the Shaikh studied under, such as in the subjects of Arabic Language, Literature, Eloquent Speech (Balaagha), etc. In the year 1380H, upon finishing his allotted time, the Shaikh graduated from the educational institute of Saamitah. In the beginning of the year 1381H, he joined the Faculty of Sharee’ah in Riyadh and stayed there for a period of one or two months. Then the Islaamic University of Madeenah opened, so he moved to Madeenah and joined the Islaamic University’s Faculty of Sharee’ah. He studied there for the length of four years and graduated in the year 1384H with a grade of Mumtaz (Excellent).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The teachers whom the Shaikh studied under while in the Islaamic University:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, the former Chief Muftee of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, ‘Abdul- ‘Azeez Ibn ‘Abdillaah Ibn Baaz, rahimahullaah, under whom he studied Al-‘Aqeedah AtTahaawiyyah.<br />
2. The ‘Allaamah, the Muhaddith, Shaikh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee, rahimahullaah, under whom he studied the subject of Hadeeth and its chains of narration.<br />
3. The Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, ‘Adul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad, under whom he studied the subject of Fiqh for three years, with the book Bidaayat-ul-Mujtahid.<br />
4. The Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, the Haafidh and Mufassir, Muhammad Al-Ameen Ash-Shanqeetee, author of the book Adwaa-ul-Bayaan, under whom he studied the subjects of Tafseer and the Principles of Fiqh for four years.<br />
5. Shaikh Saalih Al-‘Iraaqee, under whom he studied ‘Aqeedah (Creed).<br />
6. The Shaikh, the Muhaddith, ‘Abdul-Ghaffaar Hasan Al-Hindee, under whom he studied the Science of Hadeeth and its terms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After graduating from the Islaamic University of Madeenah, he worked as a teacher in one of the learning institutes of the Islaamic University for a while. Then he joined the Department for Higher Studies at Umm Al-Qurraa University, where he continued his studies, obtaining his Masters Degree in the subject of Hadeeth in 1397H, by having completed his dissertation, which is well known as “Between the two Imaams, Muslim and Ad-Daaraqutnee.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in the year 1400H, he obtained his Doctorate Degree from Umm Al-Qurraa also, with the grade of Mumtaz (Excellent). And this was because of his checking of the book “An-Nukat ‘alaa Kitaab Ibn As-Salaah” of Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr, rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After that, he went back to working as a teacher in the Islaamic University (of Madeenah) in the Faculty of Hadeeth, where he taught Hadeeth and its Sciences. He became head of the Dept. of Sunnah in the Department for Higher Studies several times. Now, he currently holds the position of chair-holding professor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Attributes and Characteristics:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah preserve him, is distinguished by his great humbleness in front of his (Muslim) brothers, students, questioners and visitors. He is humble with regard to his household, his clothes and his means of transportation &#8211; not liking to have luxury in any of these things. He is also always joyful and with a cheerful countenance. He doesn’t fatigue his students with too much talk. And his gatherings are always filled with readings in Hadeeth and the Sunnah and warnings against innovation and its people, to the extent that a person that doesn’t know him well or mix with him, may think to himself that the Shaikh doesn’t preoccupy himself except with doing this! He loves the Salafee Students of Knowledge and he is polite to them and treats them nicely. And he strives to assist them with their needs as much as he is able to, both physically and financially. His home is always open to the students of knowledge, to the point that not one day passes that he is able to eat his breakfast or lunch or dinner by himself. And he inquires about his students and assists them and shares with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is among the persistent and enthusiastic callers to the Qur’aan and the Sunnah and the Creed of the Salaf. Many in these times cannot equal his great zeal and passion for the Sunnah and the Creed of the Salaf. And in our time, he is from those who are defending this methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih, day and night, in hidden and in open, without letting the accusations of critics censure him, for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Books:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His books are many, all praise be to Allaah. The Shaikh has written on many important and required topics, especially that of refuting the people of innovation and desires in these times, in which the rectifiers are few and the troublemakers are many. His books include:[6]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has other books that we did not mention here. We ask Allaah to assist him in completing the good and to grant him the ability to do what He loves and is pleased with. Surely, Allaah has power over that and He is Able to do it</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE SCHOLARS&#8217; PRAISE FOR THE SHAIKH, DR. RABEE&#8217; IBN HAADEE &#8216;UMAIR AL-MADKHALEE</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. The Muhaddith, the &#8216;Allaamah, Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a cassette [7] the following question was presented to the Shaikh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Despite the stance that the two Shaikhs, Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee and Muqbil Ibn Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee, have taken in fighting against innovations and the deviant opinions and sayings, some of the youth have doubts as to if the two Shaikhs are upon the Salafee way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaikh, rahimahullaah, answered by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Without a doubt, we praise Allaah, the Most High, for preparing for this upright Da&#8217;wah, which is based on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah according to the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih, numerous callers throughout the various parts of the Muslim lands. They are the ones who take charge of the communal obligation (fard kifaa&#8217;ee), when there are very few who take this responsibility in the Muslim world today. So degrading and belittling these two Shaikhs (Rabee&#8217; and Muqbil), who call to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and what the Salaf As-Saalih were upon and who wage war against those who oppose this correct methodology. As is quite clear to everyone, it either comes from one of two types of people. Either it comes from someone who is ignorant or someone who follows his desires&#8230; If he is ignorant, then he can be taught. But if he is one who follows his desires, then we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evil of this person. And we ask Allaah, Mighty and Sublime, to either guide him or break his back.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaikh, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And furthermore, I want to say that what I saw from the writings of the Shaikh, Dr. Rabee&#8217;, was that they were beneficial. And I do not recall seeing any error on his part (in these books) nor any deviation from the methodology, which we are in conformity with him on and he with us.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, rahimahullaah, also said, commenting on the conclusion of the book <em>&#8220;Al-&#8216;Awaasim mimmaa fee Kutub Sayyid Qutb min Al-Qawaasim&#8221;</em> (Protection against the Dangers that are found in the Books of Sayyid Qutb):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Everything that you have refuted Sayyid Qutb in is true and correct. From this, it will become quite clear to every Muslim, who has some sort of Islaamic education, that reads this that Sayyid Qutb was not knowledgeable about Islaam, whether about its fundamental principles (Usool) or its subsidiary issues (Furoo&#8217;).[8] So may Allaah reward you, O brother (Rabee&#8217;) for fulfilling this obligation of clarifying and exposing his ignorance and deviation from Islaam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. The Imaam, the Muhaddith, the &#8216;Allaamah, Shaikh &#8216;Abd-ul-&#8216;Azeez Ibn Baaz:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Bin Baaz was asked about what he meant by his &#8220;Clarification&#8221; (a speech he gave), so he responded on (7/28/1412) in a cassette entitled &#8220;Explaining the Clarification&#8221;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This clarification that we spoke about &#8211; what was intended by it was the da&#8217;wah (call) of everyone &#8211; all of the callers and scholars &#8211; in a constructive criticism. And our intent was not our brothers in Madeenah from amongst the students of knowledge, teachers and callers. And our intent was not other than them from the people in Makkah or Riyadh or Jeddah. Rather, our intent was that of all the people in a general manner. And our brothers &#8211; the well-known mashaayikh in Madeenah &#8211; we have no doubt in them. They possess sound Creed and are from the Ahl-usSunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah, such as Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Ibn &#8216;Alee (Al-Jaamee), Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee (Al-Madkhalee), Shaikh Saalih Ibn Sa&#8217;ad As-Suhaymee, Shaikh Faalih Ibn Naafi&#8217; and Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Haadee. All of them are known to us for their perseverance, knowledge and sound Creed…However, the callers to falsehood &#8211; those who hunt in murky water (i.e. aimlessly)9 &#8211; they are the ones who confuse the people. And they talk about these matters, saying &#8220;He meant by it such and such&#8221;, and this is not good. It is an obligation to take someone&#8217;s words according to the best manner of understanding.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the tape &#8220;Sticking to the Salafee Manhaj&#8221;, which was recorded in the masjid of Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah) in Taa&#8217;if, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; gave a lecture on Thursday (3rd of Muharram 1413) called &#8220;Sticking to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah&#8221;. In this talk, the Shaikh incited the people to follow these two sources while in the presence of Shaikh Bin Baaz. And after Shaikh Rabee&#8217; finished with his talk, Shaikh Ibn Baaz commented on it saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In the Name of Allaah, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Muhammad, his family, Companions and those who follow his guidance. All of us have listened to the words of the noble Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee on the subject of sticking to the Book and the Sunnah and warning against what opposes them and (warning against) the causes for splitting and dividing and being fanatical to one&#8217;s desires. And he has indeed done well and spoken correctly and benefited us, may Allaah reward him and multiply his reward. This is the obligation upon all of the ummah &#8211; to stick to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and refer to them for judging affairs &#8211; whether small or big. So we ask Allaah that He grant the noble Shaikh Rabee&#8217; every good and that He reward him for his talk…&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the tape &#8220;Questions from Sweden&#8221;, Shaikh Ibn Baaz was asked about Shaikh Rabee&#8217; and responded by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; is from the scholars of the Sunnah &#8211; (and then he mentioned Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee with him and said) &#8211; the two of them are know to me for their knowledge and virtue.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also refer to the book &#8220;The Methodology of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah in Criticizing Men, Books and Groups&#8221; (of Shaikh Rabee&#8217;) to see Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Ibn Baaz&#8217;s good words for this book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truly, we don’t know any man that is upon what Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Ibn Baaz was upon &#8211; inwardly and outwardly &#8211; from love of the Sunnah and support for its people and hatred for innovation and warning against its people, like Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee is. The Shaikh did not cease to love him, praise him and recommend him &#8211; in fact, he granted him permission to something greater than all of this, and it was permission for him to teach in his masjid in Makkah. There he taught his well-known class on Fat&#8217;h-ul-Majeed &#8211; which continues until today &#8211; and this is a proof that the Shaikh died while he was pleased with him and with his manhaj (methodology). [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3. The Muhaddith, the &#8216;Allaamah, Muqbil Ibn Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the cassette entitled &#8220;Questions from Hadhramaut&#8221;, Shaikh Muqbil was asked: &#8220;What is your opinion concerning those who say that Shaikh Rabee&#8217; is mutahawwir (rash and hasty)?&#8221; So the Shaikh responded by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Shaikh Rabee&#8217; has experience in knowing the current state of affairs because he lived with the Ikhwaan Al-Mufliseen for a long period of time. All praise be to Allaah, he is the best at rectifying these affairs and refuting the innovations of the innovators, so I ask Allaah to preserve him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the cassette &#8220;Question regarding the Sunnah posed to the great scholar of the lands of Yemen: Questions from the youth of Taa&#8217;if&#8221;, the Shaikh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;From those who have the most insight and knowledge of the groups (jamaa&#8217;aat) and the pollution of these groups in our time is the brother, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee, may Allaah preserve him. Whoever Shaikh Rabee&#8217; says about that he is a hizbee (partisan), then you will discover after a few days that he is really a hizbee.[11] You will remember that. An individual may conceal himself in the beginning &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t want that his true nature be discovered. But when he gains strength and followers and he knows that talk abut him will not harm him, he manifests and reveals what he is truly upon. So I advise that his (Shaikh Rabee&#8217;s) books be read and that benefit be derived from them, may Allaah preserve him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>4. The Shaikh, the &#8216;Allaamah, Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the cassette &#8220;Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen&#8217;s Meeting with Rabee&#8217; Al-Madkhalee and Muhammad Al-Imaam&#8221;, the Shaikh, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed, we praise Allaah that He has enabled our brother, Doctor Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee AlMadkhalee to visit this province (in Saudi Arabia) so that those who are unaware of certain matters may know that our brother is on the side of the Salafiyyah &#8211; the way of the Salaf. May Allaah grant success to him and us. And I do not mean by &#8220;salafiyyah&#8221; that it is a separate and individual party (hizb) that opposes those apart from it amongst the Muslims. Rather what I mean by &#8220;salafiyyah&#8221; is that he is following the way of the Salaf in his methodology and especially in comprehending Tawheed and denouncing those who oppose it. And we all know that Tawheed is the foundation of the Message for which reason Allaah sent his messengers… Our Brother Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee&#8217;s visit to this province and specifically to our region of &#8216;Unayzah, no doubt it will have an effect here. And it will become clear to many of the people what they were unaware of due to their inflaming, propagating and allowing their tongues to talk freely.12 And how many are the people that feel sorrow for what they have stated against the scholars when it becomes clarified to them that they were in fact correct.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then on the same tape, one of the people in the gathering said: “There is a question concerning the books of Shaikh Rabee’?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he, rahimahullaah, responded: “It is clear that this question is in no need of my response, for as Imaam Ahmad was once asked about Ishaaq Ibn Raahawaih – may Allaah have mercy on them all – so he said: “The likes of me is asked about Ishaaq? Rather Ishaaq should be asked about me!”13 I have already spoken at the start of my talk about what I know of Shaikh Rabee’, may Allaah gave him tawfeeq. And I still insist on what I stated then until now. And his coming here and his talk in which he informed me of what he did &#8211; no doubt &#8211; are from the things that only increases a person in his love for him and his supplicating for him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the tape “Shaikh Rabee’s meeting with Shaikh Ibn ‘Uthaimeen concerning the manhaj”, he, rahimahullaah, was asked the following question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We know about many of the deviations of Sayyid Qutb, but the only thing that I have not heard about him, but which I heard from one of the students of knowledge and which I am not satisfied with – is that Sayyid Qutb was from those who held the belief in wahdat-ul-wujood. Naturally, this is clear-cut disbelief. So was Sayyid Qutb from those who held the belief in wahdat-ulwujood? I hope for your response and may Allaah reward you. With good.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaikh, rahimahullaah, responded: “My examination of the books of Sayyid Qutb is little and I do not know of the condition of this man. However, the scholars have written remarks about his book on tafseer (i.e. Fee Dhilaal-il-Qur’aan), such as the books of Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Ad-Duwaish, rahimahullaah. Also, our brother Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee wrote some remarks about Sayyid Qutb concerning his tafseer and other aspects. So whoever wants to refer to them, then he should refer to them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was also asked about Shaikh Rabee’ in the cassette “Questions from Sweden” and responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“With respect to Shaikh Rabee’, I do not know anything of him except good. And the man is one who possesses (knowledge and following of) the Sunnah and Hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another tape entitled “Unveiling the contradictions of Ahmad Salaam”, which was a telephone link-up from Holland, the question was posed to the Shaikh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“What is your advice to the one who prevents the tapes of Shaikh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee from being distributed claiming that they will lead to fitnah (turmoil), and that in these tapes is praise for the leaders in Saudi Arabia &#8211; and this praise of his for the leaders is hypocrisy?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaikh answered: “Our view is that this is a mistake and a great error. Shaikh Rabee’ is from the scholars of the Sunnah and from the people of goodness. And his Creed is sound and his methodology is upright. But when he spoke out against some (popular) figures amongst the people of recent times, and he deafened them with (his exposition of) these faults…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5. Shaikh Dr. Saalih Ibn Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his introduction to (Shaikh Rabee’s) book “Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah” (pg. 12-13), the Shaikh says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And this is because Islaam calls to gathering together upon the truth, as Allaah says: ‘That you should establish the Religion and not make division within it.’ [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: ’And hold firmly onto the Rope of Allaah – all of you together – and do not divide (into sects).’ [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since clarifying and explaining this matter is an obligation, a group amongst the scholars &#8211; that have protectiveness (of this Religion) and the ability to verify – took the responsibility of cautioning against the errors of these groups. And they took charge of explaining their opposition to the Call towards the Methodology of the Prophets, so that perhaps these groups may return to the truth &#8211; for indeed, arriving at the truth is the objective of the believer – and so that those who are unaware of the errors of these groups will not continue to be deceived by them. And from those scholars that have taken charge of this duty, acting on the hadeeth &#8211; (‘The Religion is sincerity. Religion is sincerity. Religion is sincerity.’ We said: ‘To who, O Messenger of Allaah?’ He said: ‘To Allaah, His Book, His Messenger, the Muslim leaders and their common folk’) – from those who clarified and advised is Shaikh Dr. Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee. In this book, which is before us, entitled “Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah”, he has explained &#8211; may Allaah grant him success and reward him with good &#8211; the methodology of the Messengers in Calling to Allaah according to what is stated in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. And he has compared this with the methodology of the opposing groups so that the difference between the methodology of the messengers and those various methodologies in opposition to the methodology of the messengers can become clear…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his introduction to the book (also by Shaikh Rabee’) “One Group not many groups and One Path, not several”, the Shaikh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“However, during recent times, there appeared groups that ascribed themselves to the Da’wah and which were guided by leaders specific to their groups. Each of these groups made a specific methodology for themselves the result of which was dividing, differing and a constant struggle between these groups – all of which the Religion forbids and which the Book and the Sunnah prohibit. So when the scholars refuted this methodology employed by these groups, which was foreign to Islaam, some brothers set out to defend them. And from the people that defended these groups was the Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaaan ‘Abdul-Khaaliq, by way of his printed treatises and recorded cassettes. He did all of this in spite of being advised not to do it by his brothers. Then he added to that, his reproaching and condemnation of those scholars that didn’t agree with him in his actions. And he labeled them with descriptions that were unbefitting of them, and he did not desist from that – not even against some of the sheikhs that taught him! The noble Shaikh, Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee took the responsibility of refuting him in this book, which the reader holds before him, by the title ‘One Group not many groups and One Path, not several.’ And I have read it and found that it sufficiently fulfills its objective, all praise be to Allaah.” And in the cassette “Questions from Sweden” (recorded on Rabee’-ul-Aakhira 1417H), the Shaikh said after mentioning Shaikh Rabee’ along with a group of other scholars:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They are from the prominent scholars that have an active role in the Da’wah (Call) and in refuting those who desire to deviate from the correct way of the Da’wah. So his tapes must be distributed for there is a huge benefit in them for the Muslims.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6. The &#8216;Allaamah, Shaikh Muhammad Ibn ‘Abd-il-Wahhaab Marzooq Al-Bannaa:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his introduction to the book “One Group not many groups and One Path, not several”, the Shaikh, may Allaah preserve him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I know Dr. Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee from the days when I was a student at the Islamic University (in Madeenah) as someone who was anxious to learn the Sunnah and the Way of the Salaf As-Saalih, as well as to follow that methodology and call others to that Straight Path. I graduated with him and the brothers ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ‘Abdul-Khaaliq, ‘Umar Sulaymaan AlAshqar and Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee along with some Sudanese students that were upon the same methodology of Da’wah in Sudan during the summer recess of that year. And amongst the best of those (of us) who stood firm on this path (of the Way of the Salaf) was Shaikh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee. We ask Allaah that He continue his firmness, for he has filled the gap by defending the Sunnah and clarifying the mistakes of some people whom we bear witness to their virtuousness, yet whom many people are deceived by. This is such as his advice to the son, Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan (‘Abdul-Khaaliq) in the book ‘One Group not many groups and One Path, not several.’ And in this book, he clarifies the truth that he holds, so may Allaah reward him with the best reward and may He grant us, the brother ‘Abdur-Rahmaan, and all of the brothers, the methodology of the Straight Path. And may He protect us all from the deviant paths. And I have come to know of the death of Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, may Allaah forgive him and grant him a spacious place in Paradise. He was indeed among those who defended the Sunnah and who called to following the Way of the Salaf. I ask Allaah that He accept his efforts and that he forgive him and us.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>7. Shaikh Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdillaah As-Subayyal,</strong></span> chief caretaker of the affairs of Masjid Al-Haraam and Masjid An-Nabawee and the Imaam and khateeb of Masjid Al-Haraam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the book “An-Nasr-ul-‘Azeez ‘alaa Ar-Radd-il-Wajeez” (pg. 11), he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“All praise be to Allaah, and the peace and blessings on the one whom no prophet will come after him, Muhammad, and on his family and Companions. To proceed: Indeed, the noble Shaikh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee, who is a professor at the Islaamic University of Madeenah, is from the well-known scholars and popular callers in the scholarly and educational circles in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He is known for his authority in the sciences of the Sunnah as well as other subjects from the Islaamic Sciences. The Shaikh has a big role in calling to Allaah upon the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih, defending the correct Salafee Creed and refuting those amongst the people of innovation and desires that oppose it by what is mentioned to him, so he is well thanked for that. So we ask Allaah to continue His blessing on him and that He increase him in his ability and his focus.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the cassette “Unveiling the contradictions of Ahmad Salaam” (tape 1), the following was recorded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question: “What is your advice to the one who prevents (the distribution of) the tapes of the well known scholars from Ahl-us-Sunnah, such as Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, rahimahullaah, and Shaikh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee, hafidhahullaah, to the point that he says that the Shaikh’s tapes will bring about fitnah?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh answered: “I seek refuge in Allaah, I seek refuge in Allaah…no. Look, the tapes of these two Shaikhs are from the best of tapes. They call the people to the Sunnah and to cling tightly onto the Sunnah, but no one talks bad about them except one who follows his desires. Most of the people that talk about them are the people of sects and parties – those who affiliate themselves with one of the groups or parties. They are the ones who make such statements. As for these two Shaikhs, then they are known for sticking to the Sunnah and for possessing a Creed in accordance with the way of the Salaf. And they are from the best of people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>8. Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the first cassette of the tape set &#8220;The Rulings of the Scholars on the Statements of &#8216;Adnaan &#8216;Aroor&#8221;,[14] the Shaikh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for Shaikh Rabee&#8217; &#8211; he is known for his effort in clarifying the Sunnah and refuting the innovators. May Allaah reward him with good.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>9. Shaikh &#8216;Ubaid Al-Jaabiree:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was asked about Shaikh Rabee&#8217; on the cassette &#8220;A Clarification of some of the Errors of &#8216;Adnaan &#8216;Aroor, and it was said to him: &#8220;There is a lot of talk going on about Shaikh Rabee&#8217; &#8211; is he considered one of the scholars of the Muslims?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he responded: &#8220;Shaikh Rabee&#8217;, all praise be to Allaah, is well-known with the elite personalities and the scholars. And furthermore, our shaikh (teacher), Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Bin Baaz has praised and approved of him. And I would not think that you would present this question to me.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">CLOSING REMARKS</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a small treatise containing some of the praises of the scholars for Dr. Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee, may Allaah preserve him and guard him and make Paradise his and our final abode. These statements are only a small portion of the many praises that the scholars &#8211; those living and those who have passed away &#8211; have given to this noble scholar (Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the testimony of the people of knowledge is sufficient for us as testimony. And Allaah has called on their testimony in His Book concerning the greatest matter that requires one&#8217;s testimony and that is Tawheed, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah bears witness that No deity has the right to be worshipped, and so do the angels and those who have been given knowledge. (He is always) maintaining His creation with justice. There is no deity worthy of worship except Him, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Aali-&#8216;Imraan: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And dear brother, do not be like the one about whom Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And when (news of) a matter comes to them concerning (matters of) security or fear, they propagate it…&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But rather implement the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;But if they had only returned it back to the Messenger and those in authority amongst them, those amongst them who are able to derive a correct conclusion from it would have understood it (and made it known to them).&#8221;</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware O brother of being from those about whom Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And those who harm the believing men and believing women undeservedly, they bear (on themselves) the crime of slander and plain sin.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And remember the saying of the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever says something about a believer that is not true about him will be locked away in the boiling puss of the Hellfire, until he turns back from what he said.&#8221;</strong> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these times, the false rumors and claims (against Shaikh Rabee’) have become widespread, but:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Indeed Allaah will defend those who believe. Verily Allaah does not love every treacherous, ungrateful person.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hajj: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So O servants of Allaah, do not listen to what these prejudiced and spiteful people say in their belittling and defaming of the Ahl-us-Sunnah. Rather act on the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe, if an evildoer comes to you with some news, then verify it, lest some people be afflicted by you due to ignorance and then you will feel remorse for what you did later.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hujuraat: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And take heed of the saying of the Prophet: <strong>&#8220;It is enough of a lie for a person that he narrate everything he hears.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is our conclusion and may Allaah send His peace and blessings on our sayyid, Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] How can the Qutubi Surroris make this man &#8211; Sayyid Qutb &#8211; a mujaddid and an Imaam when he was ignorant of the fundamental aspects of Islaam before the subsidiary aspects!! By Allaah, this is something very strange! So abandon your lies O you whom Allaah has tested by means of this man and defending of him. Can someone who is ignorant of the fundamental aspects of Islaam be considered a mujaddid (reviver)?! What will he revive? Rather, this kind of person can only be a mujaddid (reviver) of innovations and a reviver of diseases that are deadly to Islaam and to the Muslims. And this is known from his books, for he has revived the views of the Jahmiyyah and the Mu&#8217;tazilah and the views of the Rawaafid and the Khawaarij and the views of the Sufis, such as that of wahdat-ul-wujood (Allaah and the creation are all one existence). This is what Sayyid Qutb has revived, so how can someone who has this condition be considered an Imaam? &#8211; unless he is an Imaam of misguidance! And that is what he is, may Allaah protect us from his fitnah and his evil. Many of the scholars have refuted Sayyid Qutb, including Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Ad-Duwaish, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee (in four separate books) and Shaikh Mahmood Shaakir. The latter has refuted Sayyid Qutb in the issue of his reviling of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. But Sayyid Qutb did not pay heed to the refutation of Shaikh Mahmood Shaakir and instead was proud and stubborn and persisted in his reviling and belittling of the Companions as is quite clear in the Introduction of the book &#8220;Mataa&#8217;in Sayyid Qutb fee Ashaabi Rasoolillaah&#8221; (The Abuses of Sayyid Qutub against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger) of Shaikh Rabee&#8217; [Second Printing]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] The ones whom Shaikh Ibn Baaz, rahimahullaah, is referring to here are: Salmaan Al-&#8216;Awdah, Safar AlHawaali and Muhammad Sa&#8217;eed Al-Qahtaanee, as well as all others that stand in need of clarification. And the Shaikh has called them &#8220;callers to falsehood&#8221; and &#8220;those who hunt in murky water (i.e. aimlessly)&#8221;, wa laa Hawla wa laa Quwata illaa Billaah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] How can he not be pleased with him and his methodology when it is the methodology of the Salaf AsSaalih (Righteous Predecessors) in protecting the Tawheed and the Sunnah from the distortions and lies of the people of innovations and misguidance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]By Allaah, he has spoken the truth, for Shaikh Rabee&#8217; has informed us of (the condition of) many people and after a while, that which the Shaikh said about them began to manifest itself, may Allaah preserve him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] These are the Hizbees (partisans) from the Ikhwaan Al-Muslimeen and the Suroori Qutubis!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] This is an assertion from the great scholar, Ibn &#8216;Uthaimeen, to the fact that Shaikh Rabee&#8217; is the Carrier of the Flag of Al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel. And also, this is a sign of the Shaikh&#8217;s humbleness, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] This &#8216;Aroor has invented false and corrupt principles by which he tries to defend the people of innovation and misguidance. And he is from the extremists with regard to promoting Sayyid Qutb, to the point that he said: &#8220;I do not know of any person on the face of this earth that has spoken about the minhaaj (methodology) in the manner that Sayyid Qutb has spoken about it&#8221;!!! And he has many statements in which he praises Sayyid Qutb and commends and exalts his books. And &#8216;Aroor is well known for lying and falsifying information about him (i.e. in favor of Sayyid Qutb), may Allaah protect us from the evil of the Qutubis. And we ask Allaah that He expose them day after day. Many of the scholars have refuted &#8216;Aroor and have clarified his falsifications, deceptions and lies on the Salafees &#8211; not to mention Shaikh Rabee&#8217; from one perspective and &#8216;Aroor&#8217;s excessiveness with regard to Sayyid Qutb from another perspective. So O brothers, strive to find out about &#8216;Aroor and every misguided innovator so that you can beware of them, especially in these times in which the people of innovations, desires and calamities are many.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from Appendix I of  the book : “The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah – that is the way of wisdom and intelligence” – by Shaykh Rabee hafidhahullaah, translated by Dawud Burbank rahimahullah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Appendix I </strong>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah alone, and may He send praises and blessings of peace upon the Messenger of Allaah, and upon his family and true followers, and his Companions and those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed, I praise Allaah, with abundant, pure and blessed praise for every blessing which He has bestowed on me, and I give thanks to Him, the Most High, and praise and extol Him, and I cannot praise and extol Him as truly befits Him, and no-one can do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then from the blessings which Allaah has bestowed on me is that He has enabled me, despite my weakness, to speak the truth openly according to my capability, whether in writing or face to face encounters, so I thank Him and praise Him with praise such as would fill the heavens and the earth and whatever is between them. I also ask that He grants me firmness upon that until I meet Him and that He is pleased with me. I further ask that He grants me increase in guidance to what is correct, and protection, and I do not forget, and all praise is for Allaah, that when my book, ‘The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah &#8211; That is the Way of Wisdom and Intellect,’ was published it was accepted by the true Muslim youth in every place with joy and was greatly welcomed. This was because it made the call of the Prophets clear to them, until it became as clear as the sun in the middle of the day, and it removed confusion, distortions and the deception of some writers whose hearts were like those of devils in the form of humans those whose only concern is to gather the people around them and around their fraudulent slogans. It does not worry such people that this gathering of people should include the Raafidees (extreme <em>Shee’ah</em>), the hypocrites, the heretical <em>Khawaarij</em>,[2] the extreme Sufis who are guilty of apostasy, the ignorant and their like from the worshippers of the graves, or whichever of the wretched and unfortunate groups.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It does not worry them that this type of people rally together with them and rally to their slogans, despite the evil consequences of this in this world and the Hereafter. This is because they are as they were described by Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“Callers to the gates of Hell, whoever answers their call will be thrown into it,”</em> and because they are as the sincere, truthful and trustworthy Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   described them, <em>“Devils in the bodies of humans.”</em> If this is not the case then what is it that causes them, and those who follow their lead, to flee from and separate themselves from the clear and radiant way and methodology of the Prophets, which is made clear by the Qur&#8217;aan and shown to be their way and their methodology?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah with regard to this His names and attributes, <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah in His lordship, and <em>tawheed</em> of Allaah in His worship, and to disbelieve and reject everything that is worshipped besides Him &#8211; that is the pure religion. Allaah the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We sent a Messenger to every nation, ordering them that they should worship Allaah alone, obey Him and make their worship purely for Him, and that they should avoid everything worshipped besides Allaah.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We did not send any Messenger before you, O Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , except that We revealed to Him that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah &#8211; so make all of your worship purely for Allaah.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Study any of the other <em>da’wah</em>s of the sects and parties &#8211; other than the <em>Salafee</em>[5] <em>da’wah </em>&#8211; do you see this methodology or any trace of it in their schooling, their persons, or their <em>jamaa&#8217;aat</em>? Then show it to me if you are truthful. As for myself I do not find in these sects and parties except that they wage a fierce war against this methodology and its people. I do not see except belittlement and mockery of this methodology and its people. I do not see except hatred and enmity for this methodology and its people, and I do not see except warm greetings and respect from them for the deviant and misguided calls and their people. Indeed you will frequently see and hear the last of these from those who disguise themselves as <em>Salafees</em> but are in reality closer in relation to their enemies, and there are ties and relationships between them which are such as they are known only to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there are some who are passionately in love with the state of superstitions, innovations and misguidance who think- and evil are their thoughts, and evil is the lie which they invent- that Imake a separation between the religion and the State, and that I dispute about the importance of the subject of authority of sovereignty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“What a serious word it is that comes out of their mouths! What they say is nothing but a lie”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this book displeased them and it made clear the falsity of their calls and their misrepresentation and distortion of Islaam and of the text concerning <em>tawheed </em>&#8211; particularly with regard to the <em>da’wah</em> of the Messengers, may Allaah’s praise and blessings of peace be upon them. The book did not join them in welcoming the state of the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ahs</em>. Nor did it support them in seeking establishment of statelets founded upon the building of the tombs and upon the belief that the pious who have died know the Hidden and Unseen and have some control over the creation. Nor did it support them in seeking establishment of statelets based upon any such things as have preceded, nor in accepting the misguidance and <em>shirk</em> of secularism which seeks to disguise itself in the guise of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather the book, and all praise is for Allaah, made clear that the true and trustworthy <em>da’wah</em> is that which follows the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah, and the state which is established upon this correct methodology &#8211; that is the Islamic state. Then despite the fact that the book was dealing with a particular topic &#8211; which was to explain the methodology of the Prophets in calling to Allaah &#8211; it still gave attention to mentioning the Islamic state which it mentioned repeatedly and emphasised a number of times. It even had a chapter headed: &#8220;The view of the scholars of Islaam concerning leadership (<em>al-Imaamah</em>) and their proofs of its obligation&#8221;. Then the scholars sayings about that were quoted and their proofs mentioned. However what angered the people of innovations and desires, and the callers to falsehood, is that I placed leadership and the state in the place given to them by Allaah and which was accepted by the scholars of Islaam. I did not support the people of innovation and desires in their abandonment of the methodology of the Prophets in calling to <em>tawheed</em>, and fighting <em>shirk</em>, innovations and the rest of the types of misguidance and deviation, and fighting idolatry and grave-worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nor did I support them in making leadership (<em>al-Imaamah</em>) the most important matter, and the most fundamental principle &#8211; which is something which has led people to rejection of the methodology of the Prophets and has lead them to fight against it. It has also led them to fling themselves into the arms of the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ah</em>, and to having affection for them, and to allying themselves with them, defending them and to falsley adorning their ideology which is at war with Islaam, in opposition to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> and waging war against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   and his pure wives and the rest of the Muslims and their scholars. Indeed it goes beyond that to the point that they declare these great people to be disbelievers and make the foulest attacks against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I did not support them in this misguidance and this loathsome excess, so they disliked the book and thought evil about its author. So they said the falsehood which they said in order to turn the youth who thirst for the truth away from the irrefutable and clear truth in this book. This book which openly spoke the truth and placed both correct creed and belief (<em>‘aqeedah</em>) and the state in the place given to them by Allaah &#8211; without going beyond the bounds or falling short, and without distorting and deception. Then it is essential that I explain to the youth the distinction between the state (<em>ad-Dawlah</em>) and the dominion and sovereignty of Allaah (<em>al-Haakimiyyah</em>). As for the state, then it is a gathering of people who may be disbelievers, may be misguided deviants, or may be Believers. Then the people may be gathered under a rightly- guided <em>khilaafah</em>, or restricted kingships- which has been the case with the Islamic states after the rightly -guided <em>khilaafah</em>. So these individuals who form the Believing state are no more than the means to implement the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah- the establishment of <em>jihaad</em>, the ordering of good and forbidding of evil, establishment of the Prescribed Punishments and retribution, and the protection of the <em>ummah</em> from the plots and aggression of the enemies against the lands of the Muslims and against their souls, their wealth and their honour. So the Muslims must establish a state to accomplish these great obligations &#8211; either : by giving the pledge of allegiance to a <em>khaleefah</em> whom all of the Muslims are united upon; or by the fact that an individual from the <em>ummah</em> gains ascendancy and has power, an army and authority &#8211; which means that the benefit of the <em>ummah</em> lies in accepting him as long as he proclaims Islaam, establishes the laws and the creed (<em>‘aqeedah</em>) and protects the <em>ummah</em> from its enemies and does whatever is required, the details of which are known and mentioned in the source works of Islaam; or by the fact that some individuals gain ascendancy over some areas as happened in the lands of Islaam after the weakening of the <em>khilaafah</em>, so overall benefit necessitated submitting to this situation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for dominion and sovereignty then these are attributes of Allaah and qualities particular to Him alone, as He, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Judgement and command is for Allaah alone, He ordered that you should worship none but Him. That is the true and straight religion.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this authority and sovereignty is not denied except by one who is a disbeliever in Allaah and is severe in his enmity to Allaah, His Messenger and His Books. Indeed one who even denies Allaah’s authority in the slightest matter, not to mention with regard to fundamental matters, then he is a disbeliever in Allaah, outside the fold of Islaam if he knowingly denies that. As for the ignorant person, then he has excuse until the proof is established against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I have said applies to the rulers, the ruled and to indivduals and groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>). This has been affirmed by the trustworthy scholars of Islaam, and from them Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, <em>rahimahullaah,</em>[8] and his student Ibnul-Qayyim.[9] So whoever accepts and abides by this rule and authority in the fundamentals of the religion and its details, and in matters of creed and belief, and matters of worship, and dealings and political affairs, and economic affairs, and manners, and social affairs &#8211; then he is a Believer. But he who does not abide by it all or some of these then he is a disbeliever, whether he is an individual or a group, a ruler or one ruled, a caller or one called. Indeed I fear, by Allaah, for many of the sects, parties and individuals that they may fall into disbelief due to their not abiding by the rule and authority of Allaah with regard to the fundamentals of the religion, indeed with regard also to its details. I fear for many of them, against whom the proof has been established and to whom the truth has been made clear, yet still they persist in opposing the call to <em>tawheed</em> and oppose waging war against shirk and innovation, aswell as opposing its people and to cutting from them. Instead these people incite others against and warn against those who call with the call of the Prophets, and those who seek truly and sincerely to amend the affairs. After establishment of the proof against such a person he would fall into the abyss of disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I call all of the <em>ummah</em> &#8211; its rulers and its ruled, its indivduals, sects, and parties, to all have true belief in the all-encompassing authority and sovereignty of Allaah which covers the fundamental matters of the religion and its details, and that they should fully abide by it with regard to the fundamental matters of the religion and its details. I also call the heads of the states, from those who abide generally by the rule and authority of Allaah, and yet are negligent in some areas of practice, I call them to abide by it totally and unrestrictedly in every field, in the matter of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and worship, and dealings, and economics, and politics, and with regard to ordering good and forbidding evil, and that they should strive to fight against <em>shirk</em> and innovations, and against sins and against evil &#8211; particularly usury and the rest of the major sins which harm the <em>ummah</em> and its manners. Indeed Allaah prevents by means of the rulers those who are not prevented by the Qur’aan. They should be fully aware that Allaah will question them about every small and large matter which they are responsible for. <em>“Each of you is a guardian and is responsible for thoses whom he is in charge of.” </em>I also remind them of the saying of the Prophet, <em>“There is no ruler having authority over Muslim subjects who dies while he is decieving them except that Allaah has forbidden Paradise for him.”</em>[10] and his saying, <em>“There is no servant whom Allaah places in authority over some people, and he does not deal with them sincerely and honestly, except that he will not find the fragrance of Paradise.”</em>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From sincerity to the <em>ummah</em> is that you encourage them to abide by the ruler of Allaah and His <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, by teaching them, directing them, encouraging and warning them, and by ordering the good and forbidding the evil, and by establishing prescribed punishment and using every means which will cause them to respect the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah in <em>‘aqeedah</em>, worship, political affairs and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also call the heads of state in Islamic lands who do not abide by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah that they should turn back to Allaah and respect His religion which is found in the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em>, and that they should cling to the creed and beliefs of this religion and its rulings, and to be proud of that &#8211; since therein lies honour and nobility. However total disgrace and humiliation comes from submission to laws laid down by the most despicable humans, the enemies of this <em>ummah</em> whether they are Jews, Christians, Magians or atheists. So I call such leaders to respect the feelings of the <em>ummah</em> of Islaam which has striven and fought and sacrificed millions of its sons for the achievement of a noble and lofty goal &#8211; which is that it should be ruled by Islaam, and Islaam alone is the religion of Allaah, the Creator of this creation, the Creator of mankind and <em>jinn</em> so that they should worship Him alone and submit to His revealed laws alone. They should abide by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah and impose it upon the <em>ummah</em> in creed and beliefs, in manners, in teaching and in Islamic curriculae which education and training are to be based upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also enjoin the scholars of the <em>ummah</em>, and its callers, and parties and groups that they should sincerely advise all of the <em>ummah</em>, its elders and its youth, its males and its females, and unite them upon the Book of Allaah, the <em>Sunnah</em> of his Messenger, and upon the methodology and understanding of the <em>Salalafu-Saalih</em> (the Pious Predecessors), the Companions, the <em>Taabieen</em> and those who followed them upon good, the <em>imaams</em> of guidance, the scholars of <em>fiqh</em>, the scholars of <em>hadeeth</em> and of <em>tafseer</em>, in creed and beliefs, in worship, in manners, in dealings, in economic affairs, and all the other affairs of Islaam and <em>eemaan</em>. Then they should fully comprehend the Sayings of Allaah, the Most High,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the ones guilty of unbelief.”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the transgressors.”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever does not judge by what Allaah has revealed then they are the disobedient.”</strong>[14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They should understand that these Sayings of Allaah apply to all individuals, groups, rulers and subjects. So to restrict it to refer it to the rulers alone and not to the people of deviant sects and misguidance, those who do not judge by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> of Allaah in their creed and beliefs, nor in their worship and their behaviour, then this is from ignorance, misguidance and foolishness, since Allaah sent these <em>Aayaat</em> down concerning the Jews at a time when they had not had any state or authority for centuries. He sent these <em>Aayaat</em> down concerning them at a time when He had imposed humiliation and lowliness upon them. I have explained the authority and sovereignty of Allaah in this broad and all-embracing sense in the book itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I should also not fail to draw attention to an error made by the author of <em>‘Meezaanul-I&#8217;tidaal litaqyeem Kitaabil-Mawridiz-Zallaal fir-Tanbeeh &#8216;alaa Akhtaa’iz Zilaal,’ </em>who is ’Isaam ibn Muhammad ibn Taahir al-Barqaawee, who attributed to me something which my tongue has never uttered and which I never believed, nor have I ever written such a thing. Furthermore I seek Allaah’s refuge from what he said, and I declare myself free before Allaah from it, and I ask Allaah to save me and all the Muslims from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Barqaawee said in a footnote (p.15) to his aforementioned book: “This also reminds me of what Shaykh Rabee&#8217; ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee, <em>hafizahullaahu ta&#8217;aalaa</em>, did in his book, <em>‘Manhajul-Anbiyaa fid-Da’wah illallaah&#8230;’ </em>when he criticised the view of al-Maududi, <em>rahimahullaah ta&#8217;aalaa</em>, about the importance of leadership (<em>imaamah</em>), <em>khilaafah</em>, and judging by that which Allaah sent down, since he also sought to use as evidence the saying of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah about the position of the <em>imaamah</em> with the Raafidee (<em>Shee&#8217;ahs</em>). So he took up six pages in quoting the discussion of Shaykhul-Islaam with those <em>Raafidee</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ahs</em>). However the numerous and great differences between the beliefs of the <em>Raafidees</em> concerning the <em>imaamah</em> and the infallibility of the <em>Imaams</em>, and the twelve <em>imaams</em> and so on, and between what al-Maududi and others call to, i.e. the necessity and importance of striving to return to judging by the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em>, through the <em>khilaafah</em>, and to establish a single ruler for the people of Islaam; the differences between these two are well known. Even if the words of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah contain something which is fitting in this regard, yet most of it, if a just person were to examine it, is not fitting to this discussion, rather it applies to the matter of <em>imaamah</em> with the <em>Raafidee</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ah</em>) with its well known details&#8230; so he should not have quoted it all&#8230; for fear of deception.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Barqaawee&#8217;s scales are unbalanced and he has not judged between myself and al-Maududi with justice, and perhaps he has forgotten the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And weigh justly with the true balance.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Woe to those who give short measure to others. Those who demand full measure from others, but when they give them in measure or weight then they give them less than their due. Do these people not think that they will be ressurected for reckoning on a formidable Day. The Day when all mankind will stand before the Lord of the Worlds.”</strong>[16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brother al-Barqaawee, I was debating the view of al-Maududi about the importance of the matter of leadership (<em>imaamah</em>), the <em>khilaafah</em> and judging by that which Allaah has sent down!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards the fact of their importance, then no Believer having a trace of <em>eemaan</em> would dispute that. But O brother you have failed to note the point of disagreement between myself and al-Maududi. I debated with the view of al-Maududi with regard to his going beyond the due limits about leadership to such an extent that no Muslim who has respect for Islaam could remain silent about this excess, and it was of such a level that even the misguided would not accept it, not to mention the people of <em>hadeeth</em> and the <em>Salafees</em>. Indeed very many scholars from his own land, from the <em>Salafees</em> and others have replied to him. Then this excess of his has travelled and has reached many Arab and Islamic lands, and it has fooled an overwhelming majority of authors and youth, which has led to great neglect of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and even comtempt of it and of its people. It has also led people to treat <em>shirk</em> and innovation lightly and has caused al-Maududi and his like to ally themsleves with and to befriend the devotees of the graves and even the <em>Raafidees</em> (<em>Shee&#8217;ah</em>), and to gather these people under their banner, to treat them as brothers, to love and defend them and their beliefs and creed, and this is something which is a reality and is clear to everyone possessing intellect and religion. So since the matter has reached this frightful state, I replied to al-Maududi with regard to some of his excess in order to make the people in general aware, and also the people of the Arabian Peninsula, to which the followers of al-Maududi and their helpers direct their attention. So they seek to wipe away the <em>’aqeedah</em> of <em>tawheed</em>, and the <em>’aqeedah</em> of true and correct alliance and enmity (<em>al-Walaa wal-Baraa</em>). Do you think that my reply to al-Maududi was so unreasonable that you seek to defend his view with falsehood, and by forgetting to judge justly, to the point that you take my words to mean something which I did not say, and which they did not mean?! Listen to what al-Maududi says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The question of leadership is the most important matter in human life and its most fundamental principle.” Then try to defend this saying with clear and unequivocal texts from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger, and the words of the Companions and the scholars of Islaam. If you have not seen this, then you must adjust your scales in order to establish justice, equity and fairness, and to abandon the excess which has led al-Maududi and his followers to scorn the call of the Prophets and the goal of their <em>da’wah</em>, and to turn the affairs upside down. Listen to his saying: “The true goal of the religion is to establish the system of the rightly guided and righteous leadership (<em>imaamah</em>).” So to him this is the true goal of the religion. So <em>tawheed</em>, and the Prayer, and<em> Zakaat</em>, and <em>jihaad</em> and other matters from the religion become only means to reach this goal in the view of al-Maududi. So produce the clear proofs from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , in place of al-Maududi, to support this and if you are unable then do not be too embarrassed to say, ‘This poor weak servant, Rabee’ ibn Haadee, has spoken the truth and has been sincere towards Islaam and the Muslims, and has put matters in their due place.’ Then listen to the saying of al-Maududi: “This is the purpose for which the Prayer, Fasting, the <em>Zakaat</em> and the <em>Hajj</em> have been made obligatory in Islaam. Then the fact that they are called acts of worship does not mean that they are themselves worship, rather its meaning is that they prepare mankind for the true and fundamental worship, and these are a training course which are essential for that.&#8217; He also says, &#8216;You think that standing facing the <em>Qiblah</em>, placing the right hand upon the justify, and <em>rukoo&#8217;</em> with your hands upon your knees, and prostration upon the ground, and reciting particular words, and these actions and movements are themselves worship; and you think that fasting from the start of <em>Ramadaan</em> until the start of <em>Shawwaal</em>, and going hungry and thirsty from morning until evening, you think that this is worship; and you think that reciting a number of <em>Aayaat</em> from the Qur&#8217;aan is worship; and you think that performing <em>Tawaaf</em> around the <em>Ka&#8217;bah</em> is worship. In summary you have called the manifestation of certain actions worship, and when a person performs these actions with their form and manners you think that he has worshipped Allaah&#8230; but the truth is that the worship which Allaah created you for, and which he ordered you to perform is something else.”[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Are you pleased by this derisive manner about speaking about the great pillars of Islaam and those who worship in this way? These are not, in the view of al-Maududi, forms of worship for which man was created, rather the worship for which man was created and which they were ordered to fulfil is something else. O Barqaawee, do you take this as your religion before Allaah? That the forms of worship are only a training course which if applied will&#8230; etc. Is this something stated textually in the Qur’aan and the <em>Sunnah</em>, and which the Prophets came with and which was accepted by the best of the people of this <em>ummah</em>? If you agree with al-Maududi then bring the proofs to support his saying. Otherwise bite upon your knuckles in regret and grief for having deserted the truth and offended its people and helped falsehood. This, O my brother, was the subject of my debate with al-Maududi, and about which I quoted the words of Shaykhul-Islaam concerning the exceeding of the bounds by the <em>Raafidees</em> about leadership (imaamate). What I quoted from him was all relevant, not just a part of it as al-Barqaawee claimed. Then if you were correct, O Barqaawee, then why did you not explain what was relevant from the words of Shaykhul-Islaam and what was not? As for the claim of &#8216;infallibility&#8217; for the &#8216;twelve imaams,&#8217; then I did not attribute it to al-Maududi, nor did I debate about it with him, nor did I quote Shaykhul-Islaam’s words about it. So your words are totaly opposed to justice! As for your equity and justice which you set up for yourself in judging between Sayyid Qutb and ad-Duwaysh, then I do not know what you have done. Indeed you have totally failed to be just between myself and al-Maududi, and how would it have harmed you to speak the truth? Then as for the <em>khilaafah</em>, I do not know if you read what I wrote and quoted from the scholars of Islaam, or if you merely took the subject with the tips of your fingers with your eyes closed, thinking that justice and equity would be achieved that easily. So read this and that anew and speak the truth, supporting it with proof, not alarmism and agitation!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for judging by that which Allaah sent down, then how can you imagine that I would dispute about it with al-Maududi or anyone else, when it is something known necessarily in the religion, and not even the deviant and deviated sects dispute about it?! So I seek Allaah’s refuge from what the author of <em>‘al-Meezaan,’</em> attributed to me. Rather read again what I wrote concerning the authority and sovereignty of Allaah, and that it comprehends every part of the religion, and you will see the extent of the mistake of al-Barqaawee, may Allah guide him. Then finally the points of criticism of al-Maududi and his like are so many that this introduction is not the place for them. But in summary, he is one of those furthest from abiding by the authority and sovereignty of Allaah with regard to his <em>’aqeedah</em> and his <em>Fiqh</em>, and with regard to his stance on the <em>Sunnah</em> of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and his stance with regard to the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , and with regard to their enemies the <em>Raafidee Shee&#8217;ah</em>. Indeed he and his followers have alliance and friendship with those <em>Raafidees</em>, they support them and they praise their <em>Taaghoot</em>, al-Khomeini and his students, the <em>Aayatur-Raafidiyyah</em>. So noble reader be aware of this, and judge the people according to the truth, and do not judge the truth according to its people, and beware of falling into the abyss of over-exaggerated respect for personalities so that it leads you to reject the truth, and to argue against its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah guide and grant the <em>ummah</em> to loving the truth and its people. Indeed my Lord hears and responds to supplications.</p>

<p>[The following is the continuation of the article @ <em><a title="Permanent Link to The Call to Allah : Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/27/the-call-to-allah/">The Pillars which support the correct Da’wah</a></em> – Shaykh Salih al-Fawzan]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. So whichever call is not <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/01/27/the-call-to-allah/"><strong>built upon these foundations</strong></a>, and whatever methodology is not from the methodology of the Messengers &#8211; then it will be frustrated and fail, and it will be toil without any benefit. The clearest proofs of this are those present day groups (<em>jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) which set out a methodology and programme for themselves and their <em>da’wah</em> which is different to the methodology of the Messengers. These groups have neglected the importance of <em>‘aqeedah</em> (correct belief and creed) &#8211; except for a very few of them &#8211; and instead call for the correction of side-issues. So one group calls for the correction of rule and politics, and demands establishment of the prescribed punishments, and that Islamic Law be applied in judging amongst the people, and this is indeed something very important, but it is not what is most important &#8211; <strong>since how can one seek to establish and apply Allaah’s Judgement upon the thief and the fornicator before seeking to establish and apply Allaah’s Judgement upon the <em>mushrik</em>, the one who attributes worship to others besides Allaah?! How can we demand that Allaah’s Judgement be applied to two men disputing about a sheep or a camel before demanding that Allaah’s Judgement be applied to those who worship idols and graves, and those who deny or hold heretical beliefs with regard to Allaah’s Names and Attributes, divesting them of their true meanings, or distorting them?! </strong>Are these people not greater criminals than those who fornicate, drink wine and steal?! Those are crimes against mankind, whereas <em>shirk</em> and denial of Allaah’s Names and Attributes are crimes against the Creator, the One free of all imperfections, and the right of the Creator has precedence over the rights of the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah says in his book, <em>al-Istiqaamah</em> (1/466): “<span style="color:#ff0000;">So these sins along with correct <em>tawheed </em>are better than corrupted <em>tawheed</em> in the absence of these sins</span>.”[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then another <em>jamaa&#8217;ah</em> affiliates itself with <em>da’wah</em>, except that its methodology is also at variance with the methodology of the Messengers. They give no importance to correct <em>‘aqeedah</em>, rather they give importance to worshipping and practising some <em>dhikr </em>(remembrance of Allaah) in the way of the <em>Sufis</em>.[2]They concentrate upon going out (<em>khurooj</em>) and touring the lands, and what is important to them is that they manage to attract the people to join them, without caring about their beliefs and creed (<em>‘aqeedah</em>). All of these are innovated ways, taking as their starting point matters which were justify until last in the call of the Messengers. This is just like the case of one who seeks to cure a body whose head has been cut off, since the place of <em>‘aqeedah</em> in the religion is like the head with regard to the body. So it is necessary for these groups to correct their concepts and understanding by referring back to the Book and the <em>Sunnah</em> in order to know the methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah. For indeed Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, informed that correct rule and sovereignty, which is the central part of the call of the former <em>Jamaa&#8217;ah</em> whom we mentioned, cannot be achieved except after correcting <em>‘aqeedah</em> such that all worship is for Allaah alone, and worship of everything else is abandoned. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has promised those who truly believe (have true <em>eemaan</em>) amongst you, and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them rulership upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their religion for them, grant them authority to practise the religion which He chose for them and ordered. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear, providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me. Then whoever rejects this favour by disobedience to their Lord, then they are the rebellious transgressors.”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these people wish to establish the Islamic State before purifying the lands of idolatrous beliefs which take shape in the worship of the dead, and devotion to tombs, such as is no different to the worship of al-Laat, al-’Uzzaa and the third of them <em>Manaat</em>,[4] rather it is worse. So they are attempting that which is impossible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed establishment and application of the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> and the prescribed punishments; establishment of the Islamic State; avoidance of whatever is prohibited; and achievement of whatever is obligatory &#8211; all of these things are from the rights of <em>tawheed</em>, and matters which perfect it and follow on from it. So how can we give attention to that which is subsidiary whilst neglecting that which is of primary importance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is my view that the fact that these groups are at variance with the methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah is a result of their ignorance of this methodology, and the ignorant person is not suitable to be a caller, since one of the most important conditions for <em>da’wah</em> is knowledge, as Allaah, the Most High, says about His Prophet,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , this is my way, I call to Allaah (i.e. to the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, with no partner) upon certain knowledge &#8211; I, and those who follow me. I declare Allaah free and far removed from all that they associate as partners with Him, and I am free of those who worship anything else along with Him.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So one of the most important qualifications for a caller (<em>daa&#8217;ee</em>) is knowledge.[6] Then we see that these groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) which attribute themselves to <em>da’wah</em> are at variance with each other. Each group lays down a programme different to the programme of the others and follows a different methodology to it. This is the inevitable consequence of contradicting the methodology of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , since the way and methodology of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   is a single way, containing no division, nor divergence, as Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say, Muhammad (</strong><strong>صلّى الله عليه وسلّم</strong><strong> )  , this is my way, I call to Allaah (i.e. to the testification that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, alone, with no partner) upon certain knowledge &#8211; I, and those who follow me.”</strong>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the followers of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )   are upon this single way and are not divided and split. Rather those who contradict this way are the ones who divide amongst themselves, as Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“This is my Straight Path, so follow it, and do not follow any of the other paths, for they will split you and take you away from that way which He prescribed for you.”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So because these groups (<em>Jamaa&#8217;aat</em>) are a threat to Islaam which may obstruct it, or prevent people from entering into it, then this is something which must be properly explained, and it must be made clear that this is something which is not from Islaam at all. Allaah, the Most High, says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Those who divide up the true religion and break up into sects and parties, you, O Muhammad, have nothing to do with them.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So since explanation of this is obligatory and it is binding to make it clear, a group of scholars having sincere concern for Islaam and the required level of knowledge and research took on the task of indicating the mistakes of these groups and explaining where they are at variance in <em>da’wah</em> with the methodology of the Prophets, so that they may return to what is correct. Indeed the truth is that which the Muslim always seeks, and so that those who do not realise their errors may not be beguiled by them. So from these scholars who took on this great duty of acting upon the saying of the Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  , <em>“The religion is sincerity/sincere advice, the religion is sincerity/sincere advice, the religion is sincerity/sincere advice.” We said, “To whom, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said, “To Allaah, and to His Book, and to His Messenger, and to the rulers of the Muslims and their common folk,”</em> &#8211; from those who explained this matter and gave sincere advice about it is the noble Shaykh, Dr. Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee in his book entitled, &#8216;The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah, That is the Way of Wisdom and Intelligence.&#8217; For he explains, may Allaah grant him success and reward him with good, the Methodology of the Messengers in calling to Allaah, as it is shown in the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah </em>of His Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم )  . He presents the methodologies of the variant groups in the light of this in order to clearly show the difference between the methodology of the Messengers and these differing and contrasting methodologies which are at variance with it. He discusses these methodologies in the scholarly way and in a just way, whilst quoting examples and witnesses to what he says. So his book, and all praise and thanks are for Allaah, accomplishes the goal, and is fully sufficient for those who desire the truth, and is a proof upon those who are stubborn and obstinate in opposing what is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah to reward him for his work, and to cause it to be of benefit, and may Allaah send praise and blessings of peace upon Muhammad, his family and true followers, and His Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] The proof for this is the Saying of Allaah, the Most High, <strong>“Allaah does not forgive that partners should be set up with Him in worship, but He forgives whatever is lesser than that to whom He pleases.”</strong> [Soorah an-Nisaa (4):48]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] But some of those who claim to be callers to Islaam, if you were to ask them, “What is Islaam?” “What are the things which negate Islaam?” Then they would not be able to give a correct answer, so how can it be permissible for such a person to be a caller (<em>daa&#8217;ee</em>)?!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>.. So I am amazed at the situation of many callers today who see the manifestation of <em>shirk </em>in front of their eyes, yet it does not cause them any concern whatsoever and they do not give any attention to it. Indeed what is even worse is that they complain about those who criticise it and who feel pained by this evil state of affairs which remains from the days of ignorance.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">.. intellect, wisdom and the natural way therefore necessitates that the starting point is to wage war against the danger of <em>shirk</em>, and that the call of the Prophets and their followers should continue fighting it for as long as anything of it remains, or any form or manifestation of it continues. So if a nation is afflicted by matters damaging to its <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and <em>shirk</em> which destroys its <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and also is beset by economic and political problems, then where is wise treatment of the problems to begin?! As for the Prophets, then they did not begin except with applying their full efforts to treating problems facing <em>‘aqeedah</em>. Then beginning by seeking to treat the most dangerous problem is a matter about which all humans with intellect agree upon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So, for example, if a person with intellect saw a snake and an ant moving towards a person, then his intellect would lead him to hasten to repel or kill the snake due to the greater danger which it poses to a person. It is not possible that he would divert his attention to the ant, nor even to a thousand such ants. Also if a number of people possessing intellect saw that a fierce lion and a number of rats attacked them all at once, then they would all strive together to prevent the attack of the lion and they would forget all the rats, even if a group of frogs came with them. And if a group of travellers came to a point where they had no choice but to take one of two roads: the first passed by volcanoes which were emitting flames and fire, and flinging out rocks and boulders. Then the second road passed through areas of thorny bushes, and sun-baked ground and was subject to the heat of the sun. Then anyone with intellect would not choose except to take the second road.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So now let us think about the most severe problems and ills. I mean the problems in political affairs, social affairs and economic affairs, and the worst of these is corruption in matters relating to rulership and judgement. Then let us weigh this against corruption in matters of <em>‘aqeedah</em>. So are these two things equal in weight with Allaah and with the Prophets, or is it the case that one is more severe, dangerous and worse in its consequences?!! So in the scale of Allaah and the scale of the Prophets the most dangerous of these two, and the one which has the greater demand for attention throughout the ages, and with all the Messengers, is <em>shirk</em> and its manifestations, whose evil and corruption cannot be matched by any other evil no matter how great. So upon this we repeat and say, “<span style="color:#ff0000;">All of the Prophets began with correction of matters of <em>‘aqeedah</em>, and by waging war upon <em>shirk</em> and its manifestations</span>,” and this is what is demanded by wisdom and intellect and that is due to the following reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Firstly</span>,</strong> that corruption relating to matters of the <em>‘aqeedah</em> of the people: <em>shirk</em>, false superstitions and beliefs, and the various types of misguidance, is thousands of times more dangerous than the corruption resulting from the corruption in rulership and other affairs. Indeed if we do not say and firmly believe this then we have without knowing it discredited and belittled the Messengers, and we seek Allaah’s refuge from misguidance. Indeed this corruption encompasses the ruler and the ruled. So the rulers themselves in every time and place, except for the Believers from them, humble themselves to the idols, false-gods and tombs. They construct them, protect them, worship them and present offerings to them. They firmly believe that they have some supernatural power over and above their own authority. So they hold that these things cause harm and benefit for them due to the unseen power and authority which they think they possess, or at the very least they think they can intercede with Allaah in order for their problems to be reduced. The clearest example of the submission of the rulers to the idols is the example of the despot who claimed divinity, the Pharaoh, who said, boasting:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I am your Lord, the Most High.”</strong>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I know of no other god for you besides me.”</strong>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the leaders of his people said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Will you leave Moosaa and his people to cause mischief in the land when they have abandoned worship of you and worship of your gods?”</strong>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Namrood, the king of the Chaldeans who claimed lordship for himself. When Ibraaheem, <em>‘alayhis-salaam, </em>broke the idols, Namrood sought to burn Ibraaheem to take revenge for these idols, because they were the gods which he worshipped. Likewise the kings of India and Persia worship idols and worship fire. The kings of Rome in the past and the present-day rulers of Europe and America worship the cross and worship images. And how many of the past and present-day rulers of the Muslims are afflicted by the trial caused by the dead, so that they build tombs over them, and their hearts are attached to them in love, hope and fear. They fall into that which Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) feared for his <em>ummah</em> and which he warned against. So the seriousness and the soundness of the methodology will therefore be clear to you, and also the importance of the firm stance taken by the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) with regard to idols and tombs. Furthermore the wisdom of Ibraaheem will become clear to you, and the depth of his thinking and its extent when he made the enduring call which resounds in all corners and in every generation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And keep me and my sons far removed from worshipping the idols. O my Lord, they have caused the misguidance of many of the people. So whoever follows me in what I am upon (<em>eemaan</em> in Allaah, making worship purely for Allaah and disassociation from the worship of idols) then he is from my people (upon my way and religion), and whoever disobeys me, then indeed You are the Most Forgiving, Most Merciful.”</strong>[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So you see Ibraaheem, who was fully upon the truth and the right way, seeking Allaah’s refuge from the evils and danger of the idols, and not seeking His refuge from the evils and danger of the rulers, despite the level of their corruption and their danger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Secondly</span>,</strong> the people were upon a single religion (Islaam), upon guidance, but then they diverged from it, so Allaah sent the Prophets as bringers of good tidings of reward for the obedient Believers, and warners of Allaah’s punishment for the disobedient unbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We do not send Our Mesengers except with good news for the obedient that Paradise and success on the Day of Resurrection is the reward for obedience to Me, and with a warning for those who disobey and reject My commands that We will punish them, so that they may die aware of that. So whoever believes the Messengers and acts righteously in this world by following what they are upon then there will be no fear upon them when they meet their Lord, nor will they grieve about what they justify behind in the world.”</strong>[5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Messengers who were sent with the good news of Allaah’s reward for those who obey Allaah, do as He commands and believe in His Messengers, and warners of Allaah’s punishment for those who disobey Allaah, contravene His commands and disbelieve in His Messengers, so that those who disbelieve in Allaah and worship others besides Him may have no excuse to avoid punishment after the sending of the Messengers.”</strong>[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Mesenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, <em>“There is no one to whom granting excuse is more beloved than Allaah, therefore He sent the bringers of good-tidings and the warners.”</em>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So are the Messengers charged with anything but to clearly convey the Message?”</strong>[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Messenger’s duty is but to clearly convey the Message.”</strong>[9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So if you deny Our Messenger, O people, and reject his command for you to worship your Lord and to free yourselves from the worship of idols, then nations before you denied their Messengers who called them to the truth, so Allaah sent His punishment upon them and will do the same with you. The Messenger&#8217;s duty is but to clearly convey the Message.”</strong>[10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this duty of warning and bringing good tidings and conveying the Message is a very exalted, sublime and lofty duty. It is enough in this regard that it was the duty of the Prophets and fully concorded with their lofty station, since it the hardest and the greatest task taken up by mankind. It was then taken up by their inheritors from the true and sincere callers who follow their methodolgy, therefore Allaah’s Mesenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, <em>“The people who are most severely tried are the Prophets, then those most like them, then those most like them.”</em> We have also already mentioned the extent of the difficulties faced by the caller to <em>tawheed</em> and that others are unable to persevere in this sphere.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">Thirldy</span>,</strong> Allaah, the One free of all imperfections, and the Most High, did not start by commanding and making it a duty upon them, as is seen from the stories of their lives, that they should establish states and cause the downfall of others, and this is perfect wisdom since the call to establish a state attracts the seekers of this world, and those who seek after self-elevation and positions of power, and those who have personal goals and grudges, and aspirations and ambitions.[11] So these types of people quickly respond to the call to establish a state which they think will enable them to attain their goals, their desires and their ambitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to the like of these considerations, and Allaah knows best, and due to other reasons known by Allaah, the Creator, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise, the calls of the Prophets and their methodologies were far removed from using these flashy and attractive slogans or those which clearly appeal to short-term ambitions and desires. Rather they followed a methodology which is wise, unblemished and noble. It involves being tried and tested. So they are followed upon this way and believed in by every true and sincere person free of selfish ambitions and personal goals. Such a person does not desire through his <em>eemaan</em>, his <em>tawheed</em> and his obedience to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) except Paradise and the Pleasure of his Lord. He does not fear except from His Anger and His severe punishment. Therefore they are only followed generally by the poor, the needy and the weak. Allaah, the Most High, says, quoting what the people of Nooh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“They said, ‘Are we to believe in you, O Nooh, and affirm what you call us to, when it is only the lowly people who follow you?’”</strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said concerning the people of Saalih:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The heads of the people who haughtily rejected Faith said to those who they held to be lowly, to those who believed in and followed Saalih and what he came with, ‘Do you really know that Saalih is one sent by Allaah?’ They said, ‘We indeed attest and believe in the truth and guidance which Allaah has sent him with.’ The haughty ones said, ‘We deny and disbelieve that which you believe in.’”</strong>[13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also amongst the questions which Heraclius asked Aboo Sufyaan was, “Is it the noble of the people who follow him or the weak amongst them?” Aboo Sufyaan replied, “Rather it is the weak amongst them.” So Heraclius said, “I asked you ‘Is it the noble of the people who follow him or the weak amongst them,’ and you mentioned that it is the weak amongst them, and it is they who are the followers of the Mesengers.” So the call to establish a state is far far easier, and people respond more quickly to it since most people are seekers after this world and followers of desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also because of the reasons, the consequences and the difficulties in the way of the calls of the Messengers we find that they are not followed except by a small number of people. So Nooh remained, for nine hundred and fifty years,[14] calling to Allaah, yet despite this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“None but a few believed along with him.”</strong>[15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ibn &#8216;Abbaas, <em>radiyallaahu ‘anhumaa, </em>who said, <em>“Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, ‘The nations were presented before me, and I saw a Prophet and with him was a small group of people, and I saw a Prophet along with one man or two men, and a Prophet accompanied by nobody. Then I saw a huge crowd of people and I thought that they were my ummah. So it was said to me, “This is Moosaa and his people. But rather look to the horizon.” So I looked and saw a huge crowd, so it was said to me, “This is your ummah, and from them are seventy thousand who will enter Paradise without any reckoning.”’”</em>[16]<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ibraaheem, the chosen and beloved Friend of Allaah, who refuted and silenced the <em>mushriks </em>with irrefutable and clear proofs. Allaah says regarding him and those who believed along with him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So Loot belived in him and attested to the truth of what he came with, and Ibraaheem said, ‘Indeed I will emigrate (to the land of <em>Shaam</em>) for the sake of my Lord. Indeed He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.’”</strong>[17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to Loot and those who were saved from the punishment along with him, and perhaps they were his daughters alone:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So We brought out those who were Believers from the town, and We did not find there except a single household of Muslims.”</strong>[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But none of this diminishes the rank of the Prophets by the slightest degree, rather they are upon the highest rank and are the noblest and most distinguished of the people and the most honourable. They stand above all the people in manhood, bravery, excellence of language and eloquence, and in their clarity of explanation, their sincerity and sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also established their duty of calling to <em>tawheed</em>, propagating the Message, giving the good tidings and the warnings, and they fulfilled this in the most complete manner. So the fact that they had few followers or some of them had no followers, is purely the fault of the nations which refused to accept the call since, in their view, they did not satisfy their lowly goals. Then it may be that they respond to his call, or a large number of them do so, and so they gain a state, as a goodly fruit due to their <em>eemaan</em>, their affirmation of what the Prophet came with, and their righteous actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They thus establish the obligation upon them of fighting <em>Jihaad</em> to raise up the Word of Allaah, and of following and applying the <em>Sharee&#8217;ah</em> and the prescribed punishments and other matters prescrbed for them by Allaah. This is what happened with our Prophet Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and his noble Companions. Allaah crowned their <em>eemaan</em>, their righteous actions, and their exemplary perseverance when facing the harm and oppression of the <em>mushriks</em>, by aiding them and making their <em>Deen</em> uppermost, and by establishing them upon the earth as Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah has promised those who truly believe (have true <em>eemaan</em>) amongst you, and act in obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, that He will grant them rulership upon the earth just as He granted it to those before them, and that He will establish their religion for them grant them authority to practice the religion which He chose for them and ordered. And He will certainly change their situation to one of security, after their fear, providing that they worship and obey Me, not associating anything else in worship with Me.”</strong>[19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then sovereignty was offered to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) in Makkah but he refused and he continued calling to <em>tawheed</em> and waging war against <em>shirk</em> and the idols. So when Quraysh became troubled by the call of Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) they sent ’Utbah ibn Rabee’ah and he came to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) and said, “O son of my brother, you know the excellence you hold amongst us with regard to your position in the tribe and your lineage, but you have brought a matter which is very serious for your people. Because of it you have split their united body, caused their youth to behave foolishly and you have abused their idols with it, and their religion. You have also declared their fore-fathers to be infidels because of it. So listen to me and I will offer you some things which you may consider, and hopefully some of them will be acceptable to you.” So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) said, “Speak, O Abul-Waleed, I will listen.” He said, “O son of my brother, if what you desire by this matter that you have come with is wealth, then we will gather wealth for you from our wealth until you are one of the richest of us. <strong>And if you wish by it for high position, then we will give you such authority that we will not do anything without your approval, and if you wish by it for sovereignty, then we will make you sovereign over us.</strong> But if it is the case that what comes to you is a demon which you see and cannot get rid of, then we will seek after a medical cure for you and will expend our money until we can get you cured of it. Since a demon may take hold of a person until he is cured and relieved of it,” or as he said. Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) was listening to him, then he said, “Have you finished, O Abul-Waleed?” He said, “Yes.” He said, “Then listen to me.” He said, “I will do so.” He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“In the name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. <em>Haa Meem</em>. This Qur&#8217;aan is the Revelation sent down by the Most Merciful, the Bestwoer of Mercy. A Book whose <em>Aayaat</em> are made clear, a recital in pure Arabic for those who know (the pure Arabic language), bringing them good tidings of Paradise if they believe in it and act upon it, and as a warning to those who disbelieve in it and do not act in obedience to Allaah, that they will receive punishment and dwell forever in Hell in the Hereafter. But most of them turn away haughtily and refuse to listen to it.”</strong>[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) continued reciting it to him. When ’Utbah heard it he remained silent and sat with his hands behind his back, resting upon them and listening. So when Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came to the <em>Aayah</em> of prostration in it he prostrated and then said, “You have heard what you have heard O Abul-Waleed, so now it is up to you&#8230;” So ’Utbah went back to Quraysh and when he sat with them they said, “What has happened with you, O Abul-Waleed?” He said, “What happened is that I heard the like of which, by Allaah, I have never heard. By Allaah, it is not sorcery, nor poetry, nor divining. O Quraysh, obey me and let the decision be mine. Leave the man and let him continue in what he is upon. Keep away from him since, by Allaah, his saying which I heard will come to have great importance. So if the (other) Arabs kill him, then you will be rid of him due to the action of others, and if he conquers the Arabs, then his sovereignty is your sovereignty, his power is your power and you will be the ones fortunate with regard to him.” They said, “By Allaah, he has performed magic upon you with his tongue, O Abul-Waleed.” He said, “This is my opinion with regard to him, you may do whatever you see fit.”[21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Ishaaq reports with his chain of narration to Ibn ’Abbaas that a group of Quraysh gathered and made an offer close to the offer made by ’Utbah and his saying to Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) . So he (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) answered them by saying, “I am not afflicted by what you say. I have not come with that which I have come with seeking your wealth, nor seeking status above you, nor sovereignty over you, but rather Allaah has sent me as a Messenger to you, and has sent down a Book to me, and has ordered me to be a bringer of good tidings and a warner to you. So I have conveyed to you the revealed Messages from my Lord, and I have sincerely advised you. So if you accept what I have brought to you then you will have your share in this world and the Hereafter. But if you refuse to accept it from me then I will patiently await Allaah’s Order, until Allaah judges between me and you&#8230;”[22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) rejected the request of one of the tribes that they should be in charge of the affairs after his death, if the report is authentic. Ibn Ishaaq said that az-Zuhree narrated to me that Allaah’s Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم ) came to Banoo ’Aamir ibn Sa’sa’ah and called them to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and presented himself to them. So a man from them called Bayharah ibn Firaas said, “By Allaah, if I were to take hold of this young man from Quraysh I would devour the Arabs with him,” then he said, “If we give you our pledge of allegiance upon your affair, then Allaah gives you victory over those who oppose you, then will we be in authority after you?” He said, “The affair is for Allaah, He places authority wherever He wills.” So he said to him, “Are we to risk our necks before the Arabs for you, then when Allaah grants you victory, authority will be for other than us?! We have no need of your affair.” So they rejected him.[23]</p>

<span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong> &amp; That They are Both Created</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[91] Ahl us-Sunnah testify and believe that Paradise and Hell are both created. They will remain eternally and the people of Paradise will never leave it. Also the inhabitants of Hell, who were created for it, will never come out of it. Death will be sacrificed on the wall between Paradise and Hell, then a call will be made that day:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">..O people of Paradise, there is eternity and no death. O people of Hell, there is eternity and no death.</span></strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is reported authentically from the Messenger of Allaah [صلى الله عليه وسلم) [107)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Audio Lecture by: <strong>Abu Muhammad al Maghribee</strong> (<em>hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Believers Will See Their Lord In The Hereafter</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[90] <em>Ahl us-Sunnah</em> believe and testify that the Believers will see their Lord, The Most Blessed and The Most High, on the Day of judgement with their eyes. They will look at Him, as it is reported in the authentic <em>ahaadeeth</em> from the Messenger of Allaah, (صلى الله عليه وسلم). He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed, you will see your Lord like you see the full Moon. ”</span> </em>[105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The comparison (like) mentioned in this hadeeth is between the two (seeing’s) not between that which is seen in each case.[106] The <em>ahaadeeth</em> of the vision are related in the book <em>al-Intisaar</em> with all the <em>asaaneed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[105] Related by Ibn Khuzaimah in <em>Kitaab ut-Tawheed</em> [ 1:407-411 ]. See also al-Bukhaaree [554], Muslim [183l and Aboo Dawood [ 4729 ]. The Prophet, (صلى الله عليه وسلم ), said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;When the people of Paradise enter Paradise, Allaah, the Most Mighty and the Most Majestic, will say: ‘<strong>Do you wish for anything extra that I may give you</strong>?’ They will say: Have you not brightened our faces? Have You not entered us into Paradise and saved us from the fire? So He will remove the screen and they will not have been given anything more beloved to them, than looking at their Lord, the Most Mighty and the Most Majestic.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Related by Muslim [181]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[106] i.e The similarity between seeing the full moon and seeing Allaah is in the seeing, not between the full moon and Allaah. This fine point is a refutation on those who claim that Ahl us Sunnah here have made a comparison between Allaah and His creation ( i.e. the full moon).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[89] They believe in the Hawd [102] and the Kawthar. Also in the entering of a group of Ahl ut-Tawheed into Paradise without account. There will also be a group from them who will have an easy reckoning, without any harm befalling them, or any punishment overtaking them. A group from them who had sinned will enter the Fire, then they will be freed and led out of it and joined up with their brothers who preceded them in entering Paradise. [103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They ( i.e. Ahl Hadeeth ) know with certainty and truth that the sinful from amongst the Ahl ut Tawlieed will not remain in the Fire eternally, and will not be left there forever. [104] As for the unbelievers, they shall abide in Hell forever and never come out of it nor shall they ever be reprieved. Allaah will never leave in the Fire anyone, who was disobedient from Ahl ul-Eemaan.</p>

<p>Audio Lecture by: <strong>Abu Muhammad al Maghribee</strong> (<em>hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 20: The Outcome of the Slaves is Unknown</strong></span></p>
<p>[115] The People of <em>Hadeeth</em> believe and testify that the end of the slave is unknown. No one knows what his end shall be. They (People of <em>Hadeeth</em>) do not pass judgement on a specific person that he will be from the people of Paradise or from the people of Hell, because that is something which is hidden from them. They do not know in which state a person will die, whether it is upon <em>Islaam</em> or unbelief, so due to this fact they say:</p>
<p>“Indeed we are Believers, if Allaah wills.”</p>
<p>That is, from those Believers who will have a good end, if Allaah wills [134]</p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">[134] TRANSLATORS NOTE ~ The Prophet(صلى الله عليه وسلم), said:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do not be delighted by the actions of anyone until you see how he ends up&#8221;.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;">Related by Ahmad [ 3:120,223 ] and lbn Abee ‘Aasim [ 393-395 ]. The isnaad is Saheeh.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 21: The Ruling Upon On One Who Died Upon Belief Or Unbelief</strong></span></p>
<p>[l16] And the People of <em>Hadeeth</em> witness for the one who dies upon <em>Islaam</em> that his end will be Paradise even if their fate was written by Allaah that they will be punished with the Fire for a period, as a result of their sins which they committed and did not repent from. They will eventually enter Paradise and no one from amongst the Muslims will remain in Hell eternally. This is a great blessing and favour from Allaah. If one dies upon unbelief, and Allaah’s protection is sought from this, he will be thrown into the Fire and he will not be saved from it, and he will stay there forever.</p>

<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[The below is the Text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Chapter 14: We do not Call a Muslim an Unbeliever Due to his Sins</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[100] Ahl us-Sunnab believe that if a Believer commits sins, however small or large they may be, he does not become an unbeliever. If he leaves this world without making any repentance from them and he dies upon Tawheed and Ikhlaas, then his affair is entirely up to Allaah, The Most Mighty and The Most Majestic. If He wills, He may forgive him and enter him into Paradise on the Day of judgement, safe and sound without being afflicted by the fire and without being punished for his perpetration of the sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He will be brought on the Day of judgement with his sins and misdeeds. If Allaah wills, He will punish him for a period in the Fire. If He punishes him, he will not however remain in the Fire forever, but he will eventually be freed and taken out from it, to the place of tranquility and content.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[101] Our Shaykh, the Imaam Aboo Tayyeb Sahl ibn Muhammad as- Sa’lookee, raheemahullaah, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The sinning believer, even if he is punished by the fire, he will not be thrown in there the same way as the unbeliever is thrown in the fire. He will not remain there the same way as the unbeliever will remain there nor will he be wretched and miserable the same way the unbeliever is wretched and miserable.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[102] This means that the unbeliever will be dragged to the Fire on his face, he will be thrown in there chained, and then hung upside down, shackled by having his hands tied to his neck with strong and heavy chains. However, the sinning believer, if he is afflicted by the Fire, he will enter it like a criminal enters a prison in this world on his feet, not upside down nor thrown in. The meaning of his statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;&#8230;he will not, be thrown in there the same way as the unbeliever is thrown in the fire&#8230;,” means that the unbeliever will have all his body burned and every time his skin is roasted through it will be replaced with another, so that he may taste the punishment again, as Allaah informs us in His Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed, those who have disbelieved in our signs, we shall burn them in a fire. We shall change their skins for other skins, so that they may taste the punishment again.&#8221;</span> [Soorah an-Nisaa 4;56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the believers they will not have their faces scorched by the Fire, and their limbs which they used for sujood will not be burned. For Allaah has forbidden the Fire from burning them. “ [113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[103] His saying: “&#8230;he will not stay in the Fire like the unbeliever would&#8230;”, means that the unbeliever will remain in it forever and never come out of it. Allaah will never leave any sinning believer in the Fire forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: “&#8230;he will not be afflicted like the unbeliever”, means that the unbeliever has no hope of the Mercy of Allah and no opportunity for reprieve from the punishment. As for the believer he will never be cut off from the hope of the Mercy of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The final outcome for all the believers is Paradise, as they were created for it and it was created for them, as a Mercy and a Blessing from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[113] The prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: &#8220;Allaah has forbidden the fire to eat up the traces of Sujood&#8221;. Related by al-Bukhaaree [806] and Muslim [182]</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 25: Their Position With Regards To The Dispute Between The Companions</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[130] The People of Hadeeth hold that one must refrain ( from discussing the dispute between the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم). The tongues must be purged from mentioning anything which entails the attribution of shortcomings and deficiencies to them. [146] They (The People of Hadeeth ), hold that one should seek Allaah’s Mercy for all of them and have love and defend each and every one of them. They also hold that one should exalt the status of the Prophet’s wives, radiyallaabu ‘anhum, supplicate for them, recognise their excellence and acknowledge that they are the Mothers of the Believers.</p>

<p>Audio Lecture by: <strong>Abu Muhammad al Maghribee</strong> (<em>hafidhahullaah)</em></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Chapter 28: The Whisperings of the Devils (Shayaateen)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>[The below is the text from the Book]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[134] The People of Hadeeth believe that Allah, The One free from all deficiencies, Created the devils with the characteristic of whispering to mankind and they intend their downfall, so they lie in wait for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَإِنَّ الشَّيَاطِينَ لَيُوحُونَ إِلَىٰ أَوْلِيَائِهِمْ لِيُجَادِلُوكُمْ ۖ وَإِنْ أَطَعْتُمُوهُمْ إِنَّكُمْ لَمُشْرِكُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed the devils do inspire their friends to dispute with you and if you obey them, then indeed you will become an polytheist.&#8221;</span> (Sooratul-An&#8217;aam 6:121)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[135] Allaah empowers them (the devils ) over whomsoever He wishes and He protects whomsoever He wishes from their plots and deceptions. Allaah The Most Mighty and Majestic says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَاسْتَفْزِزْ مَنِ اسْتَطَعْتَ مِنْهُم بِصَوْتِكَ وَأَجْلِبْ عَلَيْهِم بِخَيْلِكَ وَرَجِلِكَ وَشَارِكْهُمْ فِي الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَوْلَادِ وَعِدْهُمْ ۚ وَمَا يَعِدُهُمُ الشَّيْطَانُ إِلَّا غُرُورًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ عِبَادِي لَيْسَ لَكَ عَلَيْهِمْ سُلْطَانٌ ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِرَبِّكَ وَكِيلًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And Istafziz [literally means: befool them gradually] those whom you can among them with your voice (i.e. songs, music, and any other call for Allah&#8217;s disobedience), make assaults on them with your cavalry and your infantry, mutually share with them wealth and children (by tempting them to earn money by illegal ways usury, etc., or by committing illegal sexual intercourse, etc.), and make promises to them.&#8221; But Satan promises them nothing but deceit.Verily! My slaves (i.e the true believers of Islamic Monotheism), you have no authority over them. And All-Sufficient is your Lord as a Guardian.</span>(Sooratul-Israa 17:64-65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَهُ سُلْطَانٌ عَلَى الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ<br />
إِنَّمَا سُلْطَانُهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ يَتَوَلَّوْنَهُ وَالَّذِينَ هُم بِهِ مُشْرِكُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily! He has no power over those who believe and put their trust only in their Lord (Allah).His power is only over those who obey and follow him (Satan), and those who join partners with Him (Allah)</span>  (Sooratul-Nahl 16:99-100)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[131] The People of Hadeeth believe and testify that no one is entitled to Paradise, even if he had performed good deeds and his worship was the most sincere, or his obedience was the purest obedience and his way was a pleasing one, unless Allaah favours him, thereby granting it to him, through His Blessings and Graciousness. Since the good deeds which the person performed was not made easy for him except by the facilitation of Allaah, Mighty is His Name. So if He had not facilitated it for him, the person would not have been able to accomplish this deed and (similarly) if He did not guide him to it he would never have accomplished it out of his own effort and exhoflation. Allaah, The Most Mighty and The Most Majestic says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَلَوْلَا فَضْلُ اللَّهِ عَلَيْكُمْ وَرَحْمَتُهُ مَا زَكَىٰ مِنكُم مِّنْ أَحَدٍ أَبَدًا وَلَٰكِنَّ اللَّهَ يُزَكِّي مَن يَشَاءُ ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And had it not been for the Grace of Allah and His Mercy on you, not one of you would ever have been pure from sins. But Allah purifies (guides to Islam) whom He wills, and Allah is All-Hearer, All-Knower.&#8221;</span> (An-Nur 24:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَقَالُوا الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ الَّذِي هَدَانَا لِهَٰذَا وَمَا كُنَّا لِنَهْتَدِيَ لَوْلَا أَنْ هَدَانَا اللَّهُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And they will say, &#8220;Praise to Allah , who has guided us to this; and we would never have been guided if Allah had not guided us.&#8221;</span> (Al-A&#8217;raf 7:43)</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Shaykh Rabee al-Madkhali was asked: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Are there any remnants from the Prophet?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Answer :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing now from the remnants of the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam</em>. Whoever claims that there remains something from his belongings then he is a liar and a crazy foolish person!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We visited India and found people who claimed that they had a hair of the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam</em>. They are liars and they are cheaters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We saw, I think it was either in Pakistan or in Bangladesh a Masjid, where they claimed they had the foot print of the Prophet <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in Delhi there was a Masjid and the Imam was a Bukhari and he had a lot of influence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Non-Muslim European men and women who were barely dressed would visit this Masjid.  They would go to a place in the Masjid and this Bukhari person would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘At this place is a remnant of the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa Sallam</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It had the like of a dome built over it. You see shameless women and men gathering to view the footprint of the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I saw this evil and I came to this Imam to advise him and I said: ‘You people claim that the Prophet <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam –</em> came to this place and this is his remnant/sign? ‘</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied: the people say such-and-such.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him: ‘O Brother we read history and came to know that the Messenger <em>-alayhi as Sallat wa sallam-</em> was taken up to the heavens, he went from Makkah to Madinah and he went out for battles to well known areas and he went to Tabuk, but we did not find in history that the Messenger came to Delhi and stood at this place! !</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was going around in circles. . . . then I spoke to his father when he came – and I had a Salafi with me translating – his father said about me: ‘This is bad manners’ [i.e. towards the Prophet’s hair.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then this Salafi who was with me informed me:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘That when King Saud <em>-rahimullaah-</em> visited India and came to Banaras  which is the main center idols and deities – this place Banaras is like Makkah –  In this place they have many idols,  so when they heard that he will visit this place they covered these idols – I swear by Allaah they covered them up – why ? Out of fear of Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he came to this Masjid to pray and they said to him: Here is the footprint of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> so he quickly left that place and came to know that this is foolishness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who singles out Allaah alone has knowledge and insight, he has understanding, the people of Bida have stupidity, ignorance and foolishness or evilness. May Allaah bless you. So there are many claimants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Turkey they claim that the Prophet’s hair is present there,  some of the people claim that the Mus’haf which Ali <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> wrote with his hand is present etc….. these are lies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah of Allaah regarding these things is that they pass away and cease to exist, this is the Sunnah which Allaah -Subhanahu wa Ta’ala- placed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah send praise and security upon Muhammad, upon his family and his Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[09/08 1:18 am] Whatsapp Rabee Almaqaalih:</p>
<p>من مجالس شيخنا ربيع العامرة بالنصح والتوجيه</p>
<p>كنت عنده يوم الأربعاء بتاريخ ٢١|٤|١٤٣٣ من هجرة</p>
<p>نبينا محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم.<br />
وكان يتكلم على الغرور ويذمه ثم ذكر :<br />
《 عبد الله القصيمي 》<br />
قال : كان رجلا ذكيا جدا له كتابات قوية لو ثبت يمكن يمثل شيخ الإسلام ابن تيمية في هذا العصر !<br />
لكنه ( الغرور ) الذي أضله ، فيه غرور شديد ، والله كنت أقرأ له والتمس الغرور في بعض كتاباته .<br />
ولما نصحه بعض العلماء تكبر للغرور الذي فيه وارتد عن الدين .انتهى<br />
كتبه : أبو حسان سمير القيسي</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the sittings of Shaykh Rabee full of advice and guidance:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I was with the shaykh on Wednesday 21/4/1433 AH and he was speaking about self delusion. He was dispraising it and he then made mention of <strong>&#8220;Abdullah Al-Qaseemi&#8221;</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Rabee said</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;This was an extremely intelligent man who had powerful writings. Had he remained firm, he could well have been like the Shaykh ul Islam ibn Taymiyyah of our times! However, self delusion _(alghuroor)_ is what caused him to stray. He was severely deluded by himself. By Allah, I would read his books and sense self delusion in some of his writings. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When some of the scholars advised him, he became haughty due to that very same delusion that he had (about himself) and thereafter he apostated and left the Religion.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[End of quote]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Written by Hassaan Sameer Al-Qaysee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">I, Nadeem Ahsan-Shah received this from brother Rabee Al-Maqaalih of Madinah (via a whatsapp group) who confirmed to me that he heard this directly from brother Hassaan Sameer Al-Qaysee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Translated by Abu Ishaaq Nadeem Ahsan-Shah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">May Allah keep us firm upon His Deen and protect us from feeling safe from the Hell-Fire.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imam Allaama Shaykh Rabee bin Hadi al-Madkhali -hafidhullaah- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We advise the Salafis to have harmony/solidarity and to adhere to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To have brotherhood upon what is contained in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam of Aqeedah, worship and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having brotherhood for the sake of Allaah Azza wa Jal and to have Eemaan in these principles and these foundations and to love each other for the sake of Allaah Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If a person makes a mistake whether it is a minor one or a major one, advice is given with wisdom and good admonition.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are people who make a claim of Salafeeyah, they are hard and forceful with falsehood, with slander and oppression. They are harsh and hard when being harsh is not required and they have no wisdom whatsoever, nor mercy or any of these things!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">With sadness some people accuse the established Salafis with this exaggeration! This is extreme oppression.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah we wage war against this harshness, the harshness of the Khawarij, we criticize these people who are extreme and delve too deeply and also the harsh ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We criticize those who water-down, belittle and wage war against the principles of Islaam who originate, derive and produce false, unintelligent principles and statements to protect the people of Bida.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We criticize this extremist and we call to the straight path and to that what the Salaf as-Salih were upon of beliefs, actions and manners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are extremists in watering-down, belittling and warring against the principles of Islam and the others are extremists in declaring people innovators and making Takfeer of people, so both of these types deviate from the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah ordered us to have moderation and justice and to be steadfast upon the straight path.&#8217;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are some examples taken from your Gospels [11] that confirm and support what Muhammad came with from the Qur’aan and his teachings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the seventh verse of Chapter 4 of the Gospel of Mathew, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Jesus said to him: ‘Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’”</strong></span> [Matthew 4:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. In this same chapter, there occurs a story about Jesus and the Devil, in which the Devil ordered Jesus to prostrate to him. So the Messiah Jesus responded to him, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Be gone Satan, for it is written: &#8216;You shall worship (prostrate only to) the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve (i.e. worship).’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what all the messengers came with and it is the argument that Jesus used against the Devil. So this clearly proves that all of the prophets including Jesus and Muhammad came to establish that God was One and that He was the Lord and only One deserving of being worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jesus relied on the previously revealed books (from God) as proof, which state that God is the only Lord and that He is the only One who has the right to be worshipped and prostrated to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, Allaah revealed to (Prophet) Muhammad: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And We indeed sent to every nation a messenger (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah alone and avoid the false deities.’ So amongst them were those whom Allaah guided and amongst them were those whose misguidance was justified.”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also revealed to him: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to him: ‘There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped in truth, except Me, so worship Me alone.’”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 23:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these statements that were revealed to Muhammad are in complete conformity with what Jesus stated in his reply to the Devil. It is also in conformity with what Jesus said when calling the Tribe of Israel:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is the Straight Path.”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 19:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it agrees with what he will say on the Day of Judgement when his Lord will ask him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O Jesus, son of Mary, did you tell the people: ‘Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allaah?’ He will reply: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right to say. If I had said such a thing, You would have surely known about it. You know what is in my inner self though I do not know what is in Your Self. Truly, only You are the All-Knowing of all that is hidden. I did not tell them anything except for what You commanded me to tell them, (which was): Worship Allaah, my Lord and your Lord. And I served as a witness for them for as long as I was with them. But when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things.’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:116-117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. In Chapter 11 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 25, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“At that time Jesus declared: ‘I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes (infants).’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Jesus was one of God’s servants and messengers. He acknowledged the right of his Lord who created him and bestowed His blessings on him, and therefore turned to Him, in thanks and affirmation that He alone was the Lord of the heaven and earth. This is since He is the One who created these two creations (the heaven and the earth), as well as everything inside them, in between them and whatever lies below the ground. No one else had any part in this – neither Jesus or anyone else – nor can anyone rival Him in that matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. In Chapter 14 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 23, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And after he had dismissed the crowds, he (Jesus) went up on the mountain by himself to pray.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prayer is one of the greatest acts of worship that can be performed to God, and no one engages in it except for a lowly servant who stands in need of the mercy of his Lord and Creator. This is as Allaah says in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allaah, whereas Allaah is Rich (free of all needs), Most Praiseworthy.”</span> </strong>[Qur’aan 35:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The Messiah (Jesus) will never be too proud to reject being a servant of God, nor the angels who are the ones close (to Him). And whoever is too proud and rejects worshipping Him, then He will gather them all together unto Himself.”</strong> </span>[Qur’aan 4:172]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Jesus was a servant of God, and he was not nor will he ever be too proud to worship Him. This is his condition and the condition of all of the prophets and angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. In Chapter 26 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 39, it states that the Messiah (Jesus):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“fell on his face and prayed, ‘My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in this text, there is proof that Jesus was a servant (worshipper) of God who had no control over repelling harm from himself or bringing benefit to himself. And there is evidence in this text that he sought refuge in God during times of hardship, seeking His assistance and humbling himself before Him, in order to remove the harm and danger that was approaching him. So he fell prostrate with his face on the ground, seeking nearness to Him, lowering himself before Him, showing his need for Him and expressing the belief that no one has the ability to repel harm except Him. This is the state of all of the messengers, not to mention all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. In Chapter 21 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 46, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“But when they tried to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, since they held him to be a prophet.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is proof in this verse that the masses of people who believed in God and in Jesus were monotheists with pure and sincere faith, and that they believed that Jesus was a messenger and a prophet. This proves that their prophet, Jesus, had taught them this and cultivated them to believe in that. So they did not used to believe that he was God or the son of God, since he would not teach the people these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. In Chapter 23 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 10, it states that Jesus said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Neither be called masters, for you, even the Messiah, has One master.”</span> </strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This text resembles the Qur’anic text in which Allaah informs us that His messenger Jesus told the Tribe of Israel: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And verily, Allaah is my Lord and your Lord.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 3:51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah is the Lord of Jesus, as well as his Master, Nurturer and Owner. He is the Lord, Master and Owner of all mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim scholar, Taqee-ud-Deen al-Hilaalee, pointed out in his treatise “Clear Evidences” that: Some translators have distorted this text, but that the English translation was saved from this corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. In Chapter 17 of the Gospel of John, verse 3, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And this is the eternal life – that they know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This text confirms that which all of the messengers came with, which was that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and it confirms that Jesus was a messenger of God. This was during his time, and every nation had its own time and messenger, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to him: ‘There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped in truth, except Me, so worship Me alone.’”</span> </strong>[Qur’aan 21:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And We indeed sent to every nation a messenger (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah alone and avoid the false deities.’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. In Chapter 12 of the Gospel of Mark, verses 28-30, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he (Jesus) answered them well, asked him, ‘Which commandment is the first of all?’ Jesus answered, ‘The first is: Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is One. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.&#8217;”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the first commandment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in verse 32 of the same chapter, it states that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“The scribe said to him, ‘You are right, teacher. You have truly said that He is One, and there is no other but He.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in verse 34 of the same chapter, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And when Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, ‘You are not far from the kingdom of God.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This first commandment mentioned by Jesus is the same commandment that Allaah prescribed to all of His messengers, including Jesus – and this was the commandment that the messengers passed on to their nations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“He has ordained for you the same religion that He ordained for Noah and which We revealed to you (O Muhammad) and ordained for Abraham, Moses and Jesus – that you should establish the Religion and make no divisions in it. Intolerable for the polytheists is that which you call them to.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 42:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The religion that God ordained for them was the pure monotheistic Faith, which is represented in the statement: “There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.” He ordered all of his messengers to call to this, and it is that which the polytheists found difficult to accept and for which reason they fought against God’s messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the same thing that Abraham and Jacob, also known as Israel, commanded the people with, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And remember when Abraham and (his son) Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House (Ka’bah at Makkah), saying: ‘Our Lord! Accept this from us. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower. Our Lord! Make us submissive unto You, and of our offspring, a nation submissive unto You. And show us how to perform the ceremonies required during the pilgrimage (to the Ka’bah), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful. Our Lord! Send amongst them a messenger of their own (i.e. Muhammad), who shall recite unto them Your verses and teach them the Book and the Wisdom (Prophetic Teachings), and purify them. Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.’ And who turns away from the religion of Abraham except for he who fools himself? Truly, We chose him in this world and in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous. When his Lord said to him: ‘Submit yourself’, he said: ‘I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of all that exists.’ And this (submission to Allaah) was enjoined by Abraham upon his sons, and also by Jacob, saying: ‘O my sons! Allaah has chosen for you the (true) religion, so do not die except while you are Muslims (i.e. submitting to the Will of your Creator).’ Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob? – When he said to his sons: ‘What will you worship after me?’ They said: ‘We shall worship your God, the God of your forefathers – Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac – One God and to Him we submit (as Muslims).’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 2:127-133]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is truly a tremendous religion, in which they submitted their will to the Lord of all that exists, turned to Him in repentance and sought refuge in Him to make their offspring an offspring that submit themselves to God. And they invoked Him to send a messenger from amongst them to them who would recite His verses unto them, teach them the Book and the Wisdom and purify them – the purification and wisdom that would keep them far away from polytheism, foolishness and misguidance. And Allaah rules here that whoever turns away from this religion, which is pure monotheism, only fools himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point derived from this is that the call of all of the prophets was in harmony in that they were calls to Monotheism and to Submission (to God) and that there was no deity that had the right to be worshipped except Allaah. They called their nations to this and counseled those who came after them from their offspring to abide by this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second point we want to focus on here, was the counsel of Israel, who was also known as Jacob. The text of the Bible in this regard is in conformity with the text from the Qur’aan in that the Biblical text indicates we should have love for God. This is also part of Islaam. In fact, the Religion of Islaam also consists of many aspects and great deeds apart from love (for the Creator).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at how Jesus responded and what his tremendous counsel was. And look at the faith of the scribe who had asked the question looking for an answer to benefit from, and his statement: “<strong>You are right Teacher. You have truly said that He is One, and there is no other but He.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And look at how the Messiah responded to him, saying <strong>“You are not far from the kingdom of God.”</strong> This, and Allaah knows best, is a promise from him that he will be in Paradise, and it indicates that anyone who doesn’t believe in the Oneness of God and that He alone should be worshipped will not be allowed entry into Paradise. This is similar to what Allaah says in the Qur’aan, relaying to us what Jesus said to the Tribe of Israel:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Worship Allaah, who is my Lord and your Lord. Verily, whoever ascribes partners to Allaah in worship, Allaah will surely make Paradise forbidden for him and his final abode will be the Hellfire. And the wrongdoers will not have any supporters (in Hell).”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: According to the language of the Torah and the Gospels, every righteous and dutiful follower of God is called a son of God, so Jesus was not particularized with this expression of “son of God.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. In Chapter 5 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 9, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. And in verse 45 of Chapter 5 of the Gospel of Matthew, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. In verse 4 of the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 5, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. In Chapter 6 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 1, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. In Chapter 23 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 9, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.”</strong></span> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses show that use of the terms “father” and “son” to refer to the connection between the Lord and His servant was a practice established in the Bible for all people, so the Messiah, Jesus, was not specifically characterized with this apart from others. [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps all of this was from the behavior of some of the Jews and Christians, but God knows best. This is since Allaah says in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Jews and the Christians say: ‘We are the children of God and His beloved ones.’ Say: ‘Why then does He punish you for your sins?’ Nay, you are but human beings from those He has created. He forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills. And to Allaah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. And to Him is the final return.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any fair and balanced person with sound intellect will realize that the Qur’anic texts we mentioned contain in them a tribute, honor, warm reception and high praise for Jesus. And they confirm that he was a prophet and a messenger, and that he was one of the greatest messengers who carried the banner of Monotheism, called mankind to this Monotheistic Faith, which means making all worship purely for God alone, fought against polytheism, and warned those who adhere to it (polytheism) that they would reside eternally in the Hellfire – what an evil destination!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses from the Qur’aan also show how God absolved Jesus and his mother from the slander that the Jews accused them of, how He raised the status of Jesus and his mother and made the statements of the Jews against him and his mother to be considered as disbelief and immense slander.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the texts of the Qur’aan and the Bible are in conformity with the fact that Jesus was a servant and messenger of God. This is a perfect state that no one can attain except for the great messengers amongst whom was Jesus. The teachings of Prophet Muhammad also professed the same beliefs and the Muslims believed in all of this. So what then is wrong with Islaam and the Muslims? There is nothing wrong with it at all, in the eyes of those with sound intellects and impartiality. Rather, the wrong is against God Himself, since the terrible statement (that Jesus is the son of God), due to which the heavens are ready to tear apart, the earth split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins is the opposite of what is indicated in the Qur’aan, the teachings of Prophet Muhammad and what the Muslims adhere to, not to mention what the monotheistic texts still preserved in the Bible indicate.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, the example of Jesus in the sight of Allaah is like the example of Adam – He created him from dust and then said to him ‘Be’ and he was. This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be from those who doubt. So whoever disputes with you concerning him (i.e. Jesus) after all this knowledge (about him) has come to you, say: ‘Come, let us summon our children and your children, our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves and then invoke God to send His curses on those of us who is lying.’ Verily, this is the true story (about Jesus). And there is no God that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. And indeed Allaah is the All-Mighty, All-Wise.”</strong> [Qur’aan 3:59-62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This great example is a decisive proof that cancels out all the claims of the Christians. This is because if it is not possible or correct according to sound minds, religious doctrines, and innate natures to claim that Adam, whom God created from dust with His Hands and breathed into him his soul, is God or the son of God or part of a divine trinity, then it is for all the more reason that such cannot be claimed for Jesus. This is since the creation of Adam was more remarkable and amazing than that of Jesus, as he was created from dust and dust is not part of the human race.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, Jesus was created from a woman, who is part of the human race, and she carried him in her womb in the same manner that woman carry children, and gave birth to him in the same manner that women give birth to children. So this is from the greatest of proofs that invalidate the false claims and absurd misconceptions of the Christians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a matter of fact, the angels were created from light without any fathers or mothers, and the Devil was created from fire without any parents. So this is something more remarkable and indicative of the great Ability of God, the Creator, Molder and Originator of the heavens and earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the creation of Eve from the rib of Adam, without any mother, was more miraculous than the creation of Jesus, who was conceived, carried in the womb of a woman and given birth to just as normal women give birth to children. So there does not remain any connection for the Christians according to every person possessing intellect, religion and fairness. But in spite of all this, Jesus, in the eyes of Islaam and the Muslims is far more superior than Adam and many of the other prophets and messengers, according to the Qur’aan and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad. This is since Jesus is one of the five messengers possessing strong will and determination, according to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after all this has been said, what is it that will change between the Christians and Islaam, which is the true religion of God and the religion of Jesus and all of the prophets? Won’t they realize that the greatest form of misguidance and disbelief is to claim that God has a wife and a child, since this is the biggest insult and debasement that can be leveled against God, Lord of all that exists? And the greatest denial of Jesus is to disbelieve in the true message that he brought, such as by saying that he is the son of God, etc., even though he clearly stated from the very first day that he was a slave of God who gave him Revelation, made him a prophet, blessed him wherever he was and entrusted him with prayer and charity. These are characteristics that apply to a created being that is raised and nurtured and in need of his Lord, submitting himself to His Majesty and obedient to His commands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Excellent Example</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we have in the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and in all the Prophets of Allaah a good example.  The Messenger was commanded to take those Prophets before him as an example and to follow their guidance and we have been commanded to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and take him as an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow forhe who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much</strong>. &gt;&gt; [al-Ahzab: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This good example is complete in every matter which Muhammad <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> came with<em>;</em> so, he is an example in his <em>‘<strong>Aqeedah</strong></em>, so we believe in that which he believed in; an example in his <strong>worship</strong>, so we worship Allaah making the religion sincerely for Him, following that which the noble Messenger –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam – </em>came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is an example in great manners which perhaps many of the callers to Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> and many of the youth have lost, much of it having been forgotten and some of the youth have forgotten it too.  Indeed Allaah has praised His Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> with eloquent praise and He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>And verily, you are on an exalted standard of character</strong> &gt;&gt; [Qalam: 4]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So the caller to Allaah, the student of knowledge, the instructor and the guide all need to take the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> as an example in their <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and manners.  So if these matters are combined in the caller to Allaah or they are nearly complete then this <em>Dawa’</em> will be successful <em>– InshAllaah –</em> and the caller to Allaah will have presented it in the most beautiful and best form <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the caller to Allaah is deficient in the matters of his <em>Dawa’</em>, being deficient in having noble manners-from which is having patience, wisdom, gentleness, softness and other things which are important, which the <em>Dawa’</em> of the Messengers <em>–alayhim Sallat wa Sallam-</em> requires.  Then this is an apparent deficiency in his <em>Dawa’</em>.  So it is upon him to ensure he manifests those matters completely.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Perhaps many of the people are negligent of this! And this harms the <em>Dawa’</em> of Salafiyyah and harms its people.  Since if these manners are neglected and the<em>Dawa’</em> is presented to the people in a way that they dislike and is made unpleasant and detestable by having harshness, severity and recklessness – and the likes of these things – then this is an obstacle to the <em>Dawa’</em> and to it being accepted.  Since these matters are even disliked in the affairs of the <em>Duniya</em> let alone in the matters of the <em>Deen</em>.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is necessary for the student of knowledge to follow a path of righteous good manners in giving <em>Dawa’</em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sermon consists of the advice to fear Allaah, which is necessary and it is not exemplified except in the lives of the righteous, truthful scholars as in the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah</strong></span>. &gt;&gt;[Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> so you can reach this level and learn so that you can reach that status; because the one who knows the correct <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and rulings, manners and behaviour springing from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> then he is the one who fears Allaah<em>Azza wa Jal</em> and <em>Taqwa</em> is attained with all of these matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when these matters – which we have mentioned – are acknowledged then the slave is driven to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, to having fear of Him and being aware of Him in every time, place and situation.  This is a great station which is the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>That you worship Allaah as if you see Him and if you cannot see Him then know that He sees you</strong></span>.'[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship) is that a person has certainty that Allaah sees him and that Allaah hears all he says and hears; the beating of his heart, the feelings of his heart and what he thinks to himself.   Allaah<em>Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala</em> knows it and hears it and He sees his movements and when he is still.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the true believer regards Allaah with true greatness and he acknowledges that Allaah <em>Subhanah</em> hears everything that he says and knows everything he discusses, or thinks to himself and that Allaah has:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Angels <em>Kirâman </em>(honourable)<em> Kâtibîn</em> writing down (your deeds). They know all that you do</strong></span>. &gt;&gt; [al-Infitar: 11-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these distinguished feelings are found in the soul of a believer then he has acquired the characteristic of <em>Taqwa</em> which causes him to keep away from sinning,<em>Shirk, Bida’</em> and superstitions and he acquires the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em>(perfection of worship) since he is aware of Allaah and he feels that Allaah sees him and he cannot hide anything of his affairs from Allaah not a little nor a lot, not even the like of an atom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a noble awareness and distinguished feeling which pushes one <em>-InshAllaah –</em> to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah.  This cannot be reached except for the one who knows the correct <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, the correct rulings of <em>Halaal</em> and <em>Haraam</em> and knows the commands and prohibitions, the promise and the warnings from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><strong><em>.  </em></strong>They are the ones who deserve the praise of Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> He said; about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah</strong></span>.&gt;&gt; [Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong>Allaah will exalt in degree those of you who believe and those who have been granted knowledge</strong>. &gt;&gt; [al-Mujadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So strive to be from these types of people: i.e. that you combine knowledge and action.  That is the fruit of correct knowledge and having the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> and being aware of Him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon him to learn from the sources which contain the correct beliefs and correct methodologies, to read the <em>Salafi Tafseer</em> books, which are based upon the <em>Tafseer</em> of the Book of Allaah by the Book of Allaah, by the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and by the <em>Fiqh</em> of the noble Companions those who lived through the descent of the revelation and were present at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and lived with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew the aim of the Book and the Sunnah. They are the ones whose <em>Fiqh </em>should be held on to as they preserved the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><em>.  </em>This is why the noble Messenger –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> when he spoke about splitting up into sects and spoke about the <em>Firqaat-Un Najeeyah</em> said: ‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Those who are upon what I am upon and my Companions</strong></span>.'[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>Fiqh</em> of the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah which the noble Companions had – which they acquired from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, from his sayings, actions, his teachings and his directives – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> it is obligatory upon us to take it as our reference.  The Companions are the intended believers in the saying of Allaah <em>– Tabaraka wa Ta’ala -:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him and follows other than the believers’ way. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell – what an evil destination.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [an-Nisaa: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a severe threat to the one who contends with Allaah and His Messenger and follows a path other than that of the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So pay attention to this matter and strive to understand the way of the believers which they derived from the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam </em>– and from his purifying and educating them upon the Book and the wisdom <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great opportunity for you; understand from it the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah and strive earnestly to make it apparent over all religions with proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon you to seek knowledge from its original watering sources; from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>Tafseer</em>, from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>‘Aqeedah</em>, which gush forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>.  The difference between the way of the truthful believers and the way of the innovating discriminators of the true <em>Manhaj</em> of Allaah will become clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They – I swear by Allaah – are the protectors of this <em>Ummah</em> upon the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, they had the correct <em>‘Aqeedah</em> and <em>Manhaj</em> and they were firmly upon what Muhammad <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what is understood principally, is that it is obligatory upon us to follow the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> to hold on firmly to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and to bite onto that with our molar teeth, just as the Messenger of Allaah mentioned – when he gave an eloquent sermon whereby tears fell and the hearts trembled  – the Companions requested him to give them some advice they said ; O Messenger of Allaah it is as if this is a farewell sermon, so advise us, he said: ‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I advise you to fear Allaah…….</strong></span>’  pay attention to this advice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>….to hear and obey, whoever lives from amongst you will see many differences so it is upon you to hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided <em>Khulafah</em>, bite on to it with your molar teeth, beware of newly invented matters, for every newly invented matter is a <em>Bida</em>’ and every <em>Bida’</em> is misguidance.</strong></span>’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Translator’s note: Due to the saying of the noble Messenger of Allaah<em>–</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>–</em> ‘Whoever does not thank the people does not thank Allaah.’ As narrated by Abee Sa’eed, &amp; authenticated by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah, I say that may Allaah reward with all goodness in this life and in the Hereafter the brother who facilitated us with the booklet and aided us in its translation.  And to our editor, may Allaah enter her into the highest grades of His Paradise among the Prophets, the Companions and the righteous for all her efforts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">The headings were added for further clarity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[2] Narrated by Tirmidhi (2641) from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr –radhiAllaahu anhu- &amp; regarded as Hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (5343).</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Advice to the Salafiyyoon</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, use <strong>beneficial knowledge</strong> and <strong>solid proof</strong> and <strong>beneficial wisdom</strong> in your <em>Dawa’</em>. You should have all the noble and <strong>beautiful manners</strong> encouraged by the Book and the Messenger of guidance; indeed they are causes for victory and causes for success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have to believe that the Companions did not spread Islaam or enter it into the hearts except with their <strong>wisdom</strong> and their <strong>knowledge</strong> more so than with their swords.  However, whoever enters into Islaam under the sword might not be firm, but whoever enters Islaam by way of knowledge, proof and evidence then this is what makes his Eemaan firm by Allaah’s permission and His assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon you to have these good methods and also to be serious about knowledge.  You have to be serious about <em>Dawa’</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now – O brothers – I advise you with two issues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Brotherhood between all of <em>Ahl -ul-Sunnah</em>; So O you Salafees, disseminate the soul of love and brotherhood between yourselves.  Put into effect what the Messenger of Allaah <em>– sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> informed us of regarding the believers: ‘Like a building, some of its parts supporting others.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that they are: ‘<strong>Like a single body if one limb complains then the rest of the body suffers with fever and insomnia</strong>.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how you should be O brothers: distance yourselves from the causes of splitting, I swear by Allaah indeed it is a dangerous evil and a disastrous disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: distance yourselves from the causes which lead to enmity, hatred, splitting up and dissension.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Keep away from these things; because this has become predominant nowadays at the hands of people, about whom only Allaah knows their condition and intent.  It has become predominant and has torn apart the youth in this country – whether in the university or other than it – or in the other parts of the <em>Duniya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why?! Because those who are not from its people – neither in knowledge nor in understanding – entered into the arena of giving <em>Dawa’</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that the enemies could have entered someone into the midst of the<em>Salafeeyeen</em> to tear them apart and split them up, and this issue is not unlikely, rather it can truly happen <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Strive to have brotherhood.  If any dissension has occurred between you, then both parties should make themselves forget what is past and start with a clean slate now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say to the brothers: whoever falls short it is not allowed to debase him, nor destroy the one who is deficient.  Whoever makes a mistake amongst us we do not destroy him. <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> – but we cure him with gentleness, wisdom and face him with love and friendship and all the rest of the righteous manners, along with the correct <em>Dawa’</em> until he repents.  And if there remains a weakness in him then we are not hasty with him, or otherwise, I swear by Allaah no one will remain, no one will remain!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people now who chase after the Salafis so much so that they reached the scholars and called them those who water things down <em>(Mumaya’een)</em>!! There is hardly any scholar in the arena of <em>Dawa’</em> today except that he has been falsely attacked with this claim about him!  Of course this is the way of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen and the way of <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> since, from the weapons of the <em>Ahl ul-Bid</em>a’ is that they begin by overthrowing the scholars, rather it is the Jewish Masonic way: that if you wanted to discredit an idea, then discredit their scholars or their personalities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So keep away from this rotten legacy and have respect for the scholars.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily Allaah loves three things for you and he hates three things for you. He loves that you worship Him alone, and that you do not join anyone else in your worship of him and that you do not worship other than him, He loves that you hold tight altogether to the rope of Allaah and that you do not be divided.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And Allaah hates for you hearsay (he said and she said – qeela wa qaal – spreading rumours), he hates for you excessive questioning (questioning that brings about no benefit), thirdly, he hates for you the wasting of money.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>As sallamualaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sheikh Rabee’ bin Haadee al-Madkhalee (<i>hafidhahullah</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“How is that you can rest O’ advising believer and you see the people of innovation plotting and the people of tribulation (fitan) and corruption plotting against your sons and your brothers  with respect to the ‘aqeedah (belief) and the manhaj (methodology)?!</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>How can you rest?!</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>By Allah, we do not rest. By Allah, sometimes we do not sleep out of sadness for our sons and out of fear for them from losing their (deen) religion and their dunyah (wordly life)&#8230;”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<i>Marhaban Ya Taalib-ul-‘Ilm</i>, page 29, Daar-ul-Meeraathin-Nabawee, Algiers, 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition, 1434/2013)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled by The Eminent Shaykh, the Muhaddith, Rabee bin Haadee Umair al-Madkhalee </span><br />
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise belongs to Allaah, may <em>Salaat</em> and <em>Salaam</em> be upon the Messenger of Allaah, his Companions and all those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed that which brings great sadness is that the destructive <em>math-hab</em> of the Rawafidh has been given scope and many opportunities to spread in the region of the Arab Muslim lands.  It has actually become intensely widespread and those behind its propagation are the Rulers of the Iranian Persian lands, Ayaat of Iran and the Mullahs who are the enemies of Islaam, of The Truth, of <em>Tawheed</em> and its people.  They exert themselves with everything that is precious and of value in disseminating this <em>math-hab</em> which is accompanied with harsh zeal and a frightening plot to seize all the Muslim lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They do this with their destructive math-hab which is established on:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;        Making <em>Takfeer</em> (declaring to be non-Muslims) of the Companions of Muhammad<em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;       Rejecting the Sunnah of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> because it has come via the truthful and faithful Companions of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;       Distorting the Qur’aan and applying texts regarding the <em>Kuffaar</em> and <em>Munaafiqoon</em>(hypocrites) to the Companions of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;        Further applying texts, which mention the threat of the Hellfire to the Companions of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, especially to Abu Bakr and Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhuma</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;       Applying the <em>Ayaat</em> (verses) of praise and the promise of Allaah exclusively to themselves and the Family of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.  However, Allaah has freed the family of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> from the extremist <em>math-hab</em> of the Rawafidh and their principles of disbelief which are founded upon this disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From their deviance is that they apply the <em>Ayaat</em> (verses) of the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah which indicate worshipping Him alone – such as the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And Allaah has said: Do not take for yourselves two deities. He is but one God&gt;&gt; [an-Nahl: 51] – to their Imaams!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How much have they distorted the texts of the Qur’aan? Whoever wishes to know the reality of their religion should read their fundamental sources such as ‘al-Kafi’ by Kullayni, Tafseer al-Qummi and Tafseer al-‘Ayaashi, which has even exceeded the Jews and the Christians in terms of distortion!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what fills the heart with grief is that this deviant, destructive math-hab has begun to be disseminated in Algeria.  Indeed we have read and heard that a large number of these people have embraced the ‘<em>Aqeedah</em> of Rafdh (Shia).  A number of them study in the Rafidhi city called Qum, though there has been opposition to this from the government and from some of the scholars, however it has been weak.  Where is the required concern from them for Islaam and <em>Tawheed</em>?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And where is the concern for the Qur’aan and the Sunnah?  Where is the concern for the Companions of Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O you Algerians – government and the people – indeed your remaining silent on the spread of this movement and its <em>math-hab</em> will – and I swear by Allaah – have disastrous results in relation to your <em>Deen</em>, your worldly matters, your politics and your Hereafter when you meet your Lord because you remained silent about the greatest of evils and the greatest of dangers upon your <em>Deen</em> and your worldly matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to awaken the senses of the Muslims and their intellects in order to face this destructive danger.  An imperative aspect of what they are facing is keeping away from their websites, which promote and spread evil and major deviancy.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">A clarification of some of the Principles of the Rafidhah (Shia)</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. From their principles is making <em>Takfeer</em> of the Companions and to attack them.  This is a type of destruction of Islaam, which has never been known except to cause destruction.  This is why they try to convey this <em>Takfeer</em> in the best way they can.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. From their principles is that Imamate is from the fundamentals of the <em>Deen</em>, which is extremism from them.  The fundamentals of the <em>Deen</em> were explained by the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>and Imaamate is not from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. According to them, knowing the twelve Imaams is from the fundamentals of the<em>Deen</em> and whoever is ignorant of the twelve Imaams is regarded by them to be a <em>Kaafir</em>(disbeliever).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The Imaams are, in their view, infallible (protected from sinning) and are protected from any neglect or forgetfulness.  They favour them over the Prophets and Messengers <em>–alayhim as-Salaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. They believe that their Imaams know the Unseen and that they manage and control every single atom within the universe.  This is from the greatest acts of disbelief as they have made their Imaams associates with Allaah regarding the knowledge of the Unseen and the control of the universe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. They falsely claim that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>recommended that Ali <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> be the <em>Khaleefah</em>.  They claim that the Companions illegally and forcefully took the <em>Khilafah</em> from him.  This claim is the greatest of lies and it is the foundation of their misguidance and their tyranny against the Companions, their <em>Takfeer</em> of them and their cursing them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. From their superstitions and stories is that they have a Mahdi from the Prophet’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> family whom they await and that he has been in a cave for more than 1200 years who they claim is the 12<sup>th</sup> Imaam.  This Imaam does not exist, this Mahdi has not even been created.  The Mahdi that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> mentioned is true, however, he is not the one that the Rawafidh (Shia) claim is the Mahdi.  From their stories is that Musa bin Jafar (d. 183AH)- who the Rawafidh claim is one of their Imaams – said to a person during his time: ‘If you live then you will meet him.’  Since then, 1249 years have passed and they still have not met him.  This is proof that this was a slander and a lie against Musa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. From their fundamental principles is having <em>Eemaan</em> (faith) that a person is brought back to life after having died and that, according to their <em>Deen</em>, whoever does not believe this is a <em>Kaafir</em>.  Al-Aloosi said in ‘Mukhtasir at-Tuhfa al-Ithna Ashareeyah’ (pp200-201):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The <em>Math-hab</em> of Ahlus-Sunnah is that the dead do not return to the worldly life before the Day of Judgement.  All of the Imaamiyyah (Shia) sect and some of the other sects of the Rawafidh (Shia) say that some of the dead will return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They claim that the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>and the one that he bequeathed (meaning: Ali), the two generous ones (Hasan and Hussain) along with their enemies – by which they mean the three <em>Khulafaa’</em>, Mu’aawiyah, Yazeed, Haaroon, Ibn Ziyaad and their likes – and other Imaams and their people who were killed will all be brought back to life after the Mahdi appears and they (i.e. the Prophet<em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-,</em> Ali, and Hasan and Hussain) will punish everyone that oppressed their Imaams and they will take revenge from them, before the arrival of the Dajjaal, then they will die awaiting resurrection on the Day of Judgement.’  May Allaah fight the Rawafidhah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. From the foundations of their beliefs is their claim against the Companions that they distorted the Qur’aan.  Allaah forbid that the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>– may Allaah be pleased with them all- distorted even one word from the Book of Allaah.  Rather, those who distorted it are actually the Rawafidh.  How many times have they distorted the wordings of the Qur’aan and its meanings?  Most of their distortion concerns the <em>Ayaat</em> of the promises of Allaah and His warnings and <em>Ayaat</em> regarding the <em>Kuffaar</em> and <em>Munaafiqoon</em>, which they apply to the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> whereas it is the Rawafidh who rightfully deserve that these <em>Ayaat</em> are applied to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. From the greatest of their fundamentals is <em>Tuqeeyyah</em> (lying to cover up their falsehood).  They regard it to be nine tenths of their <em>Deen</em> and that whoever does not have <em>Tuqeeyah</em> has no <em>Deen</em>.  They ascribe this saying to Abu Jafar that he said: ‘Allaah -Azza wa Jall– insisted for us and you to have <em>Tuqeeyah</em>.’  They also say that he said: ‘<em>Tuqeeyah</em> is from my religion and the religion of my fathers and whoever does not have <em>Tuqeeyah</em> has no <em>Eemaan</em>.’ [See al-Kafi by Kulaani 2/217-218]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. From their religion is to build structures over graves, especially the graves of their Imaams, and to perform <em>Tawaaf</em> around them and to seek aid from the inmates of the graves.  They give huge amounts of money to them and take oaths and sacrifices at the doors to these structures.  These are from the greatest types of Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. From the important matters of their <em>Deen</em> is temporary marriage – which the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>only made a concession for when there was a need and it was a necessity.  However, this was later abrogated by Allaah on the tongue of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.  From the narrators of the prohibition of temporary marriage was Ali <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> himself.  The Shia made temporary marriage permissible and narrated so-called ‘narrations’ showing its virtue something which both the <em>Sharia’</em> and the intellect reject. For example, their saying: ‘Whoever gratifies his pleasure with a believing woman then it is as though he visited the <em>Ka’bah</em> 70 times.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say: ‘Trustworthy narrators narrated from as-Saddiq <em>– alayhis-salaam –</em> saying, ‘Indeed temporary marriage is from my <em>Deen</em> and the <em>Deen</em> of my fathers.  Whoever acts upon it then he has raised our <em>Deen</em>, whoever rejects it then he has rejected our<em>Deen</em> and has believed in other than our <em>Deen</em>.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Temporary marriage in this form, according to them, is from their greatest fundamentals such that if one were to leave it, it would be regarded as <em>Kufr</em> (disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some narrations from them regarding this, from them is this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever performs temporary marriage once, then his rank will be like the rank of al-Hussain <em>– alayhis-salaam </em>.  Whoever performs temporary marriage twice, then his rank will be like the rank of al-Hasan <em>– alayhis-salaam </em>.  Whoever performs temporary marriage three times, then his rank will be like the rank of Ali <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em>.  Whoever performs temporary marriage four times, then his rank is the like of my status.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement of theirs <em>‘alayhis-salaam’</em> is from their expressions while, in reality, what should be said regarding the one who is a Companion is ‘<em>-Radi Allaahu anhu-</em>’ or<em>‘Rahimahullaah’</em> for a <em>Taabi’ee</em> (the follower of the Companions) and those after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a brief insight into the <em>Deen</em> of the Rawafidh although their deviancy and disbelief fills up volumes of books.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Compiled by   The Eminent Shaykh, the Muhaddith Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise belongs to Allaah and peace and prayers be upon the Messenger of Allaah and upon his family and his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a lecture explaining the status of the Messenger of Allaah and his rights upon this <em>Ummah</em>, which is the <em>Ummah</em> of those who have accepted Islaam and of those who are called to Islaam, from the <em>Jinn</em>and mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the noble Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – has a great status, and a very high position which none from the creation can reach, since he is the leader of the sons of Adam on the Day of Judgment.  Adam and whoever came after him is under the Messenger’s flag- sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was given the great intercession which the other great Messengers excused themselves from.  This great intercession that Allaah chose especially for him and preferred it for him above all the worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without doubt, his Lord <em>Azza wa Jaal</em> honored him and favoured him with abundant miracles which Allaah never gave to the other Prophets &#8211; Alayhim as-Sallam- and yet Allaah has given all of them high positions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: ” I was preferred over the other Prophets with six things: I was given eloquent speech, victory by frightening the enemy, the war-booty was made permissible for me, the earth was made as a means of purification and a place of worship, I was sent to all of creation and Prophet hood was completed with me.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh Muslim (523)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>hadeeth</em> of Jaabbir: ” … and I was given the right of intercession.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukharee (328) and Muslim (521)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said, in clarifying the status of the Messenger of Allaah and explaining his noble characteristics:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty, he is anxious over you.  For the believers he is full of pity, kind, and merciful. &gt;&gt; [at-Tauba: 128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed Allaah conferred a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting unto them His Verses (the Qur’aan), and purifying them, and instructing them in the Book  and <em>Al­-Hikmah</em>, whilst before that they had been in manifest error.&gt;&gt; [Aal-Imraan: 164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and <em>Al-Hikmah</em>.  And verily, they had been before in manifest error&gt;&gt; [Jummah: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; O Prophet! Verily, We have sent you as a witness, a bearer of glad tidings and a warner.  As one who invites to Allaah, by His permission, and as a lamp spreading light.  Announce to the believers the glad tidings that they will have from Allaah, a Great Bounty.  And obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites and harm them not.  And put your trust in Allaah, Sufficient is Allaah as a<em>Wakeel</em> (Trustee, or Disposer of affairs). &gt;&gt; [Ahzaab: 45-48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said, praising the Messenger and mentioning him and his status with Allaah and His blessings upon him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Have We not opened your chest (heart) for you? And removed from you your burden, which weighed down your back? And raised high your fame?&gt;&gt; [ash-Sharh: 1-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas said: ‘Exposed him to the light of Islaam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl said: ‘With the light of Islaam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan said: ‘He filled him with wisdom and knowledge and He removed from you your burden which weighed down on your back.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam as-Sa’adee -May Allaah have mercy upon him – said: “We will enrich him due to the legislations of the <em>Deen</em> and the <em>Da’wah </em>to Allaah, characterize him with noble manners and made him concerned with the hereafter and the ease of doing good actions, so he was not constrained nor oppressed &lt;&lt; And removed from you your burden, Which weighed down your back? &gt;&gt;  And We removed from you your burden which weighed down heavy on your back is like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&lt; That Allaah may forgive you your sins of the past and the future, and complete His Favour on you, and guide you on the Straight Path &gt;&gt; [al-Fath : 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And raised high your fame? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That we have raised your rank and we have made for you good high praise which none from the creation can reach.  So, Allaah is not mentioned except that His Messenger Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – is mentioned along with Him, like when entering into Islaam, also in the call to the prayer, the <em>Iqama</em> (the call at the time of standing for the obligatory prayer), in sermons and many other places where Allaah raises the mention of His Messenger Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.  His <em>Ummah</em> has love in their hearts for him and a highly regarded place, with splendour which no one other than him can have, which comes second to loving Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, may Allaah reward him, on behalf of his <em>Ummah,</em> the best of what a Prophet can be rewarded with, on behalf of his <em>Ummah</em>.”  See ‘Tafseer as-Sa’adee’ for this <em>Soorah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah swears with the Messenger’s great rank and He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Verily, by your life, in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly. &gt;&gt; [al-Hijr: 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer -May Allaah have mercy upon him – said: ‘Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> swears with the life of His Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, and this is a great honour, a lofty station and befitting glory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bin Maalik an-Nakree said on the authority of Abu Jooza’ on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas that he said: Allaah did not create anything, nor exempted anyone, more noble to Him than Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and I have never heard that Allaah swears with the life of anyone other than the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: &lt;&lt;Verily, by your life, in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says ‘by your life, by your life span, by your stay in the world, indeed in their wild intoxication they are blinded, i.e. that they play around.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas: they are confused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said, owing to His concern over His Messenger and His protecting him and honouring him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; By the forenoon (after sun-rise); And by the night when it is still (or darkens); Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hated you.And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present (life of this world).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And verily, your Lord will give you (all i.e. good) so that you shall be well-pleased.  Did He not find you an orphan and give you refuge? And He found you unaware and guided you?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He found you poor, and made you rich (self-sufficient with self-contentment, etc.)?  Therefore, treat not the orphan with oppression, repulse not the beggar and proclaim the Grace of your Lord (i.e. the Prophethood and all other Graces).  &gt; &gt; [Soorah Dhuh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said: Imaam Ahmad said: Abu Na’eem narrated to us that Sufyaan narrated to us on the authority of al-Aswaad bin Qayees that, I heard Jundub saying: The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – fell ill, so due to this he did not stand for the prayer for one or two nights.  Then, a woman came and said: O Muhammad, I do not see you except that your shaytaan has left you. [She said this meaning that he was not on guidance] so Allaah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; By the forenoon (after sun-rise); and by the night when it is still (or darkens); Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hated you&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said: What was narrated by Bukharee and Muslim and Tirmidhee and Nisaa’ee from the way of al-Aswaad bin Qayees on the authority of Jundub bin Abdullaah al-Bajalee, then al’Alqee narrated with his narration, and also in the narration of Sufyaan bin ‘Uaynah on the authority of al-Aswaad bin Qayees, who heard Jundub say: Jibraeel delayed in coming to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – so the <em>Mushrikoon</em> said Muhammad’s Lord has forsaken him, then Allaah Ta’ala revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; By the forenoon (after sun-rise); and by the night when it is still (or darkens); Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hated you. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an oath from Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> where He swears by the forenoon (after sunrise) and of what He made in it of light.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And by the night when it is still (or darkens)&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means it has become peaceful and dark -this was stated by Mujhaid, Qatadah and ad-Dhihaak and by other than them.  This is proof of the capability of the Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Your Lord has neither forsaken you &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: Allaah did not leave the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And : &lt;&lt; nor hated you. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: Allaah does not hate the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present (life of this world). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: ‘the place in the hereafter is better for you than this place.’  This is why the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –was the one who abstained the most from this <em>duniya</em> from amongst the people and he was the one who rejected it the most out of the people, as is well-known [ by necessity ] from his biography.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, when he was given the choice, at the end of his life, between staying in this <em>duniya</em> until its end and then entering into Paradise, or proceeding to Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal,</em> he chose what was with Allaah over this despicable, lowly <em>Duniya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: ‘I have no want of this earth.  Indeed my example and the example of this world, is like a rider who takes a nap under a tree, then he leaves that place and moves on.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And verily, your Lord will give you (all good) so that you shall be well-pleased.  &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: (i.e. pleased) with what Allaah has prepared for him in the hereafter of the gardens of Paradise and great blessings, seeing his Lord and the lake, the intercession and the rest of what Allaah has honoured him with in the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah mentions what He granted him of blessings.  Allaah protected him when he was an orphan and sheltered him until He chose him for His message.  He revealed the Book and the Wisdom to Him and taught him that which he did not know and what Allaah bestowed upon him was great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qadi ‘Aayaad -may Allaah have mercy upon him &#8211; said in his book ‘ash-Shifaa bi-Taareef Haqooq al-Mustafa’:   ‘This <em>Soorah</em> contains what Allaah honoured the Messenger with, praising him and Allaah exalting him, in six ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Allaah took an oath for him, regarding what Allaah had informed him about, in His Ta’ala saying:&lt;&lt; By the forenoon (after sun-rise); And by the night when it is still (or darkens);  &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: ‘I swear by the Lord of the forenoon (after sunrise)’, – this is from the greatest degrees of support.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- An illustration of the Messenger’s status with Allaah and Allaah’s favour upon him, where Allaah says: &lt;&lt; Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hated you. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: He did not leave you and did not hate you.  It has been said that it means, He did not neglect you after choosing you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Regarding the saying of Allaah Ta’ala : &lt;&lt; And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present (life of this world).  &gt;&gt; Ibn Ishaaq said: What you have in recourse to Allaah is greater than what Allaah has given you, of honour, in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl said: what has been stored for you, of the intercession, and the place of noble standing (<em>maqaama Mahmooda</em>) is better for you than what you have been given in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Allaah Ta’ala’s saying &lt;&lt; And verily, your Lord will give you (all good) so that you shall be well-pleased.   &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>Ayaah</em> is comprehensive: it contains all the different points of honour, types of happiness and the various blessings in the two worlds and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Ishaaq said: Allaah will make the Messenger pleased with success in the <em>Duniya</em>, and reward in the Hereafter.  It has been said that is the lake in Paradise and the intercession of the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- What Allaah has prepared for him from His blessings.  Allaah assigned bounties from Himself and blessings in the rest of the<em>Soorah</em>; from the guidance of Allaah where He guided the Messenger or guiding the people by the Messenger – this difference in meaning is due to the different <em>Tafseer</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger had no wealth and Allaah made him wealthy by what He had given him, or by what Allaah had placed in his heart due to contentment and wealth.  The Messenger was an orphan and his uncle became affectionate to him and sheltered him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been said: Allaah sheltered him – Allaah reminds him with this great favour and what is known, from <em>Tafseer, </em>is that Allaah did not neglect the Messenger when he was young, in a poor state and an orphan before he was well known as a Prophet.  Allaah did not forsake him, nor did He hate him, so what about after Allaah appointed and chose him for Prophet Hood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah commanded His Messenger to manifest His blessings upon him and to be thankful for what He had honoured him with, by announcing it and to commend it by mentioning this blessing, due to the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala </em>&lt;&lt; And proclaim the Grace of your Lord (i.e. the Prophet hood and all other Graces) &gt;&gt; since, indeed, being thankful of blessings is talking about them.  This was specific for the Messenger and general for his <em>Ummah</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 2 – The Excellence of the lineage of the Messenger</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Waatheelah bin al-Asqa <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> say: ‘Certainly Allaah chose a branch from the son of Isma’eel and chose the Quraish from this branch. He chose Bani Hashim from the Quraish, and He chose me from Bani Hashim.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘I was sent from the best of all the generations of the children of Adam, generation after generation until I was in the generation in which I was sent.’<br />
Bukharee – Characteristics (3557)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was Abul-Qaasim Muhammad bin Abdullaah bin Abdul Muttalib bin Hashim bin Abd Munaf bin Qoose bin Keelab bin Marra bin Ka’ab bin Luu’ee bin Ghalib bin Fahr bin Malik bin an-Nadhr bin Kananah bin Khuzaimah bin Mudrikah bin Ilyaas bin Madhar bin Nazzar bin Ma’d bin Adnaan. Up to here there is an agreement about its authenticity, as for after Adnaan then there is a difference of opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no difference that Adnaan was from the sons of Isma’eel bin Ibraheem. What is correct is that Isma’eel was the one to be slaughtered, and that it was Ishaaq is incorrect.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 3 – The Messenger’s beautiful physical characteristics</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Ishaq who said I heard al-Bara say: that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – was the handsomest of all the people and had the best appearance. He was neither very tall nor was he short.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also on the authority of al-Bara who said: The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – was of a moderate height having broad shoulders, his hair reached his ear-lobes. I saw him in a red cloak and I had never seen anyone more handsome than him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Ishaq who said that al-Bara was asked: ‘Was the face of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – as bright as a sword?’ He said: ‘No, as bright as the moon.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Abdullah bin Ka’b who said: I heard Ka’b bin Malik talking when he stayed behind from the battle of Tabuk, saying: ‘When I greeted the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – his face was glittering with happiness. Whenever Allaah’s Messenger was happy his face used to light up, as though it were a piece of the moon, and we used to know it (his happiness) from his face.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas &#8211; radiAllaah anhu &#8211; who said: I never touched silk or <em>Dibaj</em> (i.e. thick silk) softer than the palm of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – nor did I smell a fragrance or perspiration better than the fragrance or perspiration of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Juhaifa who said: the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – went to a place called al-Batha’ at noon, performed <em>wudu</em> and prayed two <em>Rakat</em> <em>Zuhr </em>prayer and a two <em>Rakat</em>for the <em>‘Asr</em> prayer. A spear was planted before him and passersby were passing in front of it. (After the prayer), the people got up and held the hands of the Prophet and passed them on their faces. I also took his hand and kept it on my face and noticed that it was colder than ice and its fragrance was nicer than musk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 4- His Noble Manners</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <em>Noon</em>. By the Pen and what the (angels) write (in the Records of men). You are not, by the Grace of your Lord, a madman. And verily, for you will be an endless reward. And verily, you are on an exalted standard of character. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aeysha &#8211;<em>radiAllaah anha</em> &#8211; said: ‘That his manners were that of the Qur’aan.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And by the Mercy of Allaah, you dealt with them gently. And had you been severe and harsh­ hearted, they would have broken away from about you; so pass over (their faults), and ask (Allaah’s) Forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affairs. Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allaah, certainly, Allaah loves those who put their trust (in Him). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Imran:159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin al-Aaas <em>-radiAllaah anhumma &#8211;</em>who said: ‘The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> never used bad language neither did he say or do evil acts. He used to say ‘The best amongst you are those who have the best manners.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Aeysha <em>-radiAllaah anha &#8211;</em> who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was never given the choice between two matters, except that he would choose the easier of the two, as long as it was not sinful to do so, but if it was sinful to do so, he would be the farthest away from it from amongst the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> never took revenge for his own sake but when what Allaah had prohibited was transgressed,then he would take revenge for Allaah’s Sake.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: ‘that the Prophet was shyer than a virgin in her private living quarters.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: ‘The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> never criticized any food, if he liked it he would eat it otherwise, he would leave it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas bin Malik <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: ‘I served the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> for ten years. I swear by Allaah, he never said a harsh word to me nor did he question me as to why I had done such-and-such or why I had not done such-and-such in a particular way.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another wording: ‘I served him on journeys and while resident. I swear by Allaah he never said to me about what I did ‘Why did you do this like this?’ or about something that I had not done, ‘Why did you not do this in this way?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also on the authority of Anas <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> was the best of the people in his manners.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Jabir bin Abdullah <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>never said no to anything that he was asked for.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas &#8211;<em>radiAllaah anhu</em>&#8211; who said Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was never asked for anything for the sake of Islaam except that he would give it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas mentions that a man came to him and so he gave him some sheep<strong><em>.</em></strong>  The man then went back to his people and said: ‘O people accept Islaam, for Muhammad gives so much charity he has no fear of want.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ibn Abbas <em>-radiAllaah anhuma-</em> that Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was the most prolific of people in doing good. He was generous to the utmost in the month of Ramadan. Indeed Jibreel <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> would meet him every year during the month of Ramadan up until its end.  Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> would recite the Qur’aan to him and when Jibreel would meet him, Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> would be the most generous in goodness; more so than the blowing wind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intent of the meaning ‘more so than the blowing wind’ is that he was swift and comprehensive in doing good deeds.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 5 – The Prophet’s <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> Courage</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas bin Malik <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said that Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was the best of the people, the most generous amongst them and he was the bravest of men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night the people of Madina felt frightened and they set forth in the direction of a noise when the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> met them on his way back, as he had gone towards that noise ahead of them.  He was on Abu Talha’s horse, which had no saddle over it, with a sword slung around his neck while he was saying: ‘There was nothing to be afraid of, nothing to be afraid of.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: ‘We found this horse like a torrent of water (very fast),’ whereas the horse had been slow before that time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. That this horse was slow but when the Messenger of Allaah<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> rode it, it was the fastest racing horse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas ibn AbdulMuttalib, the uncle of the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: I witnessed the Day of Hunain with the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>.  Abu Sufyan bin al-Harith bin Abdul-Muttalib and I stuck close to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and we did not separate from him. The Messenger of Allaah<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was on a white pony of his which was given to him as a gift by Farwatu bin Nufatha al-Juthaami.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslims fought the Kuffar, the Muslims retreated, but the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> began to gallop on his pony towards them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas said: I was holding onto the reins of the Messenger of Allaah’s &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> pony trying to hold it back from speeding up and Abu Sufyan was holding the stirrup of Allaah’sMessenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em><em>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘O Abbas, call the people of al-Samura.’ (Those who took the oath of allegiance of Ridwaan on the Day of Hudaybeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas mentions he was a man with a loud voice: So I said at the top of my voice: ‘Where are the people of al-Samura.’ (Those who took the oath of allegiance of Ridwaan on the Day of Hudaybeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas mentions: I swear by Allaah, they came back when they heard my voice just as the cows return for their calves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: We are here, we are here!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Fight the kuffar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the narrator continues:  ………then the Messenger of Allaah<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘Now the battle has become inflamed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas said: Then the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> took some stones and threw them in the face of the kuffar and said: ‘They are defeated, I swear by the Lord of Muhammad.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas said: ‘I went to watch and the battle took place as I was watching. I swear by Allaah, just as he threw his stones towards them I saw their strength decline and saw them retreat.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Imaam Muslim cites a summary of the hadeeth which mentions: ‘He said: ‘They are defeated, I swear by the Lord of Ka’bah. They are defeated, I swear by the Lord of Ka’bah.’ With theadditional wording: ‘Until Allaah defeated them and it was as if I was watching the Prophet of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> chasing them on his pony.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Imaam Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from al-Bara’s hadeeth of the story of Hunain: The people turned to the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and Abu Sufyan bin al-Harith was leading his pony.  So he got down, prayed and supplicated for Allaah’s help by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I am the Prophet, this is the truth *** I am the son of Abd al-Muttalib</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, send down your help.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bara’ mentioned: I swear by Allaah when the battle grew fierce, we would seek protection by being close to the Messenger due to his bravery and even the bravest among us was would stand near the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Imaam Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim narrates the story of Hunain from the hadeeth of Salama bin al-Akwaa’ within which occurs: ‘So we gathered around the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>-, he got down from his pony and grabbed a handful of dust from the ground, then he turned towards the faces of the enemy and said: ‘May these faces be disfigured.’ There was no-one from amongst them that Allaah created except that Allaah filled their eyes with dust from that handful of dust.  They turned back in flight.  Allaah the Exalted and Glorious defeated them and the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>distributed their booty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh Muslim</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 6- The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was the most knowledgeable about Allaah and had the most fear of Allaah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas bin Malik <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said: ‘A group of three people came to the houses of the Prophet’s wives asking about the Prophet’s worship.  When they were informed about it, they regarded their own as insignificant and said: ‘Where are we compared to the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>? Indeed Allaah has forgiven him his past and future sins.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them said: As for me then I will pray all night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other one said: I will fast continuously and not open my fast<strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last one said: I will keep away from women and never marry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> came he said: Are you those who said such-and-such. Then I swear by Allaah that indeed I am the most fearful of Allaah from amongst you and the one who has the most <em>Taqwa</em> of Him.  However, I fast and open my fast, I pray and I sleep and I marry women.  So whosoever does not desire my Sunnah is not of me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Aeysha <em>-RadiAllaah anha-</em> who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> did an action and made a concessionfor it. When this reached some of the people from his Companions it was as though they disliked it and regarded it as insignificant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When this reached the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> he stood, gave a sermon and said: ‘What is wrong with the people?  It reaches them that I have made a concession in a matter yet they dislike it and regard it as insignificant.<strong><em>  </em></strong>I swear by Allaah, indeed I am the most knowledgeable of them about Allaah and have the most fear of Allaah from amongst them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari narrated it in ‘al-‘I’tisaam’ &amp; Muslim in ‘Fadail’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Muslim: ‘When that reached the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> he became angry until the anger became apparent on his face.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was narrated by Bukhari in the chapter: ‘That which is dislikedregarding delving too deeply, disagreement and extremism in the<em>Deen</em> and <em>Bida</em>’.’  Then he mentioned the <em>Ayaah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">? ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?   ?  ?  ?  ??    ? ??????: ???</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of Allaah anything but the truth. &gt;&gt; [Nisa’:171]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawawi said: ‘In this hadeeth there is an encouragement to follow the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> a prohibition against delving too deeply into worship and a rebuke of abstaining from the permissible acts, doubting their permissibility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also shows the allowance of showing anger when there is a violation of the <em>Sharia’</em> even if the one violating it brings an interpretation for it.  It also indicates to the maintenance of good relations by rebuking and showing dislike for an action via general statements and not by specifying the one who did it such that it is said: ‘What is wrong with the people’ or other similar statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth also mentions that being close to Allaah is a reason for knowledge increasing.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Shaykh Rabee’) say: the intent here is the clarification that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is the most knowledgeable about Allaah and the strongest of them in having fear of Allaah.  In this is a refutation of the ideology of the extreme Soofis who say: ‘Indeed I worship Allaah, neither fearing His Fire nor desiring His Paradise!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also other texts which refute this falsehood.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 7 – Regarding the Messenger’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> reliance upon his Lord <em>–Azza wa Jal</em></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says :</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and harm them not (till you are ordered). And put your trust in Allaah, and Sufficient is Allaah as a <em>Wakeel</em> (Trustee, or Disposer of affairs)&gt;&gt;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">[ al-Ahzab:48 ]</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was the best of those who adhered to Allaah and the best in reliance upon his Lord, the Lord of all the worlds.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah saved and protected him from the plots of those who opposed him and from his enemies whether it was in the <em>Makkan</em> period or the <em>Madini</em> period, whether it was in the field of giving <em>Dawa’ </em>and conveying the <em>Deen</em> or in the field of battles and Jihad.  He used to have bodyguards in Madina but when Allaah’s statement was revealed : &lt;&lt; Allaah will protect you from the people&gt;&gt; he pardoned his guards from their duty, relying upon Allaah <em>– Azza wa Jal –</em> trusting in the promise of his Lord.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Jaabir bin Abdullaah that he was on the way to a battle along with the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> towards Najd.  The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was on his way back I was with him.   When I reached the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and his Companions, I found them taking a siesta in a valley with many trees with thorns, the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> stopped there and the people dispersed among the trees with thorns, shading themselves with the trees, the Messenger of Allaah stopped under a tree with a lot of leaves and hung his sword on it.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;" align="right">Jaabir said: We fell into a deep sleep. All of a sudden the Messenger began calling us so we came to him and found a Bedouin sitting near him.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah said: ‘Indeed this person took my sword out of its scabbard while I was sleeping when I awoke he had taken it out of its scabbard and it was in his hand and he said to me: who will prevent me from killing you? I said: Allaah and here he is sitting.’  The Messenger of Allaah did not punish him.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari – in the ‘Book of battles’ &amp; Muslim in the ‘Book of Excellence’.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 8 : </strong><strong>The </strong><strong>Prophet’s </strong><strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong><strong><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em></strong> <strong>Compassion for his <em>Ummah</em></strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said: &lt;&lt; Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves (i.e. whom you know well). It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He (Muhammad) is anxious over you, for the believers (he is) full of pity, kind, and merciful. But if they turn away, say: ‘Allaah is sufficient for me. <em>Lâ ilâha illa Huwa </em>(none has the right to be worshipped but He), in Him I put my trust and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.’&gt;&gt;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Musa al-Ashaari on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>who said: ‘My example and the example of what I have been sent with is that of a man who came to some people and said, ‘O people! I have seen the army with my own eyes, and I am the clear Warner; so protect yourselves!’ Then a group of his people obeyed him and fled proceeding slowly, so they were saved. Another group of them disbelieved him and stayed at their place until the morning when the army came upon them, and destroyed them and ruined them. So this is the example of the one who obeys me and follows what I have brought (the <em>Qur’aan</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em>), and the example of the one who disobeys me and disbelieves in the truth I have brought.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari and Muslim</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>who said: that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed my example and the example of my <em>Ummah</em> is like a man who lit a fire, and moths and insects began to fall into it.  So I am holding on to the waist of your waist wrapper while you are rushing into it.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">[in another narration: so that is my example and your example while I take hold onto the waist of your waist wrapper from the fire, saying keep away from the fire, keep away from the fire you are overcoming me and rushing into it.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon by Bukhari &amp; Muslim</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>said:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">‘I never saw any one more merciful with his family members than the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Muslim ‘Book of Excellence’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anha</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: that some Bedouins came to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said to the people: ‘Do you kiss your children?’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon the Bedouins said: ‘We swear by Allaah that we do not kiss our children.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘Then what can I do if Allaah has deprived you of mercy?’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira who reported that al-Aqra’ bin Habis saw the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> kissing Hasan.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I have ten children, but I have never kissed any one of them.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">‘He who does not show mercy, no mercy will be shown to him.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Jareer bin Abdullah who said: ‘That the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">‘He who shows no mercy to the people, Allaah does not show mercy to him.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari and Muslim</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">By The Shaykh, the Muhaddith<strong> </strong>Rabee’ bin Hadi al-Madkhali</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah; Allaah’s Peace &amp; Praise be upon the Messenger of Allah, upon his family, upon his companions and upon whoever follows his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to what took course, of the fitnah between the youth in Yemen and its tail has extended, and its branches spread out, so much so that it extended out in to other countries.  Many people began seeking for an explanation of the truth and an explanation of who is correct from the one who is wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the causes of these fitn, was that some of the students of knowledge accused some of the other students of having the Manhaj of Hadadi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I was compelled to explain this Manhaj, perhaps this will make it clear for many of the students of the truth, so they can differentiate between the Manhaj of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah, and the Manhaj of the Hadadi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Then perhaps this may share, to</em> a far distant in dealing with this fitnah, along with our promise to continue with explaining other issues, in response to this urgent request and a share in trying to end the fitnah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Manhaj  of al-Hadaadeeyah</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Their hatred towards the current scholars of the Manhaj as-Salafee, and their belittling them, claiming that they are ignorant and claiming that they are deviated, and lying upon them, especially the scholars of Madina.  And they over-reach this to Ibn Taymeeyah, Ibn al-Qayyim and Ibn Abee al-‘Azz, the explainer of ‘at-Tahawee’. The Hadaadeeyah drone on about them, so that they can destroy their status and reject their sayings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- The statement of the Hadaadeeyah, that everyone who falls into a bida’ is declared as a mubtadi (innovator), and Ibn Hajar, according to them is more severe and dangerous than Sayed Qutb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Declaring a person a mubtadi, if he does not declare that the person who fell into a bida’ is a mubtadi, and the Hadaadeeyah show enmity towards him and battle against him if he does not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not sufficient, according to them, to say: that such and such person has ashareeyah in him for example, or is asharee, rather you have to say:  that he is a mubtadi otherwise you will face war, hajr (being kept away from) and you will be declared as a mubtadi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- The Hadaadeeyah view an absolute prohibition of saying: ‘May Allah have mercy upon him” for the people of bida’, they don’t differentiate between a Rafidee, a Qadree, a Jahmee and between a scholar who fell into a bida’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- They declare a person as a mubtadi if he says:  “May Allah have mercy upon him’ upon the likes of Abu Hanifah, ash-Shawkani, Ibn al-Jawzi, Ibn Hajr, and an-Nawawee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- Severe enmity against the salafiyoon, no matter what they sacrifice of hard work in calling to salafeeyah and defending it, no matter how hard they struggled to oppose the bida, hizbeeyah and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadaadeeyah concentrate on the scholars of Madina and Shaykh al-Albaani – may Allah have mercy on him- because he is from the senior scholars of the Manhaj as-Salafee, and he was the severest of the scholars in dealing with the hizbeeyoon, the people of bida’ and the people of taasub (being biased).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the Hadaadee’s came to one of my sittings and accused Ibn ‘Uthaymeen of lying more than ten times, I became angry, severely angry, and evicted him from my sittings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadaadeeyah authored books and distributed tapes and they distributed claims against the scholars, and they filled their books and their tapes and their claims with lies and falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the injustice of al-Hadaad is that the authored a book attacking Shaykh al-Albaanee and writing distortions against him. This book consists of about 400 pages in his handwriting, and if it was printed, perhaps it would reach 1000 pages, he called it “al-Khamees” which means a huge army which has a frontline, and a back defense and a heart with a right wing and left wing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haddad used to claim that he warns against Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen, Sayid Qutb and al-Jahaymaaneeyah but we don’t see anything authored by him, not even a small booklet, let alone something like his book ‘al-Khamees’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- Their extremism regarding al-Hadaad and their claim of his superiority in knowledge, where by they can overthrow the senior people of knowledge and the Manhaj as-Salafee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadaadeeyah taking their shaykh to the level of an Imaam without any debate, just like the followers of the one who is affected with a craze for power.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also say about the one who has reached a high level of knowledge, that it is upon him to sit at the feet of Abu Abdullaah al-Hadaad and Umm Abdullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – The Hadaadeyah try to impose their selves upon the scholars of the Salafeeyah in al-Madina and of other places, accusing them of lying, so they say : so and so is a liar, such and such is a liar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They try to show an appearance of love for the truth and striving for it, but when the lies of al-Hadaad were made clear with the evidences and proofs, Allaah exposed the reality of their  situation and what they concealed of great evil, but it only increased them in their attachment to al-Hadaad and their exaggeration regarding him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9- They are distinguished with cursing and hard-heartedness and violence, to the extent that they would threaten the Salafeeyoon with violence, and it even reached to the point that they physically beat some of the Salafeeyoon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10- They curse specific people, to the extent that some of them curse Abu Hanifa, and some of them pronounce takfeer upon him, (take him out of Islaam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When al-hadaad sees any statement whether correct or false he says ‘this is heresy’, which makes one feel that this man is a hidden Takfeeri.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11- Pride and stubbornness leads to rejecting the truth, similar to the other extremists of the ahl-ul-bida’.  So everything that the ahl-ul Madina put forward as a clarification of the deviances of al-Hadaad away from the Manhaj of the Salaf, and that he rejects the Manhaj of the Salaf;  so by these actions of theirs, they are the worst of the Islaamic sects, they are the most evil in their behaviour and partisanship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12- They used to ascribe themselves to Imaam Ahmad a lot, so when it was clarified to them the opposition of al-Hadaad for Imaam Ahmad’s stance towards the ahl ul bida’; they denied this and began accusing those who had ascribed this to Imaam Ahmad. Then al-Hadaad said : ‘If this is true about Imaam Ahmad, then verily we do not blindly follow him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadaadeeyah do no love the truth nor do they seek it, rather they want fitnah and to tear apart the Salafeeyeen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Along with their extremism, the Salafeeyoon see the connections that some of them have with the Hizbeeyeen and some of them have connections with the fusaaq (corrupt people), and at the same time they battle the Salafeeyeen, and show a hatred, which is very severe, and perhaps they are concealing a lot more evil, and Allaah knows best with what they plot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if Abul-Hasan clarifies for us, with clear evidences that those who accuse him of hadaadeeyah, are really they themselves who have these characteristics, then we will not leave off striving to condemning them with al-Hadaadeeyah, rather we will force them back, by writing about them and warning against them, and attach them to al-Hadaadeeyah with out any consideration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if Abul-Hasan is not capable of doing this, then it is upon him to repent to Allaah Azza wa Jal and proclaim his repentance publicly, other wise we will not  leave off striving to support the other people and in making victorious the Manhaj as-Salafee which we are upon, and we will defend the Manhaj and we will defend them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon the truthful Salafeeyeen that they make them victorious and aid the Manhaj which they are following, and they should cut off from the one who oppressed them  and has oppressed their Manhaj, and beware, beware that one of them should fall into that which al-Hadaadeeyah fell in to, or even falling in to some of what they fell in to, and this is the field of knowledge to be able to differentiate between the truthful and the liar, like Allaah Ta’ala said :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(( Alif, Laam Meem, do the people think that they will be left alone, because they say: we believe, and that they will not be tested. Indeed We tested those who were before them. Allaah will certainly make it known, of those who are truthful and those who are liars. ))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah the most Kareem, the Lord of the great ‘Arsh that He protects all the Salafeeyeen everywhere from falling into this trial, especially in the land of Yemen where the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –  has appeared, according to the Manhaj as-Salafee.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Rabee’ bin Hadi al-Madkhali</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20 / 2 / 1423 AH</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUTHOR: Shaikh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Excerpt from the forthcoming Al-Ibaanah Publication &#8220;The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups&#8221;, may Allaah facilitate it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a chapter from the book <b>“<i>Manhaj Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah fee Naqd-ir-Rijaal wal-Kutubi wat-Tawaa’if</i>”</b> (The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups) written by Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee. This book has been highly praised and recommended by the scholars, and has become a classical work in its own time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee clarifies the correct methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah with regard to criticizing, explaining its foundations and principles and relying on the various statements of the Salaf (predecessors) to support his points. The book is primarily geared towards refuting a false concept that has crept into the Muslims’ ideologies and slogans in recent times, which is the principle of Muwaazanah. This principle dictates that when someone criticizes a person, book or group, he is obligated to also mention the good qualities of that person, book or group along with his criticism. By doing this one would be creating a balance and thus applying “fairness”, hence the term Muwaazanah, which means to make a balance, which in this case means a balance between the good and the bad aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this specific chapter of the book, Shaikh Rabee’ brings many quotes from the Salaf showing that it was from their methodology to warn against innovators and their books without requiring themselves to mention their positive aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Al-Jawzee said: ‘Abul-Wafaa ‘Alee bin ‘Aqeel, the Fiqh scholar, said: ‘Our Shaikh Abul-Fadl Al-Hamdhaanee said: The innovators in Islaam and those who fabricate <i>ahaadeeth </i>are worse than the disbelievers. This is since the disbelievers attempt to corrupt the Religion from the outside, whereas these individuals attempt to corrupt it from the inside. They take the likeness of the inhabitants of a land, who strive to corrupt its condition (from the inside), while the disbelievers take the likeness of raiders laying siege to the land from the outside. So it is the ones on the inside who open the doors of the land’s surrounding barrier (and let the besiegers in). These types (of people) are more dangerous to Islaam than those who don&#8217;t ascribe themselves to it.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say: Today, the opponents of the Sunnah and Tawheed are capitalizing on the pamphlets and cassettes of some individuals that ascribe themselves to the Sunnah and Tawheed, which defame the true scholars and callers of the Sunnah and Tawheed. Rather, what is worse in terms of danger and affliction is that these pamphlets and tapes have influenced many of the children of Tawheed and Sunnah, so that now they launch their arrows of disparagement and oppressive accusations towards the scholars of Tawheed and Sunnah, those who carry their banner and those who defend their sanctity. What is worse than this in terms of misfortune and grief, is that they attach themselves and join forces with the people of innovation and misguidance in their campaign of launching poisonous missiles at them, which the enemies of the Sunnah and Tawheed have been preparing as the ultimate attack to finish off the last remnants of the Sunnah and Tawheed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Al-Qayyim said: ‘The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) once saw a book in the hand of ‘Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) that he had transcribed from the Torah, and which caused him to be amazed at how much it conformed to the Qur’aan. So the face of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) became very angry to the point that ‘Umar went over to a fire and threw it in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how would it be if the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) saw what was written after him from the books that oppose and contradict what is in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah?! And we ask Allaah to aid us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) commanded everyone that recorded anything from him apart from the Qur’aan to erase what they had written down. However, afterward, he allowed his Sunnah to be written, but did not grant permission for anything besides that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of these books that contain opposition in them to the Sunnah, have no permission to be written. Rather, they only have permission to be erased and destroyed, for there is not anything more harmful to the ummah than these books. The Companions (of the Prophet) burned all the copies of the <i>mus-haf </i>that contradicted the <i>mus-haf </i>of ‘Uthmaan (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) out of fear that differing would spread amongst the ummah. So how would it be if they were to see the books of today that cause disunity and division amongst the ummah…!?’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is the rightly guided methodology, which all of the Salafee youth are obligated to know – it is the methodology indicated in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, and which the best of this ummah – its scholars of Hadeeth and Fiqh &#8211; followed. One of the conditions for implementing this methodology is that the one criticizing must do that for the sake of Allaah and out of sincerity to Allaah and His Book and in order to preserve Allaah’s Religion and what it encompasses from beliefs, laws and acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the severely unfortunate matters is that the people of falsehood and innovation have succeeded in deceiving many of the smart and intelligent students of knowledge, not to mention others, by making them believe that it is not permissible to talk about (i.e. criticize) those active in the field of Da’wah (calling). They mean by this, those who call to innovation and misguidance! By doing this, they intend to broaden the field (of Da’wah) so that they can spread their destructive deceptions! And they hope that with this they will be able to put an end to the Call to Tawheed, Sunnah and the Methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the offshoots of this deceitful way of thinking are those conditions that some of the children of Tawheed have put forth, such as: When criticizing the people of innovation – or those whom they label “callers” – one is obligated to mention their good qualities alongside their bad qualities&#8230;”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;">By Shaykh Rabee’ bin Haadee al-Madkhalee</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Taken from Mudhakkirah al-Hadeeth an-Nabawee</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Source: <a href="http://www.al-ibaanah.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.al-ibaanah.com</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Moosaa al-Ash’aree (radee Allaahu `anhu) reported that the Prophet (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The example of the guidance and knowledge that Allaah sent me with is like the example of abundant rain that fell upon the earth, some of which was fertile soil that absorbed the water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance; and some of which was hard earth that held the water, and Allaah benefited the people through it. So they drank from it, let their animals drink from it and used it for cultivation. And some of the rain fell upon another portion of the land that was barren and it neither held the water nor brought forth vegetation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is the example of the person that comprehends Allaah’s Religion and benefits (from the knowledge) that Allaah sent me with, so he learns and then teaches others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last example is that of a person who does not care for it and does not accept the guidance of Allaah that I was sent with.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Reported by Al-Bukhaaree [1], Muslim [2] and Ahmad [3])</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrator of the Hadeeth: He is Abu Moosaa al-Ash’aree, `Abdullaah bin Qais bin Saleem bin Hidaar, the well-known Companion. He migrated to Makkah, then to Abyssinia, then to Madeenah. The Messenger of Allaah put him in charge of one district of Yemen. He was courageous, a scholar and a doer of good deeds. `Umar bin Al-Khattaab appointed him as governor over Koofah and Basrah. He conquered Ahwaaz, Asbahaan and a number of other lands. He died in 50H.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Vocabulary in the Hadeeth:</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Mathal</strong>: (Example) what is meant by it here is an amazing resemblance not a proverbial statement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Hudaa</strong>: (Guidance) means that which leads one to what is being sought</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ghaith Katheer:</strong> abundant rain</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Naqiyyah</strong>: (fertile) means pure and fresh as occurs in another narration of the hadeeth</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Kala</strong>’: (vegetation) is applicable to both wet and dry vegetation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`<strong>ushb</strong>: (grass) refers to fresh produce</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ajaadib</strong>: (hard earth) is the plural of jadab and it means the land that is solid and which doesn’t absorb water</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Qi’aan</strong>: (barren land) is the plural of qaa’, which means a straight and smooth plain (land) that doesn’t produce vegetation.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">An Explanation of this Parable:</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) put forth an example likening what he came with from the Religion to the common rain, which comes to the people in the circumstance when they need it. Such was the circumstance with the people before the Prophet’s advent. So just as Allaah brings life to the dead earth through rain water, then such is the case with Allaah’s revelation, with which He brings life to the dead hearts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: “<span style="color:#008000;">Is he who was dead and We gave him life and set for him a light whereby he can walk amongst men – like he who is in the darkness from which he can never come out?</span>” [Soorah Al-An&#8217;aam: 122]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The light here refers to the light of revelation and the darkness refers to the darkness of ignorance, disbelief and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) likened those who hear what (guidance) he came with to the various type of earth, which rain falls upon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. So from among them is the scholar and doer of deeds, who teaches others. He bears the status of fresh earth that intakes the water and benefits itself with it and then produces vegetation thereby benefiting others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. And from among them is the one who gathers knowledge and strives to attain it, but doesn’t act upon its requirements or he doesn’t understand what he has gathered. However, he passes it on to others. So he bears the status of the earth upon which water settles, and which the people benefit from by using.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type of person was indicated by the Prophet (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) in his saying: <span style="color:#008000;">“May Allaah brighten (the face) of a man that hears a statement from me, retains it in memory and then passes it on just as he heard it.”</span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. And from among them is he who hears the knowledge but doesn’t preserve it or act upon it or pass it along to others. So it bears the status of the smooth barren land that neither intakes water nor passes it onto others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) only joined the first two praiseworthy groups in this parable due to their sharing in giving off benefit. And he singled out the third condemned group due to there being no benefit in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So take hold of the prophetic knowledge my brother and act upon it, Allaah will raise you due to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah will raise those who believe amongst you and those who have been given knowledge many levels.”</span> [Soorah Al-Mujaadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Say: Are those who have knowledge equal to those who do not have knowledge?”</span> [Soorah Az-Zumar: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And stick to acting upon it and calling to it, as Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“And who is better in speech than the one who calls to Allaah and does righteous deeds and says: Indeed I am among the Muslims.”</span> [Soorah Fussilat: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And yearn to be from the first category, from those who accept this light (knowledge) that the Prophet Muhammad (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) brought, for Allaah will put light into your heart due to it and bring life to it. The correct and good livelihood cannot come to be except with it (i.e. this knowledge).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware of being from the third category, from those who do not accept the guidance of Allaah nor have any concern for it.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Benefits from the Hadeeth:</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The magnificence of the guidance and knowledge that the Prophet (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) came with, which is the Qur’aan and the Sunnah and their effect in the lives of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. People are in various levels with respect to their willingness to either accept or reject what the Messenger came with. People have different natures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The virtue of knowledge, teaching and spreading good to the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The danger of turning away from what the Messenger of Allaah (sall-Allaahu `alayhi wa sallam) came with from the Book and the Sunnah from one aspect. This turning away (from knowledge) indicates the malicious natures of these opposers and their low status in the sight of Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, all praise is for Allaah. We praise Him, we seek His assistance and we ask Him for His forgiveness. And we seek refuge in Him from the evils of our souls and from the evils of our actions. Whosoever Allaah guides, there is none that can lead him astray. And whosoever is lead astray, there is no guide for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah &#8211; alone and with no partner. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah sent Muhammad with the Guidance and the Religion of Truth, in order that it can gain supremacy over all religions, even though the disbelievers may hate it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah commanded His Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) to establish the call (da&#8217;wah) to Him with wisdom, fair admonition and arguing that is done in the best manner. Likewise He commanded him to openly declare the truth, as He says: <b>“So proclaim openly that which you have been commanded, and turn away from the polytheists.”</b> [Surah Al-Hijr: 94]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He commanded him to wage Jihaad against the polytheists, disbelievers and hypocrites, by way of the Qur&#8217;aan, the sword and the spear, to the point that there would remain no more fitnah and the Religion would all be purely for Allaah alone. And so that the word of the disbelievers can become the lowest (in the land) and so that word of Allaah can be the highest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) rose to fulfill this great obligation of professing the truth and performing Jihaad for the sake of Allaah &#8211; the way it should be performed – up until the day he died.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then his (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) rightly-guided Khaleefahs continued upon his methodology after him &#8211; and so they waged Jihaad against those Muslims who apostated in the Arab peninsula (after the Prophet&#8217;s death). This was such that they brought this crucial movement of apostasy to an end. Then they carried the banner of Jihaad to all parts of the world and Allaah gave them victory over the strongest forces of kufr (disbelief) at that time – the Persians, the Romans and others. And so this brought to reality Allaah&#8217;s promise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;Allaah has promised those among you who believe and do good deeds, that He will certainly grant them ascendancy in the land as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the ability to practice the Religion, which He has chosen for them. And He will place in exchange of their fear a sense of security (provided), that they worship Me and do not ascribe any partners to Me. And whoever disbelieves afterward, then those are the evildoers.&#8221;</b> [Surah An-Noor: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Commander of the Believers, &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) – the ingenious one through whom Allaah gave glory to Islaam – served as a preventive barrier and a closed door in the face of fitan (trials), corruption and evil. So the heretics and fire-worshippers (Majoos) conspired against him and eventually carried out their plot by murdering him. So he went back to his Lord as a martyr, after having filled the earth with justice, Eemaan and light. But that firm and solid door (which he had established) fell apart after his death and so the various forms of fitnah entered and penetrated into the ranks of the Muslims during the time of the noble Khaleefah &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn &#8216;Affaan (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). And it grew worse and worse to the point that it led to the death of this Khaleefah. So he too, went back to his Lord as a martyr that was wronged.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a result of these afflictions, there transpired that which occurred between the fourth righteous Khaleefah &#8216;Alee (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and Mu&#8217;awiyah Ibn Abee Sufyaan (radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa). However, they were both mujtahids in that matter &#8211; so the one who was correct earned two rewards, while the one who erred was given one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there came to pass the fitnah of the people of innovation from the Khawaarij – those whom the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) described, concerning their excessiveness in worship, as:<b> &#8220;They will shoot out from the Religion just as the arrow shoots out from the (hunted) prey.&#8221; </b>And he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) described them as: <b>&#8220;The worst of mankind and creatures.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:<b> &#8220;They are the worst of those below the surface of the heaven&#8221; and &#8220;Kill them wherever you find them, for indeed, he who kills them will have a great reward with Allaah.&#8221;</b> [Agreed Upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As well as that which holds the greatest warning to those who call towards being close and having sympathy for the innovators – in that they are worse, more vile and possess more dangerous plots and schemes (than the innovators do). That was why ‘Alee (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) killed these individuals as he was commanded to by the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then there appeared the fitnah of the ideologies of the Raafidah and the Zanaadiqah. And ‘Alee (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) did not see anything more fitting to cure the hearts of the believers other than to burn them in fire. And he received aid from those noble Companions who took part in this campaign.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is what the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) and his righteous Companions prescribed for us from firmness and determination when dealing with innovators and heretics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then as time passed on and the best of generations came to an end, the innovations grew worse, their domains widened and their sects became many. Thus it became a reality what the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) informed us of and warned us about, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“You will follow the ways of those who came before you inch by inch and cubit by cubit, such that if they were to enter into the hole of a lizard, you would surely follow after them.” We said: “O Messenger of Allaah! Do you mean the Jews and the Christians?” He said: “Who else?”</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when he said:<br />
<b>“The Jews divided into seventy-one sects and the Christians divided into seventy-two sects. And my ummah will divide into seventy-three sects. All of them will be in the Hellfire except one.” They said: “Which one is it, O Messenger of Allaah?” He said: “The one that adheres to that which I and my Companions are upon.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another wording, he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“It is the Jamaa’ah.”</b> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars of Islaam such as Ibn Al-Mubaarak, Yazeed Ibn Haaroon, Ibn Al-Madeenee, Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, Al-Bukhaaree, Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee, Ibn Taimiyyah and Ibn Rajab have interpreted this saved and victorious sect as being Ahl-ul-Hadeeth and those who adhere to their methodology. Many of these interpretations of theirs occur when mentioning the Prophet’s (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) saying: <b>“There will not cease to be a group from my ummah triumphant upon the truth. Those who abandon them will not be able to harm them nor will those who oppose them, until Allaah’s order (promise) comes to pass and they are upon that (condition).”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this group did not cease to exist ever since the time when the calamities originated and the desires created divisions within the ummah, resulting in the number (seventy-three) mentioned above. This group did not cease to be upon Allaah’s command, calling others towards the truth and spreading the sciences brought down from the prophethood. Nor did they desist from safeguarding and protecting the Religion. Nor did they refrain from refuting the schemes of the conspirators, the false claims of the liars and the distortions of the ignorant. Neither the abuse and plotting of the schemers nor the evil planning of the conspirators was able to prevent them from doing that. And the difficulties that they experienced did not increase them, except in further confirming the truth and displaying strength in the face of falsehood. Such was the case during the times of Imaam Ahmad and &#8216;Abdul-Ghanee Al-Maqdisee and during the time of Ibn Taimiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah paved the way for the da’wah of the Imaam, the reformer, Shaikh Muhammad Ibn ‘Abd-il-Wahhaab in the Arab peninsula – the site of revelation and the place of the Message. But this only came after the darkness of ignorance, misguidance and disorder had reigned over it for generations. So he raised the banner of Tawheed and held high the flags of Islaam. And due to his efforts and the efforts of his brothers from the people of Tawheed and the Sunnah, a state based upon Tawheed and the Sunnah was established. But the ongoing battles between them and the people of falsehood continued and progressed to a standstill, until the state of Tawheed and the Sunnah finally became settled and its foundations firmly rooted at the hands of the king ‘Abd-ul-‘Azeez and his Muslim brothers, who were sincere warriors and truthful scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And thus the light of Tawheed and Eemaan spread throughout the world, removing the darknesses of Shirk and innovation from here and there. This came about by way of the distribution of the books of the Salaf As-Saalih (righteous predecessors), such as those on the subjects of Hadeeth, Tafseer and Tawheed, and especially those of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah and Ibn Al-Qayyim. It came about by way of the founding of schools of various grade levels, beginning with elementary schools and continuing onto universities and institutes of higher and specialized studies. This was in connection with the centers of da’wah that were spread out both inside (Saudi Arabia) and outside of it, in order to carry the message of Tawheed and the Sunnah. As well as all those other things which took sleep away from the opponents of Truth and Tawheed from amongst the secularists, Jews, Christians, communists and deviant innovators such as those who form into sects, parties and movements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the most dangerous of these (above) categories and the ones who produced the worst consequences were the people of innovation – the spiteful ones that are filled with hatred. This is since by their plotting, scheming and their camouflaging of themselves behind the cover of the Sunnah, they were able to penetrate every barrier. Thus they managed to pour into every crack from these schools, universities and masaajid. And they were able to create a group that carried their ideologies, whether all of it or some of it, and whether intentionally or unintentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this group – which they had trained and prepared according to the way they saw fit – began to form movements calling the people towards these ideologies in the universities, schools and elsewhere. And they upheld it by becoming active in this place and in that place. And these were crucial and significant times in which the da’wah (call) to Allaah had a great need for enthusiastic and active individuals that would raise its flag with firmness and conviction, fighting the armies of falsehood, schemes and plots and thus turning them back upon their heels in disgrace</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then using the name of Salafiyyah and the names of justice and fairness, this group was able to present the innovators – those who waged war against the people of Sunnah and Tawheed in their own land – as ones who were oppressed. And they corrupted the minds and the beliefs of many of the youth, distorting the image of the Salafi Manhaj and its adherents in the eyes of the youth. Then the figureheads within this group began calling towards a “new methodology” with regard to criticizing methodologies, ideologies, books and individuals – and they claimed that this was the methodology that was just and fair. So many of he youth and those who wrote in their favor began to think that such was the correct way. Rather, they even claimed that it was the methodology of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah! And this spread and circulated in the writings of some of those who ascribed themselves to the Salaf. And it had an effect on many of the youth, such that they accepted it and clung onto it, thinking that it was the truth and that it was just. And then unfortunately, that began to become deeply rooted in their hearts and they did not realize that this was a way of thinking that was foreign to Islaam and Muslims. This view crept into them from their enemies in the same manner that other (deviant) ideologies had crept into Islaamic societies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The effects of this methodology became clearly apparent in the conversations, debates, writings and attitudes of many of the youths and teachers. So this methodology began to take firm root in the people’s hearts. And from its evil consequences was that it weakened the principle of Al-Walaa wal-Baraa (loyalty and disassociation) to Allaah and for the sake of Allaah, and to the methodology of Allaah and those who adhere to it – those whom it is obligatory to love and to be loyal to for the sake of Allaah. Instead there became manifest the loyalty, love and esteem for the callers, books, ideologies and methodologies that were all far from the Salafi Manhaj, and for their people and not its people. Rather, that became the main avenue used in fighting against the Salafi Manhaj. And they changed it with strong determination so that it (the manhaj) would be replaced from its original form, halting its progression in its tracks after its departure had already taken place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This (new) methodology had a great influence upon writers who we once thought were from the best of the Salafis and from the virtuous characters, personages and figures. We ask Allaah to grant them the ability to tread the way and methodology of their righteous predecessors in regards to calling to the clear methodology of the Salaf, the dedicated education of the youth that are upon it and implanting love for it and its followers whether they are dead or alive, and to follow their example and strengthen themselves by affiliating themselves to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, this methodology, of which it is claimed that it is balanced and fair, has had a great influence upon the youth whom we used to and still have not stopped having hope in, that they will take a hold of the Salafi Manhaj with resoluteness and carry its banner with firmness, calling to it with vigor and sacrificing for its sake every expensive and cheap thing from wealth, status, activities and actions that they have. But unfortunately the state of current affairs is not this way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why the hearts indeed tremble with fear for them, that these methodologies should mix in with them and they adopt them, and that their (evil) banners mix with theirs and they adopt them. And there is nothing after the truth except falsehood. So they will display to them that everyone is upon truth or that they are all brothers coming from one origin. And it is possible that they will take some of these (ideas) as a substitute for the true Salafi Manhaj and that they will prefer that banner over its banner, since it is very glamorous, loud and radiant. And this is even if this (methodology) is empty and void of any principles of Islaam and blind in the subject of clinging onto the Qur’aan and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This methodology we have been indicating has many other signs, which I do not see fit to mention here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that Allaah grants me success in presenting the (true) Islaamic Salafi Manhaj with regard to criticizing individuals, groups, books and calls, based upon the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and the texts indicating the position the Muslim scholars took and the behavior they implemented in the books of Al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel and in the books of Sunnah and Islamic beliefs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I undertook this project motivated by my love for this believing youth, whom I consider – by Allaah – to be the greatest of treasures in this life. And we would ransom our souls and livelihoods for them. And we strictly watch over their proper procession upon the ways and paths of this life. So if their souls, minds and hearts yearn for the home of their first love,[3] then that is from what Allaah loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>“Place your heart wherever you wish from your desires<br />
For the true love is only for the first loved one<br />
How many homes on the earth is the young man’s heart attached to<br />
Yet his longing will always be for his first (original) home.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if some of them refuse, insisting to be upon indecisiveness, confusion, inconsistencies and shakiness, then know that the hearts are between the two fingers of the Most Merciful &#8211; He changes it however He wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And to Allaah belongs the Command of what came before and what will come after.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee<br />
SOURCE: His book &#8220;<i>Manhaj Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah fee Naqd ar-Rijaal wal Kutub wat-Tawaa&#8217;if</i>&#8221; (pg. 33-43 of 3rd Edition)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are guidelines, which define those whom we are required to respect and honor from among mankind, such that it is not permissible to harm their honor. And they define those whom it is permissible to speak about and criticize, rather, whom it is obligatory to criticize at the time of necessity and benefit, without having to mention their good qualities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>· Those whom we are obligated to honor</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First: The Messengers and Prophets, may Allaah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon all of them</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has related to us their stories, showing their striving and perseverance, while He has repudiated those who denied and opposed them. And He commanded the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) as well as his ummah to follow their example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: The Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing that the Muslim ummah should feel towards them except love and respect. Allaah has praised them highly in His Book. And He spoke about their high rank, their efforts and the sacrifices they made with their wealth and their lives in the Cause of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) praised them highly, both on an individual and a group level. This is such that the scholars of Islaam devoted special and close attention to their merits and qualities, writing many books concerning their virtues and special characteristics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade us from insulting them, saying: <b>&#8220;Do not revile my Companions. For I swear by the One in whose hand my soul is in, if one of you were to give in charity the likes of mount Uhud in gold, it would not equal a mudd (handful using 2 hands) of one of them nor even half of it.&#8221;</b> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah are well aware of their position and status, and so they guard it with the strictest form of guarding. And they forbid others from speaking vainly about what occurred of dispute between &#8216;Alee (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) and Mu&#8217;awiyah (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) and those who supported them from the rest of the Companions. Rather, they assert for them the reward that is given to the <i>mujtahids</i>. And they ruled that all those who spoke about them – or even about one of them – were upon deviance, misguidance and heresy.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Third: Those who followed them in goodness</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This includes those who reached the (time of the) Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) and were guided by their guidance, such as the seven scholars of Fiqh of Madeenah and those who followed their way in the rest of the towns. Then after them, are the scholars of Hadeeth, Fiqh and Tafseer – those who strove upon the way of the righteous Companions and Successors. And it includes those who followed their methodology with regard to Creed, holding tightly onto the Book and the Sunnah, avoiding innovations, vain desires and its adherents, and defending the truth and its adherents, up until this day of ours and after it, until Allaah&#8217;s promise comes about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the ones whom the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) was referring to when he said: <b>&#8220;There will not cease to be a group from my ummah, triumphant upon the truth. Those who abandon them will not be able to harm them nor will those who oppose them, until the order (promise) of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, comes.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are better known as Ahl-ul-hadeeth, as has been agreed upon by the Imaams of Islaam and the scholars of guidance. And no one opposes them in regard to what they have agreed on except those from the people of vain desires, ignorance and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad, Al-Haakim and Ibn Al-Qayyim have indeed accused those who criticize them of being heretics. And those who spoke vilely about them (the scholars) have been repudiated severely by Ibn Qutaybah, Ar-Raamaharzamee, Al-Khateeb (Al-Baghdaadee) and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there is no doubt that no one speaks against them except for those whom Allaah has led astray and blinded. So if one of these (scholars) errs in an issue from the issues in which Ijtihaad is allowed, it must be clarified but not in the manner of condemning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said with regard to these (scholars):<br />
“So whoever is known to have (the ability to perform) the allowable Ijtihaad, then it is not permissible for him to be mentioned in a manner of condemnation or blame, because Allaah has forgiven him of his error. Instead, it is an obligation due to what he possesses of Eemaan and Taqwaa to show loyalty and love to him, and to fulfill what Allaah has mandated from his rights, such as praising him, making du’aa (supplication) for him, and so on.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>· Those whom it is permissible to criticize, disparage and warn the people against their harm:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First: The People of Innovation</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible – rather obligatory – to speak about the people of innovation and warn against them and their fabrications, whether individually or as groups and whether they are absent or present. They include those among the Khawaarij, the Rawaafid, the Jahmiyyah, the Murji&#8217;ah, the Karaamiyyah and the people of Rhetoric – those whose knowledge of <i>Kalaam</i> (rhetoric) has brought them to corrupted and deviant beliefs,[3] such as the rejection of all or some of Allaah&#8217;s Attributes. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is an obligation to warn against these types of people, their books and their misguided ways. And how great in number they are!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the same applies to those who follow their methodology from the sects [and groups] of our time, such as those who separate themselves away from the people of Tawheed and Sunnah, oppose them and remain far away from their aspects of the methodology. In fact, they wage war against these aspects of the methodology and chase others away from it and its adherents (i.e. the scholars). The likes of these individuals are followed by those who support and defend them. And these followers of theirs mention their good qualities and praise them for it, praising their personalities and leaders. And they have preferred their (innovated) methodologies over the methodology of the people of Tawheed, the Sunnah and the Jamaa&#8217;ah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second: Reporters of Hadeeth and Witnesses, if they are deemed Unreliable</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to criticize these people according to the consensus of the Muslims. Rather, it is an obligation. This has been mentioned and related by An-Nawawee and Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on both of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. So if the scholars of the science of al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel all agree upon criticizing a narrator, accusing him of lying or making gross mistakes. Or they say: &#8220;His hadeeth are to be rejected&#8221;, &#8220;He has baseless (weak) hadeeth&#8221; or what resembles that, then it is permitted for everyone doing research or quoting to quote or report that. And it is not required of him – in the least – to mention that person&#8217;s good qualities, not to mention doing research on all of his good qualities and then mentioning them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. As for the narrators of which there is differing as to whether or not they are reliable or unreliable, or the narrators who were innovators, then:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The First Type:</b> To list the mention of that narrator&#8217;s criticism first and accept it without considering the sayings of those who declared him reliable would be abandoning something from the Religion and from what has been established on the leader of the Messengers (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>). And this is a great injustice and a negligence of something that is part of the Religion, which we are obligated to preserve. And it is a trust that falls on the neck of the scholars (i.e. it is their duty). So in this case, for the benefit of the Religion and for preserving it, and for the sake of giving a general benefit to the Muslims, we must seek to verify the reality of the matter. And we must weigh between the sayings of the scholars of Jarh wa-Ta’deel, taking that which is more established, whether it is from the criticism (<i>jarh</i>) or the approval (ta&#8217;deel).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is for the purpose of bringing about this beneficial good, not because it is an obligation to make a balance for the condition of that individual who has been declared unreliable (between his good and bad qualities)! So if it is established that he is in fact unreliable after having done the research, it is permitted to relate his unreliability without mentioning this balancing (between those who criticized him and those who approved of him). And no scholar said that (mentioning) this (balancing) was obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the innovator, then if we are in the position of warning against the innovations, then we warn against him, mentioning his innovation only. And it is not an obligation on us to mention any of his good qualities. And if we are in the subject of narrating reports, then it is an obligation to mention his trustworthiness and honesty, if he was in fact trustworthy and honest, for the purpose of benefiting, attaining and preserving the narration. Not for any other purpose, such as the obligation of making a balance (<i>muwaazanah</i>) between his good and bad qualities, as some people claim! So it is not required on us to mention his generosity or his knowledge or his courage or his efforts and good manners, as well as all those other things that have no relation to the subject of narrating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were some among the Salaf who would reject the reports of the people of innovation and those who were accused (of weakness, lying).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) said: <b>&#8220;There was once a time in which when a man would say: &#8216;Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said…&#8217; our eyes would hasten to him and our ears would open wide (to listen) to him. But when the difficulties and disgrace befell the people, we did not take from the people except, for that which we knew.&#8221;</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Ibn Sireen said: <b>&#8220;The people never used to ask about the isnaad (chain of narration). But when the fitnah (afflictions) occurred, they began to say: &#8216;Name your men to us.&#8217; So the Ahl-us-Sunnah would be looked upon and their hadeeth would be accepted. And the people of innovation would be looked upon and their hadeeth would not be accepted.&#8221;</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The words of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas and Ibn Sireen indicate that this was the general view of the Salaf at the time, during the days of the last of the Companions and their Successors (Taabi&#8217;een) after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps this existed in them due to their awareness of being in no need of the narrations of innovators. So they took this firm and solid stance against them. But when those who came after them were obliged to take the reports of the truthful ones among the innovators, they accepted it from them, only under certain conditions and stipulations, which consisted of taking the sound from it, while rejecting the crooked and corrupt aspects from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu Ishaaq Ibraaheem Ibn Ya&#8217;qoob Al-Jawzjaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Among them was he who deviated from the truth, yet still possessed an honest tongue. And his hadeeth would be widespread amongst the people since he was forsaken for his innovation but trusted with his narration. So concerning these individuals, I see no other alternative but to take from their hadeeth that which is (already) known, so long as his innovation does not become strengthened because of that.&#8221; [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>· Third: Those whom it is permissible to backbite:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawawee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Chapter: What is permissible from backbiting:<br />
Know that backbiting is permissible for a legitimate and legislated reason, of which the allowance for doing it (the backbiting) would not be possible without it. And they are six reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: Oppression</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: Seeking help for changing an evil and returning a sinner to what is correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third: When seeking a legal ruling</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fourth: Warning and advising the Muslims against an evil. This is in several perspectives, one of which is: Criticizing those who have been declared unreliable in narration and testimony. This is permissible according to the unanimous agreement of the Muslims. Rather it becomes obligatory for necessity&#8217;s sake…&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is up to the point where he said:<br />
&#8220;One last case is when one sees a student frequenting an innovator or a deviant, seeking to attain knowledge from him, and he fear that the student may be affected by that. Then it is upon him to advise him of the condition of that innovator, providing that his intention only be for the sake of advising…&#8221; [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His complete words will be mentioned later in its due place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>I say: So you see that he did not make it a condition for one to mention the good qualities of the person who is being warned against. And he did not say that it was an obligation to make a balance (between good and bad qualities) as those people make it an obligation, holding that if one abandons doing this balancing then it goes against the trust and it shuns equity and justice!</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Someone once said to Ahmad Ibn Hanbal: ‘It is becoming difficult upon me to say, This person is such and such, and that person is such and such (i.e. criticizing them).&#8217; So he (Ahmad) said: &#8216;If you were to remain silent and I were to remain silent, then when will the ignorant person know the authentic from the weak?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>And since advising is obligatory with regard to (bringing) beneficial good in the Religion, specific and general:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such as is the case when reporters of Hadeeth have made mistakes or lied, as Yahyaa Ibn Sa&#8217;eed said: “I asked Maalik, Ath-Thawree, Laith Ibn Sa&#8217;ad – I think – and Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee about a man that was accused with regard to hadeeth, so they all said: ‘Convey (expose) his affair.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And such as is the case when the leaders of innovation from those who voiced sayings contrary to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and who performed worship contrary to that of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Then indeed, clarifying their condition and warning the ummah against them is an obligation based on the unanimous agreement of the Muslims.</b> This is such that it was once said to Ahmad Ibn Hanbal: “Is a man that fasts, prays and makes &#8216;Itikaaf more beloved to you or one that speaks out against the people of innovation?” So he (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: “If he fasts, prays and performs &#8216;Itikaaf then that is only for himself, but if he speaks out against the innovators then indeed this is for all of the Muslims. And this is better.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam, Ibn Taimiyyah, said:<br />
“So he has explained that the benefit of (doing) this is general for all of the Muslims with regard to their Religion. And it is from the types of Jihaad that is done in the Way of Allaah. This is since cleansing Allaah&#8217;s way, His Religion, methodologies and legislation, and repelling the transgression of these individuals and having enmity against them is a collective obligation (<i>fard kifaayah</i>), according to the consensus of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if it were not for those whom Allaah placed to repel the harm of these individuals, the Religion would have indeed been corrupted. And the corruption experienced from these individuals is greater than the corruption experienced from being conquered by the enemies (of Islaam) during war.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For indeed, when these (enemies) conquered (the Muslim lands), they did not corrupt the hearts (of the Muslims) and what they contained from Religion, except for what came afterward. But as for these individuals, then they corrupt the hearts from the very start.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he has lengthier words on this subject, which will be mentioned later.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the true methodology of the Salaf, not just a claim. And it is that methodology, which was followed by Ibn Taimiyyah and others from the sincere and honest Mujaahideen. And no criticism of a critic ever rebuked them, because they did this for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So where is it that making this kind of balancing (between good and bad qualities) must be a condition?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And where is the obligation for mentioning a person’s good qualities (when criticizing him), which we hear so often repeated unjustly in defense of those callers to misguidance?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather you have seen that Ibn Taimiyyah held that it was an obligation to refute the people of vain desires. And that it was from the different types of Jihaad in the Way of Allaah, since it is a way of cleansing His Religion, methodologies and legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Sayings of the Imaams concerning the People of Innovation and (Hadeeth) Narrators:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the scholars of Islaam have indeed spoken out against the people of innovation and the (weak) reporters. And they did not indicate in the least towards the obligation of making it a condition to create this type of balancing (between good and bad qualities). They authored books on the subject of al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel and books in support of the Sunnah and in refutation of the people of innovation and in criticizing them. And they wrote books on the defects (of hadeeth) and books on the fabricated ahaadeeth. They did not make it an obligation to make this type of balancing (<i>Muwaazanah</i>) at all. In fact, they even wrote books specifically with just Jarh (discrediting of reporters) in them, and limiting them to mentioning only those (narrators) that were declared unreliable or those who were spoken about with criticism. So they did not place this principle (of<i>Muwaazanah</i>) as a condition at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus Imaam Al-Bukhaaree – who was who he was with regard to possessing authority, religious characteristics, good manners and piety – wrote two books on weak narrators and he named them &#8220;<i>Al-Kabeer</i>&#8221; and &#8220;<i>As-Sagheer</i>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And An-Nasaa&#8217;ee wrote a book about the weak and rejected narrators called <i>ad-Du&#8217;afaa wal-Matrookeen</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-&#8216;Aqeelee wrote a book on weak narrators, which is known as <i>ad-Du&#8217;afaa</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Adiyy authored a book, <i>al-Kaamil</i>, about those who were criticized.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hibbaan wrote a book specifically about those who were declared unreliable called <i>al-Majrooheen</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ad-Daaraqutnee and Ibn Ma&#8217;een have numerous books in which they answer questions concerning weak narrators and rejected reporters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haakim wrote a book called <i>ad-Du&#8217;afaa</i> (Weak Narrators), which is a chapter from his (bigger book) <i>al-Madkhal</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Nu&#8217;aim and Ibn Al-Jawzee wrote on this subject also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adh-Dhahabee wrote three books on those who were declared unreliable and those who were criticized, which are <i>al-Meezaan, al-Mughnee and Deewaan ad-Du&#8217;afaa</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr authored <i>Lisaan al-Meezaan</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise, the books on al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel are filled with the discrediting of those who were declared unreliable (<i>majrooheen</i>), especially the books of Imaam Yahyaa Ibn Ma&#8217;een. So they did not make it a condition that this <i>Muwaaznah</i> (mentioning good and bad qualities) must be employed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Indeed, this methodology, which makes this <i>Muwaaznah</i> a condition, is indeed from that which results in: The discrediting returning back to the (past) scholars of Islaam, and their falling into the web of being accused with injustice and treachery (i.e. since they did not mention the good deeds of those whom they criticized). We seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from a methodology that produces such kinds of consequences.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here, it is appropriate to mention some examples of the criticism of the Imaams (scholars) on some people, in which they just mentioned the criticism without showing any consideration to what they had from good qualities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Imaam Ahmad, may Allaah have mercy on him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Al-Marwadhee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) said: &#8220;Abu &#8216;Abdillaah (Ahmad Ibn Hanbal) once mentioned Haarith al-Muhaasibee and said: &#8216;Haarith is the source of all this affliction – meaning the innovations of the views of Jahm. There is no calamity except for Haarith.'&#8221; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Habeeb Ibn Abee Hilaal: Ahmad said of him: &#8220;He is rejected.&#8221; [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Habeeb Ibn Jahdar: Ahmad declared him a liar. [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Al-Hasan Ibn Dhakwaan: Ahmad said of him: &#8220;His ahaadeeth are forged&#8221; and in one report, he said: &#8220;He is of no significance.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Imaam Al-Bukhaaree, may Allaah have mercy on him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. He said: &#8220;Jisr bin Farqad: Yahyaa Ibn ad-Darees and others reported about him that: &#8216;He is of no significance.'&#8221; [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Khaalid bin Iyaas al-Qurshee al-&#8216;Adawee al-Madanee: &#8220;He is nothing.&#8221; [15]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: Is it permissible to perform ruqyah on a disbeliever?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh Rabee (hafidhahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible. Abu Sa&#8217;eed (radhi Allaahu anhu), performed ruqyah on a disbeliever when he went out with a military detachment and passed by a group of people by a well whom they asked permission to be hosted but this group refused to do so. Then when their leader was stung by a scorpion, they came and said: &#8220;Our leader has been stung. Do you have anyone that can treat him with ruqyah?&#8221;  The Companions replied: &#8220;By Allaah, we will not treat him with ruqyah until you give us compensation. We sought your permission but you refused to host us!&#8221; The group gave them a flock of sheep and the leader was treated with Surah Al-Faatihah and cured as if he was freed from shackles!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows you that the person who performed ruqyah was sincere. The Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) concurred with him and with his using Surah Al-Faatihah as a ruqyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today, those who perform ruqyah take gifts and money from people even if they do not heal the people they treat!! A condition for the permissibility of taking compensation for ruqyah is that the sick person must be healed, as was the case in the afore-mentioned hadeeth where, upon receiving the ruqyah, the man was cured as if he had just been released from shackles. And as a result of this, the Companions took the flock of sheep as payment. But had the man not been cured, they would not have taken the flock.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, today, the one who performs ruqyah is eager to take money. The sick and unfortunate go to him with their illnesses and misfortunes and they do not receive any help from him yet their money is seized. This money that they take is unlawful, may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Posted from <span style="color:#666699;">the excellent book (published by al-ibaanah) </span><strong style="color:#666699;"><em>The Rules and Etiquettes of Ruqya</em></strong><span style="color:#666699;">, by Shaikh Saalih Aalush-Shaikh , Q&amp;A Session on Ruqya with Shaykh Rabee</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon Allah’s Messenger, his household, his companions, and whoever followed his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed, we do advise those concerned and occupied with memorizing the Qur’an to fear Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) and to be dutiful to Him, for He it is Who has guided them towards that goodly and blessed direction, namely memorizing the Book of Allah. This is a tremendous affair as it is the religion of Allah which He sent down as guidance to people. So memorize the Qur’an so proficiently that it is not forgotten, for this requires patience and perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It takes some people only two or three readings of a Qur’anic text to memorize it, yet this is not sufficient to firmly commit the Qur’an to one’s memory. As a matter of fact, it demands great deal of repetition and long practice and perseverance, for the Qur’an is more liable to escape (from one’s memory) than a camel from its tying rope.[1a] If a person does not strongly and meticulously commit it to his memory and on top of that neglects to study it and to read it regularly, it will certainly escape from his memory faster than a camel escapes from its tying rope. So long as Allah has guided you to study and memorize the Qur’an, it behooves you to perfect that memorization.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having done with its memorization, you should then embark on learning the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) . Memorize as much as you can from it, such as ‘Umdatul- Ahkam and Bulugh Al-Maram. Memorize Imam Muhammad Ibn Adbulwahhab’s Book of Tawhid, whose subject matter is the tawhid of worship; and Imam Ibn Taymia’s “Al- Aqidatul-Wasitiyah”, on the topic of tawhid pertaining to the Names and Attributes and on the topic of ‘aqidah and manhaj. These are the foundations of Islam. If you learn them strongly and accurately, all of your ‘aqidah and manhaj related matters will be rectified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, I advise you to be sincere towards Allah, the Lord of the Universe, for all these matters that I have mentioned to you, i.e. memorizing the Qur’an and memorizing these texts and books, are amongst the greatest acts of worship whereby we seek nearness to Allah. We are in need of sincerity towards Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) with regards to these acts. So cultivate yourselves upon sincerity towards Allah, the Lord of the Universe, and study the texts that encourage towards sincerity from Riyadus-Salihin and from other than it, from the Qur’an itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says: <span style="color:#008000;">And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him).</span>(Qur’an, 98:5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad): &#8220;Verily, I am commanded to worship Allah (Alone) by obeying Him and doing religious deeds sincerely for Allah&#8217;s sake only and not to show off, and not to set up rivals with Him in worship</span>. (Qur’an, 39:11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah commands the Messenger (peace be upon him) to single Him out for worship and orders him to be sincere. Similarly, He commands the Ummah and those who follow him to be sincere. No act of worship is accepted unless it is carried out with sincerity, for sincerity is a great condition from the conditions for accepting acts of worship. Any act of worship that is performed seeking nearness to Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) must fulfill two conditions: sincerity towards Allah and following the Messenger (peace be upon him) ; that is to say, your deed should emanate from the Book and the Sunnah and be established upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness, i.e. by following the Messenger (peace be upon him) , and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.</span>(Qur’an, 18:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is to say, neither type of shirk should enter into this worship, be it major or minor shirk such as showing off.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, sincerity is an affair that is of considerable importance, and without it acts of worship are null and void, and are of no benefit in this life as well as in the hereafter. Worse still, they should bring destruction upon the one who performs them. For the one who shows off, Allah shall make a display of him; and the one who seeks to be heard, Allah shall expose him and disgrace him on the Day of Resurrection before those who will be witnessing. So do not recite the Qur’an in order to be said about you that so-and-so is a reciter. Indeed, one of the first three people upon whom hellfire will be enflamed is such a reciter. As the noble Messenger (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the first people who will be judged on the Day of Resurrection are: a man who died as a martyr. He will be brought forth, and He (Allah) will make His favors known to him and he will acknowledge them. Allah will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I fought in Your cause until I died as a martyr. Allah will say: You have lied. Rather, you fought in order to be said that you are brave, and that was said. Then a command will be passed regarding him and he will be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a man who acquired knowledge and taught it (to others), and learned the Qur’an and taught it (to others). He will be brought forth, and He (Allah) will make His favors known to him and he will acknowledge them. Allah will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I obtained knowledge and taught it and recited the Qur’an for Your sake. Allah will say: you have lied. Rather, you acquired knowledge so as to be said that you are a knowledgeable man and recited the Qur’an so as to be said that you are a reciter, and that was said. Then a command will be passed regarding him and he will be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And a man whom Allah increased his provision and granted every type of wealth. He will be brought forth, and He (Allah) will make His favors known to him and he will acknowledge them. Allah will say: What did you do with them? He will say: I left no way in which You like money to be spent without spending in it for Your sake. Allah will say: you have lied. Rather, you did that in order to be said that you are a generous man, and that was said. Then a command will be passed regarding him and he will be dragged along on his face until he is cast into Hellfire.[<em>Reported by Muslim (1905) from the narration of Abu Hurairah radhi Allaahu anhu</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadith causes fear in every Muslim and makes him think seriously about every action he performs, every word he utters, and every movement he makes. It makes him observe Allah in everything he does. It behooves every believer to try to be from the people of uprightness and people of sincerity and to achieve the level of Ihsan in his worship, and that is to worship Allah as if you see Him, and since you do not see Him then He sees you. Therefore, it is binding upon man to cultivate himself upon these affairs, not to be cultivated upon the love of showing off and fame or any insignificant worldly pursuits and interests that do not weigh with Allah the wing of a mosquito. So you recite the Qur’an and memorize it so as to act upon it. Hence, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and the senior companions used to read ten verses to the other companions in order to memorize them and never moved on to other verses until they had memorized them and acted upon them, so they used to acquire knowledge and action simultaneously. This is a great manner of cultivation that Muslims have become totally oblivious to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Messenger (peace be upon him) , then Allah revealed the Qur’an to him gradually in sequential parts in proportion to the events and occasions over a period of twenty-three years. All this was done in order to raise the Ummah upon understanding this Qur’an, acting upon it, and implementing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (peace be upon him) used to teach them the Qur’an part by part, ten verses in each, and explain to them its meaning so that they would learn it and implement it. They would not proceed to the next text until they have grasped its meaning and put it into action. If it were a text pertaining to ‘aqidah, they would hold as a belief what is contained therein; if it were an exhortation to fight in the cause of Allah, they would hope in fighting in the cause of Allah or would actually set off for the battleground; and if it were an exhortation to charity and a righteous act or a promise of reward or a warning, they would never surpass it until they have fully comprehended all its content.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great cultivation indeed, yet people now are not capable of it. O young people! Bear this in your minds, for the Ummah is in need of sincere scholars who are free from whims and desires and purely devoted to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, nowadays desires are blowing the youth of the Ummah away (from the right salafi path) &#8212; desires pertaining to partisanship and other than it. A student of knowledge would devote himself sincerely to teaching the Qur’an, yet would be umbilically attached to parties that do not act upon that Qur’an but rather follow their own desires. So beware of this type of people, and upon you is sincerity towards Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala), seeking knowledge and acting upon the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of Allah’s Messenger. And I hope that you continue to pursue that 10 A WORD OF ADVICE FOR THOSE MEMORIZING THE BOOK OF ALLAH blessed course which started with memorizing the Qur’an until you become from the firmly established scholars whom Allah has praised and in whose favor He has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allah.</span>[Qur’an, 35:28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So much so, that some people of knowledge have stated that knowledge is fear of Allah, and this is not attainable except for scholars, scholars who have true knowledge of Allah, uphold His Names and Attributes and worship Allah therewith, and believe in Paradise as if they see it with their very eyes and believe in Hell as if they see it with their very eyes. In line with this, Handhalah ? said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr met me and said: How are you, Handhalah? I replied: Handhalah has become a munafiq (i.e. hypocrite).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: Glorified is Allah! What are you saying? I said: When we are in the company of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him)  and he reminds us of Hell and Paradise, it is as if we can see them with our very eyes. But when we leave the company of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) , we turn to our wives, children and properties, and so we tend to forget much (of what we heard from him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is to say, they become busy with farming and attending to their wives, etc. which he deemed to be hypocrisy. When he is in the company of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him), he is in a different state from that when he is away from his company.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr said: By Allah! I do experience the same. So I and Abu Bakr went to Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) and entered upon him. I said: Handhalah has become a munafiq (i.e. hypocrite), O Allah’s Messenger. So Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: And what’s that? I replied: When we are in your company and you remind us of Hell and Paradise, it is as if we can see them with our very eyes. But when we leave your company, we turn to our wives, children and properties, and so we tend to forget much (of what we hear from you). Thereupon, Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said: By Him in Whose Hand my soul is, if you persist upon that state which you achieve in my company and upon remembering (Allah), the Angels will shake hands with you in your beds and in your pathways; however, O Handhalah, there is time for this and time for that. He said this three times.[<em>Reported by Muslim (2750)</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet who amongst us now reaches that level?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has commanded that this Qur’an be contemplated: <span style="color:#008000;">That they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember</span> [Qur’an, 38:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, the souls cannot rise to that high levels or come up to the same standing as that of the companions. Yet the Qur’an is the means of elevation. By Allah, souls shall never rise to high levels except through this Qur’an and this Sunnah. Through genuine commitment, sincere belief and open sensibility, souls and minds get uplifted to superior status such that this world becomes of little worth to them and their lives become just as insignificant. Hence when the companions of Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) used to sit with him, it was as if they saw Paradise with their own eyes. Due to the strength of their belief, they presented their hearts and souls as a sacrifice in the cause of Allah for they deemed them to be of no value.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now you see many Muslims thoroughly preoccupied with this worldly life, such that al-wahan has crept up on us, and that is the love for this worldly life and hatred of death. Thus with this kind of life and with the deviant cultivation they acquire at misguided schools, Muslims have become scum, as the scum on a stream of water. By Allah, were they to understand this Qur’an, to be raised upon it in the correct manner, and to found their ‘aqidah and manhaj upon it, this condition of theirs would alter completely. Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you conduct ‘inah [1] transaction, and you follow the tails of cows, and you are content with farming, and you abandon jihad, Allah shall inflict disgrace upon you which He will not withdraw until you return to your religion.[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is to say, to that Qur’an and to the Sunnah by way of understanding it, implementing it, believing in it, and recognizing its lofty status with Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala), and with His Messenger and with the believers. If they return (to their religion) with this kind of spirit, Allah will reestablish their position and status in this life. But if they did not acknowledge the status of this Qur’an and went about taking their aqidah from here and there and importing their manhaj from here and there, they would be moving from one pitfall to another until they recover their awareness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The youth need to learn the Qur’an and to get the proper cultivation (based upon it) and to recognize its lofty status. They should also display the banner of the Qur’an and the Sunnah to the Ummah by spreading and disseminating the essence of the Qur’an which will raise them to the high standing that the companion achieved, in order that the Ummah return to its genuine religion &#8212; the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) , not this party, nor that group, nor that school of thought, nor that other sect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Implementing the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him) is the one and the only way out. There is no other remedy for the Ummah except that. All these distorted visions and empty slogans destroy the Ummah worse and worse. They are of no avail or use to the Ummah in any way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If memorizing and learning the Qur’an and the Sunnah is done with the purpose of ensuring victory and support for one’s party, then this is not the correct way. Today we find those who study to obtain degrees in order to promote their own parties, such that they distort and twist the religion of Allah and the speech of the scholars, all this in favor of their own parties. Some read the Qur’an as a means to promote their own party, some read the Qur’an as a means to promote their own sect, while others read the Qur’an as a means to promote their own ‘aqidah and manhaj. No! This is not the correct way. The correct way is to submit to the Qur’an and the Sunnah, not to direct them (i.e. the course of their interpretation) according to your frame of mind and desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We want memorizers of the Qur’an who understand it and comprehend it in accordance with the understanding of the righteous salaf, not the understanding of the people of innovations and misguidance or the understanding of the deviant parties. No matter what, do not put your trust in these parties, and do not lean towards them in matters of your religion. Rather, turn to the books of the salaf, the books of ‘aqidah, the books of hadith, the likes of the two Sahihs, the four books of Sunan [3], Ahmad’s Musnad, and other Masanid [4] and Ma’ajim [5]. We advise you to turn to these books, not to nashids and movies and other nonsense that has compromised and softened the youth of this Ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people have no knowledge. Therefore, it is obligatory that the youth be warned against their nonsense and their tricks and deception. They raise the youth upon fun and amusement and upon love for that. This was not the case with the companions, the followers, nor with the Imams up to this time of ours. Now amusement has become the primary occupation and interest before anything else. While the neglectful person intends to occupy himself with seeking knowledge, these people divert him towards these means of entertainment, namely nashids, movies, music, and so on and so forth. Indeed they have caused this Ummah more calamities on top of the ones it is already suffering. They claimed to save the Ummah from the state of loss it has come to, yet they only added to its trials and tribulations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is important though is that the sole remedy lies in the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger and the way of the salaf. That is to say, how they used to cultivate themselves, how their relationship with the Qur’an was, what their occupation was and how they spent their time. To the salaf, time was more precious than gold, yet now countless hours are wasted in amusement and absolute nonsense. Therefore, be cautious, O brothers, and commit yourselves to memorizing the Book of Allah and invest your time in memorizing it and memorizing the Sunnah, then memorizing some portion of the mutun (texts) that I mentioned to you above, and then acquire knowledge from scholars and traverse this path upon that clear and noble methodology. After that you will become the men of this Ummah, and by the Will of Allah you shall direct it towards goodness by means of knowledge, proof, and evidence and the correct cultivation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to save the Ummah by virtue of sincere men, and sincere men do not materialize except through the way part of which I elucidated above that is attained through correct cultivation upon the Qur’an and the Sunnah and holding in high esteem the manhaj of the salaf and keeping steadfast upon it and leading the Ummah to that good and to that path of guidance. We ask our Lord to accomplish that, for verily our Lord is indeed All-Hearer of invocation. And peace and blessings be upon Allah’s Messenger, his household, and his companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;line-height:1.5em;">All praises belong to Allaah, may prayers and salutations be upon the Messenger of Allaah, his family, companions and those who follow his guidance. As to what follows:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly Allaah has distinguished the ummah of Islaam over the other nations, because<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> we enjoin what is right and we forbid what is wrong</span>.</strong> Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“You are the best nation brought out of the people (because) you enjoin what is right and you forbid what is wrong.”</span> (3:110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (may peace be upon him said): <span style="color:#008000;">“Whoever of you sees an evil then let him change it with his hand, if he is not able then with his tongue, if he is not able then with his heart and that is the weakest of faith.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord has imposed on us that we are from those people who establish justice. As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Oh you who believe, be from those who establish justice and be witnesses for Allaah even if it is against yourselves, parents or kinfolk.”</span> (4:135)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also ordered us to cooperate upon righteousness and piety and not sin and transgression. As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“And cooperate upon righteousness and piety and do not cooperate upon sin and transgression, and have taqwa of Allaah; certainly Allaah is strong in punishment.”</span> (5:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah ordered us with jihad, as a means for spreading the religion and defending it</strong></span>. We were ordered to make jihad with the sword and with the tongue. We were ordered with the jihad of clarifying, (establishing) evidences, and proofs. And this is the jihad of the prophets (may peace be upon them all).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah ordered (us) with truthfulness</strong></span> and what comes along with it, and forbade us from lying and what comes along with it. The Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Upon you is to be truthful, for truthfulness guides to goodness and goodness guides to paradise. A man will continue to be truthful and he is lead to that, until it is written with Allaah that he is truthful. And beware of lying, for lying leads to wickedness and wickedness leads to the fire. A man will continue lying and he is lead to that until it is written with Allaah that he is a liar.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (may peace be upon him)<span style="color:#993300;"><strong> warned us from false suspicion</strong></span> when he said: “Beware of suspicion, for suspicion is the worst of false tales.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">He ordered us with brotherhood</span></strong> and being diligent upon coming together as brothers. The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“The Muslim is a brother to another Muslim, he does not deceive him nor desert him. The Muslim’s honor, wealth and blood are sacred.”</span> (Then he said) “Piety is here,” (pointing to his chest three times) and he said, <span style="color:#008000;">“It is sufficient enough evil for a person to hold his Muslim brother in contempt.”</span> (Narrated by at-Tirmidhi who said the hadeeth is hasan)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (may peace be upon him) (also) said: “Do not envy one another, do not hate one another, do not turn away from one another, do not inflate prices on one another, but be, (oh) servants of Allaah, brothers (to one another).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He ordered us with (giving) advice</strong></span>. He said: “The religion is advice.” So we said, “To whom, oh Messenger of Allaah?” He said: “To Allaah, to His Book, to His Messenger, to the leaders of the Muslims and to the common folk.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">He ordered us with helping the oppressed and the oppressor</span></strong>. He said: “Help your brother if he is an oppressor or oppressed.” A man then said: “Oh Messenger of Allaah, I (can see) helping him if he is being oppressed. But if I see that he is the oppressor how can I help him?!” He said: “Hold him and prevent him from oppression and this is (your) helping him.” (Narrated by al-Bukhaari)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah informed us that oppression will be darkness on the Day of Judgment. Allaah says: “Indeed, Allaah does not do injustice, [even] as much as an atom&#8217;s weight; while if there is a good deed, He multiplies it and gives from Himself a great reward.” (4:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (may peace be upon him) said (that Allaah says) in a Hadeeth al-Qudsi [1]: “Oh my servants, surely I have made oppression forbidden upon Myself and I have made it forbidden amongst you, therefore do not oppress (one another).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allaah has made excessiveness and extremism forbidden in the religion</strong></span>. Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“Oh People of the Scripture, do not commit excess in your religion or say about Allaah except the truth.”</span>(4:171)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Beware of excessiveness, for certainly the people before you were destroyed because of their excessiveness in the religion.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Do not exaggerate with me as the Christians exaggerated with (Jesus) the son of Mary.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He (Allaah) made forbidden partisanship and tribalism</strong></span>, as the Messenger of Allaah (may peace be upon him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> “Whoever is killed under the banner of a people whose cause is not clear and calls to fanatical partisanship or tribalism or supports it and is killed, he dies in a state of jaahiliyyah</span> [2].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is not correct for those who educate to make the people into parties or groups and to make enmity and hatred between them. Rather they should be as brothers, cooperating upon righteousness and piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">As Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;">“And cooperate upon righteousness and piety and do not cooperate upon sin and transgression, and have taqwa of Allaah, certainly Allaah is strong in punishment.”</span> (5:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">It is not (correct) for anyone to take a vow to be in agreement with everything that someone wants, and to support those whom he supports and to become an enemy to those he is an enemy to. Rather whoever does this, he is from the likes of Genghis Khan [3] and those similar to him. They are the ones who make those in agreement with them their supporting friends and they make those who oppose them their hated enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">What is binding upon them and their followers is the covenant of Allaah and His Messenger (may peace be upon him). So they must obey Allaah and His Messenger and work by what Allaah and His Messenger ordered. They must make forbidden that which Allaah and His Messenger made forbidden. They must take care of the rights of those (scholars and students) who educate people as Allaah and His Messenger have ordered. So if a teacher (scholar or student) is the one being oppressed, then he aids him and if a teacher is the oppressor, then he does not aid him in his oppression, rather he prevents him from it. As what has been authentically reported is that the Prophet (may peace be upon him) said: “Help your brother if he is an oppressor or oppressed.” A man then said: “Oh Messenger of Allaah, I (can see) helping him if he is being oppressed. But if I see that he is the oppressor how can I help him?!” He said: “Hold him and prevent him from oppression and this is (your) helping him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(End of Ibn Taymiyyah’s quote)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>It is obligatory for this ummah to establish these affairs of great benefits and upright principles. And (the ummah) must have a concern for this with a true care, whether it be an individual, group, tribe, or government, and specifically the scholars and the students of knowledge. This applies more specifically to those who ascribe themselves to the people of Sunnah and the Jamaa’ah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>So if there is (any) exceeding of the limits of these affairs or anything from them, great corruption will appear in the world and the religion, and this leads to the destruction of these great guideposts. In this is a dangerous evil and great corruption.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>And from that of which there is no doubt for the one who has intellect, there has occurred great exceeding of the limits and harmful oppression for the one who speaks the truth. He is rebutted for what is with him of the truth, belittled and insulted, and this is something extremely bad. It coming from a disbeliever (is one thing) but how much more coming from a Muslim?</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Therefore it is upon the Muslim ummah, specifically the youth who are its pillars, to honor and respect the truth and magnify it. It is upon them to despise falsehood and its people, whoever they may be. Allaah will honor them, give them might and elevate their affairs because of this. The opposite of this only brings misguidance, trials, and displeasure from Allaah. This will (lead) to punishments in the life of this world. From these punishments is that the enemies will have authority over them until they return to their true religion and adhere to it.</em></p>

<h2>About This Publication</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these times of great division and media saturation, this treatise is an essential read to help mankind in general, and Muslims specifically, discern between what is correct and authentic knowledge, from what is misleading.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this publication, the Shaykh begins by explaining to the readers the reasons why Knowledge of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah is a necessity in our lives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He further elaborates on the fundamental importance of evidence and proof in the study of Islam and the responsibility we have in staying away from blind following.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, in seeking the correct understanding of Islam, he makes clear the status of the Companions when he says, ‘No matter how much an individual excels in intelligence, aptitude and cleverness, he cannot do without the understanding of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even great Scholars like Shaafi’ee, Malik, Ahmed, Abu Haneefa and others were in great need of referring back to the illustrious companions (may Allah be pleased with them). Ash- Shaafi’ee said: ‘The companions are superior to us in all aspects of knowledge, intelligence and understanding.’’</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Compiled by The Eminent Shaykh, the Muhaddith, Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the place which is enlightened by the Book and the Sunnah in the Islaamic world is the place of the People of Hadeeth, as-Salafiyoon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the place which is darkened in the Islaamic world is the place of the People of Bida’ and misguidance, those who oppose the people of Hadeeth and wage war against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the present day political groups – who have among them Ikhwaan Muslimoon and their likes – and the deviant sects – who have among them Jamaat Tabligh – want this darkness to remain in dominance over the Islaamic world and to cover it, they do not even move against it. They have no intention of eliminating it and they have no Manhaj (methodology) to direct them to its removal or to establish Tawheed and the light of the Book and the Sunnah, taking its place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they guard this darkness &#8211; especially the darkness of the Rafidah and Soofeeyah- with the justification that they are combating the enemies of Islaam, although they definitely do not do this. Their justification is that they say, ‘We cooperate in what we agree upon and overlook what we differ upon,’ which they justify further with their claim that they gather the Muslims together along with the Rawafidah and the extreme Soofees in order to confront the enemies of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, they wage war against the people of Hadeeth, placing different obstacles and hindrances in front of them which then prevent the people from being enlightened by that which the People of Hadeeth have of the light of Tawheed and the light of the Book, the Sunnah and the Manhaj of the Salaf-as-Saalih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How long will the defence of this darkness subjected upon the Ummah continue?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When will the Muslims see this light?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim -Rahimullaah- said, quoting as-Samaanee -Rahimullaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Every sect from the people of Bida’ claims that they adhere to the Sharia’ of Islaam and that the truth the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- established is what they believe in and profess. However, Allah has denied them that as the truth and correct ‘Aqeedah will only be with the People of Hadeeth and Athaar because they successively took their Deen and beliefs with from those who preceded them, generation by generation, until they reached the Tabi’een.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Tabi’een took it from the Companions of the Prophet -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam and the Companions took it from the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no way of knowing what the Messenger of Allaah -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- called the people to, of the straight path, except by way of what the People of Hadeeth followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What shows that the People of Hadeeth are upon the truth is that if you were to research all the books authored by them, from the first to the last, the oldest to the newest, you would find &#8211; despite the fact that they are from different countries and time periods with vast distances between their lands, each of them living in their own regions- that in the matter of belief they are on one path, they flow in one direction following that path and they do not diverge from it, nor do they deviate from it. Their hearts are one heart; you do not see any differing in what they narrated nor any divisions or differing in any issue, no matter how small it may be.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, if everything they uttered with their tongues and what they narrated from the Salaf were gathered you would find it as though it had come from one heart and spoken by one tongue. So is there any evidence clearer than this to show the truth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Do they not then consider the Qur’aan carefully? Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction. &gt;&gt; [Nisa:82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allaah (i.e. this Qur’aan), and be not divided among yourselves, and remember Allaah’s Favour on you, for you were enemies one to another but He joined your hearts together, so that, by His Grace, you became brethren (in Islaamic Faith)&gt;&gt; [Aali-Imraan: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason that the people of Hadeeth are united is because they take their Deen and method of narration from the Book and the Sunnah and so, they inherit unity and harmony.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Bida’ took the Deen from their intellects so they inherited separation and differences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed conveying and narrating from trustworthy, precise narrators ensures that differences are rare and if there were a difference it would be in a single word or the wording of a narration. This differing does not harm the Deen, not does it belittle it. As for following intellects and desires, ideas and opinions, they rarely bring unity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have seen that the Companions of Hadeeth, past and present, are those who travelled for these Aathaar. They sought them and took from their sources, they memorized them and became delighted by them, they called to following these narrations and they rebuked those who opposed them. They had numerous narrations between them such that they became famous due to them, just as a craftsman becomes famous because of his skill and what he produces.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we saw a people who became disconnected from their memorization and knowledge and deviated from following the well-known, authentic narrations. They absolved themselves from the companionship of its people and attacked the narrations and their people. These people abandoned the rights due to this knowledge, they ascribed evil examples to it and to the people of hadeeth, giving them the vilest of descriptions. So, they called them Nawasib (haters of the family of the Prophet), Mushabiha (those who compare Allaah to the creation), Hashaweeyah (those who busy themselves with things of no benefit) or Mujjassama (those who ascribe a physical body to Allaah). So we came to know, from the correct proofs and supporting evidences, that the people of hadeeth have more right to it (i.e. the knowledge of hadeeth/narrations) than the rest of the sects.’ [Mukhtasir as-Sawaaiq pg 423-429]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The new opponents of the People of Hadeeth continually repeat the attacks that the communist, laymen and Baaith party (a political party with strong socialist tendencies) use against their opponents from amongst the Muslims and other than them, attacking with such statements as, ‘they are spies,’ ‘working for America,’ ‘ scholars of the royal courts’ or ‘scholars who want meals.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah for guidance that everyone returns to the truth, turning away from falsehood and departing from the darkness of Bida’.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1 – Shaykh Rabia’ said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Learning knowledge should be <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>for the sake of Allaah’s Face, and also for acting upon that knowledge</strong></span>, otherwise knowledge will have an evil consequence, so the person remains between two illnesses, either the illness of ignorance or the illness of knowledge which is not beneficial, but rather harmful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The knowledge which Muhammad -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- came with is in itself beneficial. However, if a person does not act upon it then it becomes an evil consequence for him, and harmful for him, and perhaps it could harm others.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2 – Shaykh Rabia’ said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What is required from learning knowledge, is acting upon it, and action cannot come except after knowledge. As Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا اللَّهُ وَاسْتَغْفِرْ لِذَنْبِكَ وَلِلْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">-So know that Lâ ilâha ill-Allaah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allaah), and ask forgiveness for your sin, and also for (the sin of) believing men and believing women.-  [Muhammad: 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari wrote a chapter heading <span style="color:#008000;">‘Chapter: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Knowledge comes before Statements and Actions</strong></span>’</span> because it is obligatory upon us not to act except with knowledge, and not worship Allaah except with knowledge, so we do not worship Allaah Subhanahu – with ignorance or following desires.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3 – Shaykh Rabia’ said:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The way of those misguided from the people of the Book who learnt knowledge but did not act upon it, is that their <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>hearts became hard</strong></span>, and most of them became evil…. . .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this hardness afflicts the heart then it destroys it. . . . .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it does not accept the truth, and does not act with knowledge and refuge is sought with Allaah, and it leads to hiding knowledge and acting in opposition to knowledge. . .. .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It leads to following whims and rejection of the truth, which is clear like the sun. . . . . ’</p>

<p align="center"><strong>The State of the Salaf in Ramadan</strong><br />
by Shaykh Rabia’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee (hafidhahullaah)<br />
Translated by Umm Yahya<b> </b></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#808000;">A questioner is asking about the state of the Salaf in Ramadan.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Answer</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In answering this question I say, that the state of the noble Messenger <i>–alayhi as-Salat wa Salam-</i> in Ramadan is well known and he <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>used to prepare for this month by fasting more in Shabaan</strong></span>. As is narrated in the Hadeeth of Aeysha <i>&#8211;</i><i>Radhi Allaahu anha</i><i>-: </i><span style="color:#008000;">‘He <i>–Alayhi as-Salat wa Salam-</i><i> </i>used to fast all of, or most of Shabaan.’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he <i>–Alayhi as-Salat wa Salam-</i> would fast in this noble month of Ramadan and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>exert himself even more so in the last ten nights of Ramadan</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the last ten nights entered he would exert himself in worship and tighten his waist wrapper (meaning to exert him self in worship), he would perform <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Itikaaf</span> </strong>and his wives would too and many of his <i>–Alayhi as-Salat wa Salam-</i> Companions would also make Itikaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <i>–Alayhi as-Salat wa Salam-</i> would establish these great actions of fasting perfectly, performing good deeds and showing goodness and sacrifice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <i>–Alayhi as-Salat wa Salam- </i><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>was extremely generous</strong></span>, he was the most generous of people and when Ramadan came, he <i>–Alayhi as-Salat wa Salam-</i> was more generous than a wind that had been sent and more so if Jibraeel was sent as is narrated in the Hadeeth of Ibn Abbas <i>Radhi Allaahu anhumaa</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah would recite, or present the Qur’aan to Jibraeel once every Ramadan, and in the last year of his noble life he recited the Qur’aan to Jibraeel twice, as is narrated in the Hadeeth of Ayesha and Abu Hurairah <i>Radhi Allaahu anhumaa</i>. This was a sign of his <i>–Alayhi as-Salat wa Salam- </i>eminent passing away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Salaf held a special concern for this great month of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>paying attention to reciting the Qur’aan</strong></span>,<strong><span style="color:#000000;"> increasing in the remembrance of Allaah</span></strong>, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>abstaining from sins</strong></span>, as fasting necessitates all these things. Fasting is not merely abstaining from food and drink indeed it is a way of refraining from all that Allaah The Most High The Most Blessed hates in terms of sins etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fasting is also turning in obedience to Allaah –Azza wa Jal- and to have Ikhlaas (sincerity) for Allaah in this action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah be pleased with the Salaf. It is said of Malik that he would teach the people and when Ramadan approached he would free up his time for fasting and reciting Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Thus you should give importance to reciting the Qur’aan in this noble month, along with reflecting upon it and pondering about it, and to take heed of the admonition and take heed of that which is rebuked, and comprehend the <em>Halal</em> and <em>Haram</em> and the clear understanding of Allaah’s threats and promises and things of this nature from the noble Qur’aan, with this the soul is purified and hearts are illuminated.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This illustrates to us that the Qur’aan is life, light and a guidance for us as Allaah <i>-Tabaraka wa Ta’ala- </i>has described it as such.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;" align="center"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَوۡحَيۡنَآ إِلَيۡكَ رُوحٗا مِّنۡ أَمۡرِنَاۚ مَا كُنتَ تَدۡرِي مَا ٱلۡكِتَٰبُ</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَا ٱلۡإِيمَٰنُ وَلَٰكِن جَعَلۡنَٰهُ نُورٗا نَّهۡدِي بِهِۦ مَن نَّشَآءُ مِنۡ عِبَادِنَاۚ</span></strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنَّكَ لَتَهۡدِيٓ إِلَىٰ صِرَٰطٖ مُّسۡتَقِيمٖ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">And thus We have sent to you <i>Ruhan</i> (an Inspiration, and a Mercy) of Our Command. You knew not what is the Book, nor what is Faith? But We have made it (this Qur’aan) a light wherewith We guide whosoever of Our slaves We will. And verily, you are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path</span>.&gt;&gt; [ash-Shura: 52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the way of the Righteous Salaf, you should read about their striving, their patience and their sincerity for Allaah, how they exceeded in their efforts in this noble month and other months. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">That is to say that we do not only remind ourselves of performing these actions only in the month of Ramadan and then become heedless and forsake our obedience to Allaah in the remaining months, on the contrary we continue to stand in the night with prayer and continue to worship Allaah and turn to Allaah in addition to all the other acts of worship in order to gain closeness to Allaah in Ramadan, we should not be heedless.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people turn in obedience to Allaah in this month and once it has passed they fall short, become lazy and forget many acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No, there is no doubt that we should have more concern in this month than in the other months, however, we must remember Allaah continuously throughout the year and throughout our lives.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُواْ ٱذۡكُرُواْ ٱللَّهَ ذِكۡرٗا كَثِيرٗا </strong></span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> وَسَبِّحُوهُ بُكۡرَةٗ وَأَصِيلًا </strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center">&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Remember Allaah with much remembrance.<a name="13fce12c4b760c91_42"></a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">And glorify His Praises morning and afternoon [the early morning (<i>Fajr</i>) and <i>&#8216;Asr </i>prayers]</span>. &gt;&gt; [Ahzab: 41-42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the believer remembers Allaah <i>-Tabaraka wa Ta’ala-</i> continuously, obeys Him, has Taqwa of Him, has Khushoo (humility) of Him and awareness of Him in every hour of his life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I beseech Allaah to grant us and you the ability to perform the night prayer, fast and all that which is obligatory upon us in this noble month and grant us eagerness and zest regarding its virtues</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also beseech Allaah to grant us the ability to continuously uphold His obedience and turn to Him upon that which pleases Him. Verily our Lord hears the supplication.’</p>

<p>This is a very important Q&amp;A concerning Hijrah to the west due to some kind of persecution.</p>
<p>Answered by Shaykh Rabee&#8217; Al-Madkhalee (hafithahuAllah)</p>
<p>We can see from his answer to the questioned put to our Shaykh Rabee (hafithahuAllah), that the Ulamaa have serious insight of what the west are up to regarding us.</p>
<p>Many Muslims make excuses for there brothers and sisters for being here in the west, Insha&#8217;allaah it&#8217;s time for us to advised our friends and families and our self&#8217;s to leave this place.</p>
<p>May Allaah give us the strength and the ability to leave the west, from all it&#8217;s dangers.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Transcription of the above Audio</strong> :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we travelled to &#8216;Kassala&#8217; in Sudan.<br />
It was Maasha Allaah.<br />
We did Da&#8217;wah there.<br />
Alhamdolilah.<br />
We talked and Allaah benefited the people there.<br />
It is a small town, so we visited all of the Masaajid there.<br />
They said :<br />
&#8220;There is only one masjid that we have not visited yet.<br />
And it is upon the Tijaanee methodology.<br />
And it is a Masjid that we have never been able to enter.&#8221;<br />
Because they are very stubborn.<br />
I said :<br />
&#8220;We will go there and ask permission.<br />
If they permit us to speak, we will speak.<br />
If they do not permit us to speak, we will leave.<br />
And that is up to Allaah.<br />
We did not come here with force.&#8221;<br />
So we went there and the Imaam led the prayer.<br />
After the prayer, I gave him salaam.<br />
[And said to him] :<br />
&#8220;Do you mind if I give a small talk to these brothers?&#8221;<br />
So he said : &#8220;Go ahead.&#8221;<br />
So I spoke, may Allaah bless you, and I called to Allaah.<br />
And I called to Tawheed and I called to the Sunnah and so on.<br />
And at the same time I refuted the mistakes.<br />
And the misguided beliefs that were present.</p>
<p>Until I reached the hadeeth of A&#8217;isha where she said:<br />
&#8220;3 things, if anyone were to tell them to you, Tthen he has lied upon Allaah a great lie.<br />
Whoever tells you that Muhammad has seen his Lord has lied a great lie upon Allaah.<br />
And whoever says that Muhammad, knows the future, has lied a great lie against Allaah.<br />
And whoever claims that Muhammad did not relate the whole religion to the people has lied against Allaah a great lie.<br />
[Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p>So he got up and said :<br />
&#8220;By Allaah, Muhammad saw his Lord with his own two eyes that are on his head.&#8221;<br />
So I said to him :<br />
&#8220;May Allaah reward you with good.<br />
As for A&#8217;isha, [radiAllaahu anhaa], she is the most knowledgeable of his affairs.<br />
And she said that he did not see his Lord.<br />
And By Allaah, if he had seen his Lord he would have told her.&#8221;<br />
He kept on talking, so I said to him :<br />
&#8220;Wait until I have finished what I have to say.<br />
And then you can ask whatever you like.<br />
That which I know, I will answer.<br />
That which I do not know, I will tell you : Allah knows best.&#8221;<br />
I left him and I continued speaking.<br />
And I was not really sure if he stayed or if he left.<br />
Slowly I heard one of the men in the crowd saying :<br />
&#8220;By Allaah, what this &#8216;Zuul&#8217; is saying is the truth&#8221;<br />
Zuul means man, in Sudan.<br />
Slowly he said :<br />
&#8220;By Allaah, what this man is saying is the Truth&#8221;<br />
I used : &#8220;Allaah said&#8230;.&#8221; and &#8220;The Messenger of Allaah said&#8230;.&#8221;<br />
May Allaah bless you.<br />
Then the athaan of Isha was called and I finished my speech.<br />
Then the Iqaamah was called.<br />
And the people started pushing me to lead the prayer.<br />
So I said :<br />
&#8220;Never, never. The Imaam should lead the prayer.&#8221;<br />
They said :<br />
&#8220;By Allaah, you lead the prayer!&#8221;<br />
So I said &#8220;OK&#8221; and I led the prayer.<br />
After the prayer, the youth from Ansar us-Sunnah and myself left the masjid.<br />
And I asked :<br />
&#8220;Where is the Imaam?&#8221;<br />
They said &#8220;They kicked him out!&#8221;<br />
&#8220;Who kicked him out!?&#8221;<br />
&#8220;His own Jamaa&#8217;ah kicked him out!&#8221;<br />
By Allaah, this is what happened!<br />
But if one was to come to them with this foolishness and insult them, meaning the Tijaaniyyah, the Burhaaniyyah and so forth, If one was to say this, who would accept it!?<br />
But if you came to them with wisdom and kindness.<br />
May Allaah bless you.<br />
Allaah benefited them!<br />
Allaah benefited them with this!<br />
So O brothers, use beneficial knowledge.<br />
And strong irrefutable evidences.<br />
And beneficial wisdom in your Da&#8217;wah.<br />
And it is upon you to have all of the beautiful manners that the Book Of Allaah and the Prophet of Guidance encouraged[Sallallaahu Alaihi Wa sallam]<br />
Because they are the tools of Victory.<br />
And they are the tools of Success.<br />
And believe me when I say that the Sahaabah did not spread Islaam and have it enter into the hearts of the people, except with Wisdom and their character, more then with the sword.<br />
Because the one enters Islam by sword will probably not remain steadfast.<br />
The one who entered Islaam by way of knowledge and evidence&#8230;.He is the one who will have strong faith.<br />
So it is upon you to follow these good ways.<br />
And it is upon you to be serious about knowledge.<br />
As it is upon you to be serious about giving Da&#8217;wah to Allaah.<span style="color:#000099;"><span style="font-size:large;"><span style="font-family:trebuchet ms, sans-serif;"><span style="color:#888888;"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Bismillaah Al-Hamdulillaah wa salatu wa salaamu &#8216;ala rasulullaah<br />
Amma-ba&#8217;d</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Tremendous Advice from Shaikh Rabee&#8217; On The Importance of Reviewing Correct &#8216;Aqeedah &amp; Tawheed, Renewing one&#8217;s Eeman, and fearing Shirk and Hypocrisy! </strong></p>
<p>Shaikh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee al-Madkhalee (hafidhahullaah Ta&#8217;aala) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Look at the Muslim world today; go to Egypt, or go to Sudan, or go to Pakistan, and you will see incredibly dangerous false practices. In this land of Sa&#8217;udia Arabia, we have eradicated these elevated and venerated graves connected with false worship &#8211; all praise is due to Allaah. However, today many callers make it easy for the people to go to these locations or places of disobedience of Allaah in other countries, while at the same time it is likely that they denounce the emphasis given by others to calling to the worship of Allaah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh brother, the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) would from time to time repeatedly call his companions to reaffirm their oath of allegiance to him that they would not associate anything with Allaah in their worship. He had Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, &#8216;Ubaidah Ibn as-Saamit (radiallaahu &#8216;anhum) and others again make the oath of allegiance to him that they would not associate or join anything else along with the worship of Allaah, as well as that they would establish the prayer, and so forth<span style="color:#888888;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1yO" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">.</span></a></span></p>
<p>Why would he reaffirm this oath of allegiance with the likes of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Because our correct belief always requires being refreshed, rekindled, and renewed. As this correct belief, it is necessary that we plant it firmly within us as individuals, and among us collectively, and that we be reminded of its place and importance.&#8221; &#8230; </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Rabee&#8217; also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And if there is a caller today who correctly warns the people from this false practice of associating others with Allaah (in worship), the people will say, &#8216;Do you think we are idol worshippers?&#8217; But <span style="color:#993300;">why would the Prophet (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) himself reaffirm this oath of allegiance with the likes of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, that they not associate anything with Allaah in their worship, yet you &#8216;callers&#8217; do not warn from this practice of joining others with Allaah in worship?!</span></p>
<p>Ibraheem (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) said [in his du&#8217;aa to Allaah]:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَنْ نَعْبُدَ الأَصْنَامَ<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;&#8230;and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols.&#8221;</span></em> (Ibraaheem, ayah 35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, Ibraaheem &#8211; the father of the Prophets &#8211; and Khaleel-ur-Rahmaan said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَاجْنُبْنِي وَبَنِيَّ أَنْ نَعْبُدَ الأَصْنَامَ رَبِّ إِنَّهُنَّ أَضْلَلْنَ كَثِيرا ً مِنَ النَّاسِ فَمَنْ تَبِعَنِي فَإِنَّه ُُ مِنِّي وَمَنْ عَصَانِي فَإِنَّكَ غَفُور ٌ رَحِيم</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;&#8230;and keep me and my sons away from worshipping idols. Oh my Lord! They have indeed led astray many among mankind. But whoso follows me, he verily is of me. And whoso disobeys me &#8211; still You are indeed Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</span></em> (Ibraaheem, ayat 35-36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was aware that from among his descendants there would be many Prophets, yet despite this he still feared for them. So how can we consider ourselves safe and secure from this danger?!</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><em><strong>Ya Muqqallib al-Qulloob Thabit Qulubuna &#8216;ala Deenik</strong><br />
</em>(Oh Turner of the hearts, make our hearts steadfast upon Your Religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) often made this supplication and taught his companions to say this supplication. Yet many of us today, we possess undeserved confidence that we will not fall into associating others with Allaah, nor fall into hypocrisy.</p>
<p>But the companions feared for themselves hypocrisy. Ibn Abee Malaikah (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I encountered 30 of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad (salallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam), and all of them feared for themselves being hypocrites.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Rabee&#8217; also said:</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;As such, it is necessary that each of us fears falling into hypocrisy, and fears falling into matters of associating others with Allaah in worship, and fears for our hearts swerving away from the truth. </strong></div>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">رَبَّنَا لاَ تُزِغْ قُلُوبَنَا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَيْتَنَا وَهَبْ لَنَا مِنْ لَدُنْكَ رَحْمَة ً إِنَّكَ أَنْتَ الْوَهَّابُ<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">(They say): &#8220;Our Lord! Let not our hearts deviate (from the truth) after You have guided us, and grant us mercy from You. Truly, You are the Bestower.&#8221;</span></em> (Aali Imran, ayah 8) and the verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">فَلاَ يَأْمَنُ مَكْرَ اللَّهِ إِلاَّ الْقَوْمُ الْخَاسِرُونَ<br />
<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;None feels secure from the Plan of Allaah except the people who are the losers.</span></em> (Al-A&#8217;raf, ayah 99)</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>So we have fear for that which might affect the steadfastness and the strength of our Eeman within ourselves.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must make every effort in bringing about the causes for steadfastness, from actions which are obedience to Allaah, from submission and compliance to Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, from seeking forgiveness of Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala, during the day and night by always humbly seeking from Him and beseeching Him to make us firm upon Islaam, and that Allaah guide at our hands those who want the guidance of Allaah, Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;aala.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Rabee&#8217; also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for the danger of lying and hypocrisy, we will offer you some thoughts regarding that. Indeed many of the leading personalities of falsehood and misguidance wore the &#8216;garments&#8217; of Islaam, and made an outward show of worship and of striving to rectify affairs, as it is not possible for them to attempt to deceive the people except through adorning themselves in these &#8216;garments&#8217; of Islaam in which they present themselves giving the appearance of righteous Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in any case, if he reveals the characteristic of lying &#8211; even if he stands the night in prayer and fasts during the day &#8211; then that lying is a sign from the signs of hypocrisy. Moreover if he possesses &#8211; in addition to this &#8211; the characteristics of going against his word and excessiveness in his disputes, then clearly he stands as a pure hypocrite, and from this we seek refuge in Allaah.</p>
<p>Just as the Messenger of Allaah (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Signs of the hypocrites are three, when he speaks, he lies, when he promises, he breaks his word &#8211; or it is said when he gives a trust he is disloyal to it &#8211; and when he disputes, he goes to extremes.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these four characteristics, if he possesses these four, then he is a pure hypocrite. And I say that the first three characteristics are those which are mentioned in the narration of Abu Hurrairah. However, the narration of &#8216;Abdullaah ibn &#8216;Umar mentions four characteristics. In any case, if he possesses all of these mentioned characteristics, then he is a pure hypocrite upon pure hypocrisy. And it may be that in regard to specific individuals, it would be restricted to the hypocrisy of deeds or actions, or it may be the full reality of hypocrisy in one&#8217;s inward belief which then takes him outside of the boundaries of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Previously it has been explained to you that some of the people today consider that the matter of hypocrisy as a reality has &#8216;ended.&#8217; They suppose that hypocrisy was &#8216;only&#8217; in the time of the Messenger (salallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), but as for the latter ages, then they are &#8216;free&#8217; from hypocrisy occurring within them. This is clearly from their obvious ignorance and foolishness, and we seek refuge in Allaah from that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As indeed, the most knowledgeable of people regarding the hypocrites was the companion Hudhaifa ibn al-Yamaan (radiallaahu &#8216;anhu), and this companion who was the most knowledgeable of the hypocrites said: The hypocrisy today is worse and more evil than the hypocrisy in the time of the Messenger. They said, &#8216;Why is that?&#8217; He said: Because at that time, the hypocrites strove to conceal their hypocrisy, but as for the people today, they manifest it openly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these individuals openly showed their hypocrisy, and spoke about their shameful affair, in their opposition to the Muslims. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Specifically in the matter of calling to Allaah, the Blessed and the Most High, the one who fights against the call to the truth, engages in deceptions and fabricates things, then it is not something to be considered unlikely that many from among them are true complete hypocrites. And we ask Allaah for health and well being.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">by Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p><strong>The Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A lot of what we see in certain Masajid is ‘Ya Allaah &amp; Ya Muhammad’ (O Allaah &amp; O Muhammad) written on the Mihrab, is it permissible to pray in the likes of these Masajid?</span></p>
<p><strong>The answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is clear from what we have seen in Pakistan and Afghanistan – with great regret – I swear by Allaah we saw this written in the cars of the Mujahideen; actually those who claim to be Mujahideen! And they would not accept any advice, they would continue upon these aspects of <span style="color:#ff0000;">Shirk</span>! You would see it written in their shops and their Masajid: ‘<span style="color:#ff0000;">Ya Allaah, Ya Ali, Ya Ghawth, Ya Hussain, Ya AbdulQadir, Ya such and such!!</span>’ as well as other aspects of Shirk!</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seeking aid from other than Allaah is Shirk; by saying ‘Ya Muhammad’, then this is committing Shirk with Allaah (associating partners to Allaah). Muhammad was the Messenger of Allaah, the slave of Allaah and His Messenger –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam. Therefore, if one says ‘Ya Allaah and Ya Muhammad’, then that person has made Muhammad as an equal to Allaah Tabaraka wa Ta’ala.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam- did not come except to destroy this polytheism, and to rectify the deviated nation and at the head of what they had was committing Shirk (associating) with Allaah -Azza wa Jal. The Messenger came to purify the Dunyaa, the hearts, the minds and intellects from Shirk with Allaah –Azza wa Jal- and the filth connected with Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam- taught us pure Tawheed with the texts of the Qur’aan, the texts of the Sunnah and practically implementing them. He –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam- ordered us to level the graves, and to destroy idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not undertake journeys except to three Masajid – only these, not to graves, nor any place [for worship] – the Masjid al-Haraam, and this masjid of mine, and Masjid al-Aqsa.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because these Masajid were built by the Prophets for the Tawheed of Allaah having Ikhlaas (Sincerity) of the Deen for Allaah – Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This action of writing ‘Allaah &amp; Muhammad’ began in al-Madinah – since we know these things we can evaluate it – we knew the plots of the Ahl-ul-Bida’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a man named Siraaj Rahman a colleague of mine in the University and he was from the students of <strong>Abul-Hasan an-Nadawi</strong> – I don’t know whether – I saw this in Kenya or a story had been narrated to him that this had begun to spread in al-Madinah. Anyway, he mentioned that Abul-Hasan an-Nadawi said the statement: ‘Allaah &amp; Muhammad’ and this is disbelief, what they mean by this is that Muhammad is a partner to Allaah –Azza wa Jal; Allaah &amp; Muhammad are equal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah, Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah; I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah, I testify that there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allaah and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger; this is the highest status for this Noble Prophet –alayhi as-Sallat wa Sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger -sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Do not over praise me, like the Christians over praised the son of Maryam. Indeed I am a slave of Allaah and His Messenger.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have seen this clearly and I would have waged war against it, and if I saw it in a Masjid I would advise the Imam of the Masjid. Likewise in Masjid al-Qiblatayn – Masjid al-Amoodi -, I spoke to the Imam, but he did not do anything! So I spoke to al-Amoodi who was responsible for the Masjid, and he hastened – may Allaah reward him with goodness- and effaced these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the Masjid near my home in al-Madina they had written ‘Allaah &amp; Muhammad’ so I advised the Imam and he said: ‘we will change it, we will change it.’ But he kept postponing it and did not change it! There was a good young man present who said: ‘I’ll sort it out.’ Then he went and covered it, and that was the end of that, and all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day I was coming from Batthan and entered Madinah and there was a pickup truck in front of me and it had ‘Ya Allaah Ya Muhammad’ written on it in red. So I followed him and he began speeding up, he noticed that I was following him, so he began to speed up even more, so I gave chase and pursued him until we reached Qurban, he stopped his car and got out and said to me: ‘Shall I wipe it off?’ and I hadn’t even spoken to him yet! He knew and felt this is what I was pursuing him about, so I told him ‘Yes, wipe it off.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This confirms that there is a battle going on, the battle of these grave worshipping deviants in the land of Tawheed!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">By the Shaykh Muhaddith Allaama Rabee&#8217; bin Hadi bin Umayr al-Madkhalee<br />
Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s Introduction</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise belongs to Allaah the Lord of the Heavens and the Earth, peace and blessings be upon His Prophet, the Prophet’s family, his Companions and all those who follow his way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is a translation of a lecture which the noble <em>Shaykh</em> – may Allaah reward him with goodness &#8211; delivered in the blessed city of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.   This lecture, which is available in tape form, was transcribed and adapted into a booklet[1] and published in 1426 A.H.  Due to the immense importance of the topic and the deep wisdom of the <em>Shaykh</em> we place it forward in the hands of our brothers and sisters by Allaah’s permission to promote the correct <em>Dawa’</em> on the understanding of the <em>Manhaj as-Salafiee</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to bless and protect our noble <em>Shaykh</em> and all the noble scholars of Islaam and reward them on our behalf with a great reward amongst the righteous in His uppermost Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p>In the Name of Allaah the Most Kind the Most merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed all Praise belongs to Allaah, we praise Him, we seek His aid and we seek His forgiveness.  We seek refuge in Him from the evil of ourselves and the evil of our actions. Whomsoever Allaah guides, there is none to misguide him, and whomsoever Allaah leaves astray then there is none that can guide him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, Alone without any partner, and I testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Fear Allaah as He should be feared and dare not die except in a state of Islaam with complete submission to Allaah.</span></strong> &gt;&gt; [al-Imraan: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam) and from him He created his wife and from them both He created many men and women.  And fear Allaah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and do not cut the relations of the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allaah is Ever an All­-Watcher over you.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [an-Nisaa: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him and always speak the truth.  He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins.  And whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger he has indeed achieved a great achievement.</strong></span> &gt;&gt; [Ahzab: 70-71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Amma ba’d:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the best speech is the Speech of Allaah, the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; and the worst of the affairs are the innovated ones, every innovation is a <em>Bida’</em> and every <em>Bida’</em> is misguidance and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Welcome &#8211; O my brothers for the sake of Allaah and O you noble students &#8211; those students of this distinguished knowledge who have made the journey from far distant places, to drink from the knowledge of the <em>Sharia&#8217;</em> which gushes forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> at the place of descent of the revelation in the city of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.   Which is the second place of descent of the revelation after Makkah al-Mukkaramah the place from where the banners for the struggles and conquests were sent out to make the word of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala –</em> uppermost, to spread this true religion and to make this <em>Deen</em> apparent over all the religions.  As Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala –</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is He Who has sent His Messenger with guidance and the religion of truth to make it victorious over all other religions even though the <em>Mushrikoon</em>(polytheists) hate it.</span></strong>&gt;&gt;[as-Saff:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah made this religion manifest at the hands of the noble, sincere Companions; the Companions of Muhammad   <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> &#8211; who conquered hearts with knowledge, guidance and Eemaan.  They conquered fortresses and lands with the swords of truth.  So they assisted the religion of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> with everything they had of strength, with everything that they were capable of sacrificing of wealth and souls.  They put into effect the objective which Allaah had intended for this <em>Deen</em>, that it prevail and that it be manifest above all religions.  This is because this religion stands upon guidance and upon knowledge not upon desires, ignorance, foolishness and chaos &#8211; which has now become predominant in many countries!  &#8211; There are those people whose <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> is not built upon the Book of Allaah nor upon the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah, rather their <em>Dawa’</em> stands upon the following desires, except those whom Allaah  <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> has protected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Islaamic University &#8211; along with those who are responsible for it and those who founded it &#8211; came to realize the reality of the Muslims and what they live in of ignorance and their being far from the true <em>Manhaj</em> of Allaah &#8211; except for a few &#8211; in the Muslim world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed this University was founded upon correct Islaamic methodologies, which spring forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of theMessenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>.  There were about four fifths of those accepted to the University from the sons of the rest of the Islaamic world and 20 in every 100 from the sons of the country of the two holy Islaamic sites so that those who come to the place of the descent of the revelation to receive pure knowledge could return to their countries to disseminate this knowledge, this goodness and this guidance which they had learnt:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#008000;">Of every group of them, a party only should go forth, that they (who are left behind) may get instructions in (Islaamic) religion, and that they may warn their people when they return to them, so that they may beware (of evil).</span></strong> &gt;&gt; [at-Taubah: 122]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a great opportunity for you, so take advantage of it and come closer to the pure and clear beneficial knowledge which is derived from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, since its sources are abundant and all praise belongs to Allaah &#8211; in this city and in this university.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever wishes truth and goodness  &#8211; for himself, his family, his people and country &#8211; then it is upon him to become serious and acquire knowledge from those of the scholars who are present; those who have given their own selves to learning this truth and disseminating it, <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Correct Sources of Knowledge</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon him to learn from the sources which contain the correct beliefs and correct methodologies, to read the <em>Salafi Tafseer</em> books, which are based upon the <em>Tafseer</em> of the Book of Allaah by the Book of Allaah, by the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and by the <em>Fiqh</em> of the noble Companions those who lived through the descent of the revelation and were present at the time of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> and lived with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew the aim of the Book and the Sunnah. They are the ones whose <em>Fiqh</em> should be held on to as they preserved the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><em>.  </em>This is why the noble Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> when he spoke about splitting up into sects and spoke about the <em>Firqaat-Un Najeeyah</em> said: &#8216;Those who are upon what I am upon and my Companions.'[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this <em>Fiqh</em> of the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah which the noble Companions had &#8211; which they acquired from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of theMessenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, from his sayings, actions, his teachings and his directives – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam –</em> it is obligatory upon us to take it as our reference.  The Companions are the intended believers in the saying of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala -:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger after the right path has been shown clearly to him and follows other than the believers&#8217; way. We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell &#8211; what an evil destination. &gt;&gt; [an-Nisaa: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a severe threat to the one who contends with Allaah and His Messenger and follows a path other than that of the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So pay attention to this matter and strive to understand the way of the believers which they derived from the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of theMessenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam </em>&#8211; and from his purifying and educating them upon the Book and the wisdom <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a great opportunity for you; understand from it the true <em>Deen</em> of Allaah and strive earnestly to make it apparent over all religions with proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon you to seek knowledge from its original watering sources; from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>Tafseer</em>, from the <em>Salafi</em> books of <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, which gush forth from the Book of Allaah and from the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah –<em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em>.  The difference between the way of the truthful believers and the way of the innovating discriminators of the true <em>Manhaj</em> of Allaah will become clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They &#8211; I swear by Allaah &#8211; are the protectors of this <em>Ummah</em> upon the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, they had the correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and <em>Manhaj</em> and they were firmly upon what Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what is understood principally, is that it is obligatory upon us to follow the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> to hold on firmly to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> and to bite onto that with our molar teeth, just as the Messenger of Allaah mentioned &#8211; when he gave an eloquent sermon whereby tears fell and the hearts trembled  &#8211; the Companions requested him to give them some advice they said ; O Messenger of Allaah it is as if this is a farewell sermon, so advise us, he said: ‘I advise you to fear Allaah&#8230;&#8230;.’  pay attention to this advice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘….to hear and obey, whoever lives from amongst you will see many differences so it is upon you to hold on to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly guided <em>Khulafah</em>, bite on to it with your molar teeth, beware of newly invented matters, for every newly invented matter is a <em>Bida</em>’ and every <em>Bida’</em> is misguidance.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s note: Due to the saying of the noble Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> ‘Whoever does not thank the people does not thank Allaah.’ As narrated by Abee Sa’eed, &amp; authenticated by al-Albaani in as-Saheehah, I say that may Allaah reward with all goodness in this life and in the Hereafter the brother who facilitated us with the booklet and aided us in its translation.  And to our editor, may Allaah enter her into the highest grades of His Paradise among the Prophets, the Companions and the righteous for all her efforts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The headings were added for further clarity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Narrated by Tirmidhi (2641) from the hadeeth of Abdullaah bin ‘Amr –radhiAllaahu anhu- &amp; regarded as Hasan by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (5343).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Narrated by Abu Daawood (4607), Tirmidhi (2676) &amp; Ibn Majah (42) from the hadeeth of al-Irbaad bin Saariyah –radhiAllaahu anhu &#8211; &amp; it was authenticated by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (2549).</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 2</strong></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Station of <em>Taqwa</em> and <em>Ihsaan</em></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sermon consists of the advice to fear Allaah, which is necessary and it is not exemplified except in the lives of the righteous, truthful scholars as in the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah. &gt;&gt;[Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fear Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> so you can reach this level and learn so that you can reach that status; because the one who knows the correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and rulings, manners and behaviour springing from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> then he is the one who fears Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> and <em>Taqwa</em> is attained with all of these matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when these matters &#8211; which we have mentioned – are acknowledged then the slave is driven to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>, to having fear of Him and being aware of Him in every time, place and situation.  This is a great station which is the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;That you worship Allaah as if you see Him and if you cannot see Him then know that He sees you.'[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em> (perfection of worship) is that a person has certainty that Allaah sees him and that Allaah hears all he says and hears; the beating of his heart, the feelings of his heart and what he thinks to himself.   Allaah<em>Subhanahu Wa Ta’ala</em> knows it and hears it and He sees his movements and when he is still.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the true believer regards Allaah with true greatness and he acknowledges that Allaah <em>Subhanah</em> hears everything that he says and knows everything he discusses, or thinks to himself and that Allaah has:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Angels <em>Kirâman </em>(honourable)<em> Kâtibîn</em> writing down (your deeds). They know all that you do. &gt;&gt; [al-Infitar: 11-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these distinguished feelings are found in the soul of a believer then he has acquired the characteristic of <em>Taqwa</em> which causes him to keep away from sinning, <em>Shirk, Bida&#8217;</em> and superstitions and he acquires the station of <em>al-Ihsaan</em>(perfection of worship) since he is aware of Allaah and he feels that Allaah sees him and he cannot hide anything of his affairs from Allaah not a little nor a lot, not even the like of an atom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a noble awareness and distinguished feeling which pushes one <em>-InshAllaah &#8211;</em> to the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah.  This cannot be reached except for the one who knows the correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, the correct rulings of <em>Halaal</em> and <em>Haraam</em> and knows the commands and prohibitions, the promise and the warnings from the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam</em><strong><em>.  </em></strong>They are the ones who deserve the praise of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala –</em> He said; about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allaah.&gt;&gt; [Fatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Allaah will exalt in degree those of you who believe and those who have been granted knowledge. &gt;&gt; [al-Mujadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So strive to be from these types of people: i.e. that you combine knowledge and action.  That is the fruit of correct knowledge and having the <em>Taqwa</em> of Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and being aware of Him.</p>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">The Call to Allaah</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon you O brothers to acquire the pure, truthful Eemaan, beneficial knowledge and righteous actions.  Our Lord <em>–Jal Sha’anahu-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; By <em>Al-&#8216;Asr</em> (the time). Verily! Man is in loss, except those who believe and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth and recommend one another to patience&gt;&gt; [al-Asr: 1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truthful Eemaan is only built upon knowledge.  Righteous actions do not emanate except from knowledge. <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah cannot be set forth with it (i.e. knowledge) except by the people of knowledge and being patient with harm <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> &#8211; is required for the one who has learnt, teaches and calls to Allaah  <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be from those who know and believe in this knowledge, those who call to this knowledge and Eemaan and are patient with harm in the path of conveying this truth and goodness to the people.  Indeed a believing Muslim caller to Allaah will face harm the likes of which never even crossed his mind and nor had he anticipated!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A believer is not dazed by this since he is harmed in the way of Allaah and the best of Allaah’s creation were harmed in the path of <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah although they were the Prophets and the noble Messengers <em>&#8211; alayhim as-sallam &#8211;</em> and they were harmed more than us.  They were tried with severe enmity and hatred more than we are and this is the meaning of the saying of the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam </em>: &#8216;The people with the severest trials are the Prophets, then the righteous people then their likes and their likes.'[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> saying: &#8216;No one was harmed for the sake of Allaah like I was harmed.'[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever holds fast to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and calls to it, will definitely be harmed &#8211; except if Allaah wills &#8211; so accustom yourself to patience:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full, without reckoning. &gt;&gt; [az-Zumar: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ordered His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> to take the great Prophets as an example and to be patient in the field of <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and striving just as the great Prophets were patient.  Allaah said to him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Therefore be patient as did the Messengers of strong will and be in no haste about them (disbelievers). &gt;&gt; [al-Ahqaf: 35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Narrated by Bukhari (50) &amp; Muslim (9) from the hadeeth of Abu Huraira – radhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Narrated by Ahmad in his Musnad (1484) and it’s his wording. Also by Tirmidhi (2398) &amp; Ibn Majah (4023) from the hadeeth of Sa’ad bin Abee Waqqas – radhiAllaahu anhu &#8211; &amp; it was authenticated by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’ (992,994).</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 3</h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">An Excellent Example</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we have in the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> and in all the Prophets of Allaah a good example.  The Messenger was commanded to take those Prophets before him as an example and to follow their guidance and we have been commanded to follow the guidance of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and take him as an example:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow forhe who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much. &gt;&gt; [al-Ahzab: 21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This good example is complete in every matter which Muhammad <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> came with<em>;</em> so, he is an example in his <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, so we believe in that which he believed in; an example in his worship, so we worship Allaah making the religion sincerely for Him, following that which the noble Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211; </em>came with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is an example in great manners which perhaps many of the callers to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and many of the youth have lost, much of it having been forgotten and some of the youth have forgotten it too.  Indeed Allaah has praised His Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> with eloquent praise and He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And verily, you are on an exalted standard of character &gt;&gt; [Qalam: 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the caller to Allaah, the student of knowledge, the instructor and the guide all need to take the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> as an example in their <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, <em>Manhaj</em> and manners.  So if these matters are combined in the caller to Allaah or they are nearly complete then this <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> will be successful <em>&#8211; InshAllaah &#8211;</em> and the caller to Allaah will have presented it in the most beautiful and best form <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the caller to Allaah is deficient in the matters of his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, being deficient in having noble manners-from which is having patience, wisdom, gentleness, softness and other things which are important, which the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> of the Messengers <em>–alayhim Sallat wa Sallam-</em> requires.  Then this is an apparent deficiency in his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.  So it is upon him to ensure he manifests those matters completely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps many of the people are negligent of this! And this harms the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> of Salafiyyah and harms its people.  Since if these manners are neglected and the<em>Dawa&#8217;</em> is presented to the people in a way that they dislike and is made unpleasant and detestable by having harshness, severity and recklessness &#8211; and the likes of these things &#8211; then this is an obstacle to the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and to it being accepted.  Since these matters are even disliked in the affairs of the <em>Duniya</em> let alone in the matters of the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is necessary for the student of knowledge to follow a path of righteous good manners in giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Manner of The Call</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is necessary for you &#8211; O brother &#8211; to take as an example the<em>Aathar</em> which are mentioned about the way of calling to Allaah; and that is done by studying the biography of the Messenger, studying his manners, studying his <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and studying his <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people do not care about the <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> of the Messenger nor about his<em>Manhaj</em> and they follow other methodologies and beliefs, which Shaytaan fabricates for the people of <em>Bida&#8217; </em>and misguidance whom Allaah forsakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are a few people who have been blessed enough to acquire the <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, but they are deprived of the <em>Manhaj</em>!  There are people who are blessed with the <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and the <em>Manhaj</em> but in their behaviour they end up neglecting the<em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and the <em>Manhaj</em>, the truth is with them &#8211; correct <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em> and correct<em>Manhaj</em> &#8211; but their behaviour and technique of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> destroys the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>and harms it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So be careful of opposing the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> in his <em>&#8216;Aqeedah</em>, his<em>Manhaj</em> and his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.  It is upon you to learn how he – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">used to call the people and to find out about these prophetic instructions of wisdom, patience, gentleness, pardoning and forgiveness, softness, kindness and other matters alongside these.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Comprehend these O brothers and know that these are necessary in our <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>to the people; do not take one aspect of Islaam and neglect the other aspects, or take one aspect from the ways of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and neglect the other aspects.  Since that harms the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>-Azza wa Jal-</em> and it harms the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah; the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> of <em>Salafiyyah</em> in recent times &#8211; and in other times &#8211; was not spread except at the hands of people who were scholars, wise and gentle, who were the representation of the <em>Manhaj</em> of the Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> and they implemented what they were able to.  So Allaah caused them to be of benefit and the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> <em>As-Salafiyyah</em> was widespread in many lands of the <em>Duniya</em> via their manners, knowledge and wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the present time; we see that the <em>Dawa&#8217; As-Salafiyyah</em> is retreating and dwindling and that is not due to anything except the loss of their wisdom, rather the wisdom of the Messenger – <em>alayhis Sallat wa Sallam &#8211;</em> foremost, and the loss of the likes of his gentleness, mercy, manners, kindness and softness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Aeysha cursed a Jew, so the Messenger of Allaah said to her: &#8216; O &#8216;Aeysha indeed Allaah loves kindness in all matters.'[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a scholar nowadays mentions this hadeeth to the youth, directing them to the correct <em>Manhaj</em> of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah, then they say: this is watering things down (<em>Tameea’</em>)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these noble manners are mentioned and cited as a reminder the likes of wisdom, kindness, softness, gentleness and pardoning -which are the necessary requirements for giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> and they are attributes which attract the people to the correct <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>&#8211; then the result of this would be that the people would enter into the religion of Allaah in droves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people, who try to change things, push the people away &#8211; in spite of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah: ‘Indeed there are those amongst you who repel.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> ‘Make things easy, and do not make things difficult, give good news and do not drive people away.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers: these people do not comprehend! Otherwise &#8211; I swear by Allaah &#8211; it obligates them to then brand the Messenger as one who waters things down<em>(Mumaya’)</em>! And that the Companions and the scholars of the <em>Ummah</em> watered things down <em>(Mumaya’een)</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their claim of watering down necessitates that they – those who are upon this severity and destructive harshness &#8211; which has destroyed the <em>Dawatul Salafiyyah</em>&#8211; it necessitates, that they claim that the Messenger himself who calls to kindness, wisdom and softness is also watering things down <em>(Mumaya’)</em>, and we seek forgiveness from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I swear by Allaah; they do not want this nor do they intend the Messenger of Allaah in what they say!  But they lack understanding.  So it is upon them &#8211; from now on &#8211; to comprehend what results from these rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We, indeed &#8211; by Allaah, strive, debate, write, advise and call to Allaah <em>&#8211; Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em>with kindness and they regard us from those who water things down<em>(Mumaya’een)</em>, they do not want us to say: wisdom, softness and kindness!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed we have seen that harshness has destroyed the <em>Dawa’ As-Salafiyyah</em>, and torn its people apart, so what should we do?? I say: O brothers, when we see fires burning, do we leave them to burn more?? Or do we bring that which will extinguish these fires???</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was forced to &#8211; and this is my obligation &#8211; and I used to say this before today, but I concentrated upon this when I saw this destruction, and I saw these tribulations.  I say: it is upon you to have gentleness, it is upon you to have softness, it is upon you to have brotherhood and it is upon you to be merciful to each other.  Indeed this harshness has been directed towards the <em>Ahl -ul-Sunnah</em> themselves whereas they have left the <em>Ahl- ul- Bida&#8217;</em> and aimed at the<em>Ahl-ul Sunnah</em> with this destructive harshness and mixed it with oppression and false oppressive rulings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Be aware be very aware, lest you follow this path which will destroy you and destroy <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> <em>As-Salafiyyah</em> and it destroys its people.</p>

<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 4</h2>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Said, The Messenger Said, The Scholars Said</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Call to Allaah <em>&#8211; Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> with everything you have, with proofs and evidences in every place, with the words &#8216;Allaah said&#8217;, and &#8216;the Messenger of Allaah said&#8217; and aided with &#8211; after Allaah – with the speech of the scholars of guidance whom, both the <em>Ahul -ul &#8211; Sunnah</em> and the people of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> accept in their leadership and their status in Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise those brothers who go to Africa or to Turkey or to India or any other place that they should go with the phrase: &#8216;Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said and so and so from the scholars whom they respect said.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if, for example you went to Africa and you said: ‘Ibn Abdul Barr said, Malik said, so-and-so said.’  Even though the number of people who have corrupt beliefs is not small in number!  So if you come to them with the Book of Allaah <em>&#8211; Ta&#8217;ala </em>&#8211; and with the Sunnah of the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> then you should also bring the speech of the scholars so that they will listen to your speech and obey you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is wisdom, but if you come to them with just your own speech from yourself no-one will ever accept it from you. So it is necessary for you &#8211; after the speech of Allaah and the speech of His Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> that you connect it up with the speech of the scholars who have status in the hearts of the people and have a high station, those whom the people will not criticize nor their statements. So if you say: ‘Bukhari said’, you will find that they respect him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for example: The <em>Soofeeyah</em> everywhere respect Bukhari and they respect Muslim.  They respect these two books (Saheeh al-Bukhari and Saheeh Muslim) and they respect these two Imams.  They respect Ahmad bin Hanbal, al-Awzaa’ee and Sufyaan ath-Thawree and other than them from the preceding senior people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why there are ties between us and them where we meet up in the truth, so we enter into them from these channels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is from wisdom O brothers; you should not now, due to this, begin by saying: ‘Ibn Taymeeyah said’, even though he is an Imam; because the ignorant people do not know him and even if they knew him they are made to hate him from what they hear from their senior people, so they do not want him nor do they desire him <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should say :’Ibn Taymeeyah said’  amongst the <em>Salafiyeen</em> -those who respect him- but do not say amongst other people, for example ‘Ibn Taymeeyah said, Ibn Abdul Wahhab  said,’ because the ignorant person who is cultured amidst the people of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> runs away from this, so their shaykhs push them away.  So mention to them the names of the scholars whom they respect and hold in regard, because their leaders and their shaykhs misrepresent Ibn Taymeeyah and Ibn Abdul Wahhab and they misrepresent the scholars and leaders of the Dawa&#8217; as we previously mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not approach them from this angle, since it is not from wisdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, approach them from the angle of: ‘Malik said, Sufyaan ath-Thawree</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">said, al-Awzaa’ee said, Ibn &#8216;Uyainah said, Bukhari said, Muslim said, in such-and-such volume on such-and-such page.’  So the likes of these, they will accept from you.  Then if they accept this from you, they will after that respect Ibn Taymeeyah, they will know that he is on the truth and they will respect Ibn Abdul Wahab and they will know that he is on the truth etc.<em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: this is a word of admonition, to follow the path of wisdom in calling the people to Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is from wisdom not to curse their <em>Jamaah</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allaah, lest they insult Allaah wrongfully without knowledge. &gt;&gt; [al-An’aam:108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Journey to Sudan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: when I went to Sudan, we stopped at Port Sudan.[1]  I was received by the youth of <em>Ansaar as-Sunnah</em> and they said to me: O shaykh we want to bring your attention to something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “Go ahead.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: “Say whatever you want, say: &#8216;Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said.&#8217; and attack with whatever you want of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> and misguidance; like supplicating to other than Allaah, slaughtering, vows and seeking help etc.  But do not mention: such-and-such sect, nor so-and-so shaykh.  Do not mention that the <em>Tijaaneeyah</em> are from the different sects, nor the <em>Batineeyah</em>, nor mention their leaders, but quote the <em>&#8216;Aqaaid</em> (beliefs); and you yourself will find that the truth will be accepted from you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “fine.”  And I followed that way and found a great acceptance from the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not think &#8211; O student of knowledge &#8211; that it is from the complete, truthful<em>Manhaj</em> that it is necessary to curse their shaykhs and to defame them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah <em>Subhanahu</em> says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allaah, lest they insult Allaah wrongfully without knowledge. &gt;&gt; [al-An’aam:108]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So don&#8217;t curse the shaykh or say: &#8216;deviant!&#8217; or something similar! Or such<strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong>and<strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong>such <em>Tariqaa</em> (<em>Soofee</em> path)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since, when they hear this they run away from you.  You will be sinful and will have pushed the people away then you will be those who cause the people to turn away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> sent Muadh and Abu Musa to Yemen he said: “Make things easy and do not make things difficult, give glad-tidings and do not push people away.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are from the ways in which there is ease and glad-tidings.  It does not cause the people to be driven away.  I swear by Allaah that I did not enter a masjid except that I saw joy on the faces of the people and I couldn&#8217;t exit the place due to the many people who came to me to shake my hand and invite me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the leaders of the <em>Soofeeyah &#8211; Shayaateen &#8211;</em> saw the danger of this way and this methodology in giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, so they gathered together and conspired and strung some statements together with which to refute me.  They announced a lecture for me in a big field.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we all gathered in this field and I spoke, then their leader got up and commented upon what I said, he began to allow seeking help from other than Allaah, to allow <em>Tawwassul </em>(Seeking closeness to Allaah with Haram means), to speak with the denial of <em>Sifaat</em>, talking and talking &#8230;&#8230;.. Supporting all types of falsehood with an evil interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he finished &#8211; he had no evidences, and he had mentioned weak and fabricated Ahadeeth and he mentioned sayings of Socrates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: “O people, you have heard my speech and I say: ‘Allaah said, the Messenger said.  The well known scholars of the <em>Ummah</em> said.’  This man has mentioned fabricated Ahadeeth and did not support it with anything from the Qur&#8217;aan.  Did you hear: &#8216;Allaah said such-and-such in allowing seeking aid from other than Allaah?  And regarding the permissibility of <em>Tawwassul</em>?  Did you hear statements of the senior scholars like Malik and those like him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You did not hear that, rather you heard fabricated and weak Ahadeeth and the statements of people who you know well to believe in superstitions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this person who believed in superstitions began cursing and swearing.  And I began laughing, I did not curse him nor did I swear at him and I did not say anything more then: may Allaah bless you, may Allaah reward you, may Allaah reward you, may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we left, I swear by Allaah other than whom there is none worthy of worship except Him &#8211; the next day the people began talking in the <em>masajid</em> and the markets that the <em>Soofeeyah</em> were defeated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is an inference to a lecture that Shaykh Rabee’ gave in the city of Port Sudan in the year 1392 A.H.  This is just one of many of the evidences that Shaykh Rabee’ follows a moderate Manhaj &amp; has wisdom in giving Dawa’ to Allaah from the beginning of his life until today.  This is contrary to what some people claim that Shaykh Rabee’ follows a Manhaj of harshness. – Publisher’s Quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Narrated by Bukhari (3038) &amp; by Muslim (1733) from the hadeeth of Abu Musa al-Ashaari –radhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 5</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Guidance for the People</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So learn, O brothers, the correct methods of the <em>Sharia&#8217;</em>.  The aim is guidance for the people and the aim is conveying the truth to the hearts of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brother, it is upon you to use all that you can from the ways of the <em>Sharia&#8217;</em> in the path of <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah.  And we do not believe that the ends justify the means since this is from the characteristics of the people of <em>Bida&#8217;</em> who fell into &#8211; due to these characteristics &#8211; lying, twisting, circling around the subject and trickery.  Just as the Imam &#8216;Alee bin Harb al-Moosalee said: &#8216;Every person who follows his desire lies and he doesn&#8217;t care that he lies.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We don&#8217;t have any of these characteristics; we are the people of honesty and the people of truth.  We present the truth in a form and fashion which the people accept and it affects their hearts, may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we also went to &#8216;Kasla&#8217; in Sudan and <em>MashAllaah</em> the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> was going smoothly and well and all praise belongs to Allaah, we spoke there and praise belongs to Allaah and Allaah made our speech beneficial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we went to &#8216;al-Ghazarif&#8217; it is a small city there and we rotated between all the <em>masajd</em> in that place.  The people said: there does not remain in this city except one <em>masjid</em>, which is with the <em>Tijaaneeyah</em>, which we cannot get to!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I SAID: &#8216;WHY NOT?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;They&#8217;re prejudiced, severely prejudiced.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: &#8216;Let&#8217;s go to them and request permission, if they allow us to talk, we will convey the message and if they prevent us then we have an excuse in front of Allaah, it is not necessary that we face them with force and strength <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we went there and the imam led us in prayer.  After we finished it, I gave him Salaams and said to him, will you allow me to deliver a speech to these brothers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;go ahead.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I spoke, called to Allaah, to Tawheed, to Sunnah and to other matters of knowledge.  I criticized some of the mistakes which are present, points of misguidance until I reached to the hadeeth of &#8216;Aeysha <em>–radhiAllaahu anha-</em> which is mentioned by Bukhari and Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are three things, whoever speaks with one of them then he has told a major lie against Allaah: whoever says: that Muhammad saw his Lord; then he has told a major lie against Allaah, whoever says: that Muhammad knows what will happen tomorrow; then he has told a major lie against Allaah’: and I mentioned the proofs for that &#8211; &#8216;and he who claims that Muhammad did not convey what was revealed to him; then he has told a major lie against Allaah.’[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Imam stood up &#8211; he was annoyed and he said to me: ‘I swear by Allaah that indeed Muhammad saw his Lord with his own eyes!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him: <em>JazakAllaahu khair</em>.  As for ‘Aeysha &#8211; who is the most knowledgeable of the people about the Messenger <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em>, she said: ‘whoever says: that Muhammad saw his Lord; then he has told a major lie against Allaah.’ If the Messenger of Allaah had seen his Lord he would have told her, but he did not tell her this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he began to make a din and press me, I said to him: ‘O my brother wait until I finish my talk, then after that ask about whatever you want.  That which I know I can answer, that which I do not know, I&#8217;ll say to you Allaah knows best.’  I left him and continued speaking, I don&#8217;t know if he remained or left.  I don’t know, I didn&#8217;t turn around towards him. Then I heard a man saying:  ‘I swear that what this man is speaking the truth!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I heard the same sentence again from somebody else and he added: &#8216;the man is saying: &#8216;Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said.&#8217; <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the <em>Adhaan</em> was called for the <em>Isha</em> prayer, so the talk ended.  The prayer was about to begin and the people began pushing me to lead them in prayer. So I said to them: &#8216;no way, I won&#8217;t lead you in prayer, the <em>Imam</em> will lead.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;we swear by Allaah you will lead the prayer, we swear by Allaah you will lead the prayer.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: &#8216;OK&#8217; and I led them in prayer.  After we finished I left with the youth of<em>Ansaar as-Sunnah </em>and I asked them: &#8216;where did the <em>Imam</em> go?&#8217; They said: &#8216;They evicted him.&#8217; I said: &#8216;who evicted him?&#8217; they said: &#8216;we swear by Allaah his congregation evicted him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED. &#8211; O BROTHERS &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person comes and says that the <em>Tijaaneeyah</em> <em>al-Marganiyaah</em> are fools! They might slaughter him, not just evict him, but if you come to them with wisdom and gentleness <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> then Allaah will make them benefit by this.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Advice to the Salafiyyoon</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers, use beneficial knowledge and solid proof and beneficial wisdom in your <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>. You should have all the noble and beautiful manners encouraged by the Book and the Messenger of guidance; indeed they are causes for victory and causes for success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have to believe that the Companions did not spread Islaam or enter it into the hearts except with their wisdom and their knowledge more so than with their swords.  However, whoever enters into Islaam under the sword might not be firm, but whoever enters Islaam by way of knowledge, proof and evidence then this is what makes his Eemaan firm by Allaah&#8217;s permission and His assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon you to have these good methods and also to be serious about knowledge.  You have to be serious about <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Now &#8211; O brothers &#8211; I advise you with two issues:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: Brotherhood between all of <em>Ahl -ul-Sunnah</em>; So O you Salafees, disseminate the soul of love and brotherhood between yourselves.  Put into effect what the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> informed us of regarding the believers: ‘Like a building, some of its parts supporting others.’[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that they are: ‘Like a single body if one limb complains then the rest of the body suffers with fever and insomnia.’[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is how you should be O brothers: distance yourselves from the causes of splitting, I swear by Allaah indeed it is a dangerous evil and a disastrous disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>: distance yourselves from the causes which lead to enmity, hatred, splitting up and dissension.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Keep away from these things; because this has become predominant nowadays at the hands of people, about whom only Allaah knows their condition and intent.  It has become predominant and has torn apart the youth in this country &#8211; whether in the university or other than it &#8211; or in the other parts of the <em>Duniya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why?! Because those who are not from its people – neither in knowledge nor in understanding &#8211; entered into the arena of giving <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that the enemies could have entered someone into the midst of the <em>Salafeeyeen</em> to tear them apart and split them up, and this issue is not unlikely, rather it can truly happen <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Strive to have brotherhood.  If any dissension has occurred between you, then both parties should make themselves forget what is past and start with a clean slate now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say to the brothers: whoever falls short it is not allowed to debase him, nor destroy the one who is deficient.  Whoever makes a mistake amongst us we do not destroy him. <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> &#8211; but we cure him with gentleness, wisdom and face him with love and friendship and all the rest of the righteous manners, along with the correct <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> until he repents.  And if there remains a weakness in him then we are not hasty with him, or otherwise, I swear by Allaah no one will remain, no one will remain!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are some people now who chase after the Salafis so much so that they reached the scholars and called them those who water things down <em>(Mumaya’een)</em>!! There is hardly any scholar in the arena of <em>Dawa’</em> today except that he has been falsely attacked with this claim about him!  Of course this is the way of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen and the way of <em>Ahl-ul-Bida’</em> since, from the weapons of the <em>Ahl ul-Bid</em>a’ is that they begin by overthrowing the scholars, rather it is the Jewish Masonic way: that if you wanted to discredit an idea, then discredit their scholars or their personalities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So keep away from this rotten legacy and have respect for the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Narrated by Bukhari (4855) &amp; Muslim (177)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Narrated by Bukhari (481) &amp; by Muslim (2585) from the hadeeth of Abu Musa –radhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Narrated by Bukhari (6011) &amp; Muslim (2586) from the hadeeth of an-Nu’maan bin Basheer –radhiAllaahu anhu.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 6</h2>
<h1 style="text-align:justify;">The Intent of The Opponents</h1>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I swear by Allaah; that those who make efforts in speech against me &#8211; or attack that which we are upon – do not do so except that the intended result is to bring down the <em>Manhaj</em>; so the one who dislikes this <em>Manhaj</em> speaks about its scholars.  He who hates this <em>Manhaj</em> and wants to bring it down follows this path, so that there are no obstacles for them: they follow way of the Jews and the way of the misguided groups from the Raawafidah and other than them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Raawafidah hate Islaam and they are not capable of speaking against Muhammad &#8211;<em> sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, so they speak against Abu Bakr and Umar and the scholars of the <em>Ummah</em>; they want to overthrow Islaam.  If the people of major <em>Bida&#8217;</em> speak: then they don&#8217;t speak against Ahmad and Shafi&#8217;, but they speak against Muhammad bin Abdul Wahhab and Ibn Taymeeyah and their likes; so that they can try to overthrow this <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And now, we have people who have grown up amongst the ranks of the<em>Salafeeyeen</em>, I was not aware that they wanted to break up the leaders from amongst the scholars!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people, what do they want? What do they want? If they intend Allaah and the Hereafter and intended to aid this <em>Manhaj</em> – they claim to love this<em>Manhaj</em> – but I swear by Allaah, if they really loved it they would have defended the scholars of this <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So do not feel safe about your <em>Deen</em> with these people.  Do not regard them as trustworthy. <em>BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> &#8211; be completely careful of them, hold together firmly and have brotherhood amongst yourselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I know that you are not without blame, nor are the scholars without blame – we sometimes make mistakes with the exception of those who fall into <em>Rafd</em> or<em>‘aatizal</em> or <em>Tajahum</em> or fall into <em>Hizbeeyah</em> from the different parties which are present; then this person is the one to be abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>Salafi</em> who has allegiance to the <em>Salafeeyeen</em> and loves the <em>Salafi</em><em>Manhaj</em> <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>&#8211; and dislikes the different groups, dislikes <em>Bida’</em> and its people – amongst other aspects from the signs of the <em>Salafi</em> <em>Manhaj</em> – but then this <em>Salafi</em> becomes weak in other points, here we are gentle with this person we do not leave him but we advise him and we rescue him and we are patient with him and we try to cure him <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it were said: whoever makes a mistake is destroyed! Then according to this statement no-one remains! This is why you see these people, when they have finished dealing with the youth; they begin by overthrowing the scholars – this is the <em>Manhaj</em> of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen when they entered into many countries.  The first thing they started with was overthrowing the scholars and at the same time they defend Sayyid Qutb, Hasan al-Banna, Mawdudi and others from amongst <em>Ahl –ul Bida’</em>.  They overthrow the scholars of the <em>Salafi Manhaj</em> and they described the scholars as being agents and spies and scholars of the rulers……and many other accusations!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is their intent!?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their intent is to overthrow the <em>Salafi</em> <em>Manhaj</em> and to establish falsehood and misguidance upon mutiny.   Those who now defame the scholars say that they themselves are the <em>Salafiyoon</em> yet, along with that, they criticize the scholars of the <em>Salafiyyah</em>!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What do they want? Do they want to raise the banner of Islaam!? And raise the banner of the Sunnah and the <em>Manhaj</em> <em>as-Salafi</em>?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never, never!  These are indications and proofs that they are blameworthy liars, no matter what they claim for themselves.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Final Counsel</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise you O brothers and I emphasize that you leave off splitting and that you should have brotherhood and mutual cooperation upon the truth. You should spread this <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> between the students of the university and other than them in its correct and beautiful form, not in the distorted form which these people follow!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Present the <em>Dawa&#8217; as-Salafiyyah</em> as I mentioned in a beautiful form with the words; ‘Allaah said, the Messenger of Allaah said, the Companions said, Shafi&#8217; said, Ahmad said, Bukhari said, Muslim said’, also the scholars of Islaam whom they respect and revere, bring their attention to the speech of the scholars <em>-BarakAllaahu Feekum</em> this will aid you a great deal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, you will find some people who will be obstinate but not everyone is obstinate.  You will find most of the people accepting your <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> whether it is here in the university or when you return to your countries. Use these methods which attract the people to the Book of Allaah and to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em>, to the <em>Manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>, to the correct beliefs and correct <em>Manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah <em>&#8211; Tabaraka  wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> that He gives us and you capability and success in that which He loves and is pleased with and that He makes us from the sincere callers and practising scholars and keeps us and you away from the plots of<em>Shaytaan</em>, also from the plots of the <em>Shayateen</em> from <em>Jinn</em> and mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Him <em>&#8211; Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala &#8211;</em> that He puts love between your hearts and gathers you upon the truth, that you are beneficial wherever you reside and wherever you travel and go to, and I ask Allaah to make that a reality.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his Family, his Companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">The Status of Jesus in Islam  &#8211; by Shaykh Rabee bin Hadee Al-Madkhalee</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a short essay <b>“Makaanatu ‘Eesaa fil-Islaam”</b> (The Status of Jesus in Islaam) written by Dr. Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, a Muslim religious scholar from Saudi Arabia. The source used for this translation was the on-line version of the book, which can be found on <a href="http://www.rabee.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabee.net</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the book, for the most part, is geared towards non-Muslim readers, particularly Christians, names of prophets and other righteous believers of the past are presented here in their standard English version, even though, they are pronounced differently in Arabic by Muslims. This was done to make it easier for the non-Muslim audience, who are not accustomed to the Arabic versions of these names, to read the treatise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in many instances, the word “Allaah” was translated as God, in order to assist non-Muslim readers understand the subject at hand more clearly. However, the proper name of God, Allaah, was left as is in other parts where deemed appropriate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is hoped that this treatise may serve as a means to invite and call the Christian community to develop an understanding of how Jesus is viewed in the eyes of the Muslims and what we believe concerning him, as revealed to us by Allaah in the Qur’aan and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The story of Mary begins with this great connection of mentioning those whom God chose over mankind, which included the family of ‘Imraan, who were the parents of Mary. This is done in order to make it clear that Mary came from a righteous and noble family, and that she was part of the offspring of chosen prophets, and that her mother was a pious woman. An example of her piety and righteousness was that she vowed to offer what was in her womb to the services of God. She was hoping that it would be a boy, but instead she gave birth to a girl. So she returned this matter back to God, seeking His pardon and asking Him to protect her daughter and her offspring from the outcast Devil. So her Lord answered her supplication and warmly accepted Mary, causing her to be raised in a good manner and placing a righteous and merciful prophet, Zachariah, in charge of caring for her. This shows that the mother of Jesus had a tremendous upbringing.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“God is not in need of begetting a son. Attributing a child to Him is from the greatest forms of disbelief and misguidance, since it constitutes the highest level of insult and deficiency being ascribed to His Honor, Greatness and Lordship. This is since everything apart from God (the Creator) can only be one of His creations, and all of His creations submit themselves to His Honor and Grandness and are mandated to worship Him, whereas God is divine and free of begetting a child. This is why Allaah says to those who ascribe a child to Him, and His speech is the truth: <b>‘You have indeed brought forth something very terrible (i.e. an evil statement) – due to which the heavens are ready to tear apart, the earth split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins. It is that they ascribe a child to the Most Merciful (i.e. God). However, it is not befitting for the (Majesty of the) Most Merciful that he should beget a child. There is none in the heavens and the earth except that he comes unto the Most Merciful as a servant. Verily, He knows each one of them, and has counted them a full counting. And each one of them will come to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone (and without any helpers).’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>6.</b> In Chapter 21 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 46, it states: <b>‘But when they tried to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, since they held him to be a prophet.’</b>There is proof in this verse that the masses of people who believed in God and in Jesus were monotheists with pure and sincere faith, and that they believed that Jesus was a messenger and a prophet. This proves that their prophet, Jesus, had taught them this and cultivated them to believe in that. So they did not used to believe that he was God or the son of God, since he would not teach the people these things.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Has not the time come for the Christians, after hearing all of this, to hasten and rush to Islaam, especially the intellectual, educated and free thinking ones amongst them? We call them again to stand up before God in pairs and individually, then to reflect on this tremendous matter – of which there is no matter greater than it – with firm determination and impartiality and earnestly seeking to attain the truth and the reality, for it is indeed a crucial matter, which can either lead one to Paradise, the size of which spans the heavens and the earth, or to the Hellfire, whose fuel will be men and stones and which is prepared for those who disbelieve to reside therein forever. This is a matter that all of the messengers agreed on and which is contained in their revealed books, including Jesus, the servant and messenger of God. At this point, it is appropriate for us to honestly tell you: <b>‘O People of the Scripture! Come to a word that is just between us and you – that we worship none but God alone and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides God.’ Then if they turn away, say: ‘Bear witness that we are Muslims.’</b>”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shaykh Rabee&#8217; on Hijrah to Britain</strong><br />
Question about Escaping to the West answered by Shaykh Rabee&#8217; Al-Madkhalee may Allaah preserve him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On more than one occasion, Shaykh Rabee&#8217; has made the points translated below. In fact, he says these things every time he is asked about migrating to the West and living there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> May Allaah be benevolent to you; here is a question from the Salafi youth in Britain. They are asking about the ruling on residing in the lands of the unbelievers in order to escape the injustice of rulers in some Muslim countries. [They also ask about] the ruling on taking a British nationality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah knows best, 90% of those who go to Europe and America go there not because any government is chasing them, not because of anything [like this]. Even if a government is trying to pursue [a Muslim], he should be patient and endure. When Ahmad b. Hanbal was tortured, did he go off to the lands of unbelief? I ask you: Ahmad b. Hanbal and others, then Ibn Taymiyah, when [the rulers] harmed them incessantly and imprisoned them, did they flee to the lands of unbelief? Allaah bless you, he should be patient, he should live in his own country, even in prison, it is better for him than going to Europe and America, especially since these [countries] have measures and policies to recruit Muslims into their societies, to Christianize them and convert them to atheists and heretics (zanaadiqah). These are old strategies which they are applying now and many corrupt preachers and corrupt scholars are striving to recruit Muslims into European societies now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So why go to these countries? Why not be patient even if the government [of the Muslim country] pursues you, be patient, it is better for you. Many people go [to other counties] without being pursued. <span style="color:#ff0000;">They go to eat and drink and serve the Jews and Christians in their countries, degrading themselves and Islam</span>. Allaah bless you, He has promised he will provide your sustenance, whoever fears Allaah and obeys Him, He will make a way out for him and sustain him from where he would not imagine (Quran 65: 3). All you have to do is fear Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and obey Him (practice taqwaa) and your provision will come from places you would not imagine. A person never dies until he has fulfilled everything that was written for him. <span style="color:#993300;">But Shaytan beautifies for him the idea of going to the West, so he can live there the life of cattle, first in derision and meekness, and then in tribulation and danger surrounding him and his family</span>. When your child is six years old, where will he study? He will study in the schools of the Jews, atheists, secularists and Christians, and they will teach him their way of life, and they will not distinguish [between Muslims and non-Muslims] in this regard, may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adopting an unbelieving foreign nationality instead of an Islamic one has been declared an act of Kufr by some scholars. A person does not take this nationality except after becoming prepared by submitting to the laws of these countries and aligning his loyalty to them and his enmity for those who go against them. He might also be prepared by fighting [for them]. If the Islamic army approached the unbelievers land, he [would have to] face the Islamic army because he has become a soldier for the enemies of Allaah and is prepared. They might enlist and prepare him to fight the Muslims in their own lands, as has occurred in Afghanistan. They recruited Muslims to fight the Afghans and a fatwa (religious edict) was issued by some corrupt scholars stating it is allowed for [a Muslim] to fight the Muslims to confirm his nationality and his allegiance to America. This is the fatwaa of <strong>Al-Qardawi</strong>, who occupies a great status amongst Muslims due to this fatw?. All?h bless you, how many evil corrupt edicts there are! We ask All?h for protection and wellbeing!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Right now, measures are being taken in the West to achieve these goals: to recruit Muslims into Western societies. How can you go there in these circumstances? It is obligatory upon Muslims to migrate [back] to their lands when they hear of these actions and attempts to integrate and merge them into the Western societies.</p>
