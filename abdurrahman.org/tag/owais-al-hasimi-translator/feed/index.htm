19 Ramaḍān 1437</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawzīyah – Allāh have mercy on him – said while describing the way of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in reciting the Qurān:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People have differed as to which is best: tartīl (slower) recitation covering less (of the Qurān), or faster recitation with more covered; which of them is better? They had two opinions on this.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">My son travels abroad to attend football (soccer) matches in the lands of the unbelievers; what is your advice for me and for him regarding this matter?</span></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Salih Fawzan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[My advice] is that he is to have <strong>Taqwa</strong> of Allah and not to follow this game that has no benefit, rather it is harmful, and that he not travel for its sake to the lands of the unbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong> [football] is useless. and <strong>secondly</strong>, travelling to the lands of the unbelievers is not permitted except for a necessity, for medical treatment, to learn something special only they have and which we need, or for trade, this is alright.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] <strong>Question</strong>: What is the best way for women to give da&#8217;wah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I say to the women: “<span style="color:#008000;"><em>Remain in your homes</em></span>.” [Surah Ahzaab: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you should not concern yourselves with da&#8217;wah. I reject the use of the word &#8220;da&#8217;wah&#8221; amongst the male youth by them making it seem like they are from the people of da&#8217;wah – as if the word da&#8217;wah has become the fashion of modern times. So every individual that knows something about the Religion becomes a Da&#8217;ee (caller to Islaam)! And this matter did not stop with the male youth until it was carried over to the female youth and housewives. And in many instances, they have begun to turn away from fulfilling the obligations of their households and their husbands and their children, turning away from these obligations towards something that is not obligatory upon them, such as establishing the da&#8217;wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The general rule concerning the woman is that she is to stay in her home. And it has not been legislated for her to leave it unless she has a dire need. This is based on the statement of the Prophet,sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam: &#8220;And (praying in) their homes is better for them&#8221;, i.e. than the (congregational) prayer in the masjid.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we see a prevalent phenomenon amongst the women in that they go out often to the masjids in order to pray the congregational prayer, not to mention the Jumu&#8217;ah prayer. In spite of this, their homes are better for them – unless there is a masjid in which the Imaam is a scholar who teaches those attending some aspects from the sciences of the Religion. So in this case, the woman could go out to pray in the masjid in order to listen to the knowledge. There is nothing preventing her from that. As for the woman preoccupying herself with the da&#8217;wah (!), then let her sit in her home and read from the books that her husband or brother or other male relatives provide for her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, there is nothing preventing her from setting a day in which she calls the women to come to her house or she goes out to attend the house of one of them. That is better than a group of women going out (to her). One woman going out to a group of women is better for them than all of them going out to her. As for her moving about and traveling, perhaps traveling without a mahram, and she justifies that by claiming that she went out for the purpose of da&#8217;wah, then these are from the presentday innovations. And I do not specify the women only with that, rather, even some of the male youth speak excessively about the da&#8217;wah and yet they have very little knowledge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color:#000000;text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666666;">Translated by Abu Abdillah Owais Al-Hashimi حفظه الله</span><br style="color:#666666;" /><span style="color:#666666;">Source: </span><a class="yt-uix-redirect-link ext-link ext-icon-19" style="color:#1b7fcc;" title="http://www.alfawzan.af.org.sa/node/15245" href="http://www.alfawzan.af.org.sa/node/15245" rel="nofollow external">http://www.alfawzan.af.org.sa/node/15245</a></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><strong>Question to Shaykh Salih Al-Fawzan</strong>:</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Could you give some advice to the young Muslims, including students of knowledge, who watch World Cup matches late into a third of the night; and in the month of Ramadan matches will be played during the time of Isha and Tarawih prayers?</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><strong>His response</strong>:</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Muslims must leave diversion and play, and turn to the worship of Allah &#8216;azza wa jall, and not waste their time following matches or other types of diversion and play, especially in the blessed month of Ramadan.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">It is upon Muslims in general, and the youth in particular &#8211; because some of them are very fond of football matches and watching them; and this has no benefit, rather it has harms because it involves wasting time. How can a person waste his precious time and waste this great season of Ramadan watching matches? This is a great loss which cannot be replaced. So they must stop this and turn to the worship of Allah, especially during the month of Ramadan. A person should make good use of his precious time by spending it in the obedience of Allah and standing in prayer for Allah at night. This is what he has been told to do, and this is what will remain for the people and this is what they will find kept for them with Allah &#8216;azza wa jall as reward in the Hereafter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><b>بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</b></p>
<p align="center"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-2CK" target="_blank"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>At the Doorstep of Knowledge</b></span></a></p>
<p> It is reported from ‘Abdullâh b. ‘Abbâs – Allâh be pleased with them – that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Allâh’s Messenger – Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him – passed away, I said to a man from the Ansâr, <b>“Come, let us ask [and learn from] the Prophet’s Companions, Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him, for they are many in number today.”</b> He replied, <b>“I am surprised at you Ibn ‘Abbâs – do you really think people need you when there are so many Companions of the Prophet – Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him?”</b> So he did not involve himself in this endeavor, but I busied myself asking [the Companions about issues]. If I heard of a hadîth being reported by a man, I would come to him and if he was taking his midday nap I would lay down my garment and lie outside waiting for him, with  the wind blowing dust in my face. The man would come out [for Dhuhr] and see me in that state, and he would exclaim, <b>“O nephew of Allâh’s Messenger! What has brought you here? You should have sent for me and I would have come to you!”</b> I would say, <b>“Rather I should come to you [to seek knowledge].”</b> I would then ask him about the hadîth I heard. The man [who I originally invited to seek knowledge with me] remained as he was, and when he saw how people would gather around me [to seek knowledge] he said, <b>“For sure, this young man was more intelligent than me.”</b><b> [Al-Dârimî, Al-Sunan Vol. 2 p129.]</b></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">الشيخ صالح بن فوزان الفوزان</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Respected Shaykh, may Allah give you success: on the days following Eid, some people organize gatherings for women where the simple hand drum (al-duff) is used and there is dancing and singing. [The women] say these are the days of Eid and it is allowed to use al-duff, dance and sing without using [other] musical instruments; how correct is this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Brother, the day of Eid is one day, not a number of days. The days of Eid Al-Ad-ha and Eid Al-Fitr are a one day for each. The Days of Tashriq that follow the day of Eid Al-Ad-ha are not days of Eid, they are not called Days of Eid; these are the Days of Tashriq. These people [being asked about] want to revive drums, musical instruments and singing, they call them the Days of Eid. This is a lie about the Shariah; this behaviour is not allowed not for men and not for women.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allahs benevolence be upon you, respected Shaykh, the enquirer asks: In the tape shops there are tapes where there are recordings of al-duff being played accompanied by young women / teenage girls saying nashids. Teenage girls and women listen to these tapes on Eid with the excuse that al-duff is allowed on the Day of Eid. What is the ruling on this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ruling is that this is not allowed. This [activity] teaches young women false frivolity and singing it spoils young Muslim women and makes them become silly. Accordingly, these tapes must be destroyed, they must be destroyed. Singing on Eid was not allowed by the Prophet Allahs praise and peace be upon him except for young girls; minors who were not legally liable for their actions. [They were] young girls, not females who were legally bound by Islamic law (i.e. those who had reached puberty). Women who are grown up and legally bound by the commandments of Islam are not permitted to sing or behave frivolously.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">May Allahs benevolence be upon you, respected Shaykh, this enquirer asks about a practice that has emerged in the mosques/places of prayer on Eid: the distribution of dates before Eid prayer, so that people can get the virtue (of practicing the Sunnah) of eating some dates [before Eid Al-Fitr prayer]. Is this action a Sunnah, or is it a novel introduction?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the practice of some young Muslims Allah guide them. This was not done amongst the Salaf; we do not know that they used to distribute dates at the Eid prayer place (musalla). What is confirmed from Allahs Messenger praise and peace of Allah be upon him is that he used to eat before leaving home [on Eid Al-Fitr], he would eat a few dates before leaving his house. So, whoever wants to practice the Sunnah should eat when he leaves his house not at the mosque or prayer place.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Respected Shaykh, what is the ruling on giving presents at Eid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no harm in this. Spending more and giving more food, drink, gifts and visiting others, all of this is desired, because it involves keeping in touch with Muslims and brings about love between them. So, there is no harm in [giving gifts].</p>

<cite>Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawzīyah, Al-Fawā`id 1:277</cite></p>
<div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>Every intelligent person knows that Shaytān has no way to [attack] him except from three angles:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Extravagance</strong>. [A person] takes more than he needs, so it becomes superfluous; and [surplus] is the share of Shaytān and his point of entry to the heart. The way to avoid this is to avoid giving the self all it wants of food, sleep, pleasure and comfort. When you close this door, you will be safe from the enemy entering through it.</span></p></blockquote>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Heedlessness</strong>. One who remembers [Allāh] is in an impenetrable fortress. If he becomes forgetful and heedless, he opens the gates of the fortress, and the enemy enters, after which it is difficult to expel him.</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Affectation</strong> of what does not concern oneself, or what one is not qualified to involve oneself in.</span></p></blockquote>

<p style="text-align:justify;">بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>The brother began with Khutbatul Hajjah</p>
<p>Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala mentioned the success -the true meaning of success and being successful is the one who is saved from the fire due to his own sins and his own disobedience of Allah and is admitted into al Jannah where Allah subhanawa ta&#8217;ala said (what means):</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Whoever is saved from the fire and admitted into paradise, then he is the one who has been successful.. &#8220;</em></span></p>
<p>Allah Subhana wa ta&#8217;ala many places in the Quran told us His promise that He will admit the believing men and women into Jannah, into paradise, so He linked success and admission into paradise, with having correct iman, faith and belief, which includes practising the religion of Islam and putting it to practice. All those that a person&#8217;s faith necessitates or requires of him or her.</p>
<p>So Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala said in Surah At Taubah:<em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allah has promised to believers &#8211; men and women &#8211; Gardens under which rivers flow, to dwell therein [forever], and beautiful mansions in Gardens of everlasting bliss. But the greatest bliss is the Pleasure of Allah. That is the supreme success&#8221;.</span></em> (Surah At-Tauba 9:72)</p>
<p>Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala said (what means)</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Allaah may admit the believing men and the believing women to Gardens beneath under which rivers flow (i.e. Paradise), to abide therein forever, and to expiate from them their sins, and that is with Allâh, a supreme success.</em> </span>(Al-Fath 48:5)</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;<strong>Secondly</strong>, it is a call for us to realize that having faith, have iman in Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala necessitates certain things. If a person has true Iman, then that must bring about certain actions. It must bring about certain change in the person&#8217;s behaviour and lifestyle. So when he or she acts, they do things that are in accordance with the obedience of Allaah Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala. And that Iman (faith) that a person has -that belief about the truth, also makes a person or should make a person stay away from the things that Allah Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala has told him to stay away from.</p>
<p>Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala describes the qualities of the believers. And in this respect as a rule, we know that when the believers are described in the Qu&#8217;ran, this includes both men and women unless there is a proof, there is specific proof, either in the context of the verses or a Hadith of the Prophet sallalahu alayhi wa salam or through the Sunnah of the Prophet which explains the Qu&#8217;ran. To show that this particular command or prohibition is specific to the males, men of his ummah or to the women of his ummah. Otherwise the general rule is when the believers are addressed &#8220;O you who believe..&#8221; and when believers or righteous people are described, this refers to both men and women. So in terms of the obligation upon us all to believe in Allah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;ala and believe in the hereafter to accept the truth and then act upon the truth, to put it into practice in our lives &#8211; all of this ummah, all of the believers, men and women, are the same in the regard. And they have the same obligation and the same promise of success and the same promise of being forgiven for their shortcomings and their mistakes and being admitted into paradise and being saved from the fire.</p>
<p>However, in other places in the Qu&#8217;ran, there is also an emphasis given with regard to men and with regards to women. In some places, believing men and women are mentioned alongside each other in the verses of the Qu&#8217;ran. And in some places,there is specific address and a specific description about women believers, righteous women, women who have been commanded to d ocertain things, to put certain or obey Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala in a specific way or to stay away from some specific thing. We can say that all of those are descriptions and aspects of what make as successful Muslim woman.</p>
<p>So an example of the general description of the believers that should be true of the believing woman as well as the man, is the statement of Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala in surah Muminoon. Where He (what means)</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8221; Indeed successful are the believers, those who are humble and submissive in their prayers and those who turn away from ill and false speech. And those who pay the Zakat. And those who guard their chastity.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts)</span></em> (Al-Mu&#8217;minon 1-5)</p>
<p>So for a person who want success in this life and the hereafter, he or she should consider the description and the attributes, the qualities that are mentioned in such verses. Again, success has been linked to a person being a believer, and then in this passage, these verses of the noble Qu&#8217;ran some of the qualities of the believers are mentioned. The first of them is khushoo in one&#8217;s salah. And al khushoo is to be humble and submissive and low in front of Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala -in one&#8217;s heart and physically in the movement and in the settling of the limbs in the prayer. This is really the soul and heart of a person&#8217;s salah, that when a person stands in front of Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala to pray, to establish the salah, that person standing humbly and submissively in his heart and in his body such that she thinks or she thinks about Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala and about the remembrances that she is saying, what she is remembering Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala with. And she thinks about the meaning of whats he is reciting which makes her turn to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala and perform this act of worship according to, in the best way and hoping to gain forgiveness from Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala to get the reward of Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala through the worshipping Him. This should cause the person to pray with khushoo in one&#8217;s limbs, to be still and humble of Allah, to concentrate on remembering Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala in the prayer. And this is the thing that really gives a benefit to a person and is the real purpose of the prayer, to remember Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala, and to submit the limbs and to submit ones body, to submit your whole self to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;..And if we want to generalize,because sometimes it&#8217;s true or it&#8217;s beneficial to generalize,one of the things that many women are being tried with is false speech. Speech that is that involves disobeying Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala, and displeasing Allahazza wa jal. So back biting,slandering others, speaking indecently, speaking to males,speaking to men in an inappropriate manner, speaking and arguing and fighting with each other and cursing one another or saying things which involve belittling your fellow sisters. These things have to be considered because they draw you away from Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala and they draw a person closer to jahannam. These things are forbidden and one of the worse some of the worst sins are related to the sins of one&#8217;s speech.</p>
<p>These are also some of the qualities that Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala described of successful women. They have those same fundamental qualities that men are supposed to have to be successful, that women are supposed to also have, we are the same in this regard. Submitting to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala,believing in correct iman and correct aqeedah, correct belief system, correct attitude,believing in all those things that we&#8217;re supposed to believe in and not rejecting any of it. To have iman, To be devout, obedient to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala, to have this qunoot,, to put one self to the obedience to to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala, to be truthful in one&#8217;s belief, in one&#8217;s speech, and in one&#8217;s actions. This is one of the most important qualities, and actually in reality, the quality of truthfulness is not just to speak the truth. This is one important aspect of being truthful. Truthfulness, begins by being true in one&#8217;s heart and in one&#8217;s actions. Meaning that when a person obeys Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala openly, they really mean it and they do it sincerely from the heart. Truthfulness in reality is to be the same on the inside a as you are on the outside. Truthfulness is to be the same on the inside as you are on the out side. This is the reality of truthfulness and one part of that and a very important part of that is to always say the truth. When you speak, speak the truth.Those who are patient from the men and the women. Assabr &#8211; patience, is to remain steadfast in obeying Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala, believing and trusting in the reward from Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala and that Allah will reward you and take care of you if you remain obedient to him. Thats the reality of patience.</p>
<p>Assabr has three aspects to it. The first is to steadfast,consistent, upon the obedience of Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala, to remain obedient to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala so that no matter what hardships you have or challenges you have, you don&#8217;t allow yourself to do something or to leave obeying Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala. You stay obedient to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala. When you pray, you remain someone who prays regularly. When you obey Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala in a certain way, you ensure you try to make sure that you&#8217;re always like this. You remain steadfast on this. This is the first pillar of patience to remain obedient to Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala.</p>
<p>The second thing is to remain patient and staying away from sins and staying away from the disobedience of Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala. So when you leave and you abandon a sin for Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala, to be saved from Allah anger and to be rewarded you stay like this. You maintain that and you don&#8217;t give up you don&#8217;t allow yourself to fall back into disobeying Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala. And the third pillar of sabr, or patience, is to remain steadfast and be patient in the face of what afflicts or what faces you, what Allah has written to affect you in your life. Trouble, danger,,stress, the loss of wealth, the loss of life, the loss of loved ones, those calamities and problems that may affect a person as a test from Allah subhana wa ta&#8217;ala. The third pillar of sabr is to remain patient of obedience. This is also a very important quality of the successful woman. This is a quality of the successful man,the believing man or the believing woman&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Al-Fawzān: If you know and are sure about the deviation of a group and are able to, you must warn&#8230;…even if there is a scholar who praises the group.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following question was posed to Shaykh <span style="text-decoration:underline;">S</span>āli<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span> b. Fawzān Al-Fawzān – may Allāh preserve and protect him (&#8220;Sahab Salafi Network&#8221; 2012):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I intend to write about some deviated groups and warn against them. However, these groups have not left the fold of Islām, and some scholars have praised them, and I fear that [such scholars] might call against me<span style="color:#888888;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1Aj" target="_blank"><span style="color:#888888;">.</span></a></span> What is your advice and guidance for me, knowing that this group is deviated?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Your duty (wājib) is to clarify the truth; your duty is to clarify the truth. If you are sure about their errors and their deviation, you are one hundred percent sure, and you have the ability and the knowledge to explain, then it is a duty upon you to do this<a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1Aj" target="_blank">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>And when Allāh took the covenant from those who were given the scripture that you must explain it to people and not hide it…  </i></span>(Translation of the meaning of Āl-‘Imrān: 187)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><i>Verily those who hide the clear guidance that We have revealed…<br />
</i></span>(Translation of the meaning of Al-Baqarah: 159, 174)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not allowed to hide knowledge. If you know and are sure about the deviation of some groups or sects, then clarify them and explain them for the people, so that they may be on guard against them. This is part of na<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>ī<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ah (sincere concern for others; advice). The Messenger – Allāh’s praise and peace be upon him – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">The religion is na<span style="text-decoration:underline;">s</span>ī<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ah (sincerity). We asked: “to whom?” He replied, “to Allāh, and to His Book, and to His Messenger, and to the leaders of the Muslims and their masses. </span></em>(<span style="text-decoration:underline;">S</span>a<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>ī<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span> Muslim, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>adīth #55)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[In doing so,] <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>do not fear the people. You must fear Allāh</strong></span> – the exalted and perfect – and explain the truth and refute falsehood, and not fear people, yes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Responsibility in Knowledge and Da’wah</strong></span></span></div>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Alî b. Abî Tâlib</strong> – Allah be pleased with him – said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Narrate to people what they can understand; do you want Allah and His Messenger to be disbelieved?</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Quoted by Al-Bukhârî, Al-Sahîh, Chapter about a person preferring some people with certain knowledge to the exclusion of others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Ibn Hajr said in Fath Al-Bârî,</strong> “[In this narration] there is evidence that ambiguous knowledge should not be mentioned amongst the general public.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Shaykh Muhammad b. Sâlih Al-‘Uthaymîn </strong>– Allah have mercy on him – explained this very important and often misunderstood point beautifully. After mentioning the narration of ‘Alî, he states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is therefore an aspect of wisdom in da’wah (calling others to Allah) that you should not surprise people with things they are not able to comprehend. Rather, you should call them in stages, bit by bit until their minds settle…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He goes on to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“[The statement of ‘Alî] ‘Do you want Allah and His Messenger to be disbelieved?’ is a rhetorical question, posed as a criticism of such behavior. It means: by narrating to people things they cannot understand do you want Allah and His Messenger to be disbelieved? This is because in such cases when you say, “Allah said, and His Messenger said” they will say you have lied if their minds cannot comprehend what you are saying. Here, they are not disbelieving Allah and His Messenger, but they are disbelieving you because of this speech that you have attributed to Allah and His Messenger. Thus they will end up disbelieving Allah and His Messenger – not directly – but by way of the one who transmits this knowledge (i.e. you).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now if it is said: Should we stop telling people things they cannot understand even if they need to know? The answer is: no, we do not leave this knowledge altogether, but we should tell them in a way that they will be able to understand. This is done by telling them stage by stage, bit by bit until they can accept the speech we want them to know and they can feel comfortable with it. We do not abandon knowledge that people cannot understand and just say ‘this is something they will reject or dislike so we will not speak about it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same is the case with acting upon a Sunnah that people are not used to and which they might find objectionable. We should act by this Sunnah, but only after informing people about it, such that they will be able to accept it and feel comfortable about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We learn from this narration (of ‘Alî) that it is important to employ wisdom in calling to Allah, and that it is incumbent upon anyone who calls to Allah to consider the level of understanding of those he is inviting, and that he should put everyone in their proper place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Majmû’ Fatâwâ Ibn ‘Uthaymîn Vol.10 p140.</strong></p>

<p>It is reported that Mufaddal b. Muhalhal – Allāh have mercy on him – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">If the heretic started mentioning his bid’ah right at the beginning of the sitting, you would be on your guard and flee from him, but what he does is begin by mentioning hadīth from the <span style="color:#008000;">Sunnah</span>. Then, he slips his bid’ah in on you. It might then stick to your heart; but when will it leave your heart?</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">It is reported that ‘Abdullâh b. Mas’ûd – Allâh be pleased with him – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The example of the believer, the unbeliever and the hypocrite is that of three people who arrived at a valley. One of them descended and passed through to the other side. One of them descended until he reached half way, when the third man on the edge of the valley called to him, “Woe to you, where are you going? You will die. Come back.” The man who made it to the other side called to him, “Come and be saved.” So [the man in the middle of the valley] kept looking back and forth at the two [on each side of the valley], when a flood came into the valley and drowned him. The man who passed through to the other side is the believer; the one who drowned is the munâfiq (hypocrite) – <em><br />

<p style="text-align:justify;">And the one who remained at the edge of the valley [not  able to escape the flood and pass] is the kâfir (unbeliever).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shaykh Rabee&#8217; on Hijrah to Britain</strong><br />
Question about Escaping to the West answered by Shaykh Rabee&#8217; Al-Madkhalee may Allaah preserve him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On more than one occasion, Shaykh Rabee&#8217; has made the points translated below. In fact, he says these things every time he is asked about migrating to the West and living there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> May Allaah be benevolent to you; here is a question from the Salafi youth in Britain. They are asking about the ruling on residing in the lands of the unbelievers in order to escape the injustice of rulers in some Muslim countries. [They also ask about] the ruling on taking a British nationality.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah knows best, 90% of those who go to Europe and America go there not because any government is chasing them, not because of anything [like this]. Even if a government is trying to pursue [a Muslim], he should be patient and endure. When Ahmad b. Hanbal was tortured, did he go off to the lands of unbelief? I ask you: Ahmad b. Hanbal and others, then Ibn Taymiyah, when [the rulers] harmed them incessantly and imprisoned them, did they flee to the lands of unbelief? Allaah bless you, he should be patient, he should live in his own country, even in prison, it is better for him than going to Europe and America, especially since these [countries] have measures and policies to recruit Muslims into their societies, to Christianize them and convert them to atheists and heretics (zanaadiqah). These are old strategies which they are applying now and many corrupt preachers and corrupt scholars are striving to recruit Muslims into European societies now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So why go to these countries? Why not be patient even if the government [of the Muslim country] pursues you, be patient, it is better for you. Many people go [to other counties] without being pursued. <span style="color:#ff0000;">They go to eat and drink and serve the Jews and Christians in their countries, degrading themselves and Islam</span>. Allaah bless you, He has promised he will provide your sustenance, whoever fears Allaah and obeys Him, He will make a way out for him and sustain him from where he would not imagine (Quran 65: 3). All you have to do is fear Allaah the Mighty and Majestic and obey Him (practice taqwaa) and your provision will come from places you would not imagine. A person never dies until he has fulfilled everything that was written for him. <span style="color:#993300;">But Shaytan beautifies for him the idea of going to the West, so he can live there the life of cattle, first in derision and meekness, and then in tribulation and danger surrounding him and his family</span>. When your child is six years old, where will he study? He will study in the schools of the Jews, atheists, secularists and Christians, and they will teach him their way of life, and they will not distinguish [between Muslims and non-Muslims] in this regard, may Allaah bless you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adopting an unbelieving foreign nationality instead of an Islamic one has been declared an act of Kufr by some scholars. A person does not take this nationality except after becoming prepared by submitting to the laws of these countries and aligning his loyalty to them and his enmity for those who go against them. He might also be prepared by fighting [for them]. If the Islamic army approached the unbelievers land, he [would have to] face the Islamic army because he has become a soldier for the enemies of Allaah and is prepared. They might enlist and prepare him to fight the Muslims in their own lands, as has occurred in Afghanistan. They recruited Muslims to fight the Afghans and a fatwa (religious edict) was issued by some corrupt scholars stating it is allowed for [a Muslim] to fight the Muslims to confirm his nationality and his allegiance to America. This is the fatwaa of <strong>Al-Qardawi</strong>, who occupies a great status amongst Muslims due to this fatw?. All?h bless you, how many evil corrupt edicts there are! We ask All?h for protection and wellbeing!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Right now, measures are being taken in the West to achieve these goals: to recruit Muslims into Western societies. How can you go there in these circumstances? It is obligatory upon Muslims to migrate [back] to their lands when they hear of these actions and attempts to integrate and merge them into the Western societies.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that Wuhayb b. Al-Ward – Allâh have mercy on him – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, when Allâh the Exalted wants to honor a servant of His (for his righteousness), He afflicts him with a reduced means of living, illness in his body and a fearful life (all of which expiate his sins). Until death comes upon him, and he still has some sins, death is made hard upon him because of them, causing him to meet Allâh with no sins against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when a person is of little value to Allâh (because of his disobedience), He makes his body healthy, broadens his means of living and makes him feel safe (the rewards for any good deeds he did are exhausted). Until death comes upon him, and he still has some good deeds, the experience of death is lightened for him because of them, and he meets Allâh with nothing.</p>

A fatwa from Ibn Taymiyah on Why we should seek Laylatul-Qadr on all of the last ten nights of Ramadan. Translated by Owais al Hashimi hafidhahullaah</p>
<p>Read the PDf @ <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4RZz-y21qm_WkhZU3BscF93THc/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4RZz-y21qm_WkhZU3BscF93THc/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>When To Seek Out Laylatul-Qadr (The Night Of Decree)</strong><br />
Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah -rahimahullaah<br />
Translated by Aboo Talhah Daawood ibn Ronald Burbank rahimahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikhul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah -rahimahullaah- was asked about LaylatulQadr, whilst imprisoned in the mountain citadel (in Cairo) in the year 706 H. So he responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“All praise is for Allaah. Laylatul-Qadr is in the last ten (nights) of the month of Ramadaan. This is what is authentic from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) , that he said: &lt;&lt;<strong>It is within the last ten of Ramadaan</strong>&gt;&gt;, and it is within the odd nights from them [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However the odd nights may be counted with reference to what has already passed by, such that it should be sought on the night of the twenty first, the night of the twenty third, the night of the twenty fifth, the night of the twenty seventh, and the night of the twenty ninth; and they may otherwise be counted with reference to what remains, just as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>On the night when nine remain, on the night when seven remain, on the night when five remain, on the night when three remain</strong>.&gt;&gt; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based upon this, if the month is of thirty days, then that will be one of the even nights. So the twenty second will be (the night) when nine remain, the twenty fourth will be when seven remain; and this is how Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudree explained it in the authentic hadeeth; and this is how the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) established it in the month. If, however, the month is of twenty nine days, then counting in accordance with what remains will then be just the same as counting in accordance with what has passed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this being the case, it is befitting that the Believer seeks it out in all of the last ten, just as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &lt;&lt;<strong>Seek it out in the last ten</strong>.&gt;&gt; [3] And it occurs more frequently in the last seven; and it occurs most frequently on the twenty seventh, just as Ubayy ibn Ka`b used to swear an oath that it was the twenty seventh night. So it was said to him: “How have you come to know that?” So he replied: “On account of the sign which Allaah&#8221;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) informed us of. He informed us that the sun rises on the morning following it being like a brass dish, having no rays.” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sign which Ubayy ibn Ka`b reported from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is from the most well known signs occurring in hadeeth; and it is related regarding its signs that it is a night that is &#8220;bright, shining&#8221;; and it is calm; it is not very hot, nor very cold. It may occur that Allaah reveals it to some of the people in a dream, or whilst awake, such that he sees its light, or he sees one who says to him: &#8220;This is Laylatul-Qadr&#8221;; or he may open his heart to witnessing such things that make the affair clear to him, and Allaah -the Most High- knows best.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[&#8220;Majmoo`ul-Fataawaa&#8221;: (25/284-286).]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no.2016) and Muslim (no.1167/217) as a hadeeth of Aboo Sa`eed al-Khudree -radiyallaahu `anhu; and by al-Bukhaaree (no.2017) as a hadeeth of `Aa·ishah -radiyallaahu `anhaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narration of Muslim (no.1167/217) contains the addition that the narrator Abun-Nadrah said: &#8220;I said: &#8220;O Aboo Sa`eed! You know better about the numbers than us.&#8221; He said: &#8220;Indeed, we have more right to that than you.&#8221; He said: I said: &#8220;What is the ninth, the seventh, and the fifth?&#8221;He said: “When twenty one have passed, then that follows it is the twenty second:and it is the ninth; and when twenty three have passed, then that which follows it is the seventh; and when twenty five have passed, then that which follows it is the fifth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no.2021) as a hadeeth of `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas -radiyallaahu `anhumaa.<br />
[3] Reported by al-Bukhaaree (no.2020) and Muslim (no.1169) as a hadeeth of `Aa·ishah &#8211; radiyallaahu `anhaa.<br />
[4] Reported by Muslim (no.762).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that ‘Umar b. Al-Khattâb – Allâh be pleased with him – once addressed the people and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>No man can have anything better after faith (îmân) than a woman of righteous character, loving and child-bearing. And no man can have anything worse after unbelief (kufr) than a sharp-tongued woman of bad character.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Khâlid b. ‘Umayr Al-’Adawî reports, ‘Utbah b. Ghazwân – Allâh be pleased with him – once gave us a sermon. He praised Allâh, then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The life of this world has announced its departure and is quickly turning away, and nothing remains of it save the likes of the last drop of water in a vessel as its possessor tries to catch it. You are moving on to an abode that has no end, so move on with the best [deeds] that you have. For it has been said to us that a rock can be dropped from the edge of Hell and fall for seventy years without reaching the bottom. Yet, by Allâh, it will be filled. Do you not then wonder? And it has been said to us that a single entrance to Paradise is as wide as a journey of forty years, yet there will come a day when it will be crowded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have seen myself as the seventh of seven [followers of] Allâh’s Messenger – Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him; we had no food save the leaves of trees which put sores round our mouths. I once got a cloak which I tore in half to share with Sa’d b. Mâlik: I used half as my waist-wrap and he used the other. And yet today, there is not one of us except he has become a governor over some city – and I seek refuge with Allâh that I consider myself great and important when I am small in front of Allâh. Verily there was never prophet-hood except that it gradually changed until it ended up being a kingship, and verily you will see what the governors after us are like.</p>
<p><em>Sahîh Muslim</em> no. 7624</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that Ibrâhîm b. Adham (d162H) – Allâh have mercy on him – once passed through the market of Basrah. People gathered around him and asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Abû Ishâq, Allâh the Exalted says in his Book. ‘Call on me, I will answer your prayers’, but we have been calling on Him for a long time and He does not answer our prayers. [Ibrâhîm] replied, “O people of Basrah, your hearts have died in respect to ten things:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>First, you know Allâh but you do not give Him His rights;</li>
<li>Second, you have read Allâh’s Book but you do not act by it;</li>
<li>Third, you claim to love Allâh’s Messenger – Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him – yet you abandon his Sunnah;</li>
<li>Fourth, you claim to be enemies to Shaytân but you conform to [his ways];</li>
<li>Fifth, you say you love Paradise yet you do not work for it;</li>
<li>Sixth, you say you fear The Fire yet you put yourselves closer to it [by sinning];</li>
<li>Seventh, you say death is true but you do not prepare for it;</li>
<li>Eighth, you busy yourselves with the faults of others and disregard your own;</li>
<li>Ninth, you consume the favors of your Lord but are not grateful for them; and</li>
<li>Tenth, you bury your dead but take no lesson from them.”</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Bakr Al-Siddîq – Allâh be pleased with him – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will not leave anything Allâh’s Messenger – Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him – did, except that I will also do it; for I fear that if I were to leave any of his commands and ways I would deviate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhârî, <em>Al-Sahîh</em> 2:386 hadîth no. 3093; Ibn Battah, <em>Al-Ibânah</em> article 77, and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After recording this narration, Ibn Battah states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This, my brothers, is the greatest Siddîq (true believer i.e. Abû Bakr), fearing that he would fall into deviation if he were to leave any of the commandments of his Prophet – Allâh’s peace and blessings be upon him. What then is to happen in a time in which people deride their Prophet and his commandments, and compete with each other and show off in contradicting him and mock his Sunnah? We ask Allâh to protect us from slipping and to save us from evil deeds.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The enemy was never able to stand up to the Companions of Allâh’s Messenger – Allâh’s praise and peace be upon him, so when the news of the defeat of the Romans came to Heraclius at Antioch he asked [his people], “Woe to you, tell me about these people who fight you, are they not humans like you?” They replied, “Indeed, they are.” He asked, “So are you more in number or them?” They replied, “We outnumber them greatly in all places.” He said, “So how is it that you are defeated whenever you meet them [in battle].” A senior and esteemed elder amongst them replied, “Because they stand in prayer at night, fast during the day, fulfill their agreements and promises, enjoin what is right and forbid what is evil, they are fair and just amongst themselves; and because we drink wine, fornicate, commit sin, break our agreements, steal, oppress and do injustice, enjoin the committing of what angers Allâh and forbid what pleases Allâh the Mighty and Majestic, and we cause evil and corruption in the land.” Heraclius said, “You are the one who has told me the truth.”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise you to fear Allâh and obey Him (<em>taqwâ</em>) and I advise you to adhere to the Quran, for it is a light in the datk night and a guidance during the day, so implement it no matter how much struggle and poverty you have to face. If a calamity befalls you, put your wealth forward to protect your religion, and if the calamity continues, put forward your wealth and your life to save your religion [but never risk your religion], for the ruined is he whose religion is ruined, and the looted is he whose religion is taken. And know that there is no poverty after Paradise, and no riches after the Fire.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>‘Abdullah b. Mas’ûd – Allah be pleased with him – said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The believer sees his sins as if he is sitting at the foot of a mountain fearing that it might fall on him, while the sinner (fâjir) sees his sins as a fly that lands on his nose, he just waves it away. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al-Bukhârî, <em>Al-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">S</span>a<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span>î<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span></em>, <em>The Book of Supplications</em>, <em>Chapter on Tawbah</em>.</p>
<p>Ibn <span style="text-decoration:underline;">H</span>ajr quotes in his commentary, <em>Fat<span style="text-decoration:underline;">h</span> Al-Bârî</em>:Ibn Abî Jumrah said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The reason for this [fear] is that the heart of a believer is illuminated; so when he sees from himself something that goes against what he illuminates his heart with, it is very distressing to him. The wisdom behind giving the example of a mountain is that a person might find some way to escape from other dangers, but if a mountain falls on a person he does not survive. In short, the believer is dominated by fear (of Allah) due to the strength of îmân he has; he does not therefore feel falsely secure about being punished because of his sins. This is the way of the Muslim: he always fears and checks on himself, his good deeds are little to him and he fears even the small bad deeds he has done.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>It’s just a small sin</strong></span></p>
<p>Bilâl b. Sa’d – Allah have mercy on him – said:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color:#008000;">Do not think about how small the sin is, but think about who you have just disobeyed.</span></p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The likeness [of the munâfiq] is as the likeness of one who kindled a fire; then, when it lighted all around him, Allâh took away their light and left them in darkness. So they could not see. They are deaf, dumb and blind, so they return not [to the Right Path].</span> (Quran 2:17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qatâdah – Allâh’s mercy be upon him – said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the likeness Allâh has given of the Hypocrite (munâfiq); he says lâ ilâha illallâh and with it marries into the Muslims, inherits from the Muslims, fights alongside the Muslims, and protects his blood and wealth. But when death comes, [the testimony of faith] has no basis in his heart, and no reality in his actions, so the munâfiq is stripped of it at death and left in darkness and blindness wondering therein, just as he was blind about the right of Allâh and obedience to Him in his worldly life and deaf to the truth.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhârî reports that ‘Umar – Allâh be pleased with him – came to the Black Stone (performing tawâf, circumambulation), kissed it, and said, “I know that you are a stone, you do not cause benefit or harm; and if it were not that I had seen Allâh’s Messenger – peace and blessings of Allâh be upon him – kiss you, I would never have kissed you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhârî, <em>Al-Sahîh, </em>Chapter on what has been said about the Black Stone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Points to note</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· The illustrious Companion and Caliph ‘Umar reminded us in this narration of the pure belief that benefit and harm are not caused by created objects and thus should not be sought from them. Only Allâh has control over these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· We are reminded that acts of worship are taken from Allâh’s Messenger, and a person is not supposed to make up his own way of worship, he must follow the manner of worship that the Prophet taught and practiced.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· We also learn that once an action is confirmed in the Sunnah, the believer submits and complies and practices it because it is confirmed that Allâh’s Messenger did it, even if we don’t know the wisdom behind it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">· This narration is also an example of how a responsible person tries to clarify and do away with any misunderstandings that people may have about matters of faith. The people had recently left their unbelief and polytheism, so ‘Umar wanted to make it clear that kissing the Black Stone is by no means done as an act of devotion to it, as people used to do with their stone idols.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Compiled by <strong>Owais Al-Hâshimi</strong> (hafidhahullaah)</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Assassination of ‘Umar – Part 1</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Note: the English version of this account is based on <strong>Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan’s translation of <em>Sahîh Al-Bukhârî</em>,</strong> with slight modifications. The notes have been compiled from classic hadîth commentaries including <em>Fath Al-Bârî</em> of Ibn Hajr, as well as points from the lectures and classes of contemporary scholars.</span></p>
<p>Narrated ‘Amr b. Maimûn:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I saw ‘Umar b. Al-Khattâb a few days before he was stabbed in Al-Madînah. He was standing with Hudhayfah b. Al-Yamân and ‘Uthmân b. Hunaif to whom he said, “What have you done? Do you think that you have imposed more taxation on the land (of As-Swad i.e. ‘Iraq) than it can bear?” They replied, “We have imposed on it what it can bear because of its great yield.” ‘Umar again said, “Check whether you have imposed on the land what it cannot bear.” They said, “No, (we haven’t).” ‘Umar added, “If Allâh should keep me alive I will let the widows of ‘Irâq need no men to support them after me.” But only four days had elapsed when he was stabbed. The day he was stabbed, I was standing and there was nobody between me and him except Abdullah b. ‘Abbas. <span style="color:#008000;">Whenever Umar passed between rows, he would say, “Stand in straight lines.”</span> When he saw no defect (in the rows), he would go forward and start the prayer with Takbîr. He would recite Sûrah Yusuf or An-Nahl or the like in the first rak’ah so that people would have time to join the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The assassination of ‘Umar took place in 23H, following ‘Umar’s return from Hajj. He was assassinated by a Persian Majûsî (Fire Worshipper) called Abû Lu`-lu` Fayrauz, who was in the employment of Hudhayfah – Allâh be pleased with him. ‘Umar didn’t used to allow war captives to enter Al-Madînah, but Hudhayfah wrote to him requesting him to allow this worker to be hired for his skills in carpentry and metalwork. Hudhayfah believed people in Al-Medînah could benefit from his skills. Hudhayfah taxed this worker in the conventional manner, but he complained to ‘Umar about the amount. ‘Umar told him that he was not being taxed unfairly for what he was doing. This angered the Majûsî. One day, ‘Umar passed by the worker and enquired, “I have been told that you claim you can build a mill powered by wind (a windmill).” The Fire worshipper replied with a frown, “I will build you a mill that all the people will talk about.” ‘Umar turned to those who were with him and said, “The slave has given me an appointment [warning].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Points to note</strong></p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>‘Umar’s great concern for justice and fairness.</li>
<li>His concern that Muslim society should not be adversely influenced by unbelievers.</li>
<li>His concern and care for the wellbeing of the Muslims, especially the poor and the weak.</li>
<li>The attention given by him to the correct performance of al-salâh (prayer), and his implementation of the Sunnah of the imâm making sure the rows are straight and no gaps are left between the worshippers.</li>
<li>His assisting worshippers in getting the most out of their prayer.</li>
<li>His intelligence and insight, whereby he understood the disguised threat made to him.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Assassination of ‘Umar – Part 2</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As soon as he said Takbîr, I heard him say, “The dog has killed or eaten me,” when the murderer stabbed him. A non-Arab infidel came carrying a double-edged knife and stabbed everyone he passed by on the right and left, stabbing thirteen people out of whom seven died. When one of the Muslims saw that, he threw a cloak on him. Realizing that he had been captured, the non-Arab infidel killed himself. ‘Umar took the hand of ‘Abdur-Rahmân b. ‘Auf and let him lead the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who were standing by the side of ‘Umar saw what I saw, but the people who were in the other parts of the Mosque did not see anything, but they lost the voice of ‘Umar and they were saying, “Subhân Allâh! Subhân Allâh!” ‘Abdur-Rahmân b. ‘Auf led the people a short prayer. When they finished the prayer, ‘Umar said, “O Ibn ‘Abbâs! Find out who attacked me.” Ibn ‘Abbâs kept on looking here and there for a short time and then came back and said, “The slave of Al-Mughîrah.” At that, ‘Umar said, “The craftsman?” Ibn ‘Abbâs replied, “Yes.” ‘Umar said, “May Allah destroy him. I only treated him well. All praises are for Allâh who has not caused me to die at the hand of a man who claims to be a Muslim. No doubt, you and your father (Al-Abbâs) used to love to have more non-Arab infidels in Al-Madînah.” Al-Abbas had the greatest number of slaves. Ibn ‘Abbâs said to ‘Umar. “If you wish, we will do it.” He meant, “If you wish we will kill them.” ‘Umar said, “You are mistaken (for you cannot kill them) after they have spoken your language, prayed towards your Qiblah, and performed Hajj like yours.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Points to note</strong></p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Some narrations mention that the one who threw the cloak over the assassin was a person named Hattân Al-Tamîmî Al-Yarbû’î from the Muhâjirûn.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A narration from Ibn Shihâb describes how ‘Umar bled heavily and fainted. He was carried to his house, where he remained unconscious for a while. When he awoke and saw the people around him, the first thing he said was, “Have the people prayed?” When he was told that they had, he said, “There is no place in Islâm for those who leave the prayer.” He then performed ablution and prayed, with his wound bleeding heavily.</span> This, coupled with the fact the first thing ‘Umar did was appoint an imâm in his place, all goes to show the importance and status of the salâh, as well as the nobleness of ‘Umar.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">This narration also mentions that ‘Umar feared he had done some wrong to someone in the community, but when Ibn ‘Abbâs informed him it was the unbeliever who had stabbed him, and when Ibn ‘Abbâs saw everyone crying as if they had lost their own children, ‘Umar became relieved that this situation was not because of any injustice on his part. This shows the piety and taqwâ of ‘Umar.</li>
</ol>
<p>Continued inshâ Allâh.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from Abû Hurayrah – Allâh be pleased with him – that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Shall I not point you to comfortable proceeds? </span></strong><br />
<strong> <span style="color:#008000;">People responded, “And what is that o Abû Hurayrah?” </span></strong><br />
<strong> <span style="color:#008000;">He replied, “Fasting in winter.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabs used to refer to matters which were relatively easy to gain as being <em>cool</em>. In this narration, the relative ease of fasting in winter and its consequent reward is likened to acquiring war proceeds without the heat of violence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from ‘Umar – Allâh be pleased with him – that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Winter is booty for the devout worshippers.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is further explained in the following narration:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from ‘Ubayd b. ‘Umayr – Allâh have mercy on him – that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">It used to be said when winter came: O people of the Qur`ân, the night has become long so you can pray (more) and the day has become short for you to fast.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abû Nu’aym, <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">H</span>ilyah Al-Awliyâ`</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As with other experiences in this world, the Salaf used to be reminded of the hereafter when experiencing cold weather:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from the famous worshipper Râbi’ah – Allâh have mercy on her – that she said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">I have never heard the adhân except that I remember the caller who will announce the Day of Resurrection, and I never see the falling snow except that I imagine the flying pages of the records of peoples deeds (on that day), and I never see swarms of locusts except that I think about the Great Gathering on the Last Day.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">During his Caliphate, ‘Alî b. Abî Tâlib – Allah be pleased with him – saw some armor of his with a Christian. He decided to take the matter up legally, so he took the dispute to Shurayh (the Judge).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alî said, “This is my armor, and I have not sold it nor given it away.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shurayh said to the Christian, “What have you to say about what the Amîr of the Believers claims?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christian replied, “It is my armor, although I do not regard the Amîr of the Believers to be a liar.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shurayh then turned to ‘Alî, “O Amîr of the Believers, do you have any proof (of ownership)?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alî laughed and said, “Shurayh is correct, I have no proof.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Shurayh judged that the armor was the Christian’s.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Christian took it and began to walk away but then returned. He proclaimed,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"> “As for me, I testify that this is the judgment of the Prophets – the Amîr of the Believers himself takes me to his judge and the judge rules against him! I bear witness that there is no deity deserving worship but Allâh and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allâh. By Allâh, the armor is yours o Amîr of the Believers. I followed the army when you were on your way to the Battle of Siffîn and the armor came out of your equipment.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alî said, “If you have accepted Islâm the armor is yours.” And then he put him on his horse. Al-Sha’bî (the reporter of this incident) said, “I was later informed by those who saw this man that he fought the Khawârij (alongside ‘Alî) at the battle of Nahrawân.”</p>
<p>Ibn Kathîr, <strong><em>Al-Bidâyah wa Al-Nihâyah</em></strong> Vol.8 p5.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Uqbah b. ‘Âmir Al-Juhanî – Allâh be pleased with him – once passed by a man who looked like a Muslim, so he greeted him with salâm, and he replied, “And upon you [be peace] and the mercy of Allâh and His blessings.” A boy informed him, “He is a Christian!” So ‘Uqbah got up and followed the man, caught up with him and said, <span style="color:#008000;">“<em>The mercy of Allâh and His blessings are upon the believers; however, may Allâh give you a long life, and make plentiful your wealth and offspring</em>.”</span> [Al-Bukhârî, <em>Al-Adab Al-Mufrad]</em></p>
<p><strong>Shaykh Al-Albânî</strong> grades its chain of narration hasan in <strong><em>Sahîh Al-Adab Al-Mufrad</em></strong> p444, and notes,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In this narration this illustrious Companion indicates that it is permissible to supplicate for someone to have a long life, even if he is an unbeliever, and so [this can be done for] a Muslim <em>a fortiori</em>…However, <span style="text-decoration:underline;">the supplicant should make sure that the unbeliever is not an enemy of the Muslims</span>. It is also taken from this [narration] that such an unbeliever can be commiserated with what has been mentioned therein [i.e. the believers are the ones who will receive the mercy of Allâh and His blessings].”</p>
