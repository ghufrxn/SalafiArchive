<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Section Three: The Second Rule Regarding Shirk</strong></p>



<p><b>[</b><b>Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s “Four Rules Regarding Shirk”]</b></p>



<p><strong>The Second Rule:</strong> They (i.e. the disbelievers) said: “We did not invoke them nor turn towards them except to seek nearness (to Allah) and (their) intercession. The proof for their seeking nearness (to Allaah) is His saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">&nbsp;وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ إِنَّ اللَّهَ يَحْكُمُ بَيْنَهُمْ فِي مَا هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَهْدِي مَنْ هُوَ كَاذِبٌ كَفَّارٌ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And those who take protectors besides Him (say): ‘We don’t worship them except to bring us closer to Allaah.’ Verily Allaah will judge between them concerning that which they differ in. Verily, Allaah does not guide he who is a liar, a disbeliever.”</span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>



<p>The proof for their seeking intercession is Allaah’s saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنفَعُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ هَٰؤُلَاءِ شُفَعَاؤُنَا عِندَ اللَّهِ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And they worship besides Allaah things that harm them not nor benefit them. And they say: ‘These are our intercessors besides Allaah.’”</span> [Surah Yoonus: 18]</p>



<p>Intercession is of two types: Intercession that is negated and Intercession that is affirmed.</p>



<p>The Negated Intercession is that which is sought from someone other than Allaah in matters that no one has the ability to carry out except Allaah. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنفِقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لَّا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خُلَّةٌ وَلَا شَفَاعَةٌ ۗ وَالْكَافِرُونَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“O you who believe! Spend of that which We have provided for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining nor friendship nor intercession. And it is the disbelievers who are the wrong-doers.”</span> [Surah Al- Baqarah: 254]</p>



<p>The Affirmed Intercession is that which is sought from Allaah. The intercessor is one who is granted the honor of being able to intercede (by Allaah), while the one who is interceded for is the one whom Allaah is pleased with his statements and actions. (All of these occur) after Allaah’s permission is granted, as Allaah says:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">&nbsp;مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“Who is it that will intercede in His presence except with His permission.”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 255]</p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Listen to the Explanation of Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)</strong></span></p>



<figure class="wp-block-audio"><audio controls src="https://archive.org/download/saleh-as-saleh/They%20say%20We%20don%20t%20worship%20them%20except%20to%20bring%20us%20closer%20to%20Allaah.mp3"></audio></figure>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><strong>Source for the above Audio</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/11/06/explanation-of-the-four-rules-dr-saleh-as-saleh/">Explanation of The Four Rules (Al-Qawaa’id-ul-Arba’ah)</a> – Dr. Saleh as Saleh [Audio Series|En].&nbsp;Audio Series based on the explanation of Shaykh Uthaymeen&nbsp;<em>rahimahullah</em></p>



<p><span style="color: #993300"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color: #993300" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>



<p><strong>Language</strong>:</p>



<p><em><strong>Zulfaa</strong> </em>means closeness; <em><strong>Shufa’aaunaa</strong> </em>(our intercessors) is the plural of <em><strong>shaafi</strong></em>’ and <em><strong>shafee</strong></em>’, and he is the one that gets in between (two parties) in order to bring some benefit or to repel some harm; <em><strong>Khillah</strong> </em>(friendship) mutual love.</p>



<p><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>



<p>These disbelievers used as an argument for their supplicating and worshipping of other gods besides Allaah, the claim that they did not call unto them nor turn to them except for two reasons.</p>



<p><strong>First</strong>: So that these things (i.e. false gods) that they were worshipping could bring them nearer to Allaah. And Second: So that they may intercede for them before Allaah.</p>



<p>The proof for the first reason is Allaah’s saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">وَالَّذِينَ اتَّخَذُوا مِن دُونِهِ أَوْلِيَاءَ مَا نَعْبُدُهُمْ إِلَّا لِيُقَرِّبُونَا إِلَى اللَّهِ زُلْفَىٰ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And those who take protectors besides Him (say): ‘We don’t worship them except to bring us closer to Allaah.’”</span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>



<p>Meaning: We only supplicated to them and worshipped them so that they may serve as a means to gain nearness to Allaah and attain a high position with Him.</p>



<p>The proof for the second reason is Allaah’s saying:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">وَيَعْبُدُونَ مِن دُونِ اللَّهِ مَا لَا يَضُرُّهُمْ وَلَا يَنفَعُهُمْ وَيَقُولُونَ هَٰؤُلَاءِ شُفَعَاؤُنَا عِندَ اللَّهِ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And they worship besides Allaah things that harm them not nor benefit them. And they say: These are our intercessors besides Allaah.”</span> [Surah Yoonus: 18]</p>



<p>Meaning: We only worshipped them so that they may intercede for us before Allaah in bringing about some good or repelling some harm.</p>



<p>Then the Shaikh explains that Intercession is of two types in the Book of Allaah. The first is an intercession that the Qur’aan has negated, rejected and restricted that it be achieved. And the second type is the Affirmed Intercession, which the Qur’aan has affirmed will occur on the Day of Judgement, based on the clear evidences.</p>



<p>As for the Intercession that Allaah has negated in His Book, when He said:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا أَنفِقُوا مِمَّا رَزَقْنَاكُم مِّن قَبْلِ أَن يَأْتِيَ يَوْمٌ لَّا بَيْعٌ فِيهِ وَلَا خُلَّةٌ وَلَا شَفَاعَةٌ ۗ وَالْكَافِرُونَ هُمُ الظَّالِمُونَ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“O you who believe! Spend of that which We have provided for you, before a Day comes when there will be no bargaining nor friendship nor intercession”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 254]</p>



<p>then it is the Intercession that is sought from other than Allaah in matters that no one has control over except Allaah, such as a person who seeks entrance into Paradise from other than Allaah, for example, or to be saved from the Hellfire. What also falls into the Negated Intercession is the Intercession that is done for those whom Allaah did not permit that intercession be granted to, such as the disbelievers, or the Intercession from someone that Allaah did not allow to intercede. As for the Affirmed Intercession, then it is that which is sought from Allaah and which occurs with His permission. So the one who intercedes, Allaah has granted him the honor of interceding. As for the one who is interceded for, he is the one whom Allaah is pleased with his statements and actions, after He has given His permission for him to be interceded for.</p>



<p>This is as Allaah says:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">&nbsp;مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“Who is it that will intercede in His presence except with His permission.”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 255]</p>



<p>The true intercession, which is the affirmed one cannot occur unless two conditions are first met:</p>



<p><strong>First</strong>: Permission for the intercessor to intercede, as is stated in the previous ayah.</p>



<p><strong>Second</strong>: Allaah must be pleased with the one being interceded for. This is as is stated in Allaah’s statement:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000"> وَلَا يَشْفَعُونَ إِلَّا لِمَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ وَهُم مِّنْ خَشْيَتِهِ مُشْفِقُونَ</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“And they cannot intercede except for he whom Allaah is pleased with. And they stand in awe from fear of Allaah.”</span> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 28]</p>



<p>So due to this, all of the Intercession occurs by Allaah’s Permission and it is all in His Hand and Command, as Allaah says:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><span style="color: #000000">قُل لِّلَّهِ الشَّفَاعَةُ جَمِيعًا</span></h2>



<p><span style="color: #008000">“Say: To Allaah belongs all of the intercession.”</span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 44]</p>



<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>



<p>1. The disbelievers worshipped false gods besides Allaah seeking nearness (to Allaah) and intercession (from them) before Allaah.</p>



<p>2. Having good intention is not sufficient in the absence of following of the Sunnah.</p>



<p>3. Intercession is of two types: Affirmed and Negated.</p>



<p>4. The Conditions for Intercession are: (a) permission must be granted to the intercessor and (b) Allaah must be pleased with the one being interceded for.</p>



<p><strong>Examination:</strong></p>



<p>1. What is it that caused the disbelievers to worship other than Allaah? Provide evidence for your answer.</p>



<p>2. What are the types of Intercession? Give one proof for each type.</p>



<p>3. What are the conditions for the Affirmed Intercession?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Section Five: The Fourth Rule Regarding Shirk</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[</b><b>Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s “Four Rules Regarding Shirk”]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Rule:</strong> The polytheists in our era are more severe in their (committing of) Shirk than the first polytheists (during the Prophet’s time). This was since the first polytheists used to ascribe partners to Allaah at times of ease and worship Him sincerely during times of hardship. However, the polytheists in our era constantly commit Shirk in times of ease as well as in times of hardship. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَإِذَا رَكِبُوا فِي الْفُلْكِ دَعَوُا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ فَلَمَّا نَجَّاهُمْ إِلَى الْبَرِّ إِذَا هُمْ يُشْرِكُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allaah making their Faith purely for Him alone. But when He brings them safely to land, behold they give a share of their worship to others.”</span> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 65]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Language</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>Aghladh</strong> </em>(more severe) greater and stronger; <em><strong>Rakhaa</strong> </em>(times of ease) times of comfort and blessing; <em><strong>Shiddah</strong> </em>(hardship) difficulty and times when tribulations befall.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Explanation</span></strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the fourth and last rule, which is that the polytheists in our time, those who devote a share of their worship to other than Allaah, such as the righteous people that are buried in graves and so on. These people are greater in Shirk and stronger in disbelief than the first polytheists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for this is because the first polytheists would ascribe partners to Allaah during times of ease only, and as for times of hardness and difficulty, they would call sincerely out to Allaah (for help) and they knew that no one else could save them and that their (false) gods would not benefit them. What indicates this is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَإِذَا رَكِبُوا فِي الْفُلْكِ دَعَوُا اللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ فَلَمَّا نَجَّاهُمْ إِلَى الْبَرِّ إِذَا هُمْ يُشْرِكُونَ</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allaah making their Faith purely for Him alone. But when He brings them safely to land, behold they give a share of their worship to others.”</span> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also Allaah’s saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ مَن يُنَجِّيكُم مِّن ظُلُمَاتِ الْبَرِّ وَالْبَحْرِ تَدْعُونَهُ تَضَرُّعًا وَخُفْيَةً لَّئِنْ أَنجَانَا مِنْ هَٰذِهِ لَنَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الشَّاكِرِينَ </span></strong><strong><span style="color:#000000;">قُلِ اللَّهُ يُنَجِّيكُم مِّنْهَا وَمِن كُلِّ كَرْبٍ ثُمَّ أَنتُمْ تُشْرِكُونَ</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say: Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and sea (when) you call upon Him in humility and in secret (saying): ‘If He only saves us from this (danger), we will truly be grateful.’ Say: Allaah rescues you from this and from all other distresses, but yet you worship others besides Allaah.”</span> [Surah Al- An’aam: 63-64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these <em>ayaat</em> (verses) indicate that they would mix partners in their worship with Allaah during times of ease only. But as for times of hardship then they wouldn’t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for those who commit Shirk in our time, then they indeed mix partners in Allaah’s worship in both these conditions. If some blessing and comfort befalls them, they rush to the graves, presenting them with sacrificial offerings and slaughtering animals at their sites. And they put forth thanks to the deceased buried within them and glorify them with praises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if some calamity befalls them, they rush to these graves and seek help from them, supplicating to them and making oaths to them for such and such if this calamity is removed from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>We see this clearly going on at the graves that are worshipped besides Allaah, such as the grave sites of Husayn, Sayyidah Zaynab, ‘Abdul-Qaadir al-Jeelaani, Sayyid Al- Badawee and others.</strong> So it is clear that the Shirk that is committed by these latter-day polytheists is greater and worse than the Shirk that was done by the polytheists of old because it is a Shirk that is done constantly under every condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this completes the objective of this treatise, thus all praise is due to Allaah, Lord of the Worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Summary</span></strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The polytheists of old used to mix partners in Allaah’s worship during times of ease and turn to Him in sincere worship during times of hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The polytheists of this era mix partners in Allaah’s worship in both conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The polytheists in our time are greater in their Shirk than the first polytheists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Examination</span></strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is the difference between the polytheists in our time and the polytheists of old times?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Which of the two is greater in their Shirk: the polytheists of old or the polytheists of our time?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. What is the proof that the polytheists of old would commit Shirk during times of ease and not during times of hardship?</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Section Four: The Third Rule Regarding Shirk</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[</b><b>Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s “Four Rules Regarding Shirk”]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Third Rule:</span> </strong>The Prophet was sent to people that differed from one another in their worship. Among them were those who worshipped the angels. And among them were those who worshipped the prophets and righteous people. And among them were those who worshipped trees and stones. And among them were those who worshipped the sun and the moon. However, the Messenger of Allaah fought against (all of) them and did not differentiate between any of them. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And fight against them until there is no more fitnah (trial, i.e. Shirk) and the Religion is all purely for Allaah alone.”</span> [Surah Al-Anfaal: 39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof of them worshipping the sun and the moon is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And among His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah who created them, if it is truly He whom you worship.”</span> [Surah Fussilat: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that they worshipped the angels is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And nor did he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords (besides Allaah).”</span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that they worshipped the prophets is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when Allaah will say: ‘O ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam! Did you tell the people: Take me and my mother as gods besides Allaah?’ He will say: ‘Glory be to You, it is not for me to say what I have no right to say. Had I said such a thing, You would have surely known it. You know what is in my inner self yet I do not know what is in Your self. Verily, You re the All-Knower of the Unseen.’”</span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that they worshipped the righteous people is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Those whom they call unto (besides Allaah), they themselves seek the means of access to their Lord as to which of them will be the nearest (to Him). And they hope for His Mercy and fear His Torment.”</span> [Surah Al-Israa: 57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that they worshipped trees and stones is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> “Have you then considered Al-Laat and Al-‘Uzzaa, and Manaat, the third other?”</span> [Surah An-Najm: 19-20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Translator’s Note: These three are names of stone idols that the pagan Arabs used to worship. They were originally righteous men who after their deaths and after many generations began to be worshipped.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also the hadeeth of Abu Waaqid Al-Laythee (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">“We went out with Allaah’s Messenger to (the Battle of) Hunayn, and we had just recently come out of Kufr (Disbelief). The polytheists used to have a lote-tree, which they would organize by and hang their swords on (seeking blessings from it); it was called Dhaat Anwaat. So we passed by a lote-tree and said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah! Make for us a Dhaat Anwaat, just as they have a Dhaat Anwaat?’”</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Language:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fitnah (tribulation) here means Shirk; ‘<em><strong>alaamaat</strong> </em>(signs) proofs and indicators; <em><strong>yabtaghoon</strong> </em>(they seek) they look for; <em><strong>hudathaa ‘ahdin</strong> </em>(recently come out) close to that time; <em><strong>sidrah</strong> </em>(lote-tree); <em><strong>yanootoon</strong> </em>(hang on) cling onto.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was indeed sent to a people who varied in their worship and differed in their religions. Among them were those that worshipped angels and (those that worshipped) prophets and righteous people, and those that worshipped trees and stones or the sun and the moon. So Allaah legislated for His Prophet to fight against them. Rather, He commanded him to do that without differentiating between any of them. He commanded him to fight against every one of them until all of the Religion (i.e. worship) became solely for Allaah and until islaam gained supremacy over all other religions. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And fight against them until there is no more fitnah (i.e. Shirk) and the Religion is all purely for Allaah.”</span> [Surah Al-Anfaal: 39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) fought against all of them until he brought them under the rule and laws of Islaam. From the texts that provide evidence that there existed those who worshipped the sun and the moon and that Allaah forbade them from doing that is His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And among His signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon. Do not prostrate to the sun or the moon, but rather prostrate to Allaah who created them, if it is truly He whom you worship.”</span> [Surah Fussilat: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the evidences that indicate that there existed those who used to worship the angels, and that Allaah forbade them from doing that, is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And nor did he order you to take the angels and prophets as lords (besides Allaah).”</span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from what makes it clear that there existed those who would worship the prophets and that this worship of theirs was false is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when Allaah will say: ‘O ‘Eesaa, son of Maryam! Did you tell the people: Take me and my mother as gods besides Allaah?’ He will say: ‘Glory be to You.”</span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ‘Eesaa, peace be on him, will free himself from their worshipping of him and rule upon its falsehood. And from the proofs that show that there existed those who would worship the righteous people and the ruling that this is futile, is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Those whom they call unto (besides Allaah), they themselves seek the means of access to their Lord as to which of them will be the nearest (to Him). And they hope for His Mercy and fear His Torment.”</span> [Surah Al-Israa: 57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the scholars of Tafseer said: There was a group amongst the Arabs that used to worship some individuals amongst the Jinn. Afterward, these Jinn accepted Islaam, but those people who worshipped them did not know this. So Allaah explains to them that those people whom you worship, they themselves seek nearness to Allaah, hoping for His reward and fearing His punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from that which indicates that there existed those who would worship the stones is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Have you then considered Al-Laat and Al-‘Uzzaa, and Manaat, the third other?”</span> [Surah An-Najm: 19-20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These were (false) gods that the polytheists of Makkah used to worship. They were statues that they had constructed and worshipped besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from that which indicates that there existed those who would worship trees is the hadeeth of Abu Waaqid Al-Laythee (radyAllaah ‘anhu) when some of the Companions went out with the Prophet during the battle of Hunayn. And among them were those who had just recently come out of disbelief, i.e. they had only become Muslims a little while before. So they saw a lote-tree that belonged to the polytheists, known as Dhaat Anwaat, which the polytheists would seek blessings from and hang their swords on. So they asked the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) to make for them a Dhaat Anwaat tree just like theirs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this the Prophet said Allaahu Akbar, became very angry and was stern in his speech, forbidding them from this. He said to them: <span style="color:#808000;">“You have just said, by the One in whose hand my soul is, similar to what the companions of Moosaa said to him: ‘Make for us a god just as they have gods.’ He replied: ‘Verily you are a people given into ignorance.’”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Ahmad (5/218), ‘Abdur-Razzaaq (20763), At-Tayaalisee (1346), Al-Humaydee (848), At- Tirmidhee (2180) who said of it: “hasan saheeh” and others.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this hadeeth proves that there existed those polytheists who would worship trees. It also proves that believing in trees (i.e. that they have the ability to bring good or repel harm) amounts to disbelief. It also proves that even the noble and scholarly amongst people may fall into Shirk, while not being aware of it. It also proves that if a person utters a statement of disbelief while not knowing that it amounts to disbelief or intentionally doing it, he does not commit disbelief until he is fully aware (of what he is saying).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has declared all of these different types of worship false and futile. And He commanded His Messenger to fight against all of these people without differentiating between any of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Summary:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) was sent to various people with different religions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) fought against all of these people without differentiating between any of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. A Muslim does not commit disbelief by making a statement of disbelief if he says it unknowingly and unintentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The truth may be unknown at times to the high ranking amongst people, not to mention the common folk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Examination:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. State some of the types of worship that existed at the time of the Prophet’s advent, giving one proof for each type.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Did the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) distinguish between the adherents of these various religions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. What points of benefit can we derive from the hadeeth mentioned in this chapter?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Rule:</strong> You must know that the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allaah fought against agreed that Allaah was the Creator and the Administrator. But this (belief) did not cause them to enter into the fold of Islaam. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ مَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَمَّن يَمْلِكُ السَّمْعَ وَالْأَبْصَارَ وَمَن يُخْرِجُ الْحَيَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَيِّ وَمَن يُدَبِّرُ الْأَمْرَ ۚ فَسَيَقُولُونَ اللَّهُ ۚ فَقُلْ أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say: ‘Who provides for you from the sky and the earth, or who owns the hearing and the sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who administers the affairs?’ They will surely say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘Will you then not be dutiful to Him?’”</span> [Surah Yoonus: 31]</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Language:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Muqirroon</em> </strong>(agreed) means they acknowledged; <em><strong>Al-Mudabbir</strong> </em>(Administrator) The One who disposes of all affairs; <em><strong>tattaqoon</strong> </em>(dutiful) means putting a shield and a barrier between yourselves and what you fear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explanation</strong><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of these rules is: Knowing that the polytheists during the time of Allaah’s Messenger, from the disbelievers of Makkah and others, affirmed and acknowledged Allaah’s Lordship (<em>Ruboobiyyah</em>), which is to single Allaah out and make Him one with regard to His creating, administering and controlling of the universe. They did not ascribe partners to Him in these aspects. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <span style="color:#008000;">“Say: ‘Who provides for you from the sky and the earth, or who owns the hearing and the sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who administers the affairs?’ They will surely say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘Will you then not be dutiful to Him?’”</span> [Surah Yoonus: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also His saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ۚ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And if you ask them: ‘Who created the heavens and the earth (?)’, they will certainly say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘All praise be to Allaah.’ But most of them know not.”</span> [Surah Luqmaan: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>ayaat</em> that provide evidence for this are many. All of them make it clear that the polytheists acknowledged that Allaah alone was the only Creator, Provider and Administrator of all affairs. However, they ascribed and mixed partners with Him in worship, so this acknowledgement was of no benefit to them. And this did not cause them to enter into the fold of Islaam nor did it make their lives and wealth sacred (i.e. unlawful to be violated). Rather, the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) fought against them and made lawful (the taking of) their lives and their wealth because of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were <strong>not</strong> judged as being Muslims simply because they acknowledged and agreed to Allaah’s Lordship. Rather he (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) made their abiding by T<em>awheed Al-Uloohiyyah</em> (i.e. that worship is only for Allaah), acknowledging it and acting upon it as a condition for judging them as Muslims, withholding from causing harm to them, and sparing their lives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Summary<span style="color:#993300;">:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The polytheists during the time of Allaah’s Messenger used to affirm and acknowledge Allaah’s Lordship (i.e. that He was the sole Creator and Administrator)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Acknowledging that Allaah is the one and only Lord (i.e. <em>Ruboobiyyah</em>) is not sufficient to affirm that an individual be judged as a Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examination</strong><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What was the stance the polytheists during the time of the Prophet took with regard to Allaah’s Lordship? Bring three ayaat that prove what you say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. What was the stance Allaah’s Messenger took with regard to these polytheists during his time?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Is acknowledging that Allaah is the sole Creator and Administrator (<em>Ruboobiyyah</em>) enough to affirm that someone is Muslim? Provide evidence for your answer.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Language</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>yatawallaaka</em> (He befriend you) meaning that He take you as a friend (<em>walee</em>) through (His) love, granting of success and guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explanation</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author has begun by supplicating and asking Allaah, the Most Generous, Lord of the Great Throne, to befriend the one who reads this book in this world and the Hereafter. As for befriending him in this worldly life, then it is by loving him, guiding him, directing him and assisting him. And as for befriending him in the Hereafter, then it is by showing him mercy and forgiveness, protecting him from the Hellfire and admitting him into Paradise. Then he also supplicates that he be blessed wherever he may be, and that Allaah make him fulfill the meaning of servitude, as well as its stations, which are three:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>First: Being thankful for His Blessing</strong></span>. This is at the time when He gives it, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Work you, O family of Dawood, with thanks!”</span> [Surah Saba: 13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And if you are grateful, He will be pleased therewith for you.”</span> [Surah Az-Zumar:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And give thanks to Me and do not disbelieve.”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 152]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Being thankful for Allaah’s Blessing is shown through the heart by way of affirming, acknowledging and showing gratitude. And it is shown through the tongue by way of speaking about the blessing and praising it. And it is shown through the limbs by way of acting in accordance with what pleases Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Second: Being patient during tribulations</span>,</strong> hard times and with the things that one hates, which befall the people as a test and examination from Allaah. What is obligatory in these situations is that one have patience. Patience means suppressing the heart from being displeased and from despairing; suppressing the tongue from complaining; and suppressing the limbs from those acts that negate and contradict patience. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And bear with patience whatever befalls you.”</span> [Surah Luqmaan: 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And give glad tidings to those who are patient.”</span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Third: Seeking forgiveness after committing a sin</strong></span>. This is since all of the Son of Aadam (i.e. humans) are sinners. But what is obligatory upon mankind when they should fall into sin is to rush to ask for forgiveness and repentance, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And those who when they commit some immoral act (i.e. fornication) or wrong themselves with evil, remember Allaah and so seek (His) forgiveness for their sins. And who is it that forgives sins except Allaah? And they do not persist knowingly in what sins they committed (after that).”</span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 135]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the three characteristics: Being thankful for (Allaah’s) Blessing, being patient during times of tribulation, and seeking forgiveness after committing a sin. Whoever fulfills all of these will no doubt be from those who will experience happiness. In fact, happiness is linked to these three characteristics more than any others. All of them contain the meanings of Tawheed, submission, compliance and acceptance from Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">[</b><b style="color:#993300;">Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s &#8220;Four Rules Regarding Shirk&#8221;]</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, may Allaah grant you the ability to obey Him, that the <em>Haneefiyyah</em>, the religion of Ibraaheem is that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>you worship Allaah alone, making the Religion sincere for only Him</strong></span>, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</strong><br />
</span>[Surah Adh-Dhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you come to realize that Allaah created you in order to worship Him, then know that worship is not called worship unless it is accompanied by Tawheed, just as prayer is not called that unless it is accompanied by (ritual) purity. So if Shirk (mixing partners) enters into one’s worship, it ruins it, just like impurity when it enters into the (ritual) purity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you come to realize that Shirk – when mixed into one’s worship – spoils it, invalidates one’s actions, and makes the person who possesses it into one who will reside eternally in the Hellfire, you will know that the most important thing that is binding upon you is to gain knowledge of that, so that perhaps Allaah may absolve you from this trap, which is ascribing partners to Allaah (i.e. Shirk) about which Allaah said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him in worship, but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This can be achieved by knowing <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/islamic-book-study/the-four-rules-regarding-shirk-al-qawaaid-ul-arbaah/"><strong>Four Rules</strong></a> that Allaah has mentioned in His Book.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Language</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Haneefiyyah</em> comes from <em>Haneef</em>, which is someone that turns away from Shirk while being firmly established upon Tawheed; <em>ahbata</em> (invalidates) nullifies; <em>maa doona dhaalik</em> (what is less than that) i.e. what is less than Shirk such as sins and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, began by clarifying the foundation of <em>AlHaneefiyyah</em>, which is the upright religion of Ibraaheem. Its basis is found in what Allaah has stated, calling the people to follow Ibraaheem:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِينًا مِّمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ وَاتَّبَعَ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face </strong>(i.e. himself)<strong> to Allaah, while being a good-doer, and follows the Religion of Ibraaheem as a Haneef </strong>(i.e. rejecting Shirk and affirming Tawheed)<strong>?”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">قُلْ إِنَّنِي هَدَانِي رَبِّي إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ دِينًا قِيَمًا مِّلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا ۚ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say </strong>(O Muhammad)<strong>: ‘Truly my Lord has guided me to a Straight Path, and upright religion, the religion of Ibraaheem – Haneef – and he </strong>(i.e. Ibraaheem)<strong> was not from the polytheists.’”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 161]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So its foundation is: Singling Allaah out in the worship and sincerity that is due to Him, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</strong></span><br />
[Surah AdhDhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah did not create mankind except for them to worship Him. And it is not truthful to call worship by this name unless Tawheed accompanies it, since one of the conditions for its validity is that it (i.e. worship) must be done sincerely for Him alone. Similarly, it is not truthful to call prayer by this name unless (ritual) purity accompanies it, since it is a condition for its existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if this is not so, then if a condition is absent this means that the thing that requires this condition will also be absent. Shirk entering and mixing into worship spoils and nullifies it, just as an impure occurrence (hadath) causes the (ritual) purity to be spoiled and nullified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when it becomes clear that Shirk spoils the worship once it mixes into it, causing its reward to be lost and it to return rejected to the one that performed it, as well as canceling out his deeds, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Had you committed Shirk, we would have surely cancelled out your deeds and you would have indeed been one of the losers”</strong></span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and that the one who falls into this Shirk by committing it deserves eternity in the Hellfire, as Allaah says in His Book:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And those who disbelieve and reject Our signs </strong>(i.e. verses)<strong>, they are the inhabitants of the Hellfire, wherein they will reside forever – what an evil destination”</strong></span> [Surah At-Taghaabun: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then at this point it will become clear that the most important thing that is obligated on the servant is that he know how to single Allaah out solely for worship and how to avoid Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, perhaps he may be set free from this satanic trap, which the Devil has set up in order to mislead the people away from their Lord and into committing Shirk with Allaah. This is the sin that Allaah does not forgive, as He says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him in worship </strong>(i.e. Shirk)<strong>, but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this cannot be accomplished unless one knows the following four rules, which Allaah has mentioned in His Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Summary:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The foundation of the Religion of Ibraaheem is to make one’s worship sincerely for Allaah alone and not mix partners into His worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Shirk spoils one’s worship and causes a person’s good deeds to be invalidated. And the person that commits it will reside eternally in the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The most important thing that the servant (of Allaah) is obligated to learn is knowledge of Tawheed so that he may act on it, and knowledge of Shirk so that he may avoid it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Examination:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is the foundation of the Religion of Ibraaheem and what is the proof for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Explain the effect that Shirk has on worship and what it resembles. Give an example for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. What is the most important thing the servant (of Allaah) is obligated to learn and know?</p>
