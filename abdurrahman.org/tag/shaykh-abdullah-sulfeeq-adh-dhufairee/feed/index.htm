										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Third: Humbling Oneself before Allaah and Asking Him for Success and Prosperity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also ask his Lord to increase him in seeking knowledge, since an individual is destitute and in the utmost need of Allaah. This is why Allaah has encouraged His servants to ask of Him and to lower themselves before Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Call unto Me, I will respond to you.”</strong></span> [Surah Ghaafir: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Our Lord descends every night to the lowest level of heaven and says: ‘Who is calling Me that I may respond? Who asks of Me that I may give him? Who seeks My forgiveness that I may forgive him?’”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah commanded His Prophet to ask Him for an increase in knowledge, as He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدْنِي عِلْمًا<br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">“And say: ‘My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.’”</span></strong> [Surah TaHa: 114]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said speaking on behalf of Ibraaheem:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">رَبِّ هَبْ لِي حُكْمًا وَأَلْحِقْنِي بِالصَّالِحِينَ<br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">“My Lord! Bestow Hukm (i.e. knowledge) on me, and join me with the righteous.”</span></strong><br />
[Surah Ash-Shua’raa: 83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Hukm refers to knowledge, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “If the Haakim (judge), strives hard performing Ijtihaad…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم supplicated for Abu Hurairah radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu to be granted the ability to memorize. He صلى الله عليه وسلم also supplicated for Ibn ‘Abbaas to be granted knowledge, as he said: <strong>“O Allaah, give him understanding of the Religion, and teach him the ta’weel (interpretation of the Qur’aan).”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah answered His Prophet’s supplication, such that afterward Abu Hurairah radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu didn’t hear anything except that he memorized it and Ibn ‘Abbaas radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu came to be the scholar of the ummah and the interpreter of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars have continued to carry on this practice, thus lowering themselves before Allaah and asking Him to grant them knowledge. Look at the example of Shaikh-ul- Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him – He would go to the masaajid, prostrate to Allaah and supplicate to Him, saying: <strong>“O teacher of Ibraaheem, teach me! O educator of Sulaymaan, grant me understanding!”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah answered his supplication, such that Ibn Daqeeq-ul-‘Eid said about him: <strong>“Allaah gathered the knowledge for him to the point that it was as if it (i.e. the knowledge) was between his eyes and he would take what he wished from it and leave off what he wished from it.”</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth: An Upright Heart</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The heart is the container where knowledge is stored. If the container is firm, it will store and protect what is placed in it, and if the container is damaged, it will lose what is placed in it.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم)&nbsp;made the heart the foundation of everything, as he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, there is a morsel of flesh in the body that if it is correct, the entire body will be correct, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupt. Indeed, it is the heart.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An upright heart comes about through <strong>awareness of Allaah and knowledge of His Names, Attributes and Actions</strong>. It also comes about by way of <strong>reflecting on His signs and creations</strong>, and by <strong>pondering on the Qur&#8217;aan</strong>. An upright heart also comes about due to one constantly <strong>prostrating (in prayer)</strong> and frequently observing the <strong>night prayer</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also avoid the things that corrupt and sicken the heart, since if these things are present in the heart, it will not be able to carry the knowledge. And even if the heart does carry it, it will not be understood, as Allaah says about the hypocrites &#8211; those with diseased hearts:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">They have heart with which they do not comprehend.</span>&#8221; [Surah Al-Araaf: 179]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The diseases of the heart are of two types: <strong>Desires</strong> and <strong>Doubts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Desires are such as love for this worldly life and its pleasures and being preoccupied with that; love for unlawful images; listening to unlawful things such as musical voices and instruments; and looking at the forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doubts are such as corrupt beliefs; innovated actions; and ascribing to innovated ideological movements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some other diseases of the heart that also serve as obstacles before knowledge are: jealousy, spite and pride.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some other things that corrupt the heart are: excessive sleep, excessive speech and excessive eating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, one should avoid these diseases and corruptors in order to rectify the heart and make it upright.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: &#8216;Abdullaah bin Salfeeq Adh-Dhufairee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of a small booklet entitled: <b><i>“Ar-Rakaa’iz-ul-‘Ashar Lit-Tahseel-il-‘Ilmee”</i></b><i></i> (Ten Guidelines for Obtaining Knowledge) printed by Daar-ul-Minhaaj, 1st Edition, 2003.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this short treatise, the author ‘Abdullaah bin Salfeeq Adh-Dhufairee, presents concise advice to the seekers of knowledge in the format of ten simple guidelines. These guidelines cover characteristics and etiquettes that a student of knowledge should adorn himself with in order to obtain knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The treatise has been introduced and praised by Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee, one of the elder scholars in Saudi Arabia, thus indicating its importance and benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book:</b><br />
&#8220;The greatest form of dutifulness (Taqwaa) to Allaah is making one’s intention purely for the sake of Allaah. As for the one who seeks knowledge for the sake of showing off, then apart from being a loser in this world, he will also be punished for this in the Hereafter as has been reported in the hadeeth about the three people who will be dragged on their faces into Hell, amongst whom will be a man who sought knowledge so that it could be said: <b>&#8216;He is a scholar&#8217;</b> and such was said about him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;An upright heart comes about through awareness of Allaah and knowledge of His Names, Attributes and Actions. It also comes about by way of reflecting on His signs and creations, and by pondering on the Qur’aan. An upright heart also comes about due to one constantly prostrating (in prayer) and frequently observing the night prayer.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;One of the ways that help in motivating a person to seek knowledge is: Reading the biographies of the scholars, as well as their patience and endurance in the face of trials. This also includes reading about the journeys they undertook for the sake of acquiring knowledge and obtaining Hadeeth.&#8221;</p>
