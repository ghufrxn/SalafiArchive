										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><b>1315H–1389H: Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad Al-Qar’aawee</b></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">Author: Fawaaz bin ‘Alee Al-Madkhalee</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Source: His compilation “Tareeq-ul-Wusool ilaa Eedaah ath-Thalaathat-il-Usool. </span><span style="color:#999999;">Produced By:  <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/al-ibaanah-com/">Al-Ibaanah.com</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was <strong>Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad bin Hamad bin Muhammad Al-Qar’aawee</strong> [2] An-Najdee from the district of Qaseem in Najd. He played a great role in Calling to Allaah and spreading the authentic creed, particularly in the southern regions of Saudi Arabia, where this (Salafee) Da’wah thrived and prospered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, may Allaah have mercy on him, was born in Dhul-Hijjah of 1315H in the <strong>city of ‘Unayzah</strong>. His father passed away two months prior to his birth, so he was raised an orphan under the care and auspices of his mother and paternal uncle. He was brought up learning the basic elementary studies, uprightness, purification and memorization of the Qur’aan. During the first part of his life, he occupied himself with conducting business, but he changed to seeking knowledge. He traveled to India twice and then moved throughout the cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia seeking knowledge. So he traveled from Buraydah to Makkah and then to Madeenah, Riyadh, Ihsaa and Qatar. In fact, he even transcended beyond the Arabian Peninsula, visiting Iraq, Egypt and Syria.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterward, he commenced his Call to reformation, turning his attention to the southern region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He settled in <strong>Saamitah</strong> and made it the center for his Da’wah. So he began calling the people to have Taqwaa of Allaah and to adhere to the beliefs of the pious predecessors (Salaf as-Saalih), with wisdom and fair admonition. Many students would gather around him, and so he would have a large following of people who came to him seeking knowledge. So he held gatherings, teaching them the Qur’aan, Tafseer, Tajweed, Tawheed, Hadeeth, Fiqh, Laws of Inheritance, and some of the sciences of the Arabic language. [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he focused on some of the neighboring towns of Saamitah and opened various educational institutes, appointing some of his main students as teachers in them – students the likes of <strong>Shaikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>)</strong>, about whom he said: “<span style="color:#008000;">He is one of my students, however he has surpassed me in knowledge by far</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would supply these schools with everything that students stood in need of, such as books, notepads and so on, purchasing that with his personal donations. He would also go out in person to visit the neighboring villages on certain days to the point that the people turned towards seeking knowledge under him. The Shaikh’s schools spread out from the district of Tuhaamah to the district of ‘Aseer. He opened many schools and institutes within these regions and appointed his major students to teach in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the main objectives of his Da’wah were to rectify the Creed in the people’s souls, to cultivate the true Islaam into the hearts of the Muslim youth and to guide them to the correct path. Prior to his arrival, the community was living upon ignorance and false notions. So the Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, produced students that were strong in their Creed to guide the people and call them to Allaah. So his efforts were crowned with success and many of the people began to perform the obligations at their proper times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the last part of his life, he was afflicted with a painful sickness, as a result of which he was forced to move to Riyadh where he was admitted into its central hospital. On Tuesday, the 8th of Jumaadaal-Oolaa, 1389H, the Shaikh passed away, having reached around 73 years of age – a lifetime which he spent serving knowledge, seeking it and spreading it to the people. He, may Allaah have mercy on him, is regarded today as one of the Imaams of the Islamic Da’wah of the 14th Hijree Century, particularly in the districts of Tuhaamah and ‘Aseer, which serve as the birthplace of his Da’wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For more about Imaam Al-Qar’aawee, refer to the book <strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Shaikh Haafidh bin Ahmad Al-Hakamee – His Life and Effects”</span> </strong>(pg. 31-35) written by our sheikh, Zayd bin Muhammad Al-Madkhalee, rahimahullaah, and the book <strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Al-Qar’aawee and his Da’wah in the South of the Kingdom”</span></strong> (pg. 12) by As-Sahlee.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>Translator’s Note: </b>This book was compiled by Fawaaz al-Madkhalee from classes Shaikh Zayd Al-Madkhalee (rahimahullaah) gave on the explanation of the famous book “The Three Fundamental Principles” in the First Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad Al-Qar’aawee Educational Seminar, which was held in 1415H in the district of Jaazaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <b>Translator’s Note: </b><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Qar’aawee</strong> was the nickname of his grandfather, which was an ascription to a town he lived in called al-Qar’aa, within the confines of the city of Buraydah</span>. See <i>Fatawaa al-Jaliyyah</i>, footnote 3 on (pg. 5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Al-Qar’aawee served as one of the carriers of the Sunnah and one of the callers to it during that time period. He studied under the noble scholars of his region of Najd and elsewhere. He longed to be one of the callers to Allaah and to be one of those who would revive His Religion, aiding the truth, and guiding the people from deviation to the truth and from Shirk to Tawheed. He yearned to be from those who would warn the people against the evils that are the cause for Allaah’s Anger. So Allaah willed for him to be from those who called to his Path in the southern region of Saudi Arabia. This was due the suggestion of his teacher at that time, the former Muftee of Saudi Arabia, <strong>Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem (<i>rahimahullaah</i>)</strong>, to go there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This happened after Shaikh Al-Qar’aawee confided in him a dream he had in which he saw himself go down to the southern regions of Saudi Arabia. So he set out for the south and ended up in Jaazaan in the year 1358H. Thereafter, he advanced to the city of Saamitah, and Allaah benefited the people of these lands through him. So the people of the south learned the Book and the Sunnah from him and they began to understand the Religion of Allaah at his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he first came to Saamitah, he opened the first Madrasah Salafiyyah (Salafee School) there in Sha’baan 1358H, and began teaching in it shortly thereafter. The school was opened in the house of Shaikh Naasir bin Khaloofah, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>At the head of his students, were:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shaikh Haafidh bin Ahmad al-Hakamee,</li>
<li>Shaikh Ahmad bin Yahyaa An-Najmee,</li>
<li>Shaikh ‘Umar Jardee Al-Madkhalee,</li>
<li>Shaikh Muhammad bin Ahmad Al-Hakamee, and</li>
<li>other scholars, at whose hands Allaah raised the Sunnah and subdued innovation.</li>
</ul>
<p>[This excerpt is from footnote 3 on (pg. 5) of <i>Al-Fatawaa al-Jaliyyah</i>, written by the compiler of the book, Hasan bin Muhammad Ad-Dagreeree.]</p>
