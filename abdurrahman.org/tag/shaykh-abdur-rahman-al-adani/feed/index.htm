										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 18 :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A man wants to make hijrah, but he has parents who need his assistance, so what does he do?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Answer :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He must strive to convince them to make <em>hijrah</em> if they are Muslims and use wit and artful means with them in order to leave, and likewise if they are disbelievers, he must strive to call them to Islaam and save them from the state they are in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if he is very afraid for himself and they refuse to leave with him, then it is upon him to save himself and flee with his <em>deen</em> and distance himself from the tribulations, and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>he must not be like the candle which burns itself to shed light on others</strong></span>, for verily before everything else, he is commanded to save himself and he is commanded to be upright on the <em>deen</em> of Allah,عز و جل, as our Lord,سبحانه و تعالى, has said :</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> فاستقم كما أمرت </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8221; <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So be upright as you were commanded</strong></span>.&#8221;(Hud:112)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 19:</strong> Leaving the lands of disbelief for knowledge but not for hijrah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Some brothers, when they leave from France or other lands of disbelief, they leave with the intention of seeking knowledge and they don’t attach importance to making hijrah, and when he is asked, ‘Are you a Muhaajir?’ he replies with the statement: ‘I want to seek knowledge, as for hijrah, I will look into it later, Allaah willing.’ And at the same time it is possible that he could return to the land of disbelief at anytime, so what do you have to say about this?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most important thing is that he leaves from those disbelieving lands so he can escape with his deen, and it is upon him that he be firmly determined not to reside in the lands of disbelief, whichever ones exist. If he were to do that then, verily, he would be free from the sin, by Allaah’s permission, and he would be safeguarding his deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the question: “<strong>Does he intend with this departure hijrah or merely fleeing with the deen from the tribulations without the intention of hijrah?</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of our Mashaayikh (<em>Rahimahullaah Ta’ala</em>) used to advise to leave, to flee with the deen without making the intention of hijrah, for the fear that he will arrive at the Islaamic lands and he will not be able to remain there, so when that happens he will be able to return to the land he left, contrary to if he were to leave with the intention of hijrah, for verily he will not be able to return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the reason for this position due to the many obstacles that are well-known and have been placed in front of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second position that is well-known in this issue is that it is better to have the intention of hijrah because the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam</em>) and his Companions (<em>Radhillaahu ‘Anhum</em>) made hijrah from the most beloved of places to Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>); from Makkah. And no doubt, this position appears to be closer and more correct. Also, as has preceded, verily he who relies on Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>) and thinks good of Allaah and is sincere in his intention of escaping with his deen from the tribulations, Allaah (<em>Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala</em>) is more generous than to leave this slave to perish and have him rely on the people and abandon him. He is glorified and exalted (above that). Also, Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>) has promised him help, and victory, and to make things easy, and facilitate things for him, even if whoever is on earth were to plot against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In not intending hijrah when leaving, there is a clear cause for bad to happen to the Muslim because for the least difficulty that occurs to him he will pack up his belongings and return to the land of disbelief. So what we advise our brothers with is that they leave with the intention of hijrah and that they use as a lesson their brothers who have left before them. Has Allaah (<em>Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala</em>) left them to perish?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer: No, rather, with praise to Allaah, they live in the lands of Islaam in honor and respect and happiness, and they have been granted knowledge and implementation of the knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah (<em>Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala</em>) that He grant us and you all the success to obey Him and obey His Messenger (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa ‘Alaa Aalihi Wa Sallam</em>). We ask Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>) for forgiveness and good health and well-being in the deen, and in this life and in the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah (<em>Tabarak Wa Ta’ala</em>) to make us and you all from those who direct with the truth and establish justice therewith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allaah, Lord of all that exists, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our Prophet Muhammad and upon his Family and his Companions, all of them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 15:</strong> Not making hijrah due to being upon welfare and fearing poverty</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Taking money from the disbelievers (welfare) has made many of the Muslims lazy from making hijrah, and that is because they, if they work they fall into forbidden acts, and if they make hijrah they fear poverty. Also, they claim that with this money they are able to live at ease and perform their deen. So what is your advice for these people, and is hijrah from the means for provision and what is the proof for that, and are the rituals that the Salafees do over there considered to be performing the deen?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>), the treasures of the heavens and the earth are in His hand, and He has guaranteed provision for His slaves as He (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>) said in His Book:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا مِن دَابَّةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا عَلَى اللَّهِ رِزْقُهَا وَيَعْلَمُ مُسْتَقَرَّهَا وَمُسْتَوْدَعَهَا ۚ كُلٌّ فِي كِتَابٍ مُّبِينٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And no living creature is there on earth but its provision is due from Allaah. And He knows its dwelling place and its deposit. All is in a Clear Book.”</strong></span> &#8211; Hud (11):6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as He (<em>Subhaanahu</em>) said:</p>
<p><strong>وَكَأَيِّن مِّن دَابَّةٍ لَّا تَحْمِلُ رِزْقَهَا اللَّهُ يَرْزُقُهَا وَإِيَّاكُمْ ۚ وَهُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْعَلِيمُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And so many a living creature there is that carries not its own provision. Allaah provides for it and for you. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.”</strong> </span>&#8211; Al-Ankaboot (29):60</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</strong><br />
<strong>مَا أُرِيدُ مِنْهُم مِّن رِّزْقٍ وَمَا أُرِيدُ أَن يُطْعِمُونِ</strong><br />
<strong>إِنَّ اللَّهَ هُوَ الرَّزَّاقُ ذُو الْقُوَّةِ الْمَتِينُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I created not the jinns and mankind except they should worship Me. I seek not any provision from them nor do I ask that they should feed Me. Verily, Allaah is the Provider, Possessor of power, the Most Strong.”</strong></span> &#8211; AdhDhaariyaat (51):56-58</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon every Muslim to know that his provision has already been determined and has been written for him in a book with Allaah (<em>Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala</em>) fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, and that was also written while he was in his mother’s womb; his provision was written, and his life-span, and his deeds, and whether he would be miserable or happy. Also, the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam</em>), he is the one who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Verily the spirit of purity (Jibreel) has inspired me that no soul will die except that it has fulfilled its provision and its life-span, so fear Allaah and do that which is good in seeking provision</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the only provision that will come to the slave is that which has been written for him, so it is only upon him that he strive to be righteous and he hasten to do acts of obedience, and it is not permissible for him to think that his righteousness and his performance of that which Allaah has ordered is going to decrease his provision, and that his laxity and negligence and his unstableness in his deen is going to be a reason for his provision to increase.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon all of us to know that hijrah for Allaah’s sake is one of the great means of provision as He (<em>Ta’ala</em>) said in His Noble Book:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَن يُهَاجِرْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ يَجِدْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُرَاغَمًا كَثِيرًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“He who emigrates in the cause of Allaah will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty of provision.”</strong></span> &#8211; An-Nisaa (4):100</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whoever makes hijrah for Allaah’s sake seeking the pleasure of Allaah (<em>‘Azza Wa Jall</em>), Allaah has promised him the good promise, provision and ease and comfort, that which will be a means to infuriate his enemies. So it is upon every Muslim to ask Allaah for a portion of His bounty, and rely upon Him, and see Him to be sufficient for him, and be modest because if he sees Allaah to be sufficient for him, then Allaah will be sufficient for him, and if he strives to be modest, then Allaah will enable him to be modest.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the question, <span style="color:#993300;">“Are the rituals that the Salafees do over there considered to be performing the deen.”</span> The answer is that the discussion about residing in the lands of the disbelievers and its ruling has preceded, so you, after examining what has preceded, will be able, Allaah (<em>Ta’ala</em>) willing, to give the ruling of our brothers over there.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 8:</strong> Travelling to the lands of disbelief for tourism, business, da’wah, and marriage</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“There are some travels to the lands of disbelief that don’t include residing nor settling there, like traveling for vacation, and tourism, and traveling for business, and traveling for da’wah, or for someone who made hijrah to go get married over there.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regards to traveling for vacation and tourism we say; traveling to the lands of disbelief for those matters of daroorah (extreme necessity), like seeking treatment and such, there is no problem with this as has preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for that which is for the purpose of vacation, or tourism, or roaming around or recreation, this travel is not a travel of extreme necessity because it is possible for him to go to the Islaamic lands whose people are conservative Muslims and take vacation there, and it will be less expensive, and he will feel safe in his journey for his deen, although the advice we give is that the Muslim focus on that which benefits him, as the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) said, “<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Focus on that which benefits you</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for traveling to the land of disbelief and shirk for the purpose of tourism and recreation, no doubt, there is great danger in that and trial on the deen of the Muslim and on his character because of what has been mentioned. Also, in that great sums of money are wasted in these types of journeys to the lands of disbelief, and over there the temptations are intense. How often has a righteous person traveled to those lands then returned corrupted. Rather, how often has a Muslim traveled there and returned as a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in brief, it is not permissible to travel to the land of disbelief for tourism, and roaming around and recreation. That is so the (person’s) deen can be protected, and so he can be saved from the means of trial, and so he can distance himself from the dangers and the evil consequences, especially since the traveler travels and searches in his journey for everything that delights him and everything that entertains him, and you know the laxity that exists in those lands for sins like drinking alcoholic beverages, and fornication, and nudity, and decadence, and the many types of abominations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, those disbelievers have prepared their lands for these purposes and compete with one another in that. And, all praises are due to Allaah, the people of knowledge have given the legal verdict that it is forbidden to go to the land of the disbelievers for tourism and roaming around.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for traveling for the purpose of business, some of the people of knowledge allow that, and some of the people of knowledge see that to be forbidden and don’t allow that because of the severe danger which the Muslim is subject to over there. Whatever the case may be, our advice is that the Muslim beware of going to the lands of disbelief for the purpose of business as much as possible because of the danger in that on the deen and on the character, and because of the great evils which have already been mentioned, especially since the one who wants to do business, he brings with him on his journey large sums of money, and you know that the abomination is at hands reach, we ask Allaah for safety and wellbeing. However, if he is going to travel for his business to one of the remote lands of the disbelievers with trustworthy company in a short time-period, in this instance it could be said to be permissible. As for most of the lands of disbelief, there is great danger in that on the deen of the Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Muhaajir traveling only to get married, it appears that it is not permissible because it is not an extreme necessity, rather, he is able to marry a righteous woman over there, if one can be found, over the telephone or by the different means of communication without having to travel there because in the Muslim traveling there, as you have heard, there is danger for him, and perhaps if he goes to those lands after making hijrah from them he could long for staying there and employ different types of tricks to stay there with the argument that he is still trying to find the right wife, or with the argument that he is working for a little while so he can save money to suffice the requirements of the marriage and the journey with his family to the lands of Islaam, or with the argument that there are obstacles making it difficult to return to the land of Islaam, or because he needs some treatment or things like that, and Allaah is the one whose help is sought. So we advise that he doesn’t go for this purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for traveling to those lands for the purpose of calling to Allaah, it is well known the many proofs from the Book and the Sunnah mentioning the virtue of calling to Allaah. Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) said in His Book:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ قَوْلًا مِّمَّن دَعَا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا وَقَالَ إِنَّنِي مِنَ الْمُسْلِمِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And who is better in speech than he who invites (men) to Allaah, and does righteous deeds, and says: ‘I am one of the Muslims.’”</strong></span> &#8211; Fussilat (41):33</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says:</p>
<p><strong>قُلْ هَٰذِهِ سَبِيلِي أَدْعُو إِلَى اللَّهِ ۚ عَلَىٰ بَصِيرَةٍ أَنَا وَمَنِ اتَّبَعَنِي ۖ وَسُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَمَا أَنَا مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad): ‘This is my way; I invite unto Allaah with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me with sure knowledge. And Glorified and Exalted be Allaah. And I am not of the Mushrikoon (polytheists, pagans, idolaters and disbelievers).’”</span></strong> &#8211; Yusuf (12):108</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Subhaanahu) says:</p>
<p><strong>ادْعُ إِلَىٰ سَبِيلِ رَبِّكَ بِالْحِكْمَةِ وَالْمَوْعِظَةِ الْحَسَنَةِ ۖ وَجَادِلْهُم بِالَّتِي هِيَ أَحْسَنُ ۚ إِنَّ رَبَّكَ هُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِمَن ضَلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ۖ وَهُوَ أَعْلَمُ بِالْمُهْتَدِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Invite (mankind, O Muhammad) to the Way of your Lord with wisdom and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.”</strong></span> &#8211; An-Nahl (16):125</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So traveling to the lands of disbelief for the purpose of da’wah is considered to be a type of Jihaad, and it is fard kifaayah (obligatory on a part of the nation) upon he who is able to do that. So calling to Allaah, and instructing the people, and conveying Allaah’s message to His slaves, and removing the people from the types of darkness to the light, and explaining the good qualities of Islaam to the disbelievers, and educating the Muslims over there about the rulings of the deen, and enlightening them, and instructing them, and encouraging them to leave there and go to the lands of Islaam, no doubt, these are important matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The disbelievers are in need of someone to call them, especially since Islaam in the lands of disbelief has been distorted. So many of the disbelievers don’t know anything about true Islaam because of the cover-up, and misguidance, and distortion, and deterrence, and false allegations against the religion of Islaam, that it is a religion of barbarity, and savageness and backwardness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in brief, calling to Allaah in those lands is a matter of extreme importance because of what results because of it from benefit and guidance for the creation, in particular when sincerity, and truthfulness, and patience exists in the callers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt, by Allaah’s permission, good outcomes will occur. However, it is a must that this caller to Allaah, his da’wah must have some effect and influence, and this only happens to a man who has with him knowledge and insight; a man who knows his deen with its evidences, and he has the ability to call to it and refute the specious arguments that he comes across, along with the ability to perform that which Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) has made obligatory upon him, and all of this, meaning the permissibility of going there for the purpose of da’wah, is under the condition that the caller to Allaah feels safe for himself from tribulation, for if he fears tribulation for his deen, or fears for himself falling into that which Allaah has forbidden, it is not allowed for him to travel there even if it is for the purpose of da’wah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 13:</strong> Restricting hijrah to certain lands from the lands of Islaam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Some brothers, ash-Shaytaan has deceived them, they only see hijrah to be to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, or they only wish to make hijrah to it despite the well-known hardship it takes to do that, so what is your advice to these people?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What we advise our brothers with is that they fear Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) and that they rush to flee with their deen from the tribulations. No doubt, Saudi Arabia is from the best lands of Islaam due to the much good there, and the existence of the Scholars and the scarceness of open abominations, however, it is a mistake for the Muslim to delay leaving the land of disbelief and delay escaping with his deen with the argument that he is still proceeding and following up so he can enter Saudi Arabia and reside there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This excuse is not accepted because the lands of Islaam in which evil is scarce and less intense in comparison to the other lands of disbelief, no doubt, these Islaamic lands are wide, and vast and many, and Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says in His Book:</p>
<p><strong>يَا عِبَادِيَ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا إِنَّ أَرْضِي وَاسِعَةٌ فَإِيَّايَ فَاعْبُدُونِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O My slaves who believe! Certainly, spacious is My earth. Therefore worship Me (Alone).”</span></strong> &#8211; [Al-Ankaboot (29):56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says:</p>
<p><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَوَفَّاهُمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ ظَالِمِي أَنفُسِهِمْ قَالُوا فِيمَ كُنتُمْ ۖ قَالُوا كُنَّا مُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ قَالُوا أَلَمْ تَكُنْ أَرْضُ اللَّهِ وَاسِعَةً فَتُهَاجِرُوا فِيهَا ۚ فَأُولَٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَسَاءَتْ مَصِيرًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): ‘In what (condition) were you?’ They reply: ‘We were weak and oppressed on earth.’ They (angels) say: ‘Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?’ Such men will find their abode in Hell &#8211; What an evil destination!”</span></strong> &#8211; [An Nisaa (4):97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon the Muslim to, first and foremost, rush to leave the lands of disbelief to go to the lands of Islaam that are easy to get to, then after that it is alright for him to strive to take permanent residence in the best of places and the one that has the less evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saudi Arabia has much good in it, and likewise Yemen, especially in its rural areas and villages, there is much good. Also, the other Islaamic countries, despite the great affliction that exists in them, there is no doubt that there is no comparison between them and the other countries of disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So it is upon the Muslim to rush to escape with his deen, for today he has the correct intention and is eager but what will make him realize that perhaps afterwards he will slacken in this determination even if entering Saudi Arabia became possible for him, for the hearts are between two fingers from the fingers of Ar-Rahmaan (The Most Merciful).</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So does the person over there feel safe for himself that he will stay upon what he is on until the next morning? Today he is healthy but what will make him realize that perhaps something will happen to him tomorrow. Today he possesses some money to help him make hijrah and travel but what will make him realize how his situation will be days after. Today he is able to travel to many of the lands of Islaam without any obstacles but he does not know what will happen to him days later. So Rush! Rush! Escape! Escape! Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says in His Book:</p>
<p><strong>فَاسْتَبِقُوا الْخَيْرَاتِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“So hasten towards all that is good.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Baqarah (2):148</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam), he is the one who said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Hasten to do good deeds before the occurrence of tribulations that are like the parts of the dark night; a man will enter the morning as a believer then enter the evening as a disbeliever, or he will enter the evening as a believer then enter the morning as a disbeliever, he will sell his deen for a commodity of the dunyaa.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Imaam) Muslim has transmitted it from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is what we advise our brothers with, and Allaah is the one whose help is sought.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 16:</strong> Advice for the one who studied in Yemen and Saudi Arabia and then returned to the land of disbelief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Some of the students of knowledge who benefited from studying in Yemen and Saudi Arabia with Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa&#8217;ah have returned to the lands of the disbelievers, however, there actions show that they are out for the money. So what is your advice to these people?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that calling to Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) has a significant status and is deemed to be an honor for the Muslim, for he who is sincere to Allaah in doing it, for verily an abundant reward and a great recompense is anticipated for him, and it is upon the caller to Allaah (Subhaanahu) that he does not exchange that which is better for that which is worse, and it is upon him to know that his mistake is not like someone else’s mistake, for verily he who knows is not like he who doesn’t know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he who Allaah has honored with knowledge then does something blameworthy, his punishment is not like the punishment of that ignorant person who perhaps if he knew similar to what this student or caller knew, perhaps he wouldn’t do this forbidden act.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) has said in His Noble Book threatening His Prophet Muhammad (‘Alayhis Salaatu Was Salaam), that if he were to lean towards the disbelievers and sway towards them, and he (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) is far above doing that, then Allaah would double his punishment as He (Subhaanahu) said:</p>
<p><strong>وَإِن كَادُوا لَيَفْتِنُونَكَ عَنِ الَّذِي أَوْحَيْنَا إِلَيْكَ لِتَفْتَرِيَ عَلَيْنَا غَيْرَهُ ۖ وَإِذًا لَّاتَّخَذُوكَ خَلِيلًا &#8211; 17:73</strong></p>
<p><strong>وَلَوْلَا أَن ثَبَّتْنَاكَ لَقَدْ كِدتَّ تَرْكَنُ إِلَيْهِمْ شَيْئًا قَلِيلًا &#8211; 17:74</strong></p>
<p><strong>إِذًا لَّأَذَقْنَاكَ ضِعْفَ الْحَيَاةِ وَضِعْفَ الْمَمَاتِ ثُمَّ لَا تَجِدُ لَكَ عَلَيْنَا نَصِيرًا &#8211; 17:75</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, they were about to tempt you away from that which We have revealed to you, to fabricate something other than it against Us, and then they would certainly have taken you as a friend. And had We not made you stand firm, you would nearly have inclined to them a little. In that case, We would have made you taste a double portion of punishment in this life and a double portion of punishment after death. And then you would have found none to help you against Us.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Israa (17):73-75</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is upon these people to fear Allaah and know that Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) knows that which is secret and that which is most hidden, and Allaah (Ta’ala) knows what is in the breasts, and that Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) knows the deceitful eyes and that which the breasts conceal. So if they have gone over there with the pretext of calling to Allaah while in reality there goal is to collect money and enjoy the pleasures of this life, they must know that they are only fooling themselves and that they are only harming themselves. Also, we remind them of the statement of Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall):</p>
<p><strong>يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ النَّاسِ وَلَا يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ اللَّهِ وَهُوَ مَعَهُمْ إِذْ يُبَيِّتُونَ مَا لَا يَرْضَىٰ مِنَ الْقَوْلِ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ بِمَا يَعْمَلُونَ مُحِيطًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“They may hide from the people, but they cannot hide from Allaah, for He is with them when they plot by night in words that He does not approve, and Allaah ever encompasses what they do.”</strong></span> &#8211; An-Nisaa (4):108</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we advise them to fear Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) and to make their deeds sincerely for Allaah, and that they either stay over there for the purpose of calling to Allaah and be sincere in doing that and strive hard to convey it, or if not, they must leave those lands and return to the lands of Islaam, and by doing that they will be, Allaah (Ta’ala) willing, a good example for their brothers, and if not, if they don’t do that, then we, by Allaah, we fear for them tribulation in their deen, and we fear that Allaah will not bless them in their knowledge nor in the wealth they gathered because of their turning away from the truth after knowing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon us all to beware of that which our Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) has warned us, and he has warned us of the temptation of the dunyaa and the temptation of wealth, for verily the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) he is the one who said as can be found in at-Tirmidhee from the hadeeth of Ka’b Ibn Maalik,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Two hungry wolves released into a flock of sheep are not more destructive than the destruction that a person’s desire for wealth and status has on his deen.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a saheeh hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in at-Tirmidhee with a chain that is hasan from the hadeeth of Ka’b Ibn Iyaad, he said, “I heard the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) say,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Indeed, for every nation there is a fitnah (trial), and the fitnah of my nation is wealth.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we advise them to have contentment, and to strive to implement what they know, and to beware of having greed for the dunyaa and competing with one another for it, for verily, if they were granted small provision in the lands of Islaam along with Allaah granting them the success to obtain knowledge and implement it and stand firm on the deen, then they, by Allaah, would be in prosperity and success as the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa ‘Alaa Aalihi Wa Sallam) informed of in his statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“He has prospered, he who embraces Islaam and his provision is just sufficient means for living and Allaah has made him satisfied with what comes to him.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim has transmitted it from the hadeeth of ‘Abdullah Ibn Amr Ibn al- ‘Aas. So our advice to these people is that they fear Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this previous advice of ours is only for he who is truly like that, he who has focused on gathering money, and he has focused on remaining in the lands of disbelief for that reason while at the same time he pretends as if he only wanted to go to those lands for the purpose of da’wah. Also, we advise all of the brothers to think good of their brothers and to beware of thinking bad of the callers and the students of knowledge for nothing other than doubts and notions without a distinct clear proof and clear signs which show that this is what they intend because Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says in His Noble Book:</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا اجْتَنِبُوا كَثِيرًا مِّنَ الظَّنِّ إِنَّ بَعْضَ الظَّنِّ إِثْمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“O you who believe, avoid much suspicion, indeed some suspicion is sin.” </strong></span>&#8211; Al-Hujuraat (49):12</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) says as has come in the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (RadhiAllaahu Ta’ala ‘Anhu) transmitted by the two Shaykhs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Beware of suspicion, for verily suspicion is the most false of speech.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) for safety and well-being, and we seek refuge in Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) from every act that our Lord does not love and is not pleased with.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 4: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“When was <em>Al-Hijrah</em> (Migration) legislated, and what were the types of hijrah in the era of the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa Sallam)?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>hijrah</em> of the Muslims from Makkah to Al-Habasha (in Ethiopia), which is the first <em>hijrah</em>, took place in the month of Rajab five years after the <em>mab’ath</em> (the time when the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa ‘Alaa Aalihi Wa Sallam</em>) was sent with Islaam) as the historians mention. As for the <em>hijrah</em> of the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam</em>) from Makkah to Madeenah, it took place in the month of Rabee’ Al-Awwal thirteen years after being sent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the types of <em>hijrah</em> which existed in the era of the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam</em>), a group of Scholars have mentioned various types of hijrahs to the point that some of them mentioned eight types, however, some of these types are not accepted as being called <em>hijrah</em>, rather they are delegations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever the case may be, the hijrahs that occurred in Islaam and have the right to be called hijrah are of two forms:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Moving from the land of fear to the land of safety, as occurred in the two hijrahs to Al-Habasha, for verily Al-Habasha was a land of disbelief, but it was safe and secure for the Muslims in comparison to Makkah, and likewise in the beginning of the hijrah from Makkah to Madeenah, for verily Madeenah at first was a land of disbelief, but it was safe and secure for the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The <em>hijrah</em> from the land of disbelief to the land of belief. That occurred after the Prophet (<em>Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam</em>) took residence in Madeenah, and those Muslims who were able to, made <em>hijrah</em> to it. <em>Al-Hijrah</em> at that time was only relevant to moving to Madeenah, until Makkah was conquered. The specific ruling then ceased, while the general ruling of leaving the land of disbelief for whoever was able to do so remained.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 3: The types of hijrah and their rulings</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“What are the types of hijrah, and what is the ruling of each one?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are numerous divisions for the types of hijrah which the people of knowledge have mentioned. From these divisions is that which Ibn Hajar has mentioned in ‘Al-Fath’ (his explanation of Saheeh al-Bukhaaree) under the hadeeth: “The Muhaajir is he who leaves that which Allaah has prohibited” He said, “&#8230;and this hijrah is of two types, outer and inner. The inner is to leave that which the soul which commands evil and the Shaytaan call to, and the outer is to flee with the deen from tribulations.” Some of them phrase this as hijrah of the place and hijrah of the deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hijrah of the place, its proofs have preceded. As for hijrah of the deeds, it is that the Muslim leave, that which Allaah has prohibited from disobedient acts and the different types of sins and transgressions. This type is as Ibnul-Mulaqqin (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala) has said, “Some of the later Maalikee scholars have said it is the greatest hijrah in which all of the divisions fall under.” This division of hijrah, hijrah of deeds or hijrah of sins, its proof is what the two Shaykhs have transmitted on ‘Abdullaah Ibn ‘Amr Ibn al-‘Aas on the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) that he said, “The Muslim is he who the Muslims are safe from his tongue and his hand, and the Muhaajir is he who leaves that which Allaah has prohibited.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, An-Nasaa&#8217;ee has transmitted with a chain that is saheeh on ‘Abdullaah Ibn ‘Amr Ibn al-‘Aas that he said, “A man said, ‘O Messenger of Allaah. What hijrah is best?’” He said, “That you leave that which your Lord (‘Azza Wa Jall) dislikes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Ibn Maajah has transmitted with a chain that is hasan on Fudaalah Ibn ‘Ubayd on the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) that he said, “The believer is he who the people trust him with their wealth and their own selves, and the Muhaajir is he who leaves off crimes and sins.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajar (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala) has said under the previous passage, under the hadeeth: “The Muhaajir is he who leaves that which Allaah has prohibited,” he said, “It is as if the Muhaajiroon were addressed with that in order that they don’t rely solely upon the migration from their land, and in order that they act according to the commands and prohibitions of the legislation, or it is possible that was said after the hijrah had ceased, when Makkah was conquered, to soothe the hearts of those who did not attain that, however, the essence of hijrah is obtained by he who leaves that which Allaah has prohibited.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajar (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala) derived and summarized this from the statement of Ibnul-Mulaqqin in his explanation of the book ‘Al-‘Umdah’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also another division of Al-Hijrah, that Al-Hijrah is divided into general and specific. The specific hijrah being the hijrah from Makkah to Madeenah, and it is well known that hijrah to Madeenah before the conquest of Makkah was obligatory upon the Muslims, and that it was obligatory upon the Muslims in Makkah and elsewhere to reside in Madeenah in order to help the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) and assist him with person and wealth and other than that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) emphasized that before the conquest of Makkah in numerous verses to the point where He cut the ties of guardianship between whoever made hijrah and whoever did not make hijrah. Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>And as to those who believed but did not emigrate (to you O Muhammad), you owe no duty of protection to them until they emigrate&#8230;</strong>” &#8211; Al-Anfaal (8):72</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this specific hijrah is the one which its ruling of being obligatory was abolished by his (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa ‘Alaa Aalihi Wa Sallam) statement: “There is no hijrah after the conquest, rather Jihaad and intention.” So when Makkah was conquered and it became a land of Islaam, the ruling of making hijrah to it (Madeenah) was abolished. (Imaam) alBukhaaree (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala) has transmitted in his Saheeh from the chain of Ataa Ibn Abee Rabaah that he said, “I along with ‘Ubayd Ibn Umar al-Laithee visited ‘Aishah and we asked her about Al-Hijrah, so she said, ‘There is no hijrah today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It used to be that the believers, one of them would flee with his deen to Allaah (Ta’ala) and His Messenger (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa ‘Alaa Aalihi Wa Sallam) out of fear of being tortured because of it (his deen). As for today, Allaah has made Islaam victorious, and today the person can worship his Lord wherever he pleases, however, there is Jihaad and intention.’” What ‘Aishah means by her statement “today” is after the conquest of Makkah. So this is the specific hijrah for which its ruling of being obligatory has been abolished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the general hijrah, which is the migration from the land of shirk to the land of Islaam, this remains until the Final Hour as the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) has stated for he who is not able to perform his deen and openly perform its rituals in the land which is not the land of Islaam. How long has there continued to exist, lands of disbelief and enemies that fight the people of the Religion of Islaam, so hijrah continues to be a prescribed practice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also another division of hijrah, that hijrah is of two types: The hijrah from the land of shirk to the land of Islaam which has previously been discussed and its ruling &#8211; when is it obligatory and when is it mustahab (highly recommended) &#8211; has also preceded, and Allaah (Ta’ala) willing, the discussion about the rule defining the land of shirk will come in the answer to the fifth question. The second type is to leave and make hijrah from the land in which innovations and sins have become widespread to the land where that is few and less intense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So with regards to leaving and making hijrah from the land in which misguiding innovations are many and widespread, and the man on the Sunnah is not able to openly perform the Sunnah and defend it and wage war against those innovations, this type of hijrah has been mentioned by a group of Scholars, among them is Ibnul-‘Arabee (Rahimahullaah) in his book ‘Ahkaam AlQur&#8217;aan’. He said, “Ibnul-Qaasim said, ‘I heard Maalik say, ‘It is not permissible for anyone to reside in a land where the Salaf are reviled therein.’’” (Imaam) al-Qurtubee added that he also said, “and falsehood is practiced therein.” Ibnul-‘Arabee commented on this statement of Maalik saying, “This is true, for verily the munkar (abomination), if you are not able to change it then get away from it.” Allaah (Ta’ala) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when you (Muhammad) see those who engage in a false conversation about Our Verses (of the Qur&#8217;aan) by mocking at them, stay away from them till they turn to another topic. And if Shaytaan (Satan) causes you to forget, then after the remembrance sit not you in the company of those people who are the wrong-doers.” &#8211; Al-An’aam (6):68</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So due to that, there are many Scholars who have mentioned this type of hijrah, leaving the land in which innovations are many, and the people of innovation are out in the open, and the Sunan are hidden. Many Scholars from the Maalikee Scholars, and the Shaafi’ee Scholars, and Scholars from some of the other madhaahib amongst them, the Hanbalee Scholars, take the position of leaving (such a land), for he has said in the book ‘AlMuntahaa’, “…or the land of the oppressors or misguiding innovations like Rafd [1] or I’tizaal [2]. It is obligatory that he leave there and go to the land of the people of the Sunnah if he is not able to openly perform the methodology of the people of the Sunnah therein.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, others such as al-Baghawee in his tafseer, and al-Qurtubee, and Ibn Hajar in ‘Al-Fath’, and ashShawkaanee, may Allaah have mercy upon them all, have mentioned this type of hijrah, while (on the other hand) some Scholars remained in the lands where innovations were many and widespread thinking they would be able to confront these innovations and abominations and establish, for Allaah’s (‘Azza Wa Jall) sake, the proof against the slaves of Allaah, so they would defend (the truth) and combat and reduce the evils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul-‘Arabee mentioned in his book ‘Ahkaam Al-Qur&#8217;aan’ that he requested from his Shaykh Abu Bakr al-Fihree that he leave the land of Misr (Egypt) and go somewhere else because of the innovation and forbidden acts that existed there. So his Shaykh gave as an excuse that there is good in him staying there, from spreading the guidance, and directing the people, and spreading Tawheed, and warning from false beliefs, and calling to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, the dispute between them became severe over the issue. Ibnul-‘Arabee said, “…to the point that the dispute between he and I grew extremely intense,” or a statement similar to that (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala). Many Scholars have mentioned this type of hijrah to be obligatory, from the Maalikee Scholars, and the Shaafi’ee Scholars, and the Hanbalee Scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, leaving the land in which sins and different types of crimes and disobedient acts are many, and the Muslim there is not able to enjoin the good and forbid the evil and reduce the evil, rather he is scared for himself, and for his family, and for those whom Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) has made him responsible for. A group of Scholars from the Maalikee Scholars, and the Shaafi’ee Scholars, and the Hanbalee Scholars have also mentioned this, and that it is upon the Muslim to make hijrah. However, some Scholars dispute it being obligatory, they dispute it being obligatory to make the hijrah of this type. They have reported on a group of Scholars of Fiqh, from the Hanbalee Scholars of Fiqh, that hijrah from the land in which sins are many and widespread is mustahab (highly recommended) and it is not obligatory because of the statement of the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam): “Whoever amongst you sees an evil, let him change it with his hand.” Likewise, Imaam ash-Shawkaanee (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala) in his book ‘Nail AlAwtaar’ disputed the obligation of leaving the land of sins, rather he saw that to be highly recommended. However, in his book ‘As-Sail Al-Jarraar’ he took that back and declared it to be obligatory. A group (from the people of knowledge) has mentioned it to be highly recommended, while others see this type of hijrah to be similar to the previous type of hijrah, hijrah from the land of innovations and desires. They see leaving the land in which sins are widespread, and the Muslim therein is not able to combat that and suppress that, and he does not feel safe for himself there, they see this type to also be obligatory. Whatever the case may be, this is a division from the divisions of hijrah that the people of knowledge have mentioned. The proof the people of knowledge use for this type of hijrah, hijrah from the land of sins and hijrah from the land of innovations, is the statement of Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): ‘In what (condition) were you?’ They reply: ‘We were weak and oppressed on earth.’”</strong> &#8211; An-Nisaa (4):97</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have reported on Sa’eed Ibn Jubair that he extracted from this verse that it is obligatory to make hijrah from the land in which sins are many, and they similarly reported that on ‘Ataa, and similarly a group of the people of knowledge have used this as a proof. So in brief, the hijrah from the land in which sins are many and widespread, a group of Scholars of Fiqh, as you have heard, declare it to be obligatory, and some of them say it is highly recommended. As for the first type, making hijrah from the land of innovations, many people of knowledge see it to be obligatory to leave this type of land.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] This is the belief and practice of the Raafidhah. They are more commonly known as the Shee’ah who have exceeded in their love and honor for the family of the Prophet (Salallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are called the Raafidhah because they rejected the leadership of Zayd Ibn ‘Ali Iibn alHusayn, and also when they asked him about Abu Bakr and ‘Umar and he praised them. So they said: “They are the ministers of my grandfather”, then they departed and as a result rejected (the statement and leadership of Zayd ibn ‘Ali).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This is the belief and practice of the Mu’tazilah. The doctrine of i&#8217;tizal is the belief that there exists state of existence between eemaan and kufr. They also believe that the Qur’aan is created. From the main proponents of this deviant ideology was the ‘Abbasid khaleefah <strong>al-Ma’moon</strong> and his brother<strong> al-Mu’tasim</strong>. The belief of this group was strongly opposed and refuted by Imaam Ahmed Ibn Hanbal (Rahimahullaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name Mu’tazilah is derived from a schism which took place in the circle of al-Hasan alBasree. After laying down their deviant ideology <strong>Wasil Ibn ‘Ataa</strong> and <strong>‘Amr Ibn ‘Ubayd</strong> are said to have separated (i‘tazala) from al-Hasan al-Basree’s circle to establish an independent school.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 6: Are there any exceptions to residing in the lands of disbelief?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“After we have come to know the ruling of hijrah, and <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2017/09/25/the-rule-defining-the-land-in-which-it-is-obligatory-to-make-hijrah-migration-from/">the rule defining the land from which hijrah is made</a>, are there any circumstances considered exceptions to this, and if so, what is the condition on this resident?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (Ta’ala) says in His Noble Book:</p>
<p>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَوَفَّاهُمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ ظَالِمِي أَنفُسِهِمْ قَالُوا فِيمَ كُنتُمْ ۖ قَالُوا كُنَّا مُسْتَضْعَفِينَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۚ قَالُوا أَلَمْ تَكُنْ أَرْضُ اللَّهِ وَاسِعَةً فَتُهَاجِرُوا فِيهَا ۚ فَأُولَٰئِكَ مَأْوَاهُمْ جَهَنَّمُ ۖ وَسَاءَتْ مَصِيرًا &#8211; 4:97</p>
<p>إِلَّا الْمُسْتَضْعَفِينَ مِنَ الرِّجَالِ وَالنِّسَاءِ وَالْوِلْدَانِ لَا يَسْتَطِيعُونَ حِيلَةً وَلَا يَهْتَدُونَ سَبِيلًا &#8211; 4:98</p>
<p>فَأُولَٰئِكَ عَسَى اللَّهُ أَن يَعْفُوَ عَنْهُمْ ۚ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ عَفُوًّا غَفُورًا &#8211; 4:99</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): ‘In what (condition) were you?’ They reply: ‘We were weak and oppressed on earth.’ They (angels) say: ‘Was not the earth of Allaah spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?’ Such men will find their abode in Hell &#8211; What an evil destination! Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way. For these there is hope that Allaah will forgive them, and Allaah is Ever Oft Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.”</span></strong> &#8211; An-Nisaa (4):97-99</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So those who are excused for not making hijrah when it is obligatory upon them, they are these people, the people who have excuses, those who are in no way able to make hijrah. So these people, they are the ones in which an exception is made, and this incapability is under certain circumstances:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It could be <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">because of an illness</span></strong>. Either because he is sick with an illness that forces him to stay in bed, and with this illness he is not able to mount any means of transportation required to leave the land he is in, this person is then excused, or likewise if he has an illness that he can’t find treatment to stay alive except in the land of disbelief which he is in, this person is also excused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Or this incapability could be <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">because of compulsion</span></strong>, like a prisoner for example, or likewise some countries prevent its citizens from leaving to go somewhere else except under extremely difficult measures as we saw and witnessed in the south of Yemen in the days of Communism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Or it could be <strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">because of weakness as is the case of the women and children</span></strong> who are unable to travel from one land to another because of their weakness and lack of experience. So these also are from those for whom an exception is made.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if there exists from the women one who is rational, and resolute, and possesses insight and comprehension, and is able to travel and leave the land of disbelief to go to the land of Islaam, and she feels safe for herself from fitnah (tribulation), then this woman, it is obligatory upon her to leave and make hijrah when she is in the circumstance where it is obligatory upon her, and <strong>it is not a condition that she have a mahram</strong> (a guardian who, because of ties, she is never able to marry) because of the statement of Allaah (Ta’ala):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe! When believing women come to you as emigrants, examine them”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Mumtahanah (60):10</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For verily Umm Kulthoom Bint ‘Uqbah Ibn Abee Mu’ait justify, and also Zainab the daughter of the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) justify, they both justify without a mahram, and likewise many women justify from Makkah to Madeenah without mahaarim, so the ahadeeth which mention the <strong>condition of having a mahram for a woman to travel don’t apply in the particular case of hijrah</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Or this incapability could be because of the obstacles which have been put in place today, from <span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>the visas and things similar to that</strong></span>, thus if he is not able to enter the lands of Islaam because of the likes of these obstacles, and this is rare that all of the Islaamic lands shut their doors on he who comes from Europe, and America, and other lands of disbelief, however, whatever the case may be, if something like that were to happen to a Muslim, then it would be an excuse for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Also, there are some extremely rare cases where the person has <span style="color:#ff6600;"><strong>fled from an oppressive Muslim ruler</strong></span> who wants to kill him, or he wants to do something to him that he can’t handle, and he could not find a land where he is safe from the evil of this oppressor other than a land of disbelief. This is a rare case, otherwise, the Islaamic countries are many, however, sadly you find many of these people who flee from their oppressive rulers choose the countries of disbelief over the Muslim countries without necessity. They only desire easy living and luxury, and Allaah is the one whose help is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever the case may be, it is upon these people who are excused to avoid falsehood and the people of falsehood, and stay far away from the tribulations as much as they are able to do so, and it is upon them to hold firm to the truth and the Sunnah in those lands which they were forced to stay in. And we ask Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) for grace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, it is upon the Muslims to help their brothers who are not able to make hijrah, while they are in the circumstance where it is obligatory, with everything they can, so they can rescue them from the situation they are in. Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) says in His Noble Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Help you one another in righteousness and piety; but do not help one another in sin and transgression.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Maaidah (5):2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) is the one who said, <strong>“One of you doesn’t believe until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.”</strong> (This hadeeth is) agreed upon (by al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) from the hadeeth of Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, in Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah on the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> “Whoever relieves a believer of an anxiety from the anxieties of this life, Allaah will relieve him of an anxiety from the anxieties of the day of resurrection, and whoever makes things easy for the mu’sir (the one who is in financial straights and is not able to repay his debt), Allaah will make things easy for him in this life and the next, and Allaah supports the slave when the slave supports his brother.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the condition on the one residing in those lands, it is that he have the ability to openly perform his deen, and perform the rituals of his deen, and openly profess it without hindrance. The second condition is that he feels safe for his deen, whereas he has enough knowledge and insight and strength of faith and contentment and conviction and firmness and composure that will help him to stand firm on his deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regards to the first condition, it is the one the Muslims focus on in order to justify them residing in the lands of disbelief, and most of their questions are about that while they are negligent when it comes to fulfilling the second condition, and at the same time the first condition, which is to be able to openly perform the deen in a manner which frees you from guilt, most of the people residing over there, this condition is not possible for them. For example, the Adhaan, to call it publicly out loud is prohibited over there as is well known, and it is from the important rituals of our deen. The Permanent Committee of Scholars (in Saudi Arabia) gave a legal verdict that: “<strong>Whoever is not able to call the Adhaan out loud then he has failed to openly perform the rituals of the deen, and it is upon him to make hijrah</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the second condition, which is that, the resident feels safe for his deen, do we truly believe that there is anyone over there who is able to feel safe for his deen, and stand firm upon it with all those tremendous causes of corruption that exist over there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">In brief, in residing in the lands of disbelief there is tremendous danger for the belief of the Muslim and for his deen and for his character</span>. Over there the causes of disbelief and sin are strong and many and of various kinds, and add to that the weakness the Muslims over there have in adhering to their deen. Look how he and his family are brought up amongst the disbelievers and how they then acquire their despicable character and their evil habits. Rather, at times they get affected by them in beliefs and types of worship. So he who lives in those corruptive, bestial societies, he does not take interest in his deen, nor does he take it into account, nor does he pay attention to its commands and its good manners. How sad it is!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How can his soul feel at ease about residing in the land of disbelief in which the rituals of disbelief are publicized, and the unlawful things and despicable things are considered lawful, and in which every wicked person is deemed good, and in which every forbidden act is performed, and in which every secret thing is brought out into the open, and over there every evil and abomination is at hands reach. How can the soul of the Muslim feel at ease about being in a land in which the rule is for other than Allaah and His Messenger (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa ‘Alaa Aalihi Wa Sallam). He hears that, and witnesses it, and touches it, and then he persists to remain there with his children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is upon the Muslims to beware of the plots, and conspiracies, and plans, and schemes of the enemies of Islaam which aim to turn the Muslims away from their deen and weaken their adherence to it. We must be alert, and we must also ask ourselves: <strong>Why did the enemies of Islaam open their lands to the Muslims?</strong> So they can reside there, and work there, and study there, and amuse themselves and stroll about there? Did they do that because of their love for the Muslims? Did they do that out of desire for their wealth or for their need for laborers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer: No! By Allaah! They didn’t do that because of their love for the Muslims, for verily they harbor in their hearts hatred and enmity. Also, they opened up their lands to the poor Muslims and the weak Muslims, so this shows us they are not ambitious for their wealth. Also, it is well known that they have unemployment, so they are not in need of laborers. Rather, the goal from that is to attempt to turn the Muslims away from their deen, and to corrupt the Muslims, and wipe out the Muslims’ identity over there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allaah, O my brothers in Allaah’s deen, they envy us because of this deen, and because of this good that we live in, and they are extremely eager for us to become like them in disbelief and misguidance and decadence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says in His Noble Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“They wish that you disbelieve, as they have disbelieved, so you all become equal.”</span></strong> &#8211; An-Nisaa (4):89</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Subhaanahu) is the one who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“The Jews and the Christians will not be pleased with you until you follow their religion.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Baqarah (2):120</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Subhaanahu) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“&#8230; and they will not cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion if they can.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Baqarah (2):217</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are bent on making evil and discomfort reach the Muslims. They are saddened by the good that reaches the Muslims, and they rejoice at the calamity that befalls them. Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) has exposed them in His Book, and He has disclosed that which they conceal in their hearts. He (‘Azza Wa Jall) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, take not as your advisors those outside your religion since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed, We have made plain to you the proofs if you understand.” </span></strong>&#8211; Aal Imraan (3):118</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says in His Noble Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Should they gain the upper hand over you, they would behave to you as enemies, and stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you with evil, and they desire that you disbelieve.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Mumtahanah (60):2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they, O my brothers in Allaah’s deen, they have not justify the Muslims alone in their (the Muslims’) own lands and inside their own houses, so how much more with someone who lives amongst them, and with someone who goes to them? No doubt, they will not leave off any means or path that leads to diverting him from his deen except that they will implement that. They have plots for that, and tricks, and secret means, and apparent means. There is a war against Islaam and the Muslims, and there are plots, day and night. So because of that they aspire to carry out these schemes on the Muslims with all the might they have and they spend large amounts of money and take great efforts to achieve that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, they have plans to convert people to Christianity in their lands and in the Muslim lands. They have revealed those plans in many Muslim lands like Indonesia, and the Philippines, and Sudan, and Bangladesh, and Uganda, and other Islaamic lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They use as a means to do that giving charity to the weak Muslims by building schools and hospitals, and also by forming what are called organizations for humanity, and there goal is not to benefit the Muslims, nor develop the Muslim societies, there goal in that is only to destroy the Muslims’ character and destroy the Muslims’ intellect and break the relationship the Muslims have with their Lord, Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) and give free rein to their desires. So we must beware of these plans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In brief, residing in the land of disbelief has evil consequences, and it has bad effects on the Muslim’s deen, and this deen is the capital wealth of the righteous slave in this life. So I ask you by Allaah, is there anyone residing in the lands of disbelief who has realized At-Taqwaa (piety and fear of Allaah), and has become from the Muttaqeen (the devout ones who fear Allaah), and thus has performed the commands, and has stayed away from the prohibitions in his eating, and drinking, and in his clothing, and in his house, and in his street, and in his market, and in his school, and in his job.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is rare that you find someone who has realized At-Taqwaa and has truly become from the Muttaqeen, those who hasten to carry out the commands and stay away from the prohibitions. Rather, how many are the sins which the Muslims over there live in, and infatuation and love of the dunyaa (worldly pleasures), and being attached to it, and putting it before obedience to Allaah and His Messenger, for the disbelievers, as is well known, the splendor of this life has been granted to them, however, it is a small pleasure, and a short lived pleasure designed for tribulation, and test, and trial. Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Let not the free disposal (and affluence) of the disbelievers throughout the land deceive you. A brief enjoyment; then, there ultimate abode is hell, and worst indeed is that place for rest.”</span></strong> &#8211; Aal Imraan (3):196-197</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Subhaanahu) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Do they think that We enlarge them in wealth and children. We hasten unto them with good things (in this life so that they will have no share of good things in the Hereafter). Nay, but they perceive not.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Mu&#8217;minoon (23):55-56</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Ta’ala) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“We shall gradually seize them with punishment in ways they perceive not. And I respite them; certainly My plan is strong.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-A’raaf (7):182-183 and Al-Qalam (68):44-45</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim over there gets amazed and dazzled by the civilization of the disbelievers and by the material goods of the disbelievers which leads to glorifying them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, (there is) the temptation of the women. It is well known the nudity, and the decadence, and the lack of morals, and the lack of values in those bestial societies. They have no deen, no shame, no morals, no obstacles, nothing preventing them from the forbidden things, and the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam), he is the one who said as has been transmitted in the two Saheehs from the hadeeth of ‘Usaamah, “<strong>I have not justify a fitnah (trial) more harmful on the men than the women.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the hadeeth of Abu Sa’eed on the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) which has been transmitted by Imaam Muslim,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, the dunyaa (this life) is sweet and succulent, and indeed Allaah has made you successors to one another in it, so beware of the dunyaa, and beware of the women, for verily the first fitnah (trial/temptation) for the children of Israa&#8217;eel was in the women.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) statement,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I have not seen from the females who are deficient in their intellect and deen she who has more power to take away the heart of the prudent man than one of you.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The highlight is that the Muslim over there is in serious danger, he, and his family, and his children. It has to amaze you how can the Muslim feel safe for his children, boys and girls, in those societies, in the schools, and in the streets, and in the different sections of town, and in the roads, everywhere! These little ones who are like moths, they don’t distinguish between that which is beneficial and that which is harmful, nor between guidance and misguidance, nor between what is permissible and what is forbidden. Rather, whoever directs them to the path of good, they follow it by the success granted by Allaah, and likewise, whoever directs them to the path of evil, they, in most cases, rush to it, except for he who Allaah protects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the infant over there from his infancy is being led to that which has evil in it, and that which has corruption in it, and to decadence, and to being detached from the deen, and from morals, and from modesty. From kindergarten to the highest grades; while it is incumbent upon those in charge of their affairs to fear Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) in dealing with these offspring and these families, and they must take care of the responsibility facing their children and their families, and they must show them the path to paradise and help them follow that path, and it is also upon them to warn them from the path to the fire, and warn them from these paths, and help them to leave alone these paths, and help them to stay far away from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also upon them to raise their children a righteous upbringing, and bring them up in a good way, and order them to observe the Islaamic rituals and codes of behavior, and it is also upon them to forbid them from despicable forms of behavior and the forbidden things and all means which lead to that, and that is not possible except by keeping them far away from evil companions, and far away from criminal groups and places of corruption. It is also upon them to implant in them outstanding character. All of that must be done in compliance with the statement of Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe! Ward off from yourselves and your families a Fire (Hell) whose fuel is men and stones.”</span></strong> &#8211; AtTahreem (66):6</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam), he is the one who said, <strong>“Each one of you is a herdsman, and each one of you is responsible for his flock.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I ask you, by Allaah, is the one who resides over there able to do that with his family and his children, or is it the reality that the Muslim over there is subject to the systems of the disbelievers and to the laws of the disbelievers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Over there he does not have true authority over them (his family). Rather, how often are the incidents of rebellion, and dispute, and quarrel between the man and his family, for verily if he does not respond to their demands, the disbelieving police force is the judge, and because of that you notice that he sees the abomination and the indecency in his family, and he is not able to do anything about it. O how distressing it is! O how sad it is!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from the dangers is the existence of complete social intercourse with the disbelievers which causes him and them to come closer together, and brings about love through the perception that he is a fellow citizen, and this is a dangerous matter because it is incumbent upon the Muslim to hate the disbelievers because they are the enemies of Allaah, and the enemies of His Messenger, and the enemies of Islaam and the Muslims. Allaah has ordered that, and He has warned against loving them and befriending them. He (‘Azza Wa Jall) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“You (O Muhammad) will not find any people who believe in Allaah and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger (Muhammad), even though they were their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kindred (people). For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Rooh (proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself.”</span></strong> &#8211; AlMujaadilah (58):22</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (‘Azza Wa Jall) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Let not the believers take the disbelievers as Auliyaa (supporters, helpers, etc.) instead of the believers, and whoever does that will never be helped by Allaah in any way, except if you indeed fear a danger from them. And Allaah warns you against Himself (His Punishment), and to Allaah is the final return.”</span></strong> &#8211; Aal Imraan (3):28</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitaanah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends, etc.) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely.”</span></strong> &#8211; Aal Imraan (3):118</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Subhaanahu) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyaa (friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), they are but Auliyaa to one another. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliyaa, then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allaah guides not those people who are the wrong-doers.”</span> </strong>&#8211; AlMaa&#8217;idah (5):51</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our Lord (Subhaanahu) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“You see many of them taking the disbelievers as their Auliyaa (protectors and helpers). Evil indeed is that which their ownselves have sent forward before them, for that (reason) Allaah’s Wrath fell upon them and in torment they will abide.”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Maa&#8217;idah (5):80</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our Lord (Subhaanahu) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibraaheem (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: ‘Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allaah, we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you, hostility and hatred for ever, until you believe in Allaah Alone.’”</span></strong> &#8211; Al-Mumtahanah (60):4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he (the Muslim) loves them, then, no doubt, he will agree with them, and follow in their footsteps, and blindly follow them and imitate them, while the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam), he is the one who said, “<strong>Whoever imitates a people then he is from them</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from the evils of residing in the lands of the disbelievers is, in doing so, their masses are increased, and their societies are stimulated, and it also strengthens their economy, while we are ordered to irritate them, and show enmity to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In brief, it is almost impossible for the Muslim to feel safe for his deen in most lands of disbelief. Add to that, the enemies of Islaam over there who are eager to make the Muslim doubt about his deen, and his creed, and his faith in his Lord and His Messenger. And it is known that faith does not accept doubt, rather, it is the certain belief. So if the Muslim becomes doubtful, and uncertain, and irresolute about that which it is incumbent upon him to be firmly convinced about, then he, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, becomes a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They spread their specious arguments, and their falsehood, and their ways of skepticism everywhere, and with every means, and because of that, it is from the conditions of the one residing in those lands that he feel safe for his deen, and this does not happen except if he learns his deen with its proofs, and evidences and arguments, so he will be able to defend it, and so he can refute the specious arguments of the disbelievers which they have spread everywhere. Yes, it is upon him to have knowledge of the legislation and know that which will enable him to distinguish between truth and falsehood, so he won’t be deceived by the falsehood and the people of falsehood, and so the truth won’t be made obscure to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is a must that the Muslim have knowledge to protect himself from the specious arguments, and so he can use it to protect himself from disbelief and disobedience. It is well known that the hearts are weak, and the specious arguments are strong and grabbing, and when it was the case that most of the people going and residing over there were not strong in deen, and were lacking in knowledge and insight, many of them returned to us with something different from what he went with. He would return deviant in his deen, and in his manners and behavior. He would return as a sinful person, far astray, rather, some of them would return, and Allaah’s refuge is sought, as an apostate disbelieving in his deen, the deen of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, he would also disbelieve in the rest of the religions whereas he would be upon total disbelief, and he would mock the people of Islaam. He would return imitating the destructive ideology of the disbelievers, and he would follow their way in lifestyle, and in clothing, and in appearance, and in all of their affairs, and they would become spokesmen for the enemies of Islaam in the lands of the Muslims. So it is upon every Muslim to strive to reside in the lands of Islaam in which the abominations are few in comparison to the lands of disbelief. Indeed, in that is good for him, and security and protection for his deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nevertheless, we would like to point out, it is possible that there exists remote lands of disbelief in which the Muslim is able to openly perform his deen, and openly perform the rituals while feeling safe for himself from tribulations, so if there are lands of disbelief out there upon this description, then Al-Hijrah from it is mustahab (highly recommended) for the Muslim, and residing there is makrooh (disliked). However, as is well known, most of the lands of disbelief in the east and the west are not like that.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 17:</strong> Moving from one land of disbelief to another land of disbelief where there is less tribulation</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Some of the Salafees travel from one land of disbelief to another land of disbelief with the argument that the Salafee da’wah there is stronger, like those who go from France to Britian, and they don’t make hijrah to an Islaamic land. So is this practice permissible according to the legislation, and what is your advice to these people?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer (by Shaykh ‘Abdur Rahmaan al-‘Adanee) :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If these people who do that are able to make hijrah to the land of Islaam then this act of theirs does them no benefit and this doesn’t remove them from the disobedient act and the sin. As for, if they are not able to make hijrah to the land of Islaam and they are from the people who have excuses, those who were previously mentioned in the <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/questions-and-answers-concerning-al-hijrah-shaykh-abdur-rahmaan-al-adanee.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>answer to the sixth question</strong></a>, then this act is alright and it is a good thing, and it has a basis in the Sunnah as some of the Muslims made hijrah from Makkah by the order of the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) to the lands of Al-Habasha. So in this act of theirs, moving from a land of shirk to a land of shirk that has less evil and less danger on the Muslim, it is said: “With evil there is a choice”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(and as the poet said):<br />
Have mercy, for some evil is lesser than others</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is if in reality the land of Britian has less evil and less danger on the Muslim than France, otherwise, this act of theirs is just a burden on one’s self by crossing long distances and the burden of moving, and Allaah is the one whose help is sought. This, as you have heard, is if they are not able to make hijrah to the lands of Islaam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question 5: </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The rule defining which land it is obligatory to make hijrah from</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“What is the rule defining the land in which it is obligatory to make hijrah from?”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has already preceded that <em>hijrah</em> is made from the land of disbelief to the land of Islaam, so if what is meant by this question, is an explanation and clarification of the rule defining the land of <em>shirk</em> or disbelief then the Scholars have many interpretations defining that rule.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most famous rule amongst the Scholars defining the land of <em>shirk</em> and the land of disbelief is: ‘The land in which <em>shirk</em> or disbelief is in the open and predominant,’ as has been mentioned in ‘<em>Sharh Al-Iqnaa</em>’ by al-Buhootee, and in the <em>fataawa</em> (legal verdicts) of Ash-Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Ibraaheem, and in the <em>fataawa</em> of Ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz, may Allaah have mercy upon all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ash-Shawkaanee (<em>Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala</em>) has also mentioned in his book ‘<em>AsSail Al-Jarraar</em>’ a rule defining the land of disbelief, and the land of shirk, and also the land of Islaam. He (<em>Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“What is considered is, who’s word is predominant. If the commands and prohibitions in the land belong to the people of Islaam, then it is a land of Islaam, and that ruling is not impaired by the appearance of certain traits of disbelief because they didn’t appear by means of the might and force of the disbelievers as is witnessed in <em>Ahl Adh-Dhimmah</em> (those disbelievers who pay a tax to live in the Muslim lands) from the Jews and Christians, and in the <em>Muaahadoon</em> (those who have a pact with the Muslims) who reside in the Islaamic cities, and if the situation is opposite to that, the land takes the opposite ruling.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, there is a nice discussion by Ash-Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala) in his explanation to ‘Al-Usool AthThalaathah’. He (Rahimahullaah) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And the land of shirk is the one in which the rituals of disbelief are performed and the rituals of Islaam, such as the Adhaan (call to prayer), and the Salaah (prayer) in congregation, and the ‘Eed prayers, and Jumu’ah (Friday prayers) are not performed in a general universal manner.” </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“We only said: ‘in a general universal manner’ in order to exclude those places in which these rituals are performed in a limited way like the lands of the disbelievers that have Muslim minorities, for verily they don’t become the lands of Islaam by the Islamic rituals that the Muslim minorities perform therein. As for the lands of Islaam, they are the lands in which these rituals are performed in a general universal manner.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement of Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala), could be used to refute that which al-Maawardee mentioned. He is a Shaafi&#8217;ee Scholar who said, “<em>If he is able to openly perform the deen in a land from the lands of disbelief, then that land has become a land of Islaam, and therefore, residing in it is better than leaving it because of the hope that others will enter Islaam</em>.” Ibn Hajar (Rahimahullaah) reported that on him. So the statement of Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (Rahimahullaah) could be used as a refutation against what al-Maawardee (Rahimahullaahu Ta’ala) mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the rule defining the land of shirk and the land of disbelief from which hijrah is obligatory upon whoever is not able to openly perform his deen, nor perform the rituals therein.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question 7</strong>: <strong>The ruling on working and studying in the lands of disbelief</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Is residing in the lands of disbelief for work and study from the exceptions to this?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regards to working and gathering money, the discussion about the danger of the Muslim staying in the land of disbelief has already preceded, so it is upon the Muslim to strive to save himself, and protect his deen and guard himself against the tribulations, for that, by Allaah, is better than the dunyaa and what is in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, it is upon the Muslim to strive to remain in the lands of Islaam, even if the income there is small. Rather, it is upon him to rely on Allaah, and think good of Allaah, and ask Allaah to bless that which He provides him, for indeed blessing is from Allaah. How many people, their incomes are limited, however, they are at ease, and in a state of peacefulness, and happiness and blessing, while on the contrary, how many people have gone to the lands of disbelief to gather money and to compete with the people of the dunyaa in their dunyaa, then you find them in a state of loss and need, even if they possess millions, and build buildings, and buy fancy cars. You find them in a state of misery and unhappiness. This is the norm for the one who strives to compete for dunyaa, that he (will) be in a state of grief, and sorrow, and fatigue, and misery and distress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Maajah has transmitted the hadeeth of Zaid Ibn Thaabit on the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever has the dunyaa be his main concern, Allaah will make his affair fall apart, and He will put poverty before his eyes, and only that which has been written for him from the dunyaa will come to him, and whoever has the next life as his determination, Allaah will put together for him his affair, and He will put wealth in his heart, and the dunyaa will be forced to come to him.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth is saheeh, and we benefit from this hadeeth that Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) punishes he who strives to obtain dunyaa and gather it even if it costs him his deen. Allaah makes his affair fall apart, and puts Him in disarray and in fear of want and poverty despite the fact that he works morning and evening, and toils night and day. Some of them neglect the rights of his wife and children, rather, he is also negligent in his forms of worship and religious obligations, and at the same time, the only provision from the dunyaa that will come to him is that which Allaah has decreed for him, not what he himself wants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (‘Azza Wa Jall) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَّن كَانَ يُرِيدُ الْعَاجِلَةَ عَجَّلْنَا لَهُ فِيهَا مَا نَشَاءُ لِمَن نُّرِيدُ ثُمَّ جَعَلْنَا لَهُ جَهَنَّمَ يَصْلَاهَا مَذْمُومًا مَّدْحُورًا</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Whoever wishes for the quick-passing (transitory enjoyment of this world), We readily grant him what We will for whom We like. Then, afterwards, We have appointed for him Hell, he will burn therein disgraced and rejected, (far away from Allaah’s Mercy).”</strong> </span>&#8211; Al-Israa (17):18</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he will only get from the dunyaa, that which Allaah wants and wills for him, not what that person wants, and decides, and desires and wishes for. So it is upon the slave to strive to obey Allaah and His Messenger, and stay away from the tribulations, and occupy himself with worship, and exert himself wholeheartedly for Allaah, for verily if he does that, then Allaah (Subhaanahu Wa Ta’ala) will bless him in his provision, and He will put satisfaction in his heart, and if not, if he does contrary to that, then let him expect the opposite of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haakim has transmitted with a saheeh chain on Ma’qil Ibn Yasaar on the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Your Lord (Tabarak Wa Ta’ala) says: ‘O son of Adam, devote yourself to worshipping Me, I will fill your heart with wealth (satisfaction), and I will fill your hands with provision. O son of Adam, don’t move away from Me, (if you do so) I will fill your heart with poverty, and I will fill your hands with work.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So every Muslim must beware of subjecting his deen to tribulation because of some limited amount of money that he gathers. A group of the people of knowledge has mentioned that remaining in the lands of the disbelievers for the purpose of working is from those things which are forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for going to the lands of disbelief to study, it has preceded that from the conditions for the one residing over there is that he is able to perform his deen, and openly perform it, and also that he feel safe for his deen and for himself, and this, in reality, is not being fulfilled with most of the students.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In studying with them there is great danger for the deen and character of the students, while most of the students are negligent when it comes to learning their deen, and they have weakness in differentiating between good and bad, and between that which is beneficial and that which is harmful, and between right and wrong, and between misguidance and guidance and between that which is meager and that which is stout, so over there they are prey for the enemies of Islaam because they are under the supervision of the disbelievers, and under the instruction and education of the disbelievers, so what do we expect after that?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, in most cases the student looks up to his teacher and respects him, and his heart leans toward him, and when that happens he copies his ideas and follows him in his character and his behavior, thus he does not return to his country except that he has abandoned his deen. It is rare that the student over there escapes sins, and disobedient acts, and the different types of abominations and sins and disobedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a very important point that the Muslims must be aware of, and those who want to go over there must beware of. Is it perceivable that there exists education in those lands far free from having acts forbidden by the Islamic legislation like intermingling (of men and women) and other things?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So due to this, it is upon the Muslim to strive to study in the land of Islaam so he can feel safe in the lands of Islaam for his deen and his character. Also, there exists in the lands of Islaam different types of studies which suffices having to go to the lands of the disbelievers, although we point out that the places of education that contain acts forbidden by the Islamic legislation, like intermingling and other things, it is not permissible to enroll in them, whether they are in the land of disbelief or in the land of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">If someone were to say, “What if the field of study is something that is needed, and it does not exist in the lands of Islaam, is it permissible to go to the lands of disbelief?”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer: this is not permissible, going to their lands, even if the type of knowledge is something needed and it does not exist in the lands of the Muslims because in that there is danger for the students as you have heard, and also, if we were to refrain from studying this matter that the Muslims need, is straying from the truth going to occur because of that? Or is the worst that will occur is deprivation and some extra effort, contrary to the Muslims need for knowledge of the Islamic legislation and the beneficial knowledge, for verily if they were to leave that, straying from the truth would befall them as the Prophet (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi Wa Sallam) has informed of as is mentioned in the two Saheehs from the hadeeth of ‘Abdullaah Ibn ‘Amr:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not seize the knowledge by snatching it from the breasts of men, rather He seizes the knowledge by the death of the Scholars, then when He doesn’t let a Scholar remain, the people will take ignorant people as their leaders, so they will be asked, and they will give legal verdicts without knowledge, so they will go astray and they will lead others astray.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus if the knowledge of the legislation does not exist, then straying and misguidance occurs in the Muslim societies. As for the knowledge of worldly affairs, the worst that could happen to them is some extra effort, although, as we have mentioned, the types of knowledge which the Muslims need exist in the lands of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, look at the evil consequences that have occurred in the ranks of the Muslims because of them sending their children to go study with the disbelievers, and that could be because of a legal opinion of some of the people of knowledge, however, look at the tremendous evils. What have the Muslims benefited from their children going to the lands of disbelief? If we were to look at the evil consequences we would find them to be many and tremendous.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shaykh</em> is from the senior scholars of our time, from the students of <em>Ash-Shaykh Muqbil ibn Hadi&#8217; al-Wad&#8217;ee</em> <em>(rahimahullaah)</em>and is in charge of <em>Dar-ul-Hadeeth, Baalfeewush, </em>in<em> &#8216;Aden, Yemen</em>. <em>Shaykh &#8216;AbdurRahmaan</em> is highly praised as an <em>&#8216;Alim</em> of <em>Ahl Sunnah</em> by <em>Shaykh Rabee&#8217; al-Madkhalee</em>, <em>Shaykh &#8216;Ubayd al-Jaabiree</em>, <em>Shaykh Muhammad ibn Hadi al-Madkhalee</em>, <em>Shaykh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul Wahhaab al-Wasaabee</em> (May <strong>Allaah</strong> preserve them all) and many others.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah</strong> says in His Book,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Say: Are they equal, those who have knowledge and those who do not? But only the men of understanding will take admonition.&#8221;</span> [Soorah Zumar 39:9]</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">“<strong>Allaah</strong> will raise up in degrees those of you who believe and those who have been granted knowledge.&#8221;</span><br />
[Soorah al-Mujaadalah 58:11].</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is only those who possess knowledge amongst His slaves that fear <strong>Allaah</strong>&#8220;</span><br />
[Soorah Faatir 35:28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> asserted,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;" align="center"><span style="color:#008000;">“The superiority of the scholar over the worshiper is like that of the moon over the rest of the stars.”</span><br />
[Abu Dawood and Tirmidhee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, those who have also been described as the ‘inheritors of the prophets’ by our Noble Messenger<em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam)</em> hold an honourable and lofty station in the deen of <em>Islaam</em>. They are those who clarify the affairs of the religion to us and teach us that which will aid us in this life and the next. Therefore, it is incumbent upon us to recognize this high rank of theirs and give them their due right and not fall short in this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Imaam Ahmad (rahimahullaah)</em> beautifully described the reality of the scholars in the following,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“All Praise is for <strong>Allaah</strong> Who, in every age and interval between the Prophets, raises up a group from the People of Knowledge who call the misguided to guidance and patiently bear ill-treatment and harm. With the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> they give life to the dead, and by <strong>Allaah&#8217;s</strong> light they give sight to the blind. How many a person killed by <em>iblees</em> have they revived. How many people astray and wandering have they guided. How beautiful their effect has been upon the people, and how vile people have been towards them. They repel from the Book of <strong>Allaah</strong> the alterations of those going beyond bounds, the false claims of the liars and the false interpretations of the ignorant ones-those who uphold the banner of innovation and let loose the trials and discords.”<strong> [Ar-Radd &#8216;alal-Jahmiyyah waz-Zanaadiqah of Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our <em>Shaykh ‘Abdur Rahmaan al-Adani (hafidhahullaah)</em> will admonish us regarding this affair and by the Permission of <strong>Allaah</strong> cause us to truly understand and respect the honourable status of our scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to grant us beneficial knowledge and to place in our hearts sincere love for the<em> ‘ulamaa`</em> of<em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em>.</p>
