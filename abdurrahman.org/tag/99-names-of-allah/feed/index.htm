<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> [Allaah] is <strong><em>al-Qaahir</em></strong> </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em> </em><strong>above His slaves</strong>.</span><br />
[Qur’aan<em>, Soorat Al-An’aam </em>(6:18)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah is <em>al-Qaahir</em></strong>: The Most Mighty and the Magnificent, is <strong>dominant</strong> over all his slaves being Himself above creation, the Ever-living, the Mighty, and the AllPowerful. He is the One who <strong>subdued</strong> all of his creatures; everything in the upper and lower worlds is subservient to His Will, and Authority; whatever He willed to happen will certainly occur and as He wanted it to be, and whatever He willed not to occur will never take place; All creatures are in need of Him, they have no control of good or harm to themselves; nor can they control death nor life nor Resurrection. The most powerful creature is nothing before the domination and power of Allaah, the AllMighty; the creatures which people have taken as “gods” besides Allaah, cannot protect themselves let alone to dominate others. Allaah, the perfect is His domination deserves to be worshipped alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah</strong> is the ‘<em>alam</em> (identifying name or title) of the majestic, sole, and true God. This noun, which is the name of Allaah, applies to none other than Him. He, Most Majestic and High, has other names all of which follow on from His name Allaah. The meaning of the name “Allaah” is the <em>ma’looh</em> (that which is worshipped out of love, magnification, deification, and longing).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[See Shaykh Muhammad Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharhul ‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> (Dammaam, KSA: Daar Ibnul Jawzi, 2d. ed. 1415/1994], p. 38, and <em>Sharh Lum’at Al-’Itiqaad</em> (<em>Ismaa’eeliyyah</em>, Egypt: MaktabatulImaam al-Bukhaari (checked by Ashraf Maqsood), 1412/1992)], p. 29.]</span></p>
<p><b>Source</b> : From the eBook: <b><a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Tafseer Ayatul-Kursi</a></b> – By Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-’Uthaymeen (<em>rahimahullah</em>). With Related Points of Benefit From the Shaykh’s Commentary on Imaam ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Sharhul ’Aqeedatil-Waasitiyyah</em>, Prepared by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (<em>rahimahullah</em>)</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the name <em>Allaah,</em> <strong>Ibn ul-Qayyim</strong> said in <em>Midaarij us-Saalikeen:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The name <em>Allaah</em> indicates all of the perfect names and lofty attributes in all three ways of indication since it indicates His Divinity, which indicates affirmation of all the characteristics of divinity for Him along with negation of their opposites for Him. So, the attributes of divinity are the attributes of perfection being free from any likeness with the creation and free of any deficiency or imperfection.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the author of the explainer of <em>Kitaab at-Tawheed</em> in <em>Tayseer ul-`Azeez al-<u>H</u>ameed</em>, brings a quote from Ibn ul-Qayyim also with regard to the excellent qualities of the name <em>Allaah</em> that Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the particular virtues of the meaning of this name <em>Allaah</em> then in this regard the most knowledgeable of the creation <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“I could not praise You enough as You deserve, You are as You have praised Yourself.”</span></strong></p>
<p>[Reported by Muslim from the <u>h</u>adeeth of A’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anha</em>.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, so how could we enumerate the special virtues of the name of the One Who comprises every perfection unrestrictedly and every praise and commendation and every laudation and exaltation and all splendour and all perfection and all glory and all beauty and all good and all eminence and all generosity, excellence and goodness is for Him and is from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this name <em>Allaah</em> is not mentioned upon a small amount of something except that it causes it to increase. Nor is it mentioned in a state of fear except that it removes it. Nor is it mentioned upon any misfortune except that it relieves it. Nor in any state of anxiety and distress except that it brings relief. Nor upon any state of difficulty except that it brings ease to it. None who is weak resorts to it except that it brings strength to him. Nor anyone in a state of humiliation except that it brings honour to him. Nor anyone in poverty except that he is enriched. Nor anyone who feels estranged and uneasy except that it causes him to feel at ease. Nor is it mentioned by one who has been overcome except that it brings aid and victory for him. Nor by one who is in straitened circumstances except that his difficulty is removed. Nor is it mentioned by a fugitive except that he finds refuge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the name, meaning Allaah’s name <em>Allaah</em>, it is the name through which distress is removed through which the descent of blessings is sought and through which supplications are answered. Through it slips are corrected, sins are warded away and good deeds are brought closer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the name with which the earth and heavens were established and with which the revealed books were sent down and with which the messengers were sent. With it the legislated laws were prescribed, through it the prescribed punishments were established and with it <em>jihaad</em> was prescribed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through this name the creation will become divided into the fortunate and the wretched. With it the true and tremendous day is established and with it, the scales of justice are set up, the bridge laid down and the Paradise and the Fire established. With it, the Lord of all creation is worshipped and praised, for its right the messengers were sent and it will be asked about in the grave and for it, there will be the resurrection. Dispute is regarding it and judgement is to it and alliance and enmity are for it. Through it those who know it and establish its rights will be the fortunate ones and through it those who are ignorant of it and leave its rights will be the wretched ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the reason for creation and command and through it, they are established and confirmed and to it they arrive at a conclusion. So, the creation comes about through it, returns to it and exists because of it. So, there is nothing in creation and no command nor reward and no punishment except that it starts from it and ends with it. That is what brings it about and its reason. Then he quotes the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>رَبَّنَا مَا خَلَقْتَ هَٰذَا بَاطِلًا سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O our Lord, You have not created all of this without purpose, free and far removed are You from that. So save us from the punishment of the Fire.</span> </strong> (Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 191)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the name <strong>الله</strong>  <em>Allaah</em>, brief indication of the meaning which is – <strong>t</strong><strong>he One Who is truly venerated and worshipped, the One deserving that He be singled out with all worship because of His perfect attributes of divinity.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>الرَّحْمَان</strong> <strong><em>Ar-Rahmaan</em></strong> (the Extremely Merciful), the Merciful One Who has as His attribute mercy, the One possessing tremendous and extensive mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <strong>الرَّحِيم</strong>  <strong><em>Ar-Raheem</em></strong> (the Bestower of mercy), the One Who has mercy upon the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the verifier has mentioned, the difference between <em>Ar-Rahmaan </em>and <em>Ar-Raheem</em> is <em>Ar-Rahmaan</em> is with regard to the attribute of Allaah’s self, the attribute He has Himself of extreme mercy and <em>Ar-Raheem</em> is His bestowing mercy upon the creation with regard to His action.</p>
<p><strong>[Source</strong>: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/01/28/the-ninety-nine-names-of-allaah/">The Ninety-Nine Names of Allaah </a>– Dawud Burbank [Audio|En] &amp; Transcribed PDF]</p>
<p><strong>&#8212;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong>ar-Rahmaan</strong></em> (The One Who is Most Merciful): This is one of Allaah’s particular names and which denotes the attribute of very great and extensive mercy that exists with Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">[<span style="color:#808080;">See Ibnul Qayyim’s Badaai’ Al-Fawaa’id (Beirut, Lebanon: Daarul Khayr, 1st. ed. 1414/1994)], vol. 1, pp. 23-24, and Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s Sharhul <em>‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em>, ibid.</span>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ar-Raheem</strong> (The One Who Bestows Mercy): This name denotes that the attribute is related to the <em>marhoom</em> (i.e. the one whom Allaah chooses to receive His <em>Rahmah</em> (Mercy).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the difference between <em>ar-Rahmaan</em> and ar-Raheem is that in the case of the former, <em>ar-Rahmah</em> is His attribute, and in the latter, <em>ar-Rahmah</em> is His act, meaning that He is the One Who bestows <em>ar-Rahmah</em> upon others. So, when both names come together [i.e. <em>ar-Rahmaan</em>, <em>ar-Raheem</em>], then the meaning in this context is that Allaah’s Mercy is very great and extensive, and that His Mercy reaches His creation. This is what is meant by those who say that <em>ar-Rahmaan</em> is the One Whose Mercy encompasses everything (general Mercy), and <em>ar-Raheem</em> is the One who has Mercy upon the believers (special Mercy). Since Allaah’s Mercy upon the <em>kaafir</em> is a special one in this life only, then it is as if they have no mercy upon them, because in the Hereafter when they will ask Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) to save them from Hell and admit being wrong, Allaah will deal with them with His Justice, not His Mercy, Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>اخْسَئُوا فِيهَا وَلَا تُكَلِّمُونِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Remain you in it [Hell] with ignominy! And speak not to Me!”</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Mu’minoon</em> (23:108)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name <em>ar-Raheem</em> is applied to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) and may be applied to others. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has described His Messenger Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as <em>Raheem</em> (Soorat At-Tawbah, 9:128).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer (رحمه االله) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Some of the names of Allaah تعالى are restricted to Him only like the names: Allaah, <em>ar-Rahmaan</em>, <em>al-Khaaliq</em>, <em>ar-Raaziq</em> and so forth. Some other names, however, may be applied to other than Him.” </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[See <em>Badaai’ Al-Fawaa’id</em>, p. 24, <em>Sharhul ‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em>, pp. 38-39, <em>Lum’atul I’tiqaad</em>, p. 29, <em>Tafseer Ibn Katheer</em> (1:21), <em>Sharh Thalaathat Al-Usool</em> within Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Majmoo’ Fataawaa</em> (Riyadh, KSA: Daar Ath-Thuraya, 1st. ed. 1414/1993)], vol. 6, p. 11.</p>

If somebody intends to do a good deed and he does not do it, then Allaah, <em>al-Barr,</em> will write for him a full good deed in his account with Him; and if he intends to do a bad deed and he does not do it, then Allaah will write a full good deed in his account with Him. He loves piety towards Him, goodness, justice, righteousness, honesty, truthfulness, benevolent regard or conduct to parents and others, as well as every incumbent duty.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Decsription of the Names are transcribed from above Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1<sup>st</sup> Name: </strong><strong>الله</strong><strong> </strong><strong> <em>Allaah</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the name <em>Allaah,</em> Ibn ul-Qayyim said in <em>Midaarij us-Saalikeen:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The name <em>Allaah</em> indicates all of the perfect names and lofty attributes in all three ways of indication since it indicates His Divinity, which indicates affirmation of all the characteristics of divinity for Him along with negation of their opposites for Him. So, the attributes of divinity are the attributes of perfection being free from any likeness with the creation and free of any deficiency or imperfection.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the author of the explainer of <em>Kitaab at-Tawheed</em> in <em>Tayseer ul-`Azeez al-<u>H</u>ameed</em>, brings a quote from Ibn ul-Qayyim also with regard to the excellent qualities of the name <em>Allaah</em> that Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the particular virtues of the meaning of this name <em>Allaah</em> then in this regard the most knowledgeable of the creation <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“I could not praise You enough as You deserve, You are as You have praised Yourself.”</span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, so how could we enumerate the special virtues of the name of the One Who comprises every perfection unrestrictedly and every praise and commendation and every laudation and exaltation and all splendour and all perfection and all glory and all beauty and all good and all eminence and all generosity, excellence and goodness is for Him and is from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this name <em>Allaah</em> is not mentioned upon a small amount of something except that it causes it to increase. Nor is it mentioned in a state of fear except that it removes it. Nor is it mentioned upon any misfortune except that it relieves it. Nor in any state of anxiety and distress except that it brings relief. Nor upon any state of difficulty except that it brings ease to it. None who is weak resorts to it except that it brings strength to him. Nor anyone in a state of humiliation except that it brings honour to him. Nor anyone in poverty except that he is enriched. Nor anyone who feels estranged and uneasy except that it causes him to feel at ease. Nor is it mentioned by one who has been overcome except that it brings aid and victory for him. Nor by one who is in straitened circumstances except that his difficulty is removed. Nor is it mentioned by a fugitive except that he finds refuge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the name, meaning Allaah’s name <em>Allaah</em>, it is the name through which distress is removed through which the descent of blessings is sought and through which supplications are answered. Through it slips are corrected, sins are warded away and good deeds are brought closer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the name with which the earth and heavens were established and with which the revealed books were sent down and with which the messengers were sent. With it the legislated laws were prescribed, through it the prescribed punishments were established and with it <em>jihaad</em> was prescribed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through this name the creation will become divided into the fortunate and the wretched. With it the true and tremendous day is established and with it, the scales of justice are set up, the bridge laid down and the Paradise and the Fire established. With it, the Lord of all creation is worshipped and praised, for its right the messengers were sent and it will be asked about in the grave and for it, there will be the resurrection. Dispute is regarding it and judgement is to it and alliance and enmity are for it. Through it those who know it and establish its rights will be the fortunate ones and through it those who are ignorant of it and leave its rights will be the wretched ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the reason for creation and command and through it, they are established and confirmed and to it they arrive at a conclusion. So, the creation comes about through it, returns to it and exists because of it. So, there is nothing in creation and no command nor reward and no punishment except that it starts from it and ends with it. That is what brings it about and its reason. Then he quotes the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">رَبَّنَا مَا خَلَقْتَ هَٰذَا بَاطِلًا سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O our Lord, You have not created all of this without purpose, free and far removed are You from that. So save us from the punishment of the Fire. </strong></span> (Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 191)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the name <strong>الله</strong>  <em>Allaah</em>, brief indication of the meaning which is &#8211; <strong>t</strong><strong>he One Who is truly venerated and worshipped, the One deserving that He be singled out with all worship because of His perfect attributes of divinity. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the <strong>2<sup>nd</sup> name</strong> that the Shaykh quotes, <strong>الأحَد</strong>  <em>Al-A<u>h</u>ad</em> (the Unique), the One Who is alone and unique in every sense, the One alone in His oneness, in His self and in His attributes, alone in His divinity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 3<sup>rd</sup> name;</strong> <strong>الأعْلَى</strong><strong> </strong> <em>Al-A’laa</em> (the Most High), the One Who is above everything, having power and control over everything and the One Who is exalted above every deficiency.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 5<sup>th</sup> name;</strong> <strong>الإله</strong> <em>Al-Ilaah, </em>the One Who alone deserves to be worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 6<sup>th</sup> name; </strong><strong>الأوَّل</strong>  <em>Al Awwal</em> (the First) and this name, <strong>the 6<sup>th</sup></strong> and <strong>the 7<sup>th</sup></strong> and <strong>the 8<sup>th</sup></strong> and <strong>the 9<sup>th</sup></strong> <em>Al-Awwalu</em>, <em>W`al Aakhiru W`al Dhaahiru W`al Baatin</em>, the Shaykh has put most of the names as you can see in alphabetical order. These 4 names are out of alphabetical order and put together because they are all explained in an authentic <u>h</u>adeeth in <u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u> Muslim explained by Allaah’s Messenger himself <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Al Awwal</em> (the First), is the One Who was before everything without any beginning.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 13<sup>th</sup> name; </strong> <strong>التَّوَّاب</strong>  <em>At-Tawwaab</em> (the One Who guides His servants to repent and accepts their repentance), the One Who guides the servants that they should repent to Him, grants to them that they should repent and accepts their repentance again and again.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 14<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الجَبَّار</strong> <em>Al-Jabbaar</em> (the Exalted and Almighty Compeller), the One to Whose might everything in the creation submits and the exalted One Who rectifies the affairs of His creation for them and Who restores the weak and the broken-hearted.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 17<sup>th</sup> name;  </strong><strong>الحَفِيظ</strong>  <em>Al-<u>H</u>afeedh</em> (the Guardian), the One Who protects the servants from harm and Who perfectly preserves whatever deeds His servants have done, not losing any of their deeds and the One Who preserves and protects His beloved servants from falling into sins and from Satan.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 25<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>القَيُّوم</strong>  <em>Al-Qayyoom</em> (the Self-Subsisting One), upon Whom everything depends, the One Who sustains everything that exists, the One Who has no need whatever of anything but rather everything in existence has total need of Him.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 27<sup>th</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الخَالِق</strong> <em>Al-Khaaliq</em> (the Creator and Maker of everything), the One Who brought everything into existence after it had previously not existed, the One Who has always had the attribute of being the Creator even when there was no creation in existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That’s a fine point that Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah brings out and makes clear, “This was Allaah’s attribute always that He did not become the Creator when the creation came into existence, rather He has always been the Creator.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The 31<sup>st</sup> name;</strong>  <strong>الرَّحِيم</strong>  <em>Ar-Raheem</em> (the Bestower of mercy), the One Who has mercy upon the creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the verifier has mentioned, the difference between <em>Ar-Rahmaan</em> and <em>Ar-Raheem</em> is <em>Ar-Rahmaan</em> is with regard to the attribute of Allaah’s self, the attribute He has Himself of extreme mercy and <em>Ar-Raheem</em> is His bestowing mercy upon the creation with regard to His action.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>  </strong><strong>العَلِيم</strong> <em>Al-`Aleem</em> (the All-Knowing) and here we’ll quote quite a longest saying from Imaam Ahmad in explanation of <em>Al-`Aleem </em>found in the book <em>Ar-rad `ala al-Jahmiyyah</em> that he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He is the One Who knows everything in the seven heavens and the seven earths and whatever is between them and whatever is beneath the ground and whatever is in the depths of the oceans and who knows the place where every hair grows and every tree and the place where each leaf falls and the number of stones there are and the number of the grains of sand and the number of grains of soil and the weight of the mountains and all of the actions of the servants and the traces they leave behind and their speech and every breath they take, He knows everything, nothing is hidden from Him whilst He is upon the Throne above the seven heavens, He, the Perfect and Most High.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He knows whatever was, whatever is and whatever will be before it occurs and He knows the true and hidden reality of everything and He knows whatever is not going to be and how it would be if it were to exist and He has always been the All-Knowing, perfect in His knowledge.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Allāh is <em>As-Samad</em>” – Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Concerning his statement: &#8220;Allāh is <em>As-Samad</em>&#8220;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a clause of continuation, after He mentioned <em>Al-Ahadai&#8217;yyah</em> (the oneness), he mentioned <em>As-Samadiyyah</em>, and used a definite clause for both, to indicate exclusivity. That is Allah, alone, is <em>As-Samad</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What is the meaning of <em>As-Samad</em>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that As-Samad means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He is the Perfect One, in His Knowledge, His Power, His Wisdom, His ’<em>Izzah</em> (Honor and Might), His Sovereignty and in all His Attributes</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em> As-Samad</em> is the one who does not have any cavity</strong></span> &#8211; that is without intestines nor abdomen. That is why it is said: The Angels are <em>Samad</em> because they do not have cavities; they do not eat nor drink. This meaning is related from Ibn ’Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him.[1] And this does not negate the first meaning, because it indicates His self sufficiency from all of His creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is said: <em>As-Samad</em> has the meaning of the <em>Ma’ful</em> form, that is <em>Al-Masmudu ilaihi</em>;He who is betaken to by the creation of their needs, with the meaning that they incline to Him and they reach out for Him, and surrender their needs to Him. So it has the meaning of the everyone is in need of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These interpretations do not contradict one another in relation to Allah, the Mighty and Sublime, and as such we say that each of these meanings are affirmed due to the lack of contradiction among them. We interpret it with a comprehensive interpretation; we say As-Samad is the One Who is Perfect in His Attributes, the One whom all His creatures are in need of; they are dependent upon Him. Therefore, the tremendous meaning of the word As-Samad becomes clear to you. He is the One independent of any need from all other than Him, Perfect in all of What is attributed to Him, and that all other than Him is in need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If somebody says to you: “Allah rose above the Throne, does His rising above the Throne mean that He is in need of the Throne, such that if the Throne was removed, He would fall?” The answer is no! Never! Because Allah is <em>Samad</em>, perfect without need of the Throne. Rather the Throne, the heavens, the <em>Kursi</em> and all creatures are in need of Allah; He is independent of any need from them. We derive this from the word <em>As-Samad</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If somebody asks: &#8220;<strong>Does Allah eat and drink</strong>?&#8221; I say: Never; because Allah is <em>Samad</em>.” With this, we recognize that the word <em>As-Samad</em> is a word that covers all the perfect Attributes of Allah, and it relates to all the imperfect attributes of the creatures. That is why the are in need of Allah, the Mighty and Sublime.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>The following is Translated &amp; Compiled by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, Allaah is not ashamed to set forth a parable</span></strong>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Baqarah: 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – What is mentioned in the hadeeth of Ya’ala bin Umayyah <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> saw a man bathing at an open place where there was no partitioning and without a wrapping garment, so the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> climbed the <em>Mimbar</em>, and he praised Allaah and glorified Him and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Indeed Allaah <em>– Azza wa Jal –</em> is The Shy One, The One who Conceals, He loves modesty and covering up, so if one of you bathes (outside) then he should cover up.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Abu Dawood and Nisaa’ee – authenticated by Albaani in ‘Irwa’ no. 2335]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – The hadeeth of Salman <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>‘Indeed your Lord <em>– Tabaaraka wa Ta’ala –</em> is The Shy One, The Generous, Allaah is Shy from His slave if the slave raises his hands towards Him, that He would return them without anything.’</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi and Ibn Maajah – authenticated by Albaani in ‘Irwa’ no. 2335]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – The author Muhammad al-Hamood an-Najdi said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Know – may Allaah have mercy upon me and you – that the greatest modesty which is necessary to have is with Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>, He Who fluctuates His blessings and His virtue day and night. We cannot do without Him even for a blink of an eye. We are under His Hearing and Sight, and nothing of our condition, statements and actions is absent from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just like Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Whatever you (O Muhammad) may be doing, and whatever portion you may be reciting from the Qur’aan, – and whatever deed you (mankind) may be doing (good or evil), We are Witness thereof, when you are doing it. And nothing is hidden from your Lord (so much as) the weight of an atom on the earth or in the heaven. Not what is less than that or what is greater than that but is (written) in a Clear Record</span>.</strong> &gt;&gt; [Yunus: 61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Summarised from ‘an-Nahaj al-Asma’ fee Sharh ‘Asmaa Allaah al-Hussna 3/99-]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5  – Shaykh Muhammad Khaleel Haraas <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Name of Allaah Ta’ala <em>al-Hayyee</em> (The Shy One) is a Name which is appropriate to Him, and it is not like the <em>Hayya</em> (Modesty) of the creation, which is a change and effect, which seizes a person when he is frightened by that which brings him shame or fault.  Rather it is leaving that which is not appropriate with His abundant Mercy and His perfect Generosity and Kindness, and His great Pardoning and His Gentleness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the slave of Allaah openly sins even though modesty is the thing that he is in most need of, and modesty is the weakest thing he has, and he uses Allaah’s blessings to sin.  However, Allaah <em>– Subhanahu–</em> along with His perfection in not needing anything whatsoever and His complete ability over modesty, is shy from the slave from removing his veil and humiliating him, so Allaah covers up the slave with that which disguises him from the means of covering up, then after that Allaah pardons his sins and forgives them.  Just like the hadeeth of Ibn Umar <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">‘Indeed Allaah comes close to the believer, and covers him then asks him, between Himself and the slave: Did you not do such and such, on such and such day? Until the slave of Allaah acknowledges his sins, and is certain that he will definitely be destroyed and Allaah says to him: I covered up your sins in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and today I will forgive them for you.’</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Narrated by Bukhari and Muslim &#8211; Taken from ‘an-Nahaj al-Asma’ fee Sharh ‘Asmaa Allaah al-Hussna 3/103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allāh , may His Praise and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abd ur-Razzaaq al-Badr</strong> (hafidhahullaah) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Shaykh &#8216;Abd ur-Rahmaan bin Sa&#8217;dee</strong>, rahimahullaah, said: &#8216;Al-Fattaah has two meanings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">The first meaning</span> is: the One who judges between His slaves, and judges between them with His legislation and by rewarding those who obey (Him) and punishing those who disobey (Him) in the dunyaa and aakhira, as His, ta&#8217;aala, statement: <span style="color:#008000;">{Say: &#8216;Our Lord will assemble us all together (on the Day of Resurrection), then He will judge between us in truth. And He is the Just Judge, the All-Knower of the true state of affairs&#8217;}</span>, and His, ta&#8217;aala, statement: <span style="color:#008000;">{&#8216;Our Lord! Judge between us and our people in truth, for You are the Best of those who give judgment}</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">The second meaning</span> is: <em>the One who opens all doors of blessings for His slaves</em>. He, ta&#8217;aala, said: {Whatever Allaah grants to people of mercy &#8211; none can withhold it}. He grants benefits of the dunyaa and deen to His slaves, and opens the locks upon hearts for those whom He has favored with His Kindness and Care, and showers (the hearts) with knowledge and understanding from Him and realities of faith that rectifiy their conditions and by which they remain upon the Straight Path; and what&#8217;s more special is that He grants those who love Him and turn to Him knowledge from Him, spiritual conditions, shining lights and true understanding. And likewise <em>He</em> <em>opens for His slaves the doors of rizq (provision) and the paths of the means, and paves the way for provisions and the means to (these provisions) for the muttaqoon (those who fear Him) from where they can&#8217;t imagine, and gives the mutawakkiloon (those who put their trust in Him) beyond what they ask and hope for, and makes easy for them affairs that are difficult, and opens for them doors that are closed</em>.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Explaining the Meaning of <em>An-Nur</em> (The Light) – One of Allaah’s Names<br />
<span style="color:#333333;">Prepared by <strong>Dr. Saleh As-Saleh</strong> (<em>rahimahullah</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><iframe class="youtube-player" width="715" height="403" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1eaBiWCuC5E?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" style="border:0;" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"></iframe></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>An-Nur</em> (The Light) &#8211; Soorat <em>An-Nur</em> (Qur’aan 24:35):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">1-<em>An-Nur</em> is one of Allaah’s Names as well one of His Attribute, derived from His <em>Nur</em> (Light) which is an Attribute established with His <em>Thaat</em> (Essence)</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, (<em>Azzawajal</em>), said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>اللَّهُ نُورُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ<br />
</strong><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah is the Light (<em>Nur</em>) of the heavens and the earth</strong></span> [#2]<br />
[TMQ;An-Nur (24):35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Peace be upon him) used to invoke Allaah (<em>Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala</em>) upon starting the night prayers (<em>Tahajjud</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“All Praise is due to You; You are the Light of the heavens and the earth&#8230;”</span></strong>[#3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- “<strong>The texts from the Qur’aan and authentic Sunnah</strong> relate An-Nur to Allaah, according to the following angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First Angle</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a. That Allaah (<em>Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala</em>) has a <em>Nur</em> related (gr. conjugated) to Him as an Attribute of His <em>Thaat</em> [Essense], the same as His other Attributes of Life, Sight, Knowledge, Might, and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, Most Majestic and Most Magnificent, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَأَشْرَقَتِ الْأَرْضُ بِنُورِ رَبِّهَا</strong><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And the earth will shine with the Light of its Rabb </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Allaah–when He will come on the Day of Resurrection to judge among men)</span>&#8230;[TMQ; Az-Zumar (39): 69].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if the earth will shine with His Light, then He (<em>Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala</em>) is a <em>Nur</em> (Light) as stated by His Messenger, Muhammad (Peace be upon him): <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“You are the Light of the heavens and the earth&#8230;”</strong></span>[#4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b. That <em>An-Nur</em> relates to His most Honorable and Majestic Face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’oud (<em>radhi Allaahu anhu</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The light of the heavens and the earth is from the Light of His Face.”</strong> </span>[#5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c. Allaah’s Nur is also related (<em>mudaaf</em>) to the heavens and the earth as in His (<em>Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala</em>) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">اللَّهُ نُورُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ<br />
Allaah is the Light (Nur) of the heavens and the earth ..<br />
</span></strong>[TMQ; An-Nur (24): 35].[#6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">d. Light is Allaah’s Hijaab (Veil). The Prophet (<em>Peace be upon him</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Light is His Hijaab, If He uncovers it then the <em>subuhaat</em> (brightness, splendour, majesty, and greatness) of His Face would burn His creation so far as His Sight reaches.”</span></strong> [#7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The cases of the aforementioned angle represent situations in which the <em>sifah</em> (attribute) of <em>An-Nur</em> has been related to its <em>mawsoof</em> (what is being described) as Imaam Ibnul Qayyim رحمه الله تعالى classified them.[#8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Angle</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second angle is the <em>idaafah</em> (relating) of the <em>maf’uool</em> (object) to its <em>faa’il</em> (active subject).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibnul Qayyim said: “This is mentioned in the saying of Allaah, Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>اللَّهُ نُورُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ مَثَلُ نُورِهِ كَمِشْكَاةٍ فِيهَا مِصْبَاحٌ ۖ الْمِصْبَاحُ فِي زُجَاجَةٍ ۖ الزُّجَاجَةُ كَأَنَّهَا كَوْكَبٌ دُرِّيٌّ يُوقَدُ مِن شَجَرَةٍ مُّبَارَكَةٍ زَيْتُونَةٍ لَّا شَرْقِيَّةٍ وَلَا غَرْبِيَّةٍ يَكَادُ زَيْتُهَا يُضِيءُ وَلَوْ لَمْ تَمْسَسْهُ نَارٌ ۚ نُّورٌ عَلَىٰ نُورٍ ۗ يَهْدِي اللَّهُ لِنُورِهِ مَن يَشَاءُ ۚ وَيَضْرِبُ اللَّهُ الْأَمْثَالَ لِلنَّاسِ ۗ وَاللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ عَلِيمٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The parable of His Light is as </strong>(if there were)<strong> a niche and within it is a lamp, and the lamp is in glass, the glass as it were a brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive, neither of the east</strong></span> [#9]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> nor of the west </strong></span>[#10]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>, whose oil would almost glow forth </strong>(of itself)<strong>, though no fire touched it. Light upon Light! Allaah guides to His Light whom he wills. And Allaah sets parables for mankind, and Allaah is the All-Knower of everything.”</strong> </span>[TMQ; An-Nur (24): 35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means: The parable of Allaah’s Light in the heart of his believing slave. The one having the greatest share of this Light is His Messenger Muhammad (Peace be upon him). This Light relates to Allaah تعالى being the One who grants and bestows it upon His slave. It is also related to the slave since he is its place (<em>mahalluhu</em>) and favorable recipient (<em>qaabiluhu</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This light has a:</p>
<ul>
<li>1-<em>faa’il</em> (active subject),</li>
<li>2-<em>qaabil</em> (recipient),</li>
<li>3-<em>mahal</em> (place),</li>
<li>4-<em>haamil</em> (carrier), and</li>
<li>5-and <em>maadah</em> (substance).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aayah above comprises all of these mattters in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>faa’il</em> (One Who does this) is Allaah, Most High, the One Who makes the lights to abound, Who guides to His Light whom He Wills.</li>
<li>The favorable recipient (<em>al-qaabil</em>) is the believing slave.</li>
<li>The place of reception (<em>mahal al-qubool</em>) is the believer’s heart.</li>
<li>The <em>haamil</em> (carrier) is his motivation, determination, and will.</li>
<li>The <em>maadah</em> (substance) is his sayings and actions.”[#11]</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The light which Allaah puts in the heart of the submitting Muslim is faith in Him, knowledge and love of Him, and remembrance of Him. It is His light (the Qur’aan) which He brought down, the origin of which is in the hearts of the Muslims. Its substance strengthens and increases until it appears on their faces, their limbs and their bodies, even on their clothes and in their homes. On the Day of Resurrection, this light emerges and runs forward before them [#12] amidst the darkness of the Bridge (Siraat)[#13] until they cross over it. The (intensity) of their lights on the Bridge will correspond to the intensity (strong or weak) of the repective lights in their hearts in the dunya (this life).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The similitude of this Light and its place, its carrier, and its substance is as the niche which is like the chest [of the believer]. Inside the niche there is a glass, from the most crisp and clear kind. [In the aayah] it is even made to resemble brilliant star in its clarity and purity. This glass resembles the heart [al-mahal]. The similitude to the glass is because it embodies qualities present in the heart of the believer: clearity, smoothness, and firmness. It sees the truth by virtue of its clarity; kindness, mercy and affection originate from it because of its smoothness; it stands firm in holding to the truth and it makes jihaad against the enemies of Allaah, due to the firmness in its structure&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In contrast with this enlightened heart, there are two other opposing and blameworthy hearts. One of them is stone-like, harsh, merciless, it lacks beneficience, reverence, and the clarity by which it can see the truth. In fact it is as an ignorant and a tyrant heart; it is neither aware of Allaah (the Truth) nor it is mercifull to the creation. Opposite to it, is a weak, watery, neither firm nor strong heart,… and everything (good, evil, wicked, etc.) that mixes with it, affects it in its own way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the glass there is a lamp and it is the light (an-nur) that is in the wick. The wick in the lamp is the light carrier (al-haamil), and the substance of the light is the olive oil, extracted from the olives of a tree growing in the most suitable place by being exposed to the sun rays all day long. Its oil is from the purest of its kind, clear without turbidity, to the degree that it will almost glow forth of itself. Similar to the olive oil is the substance of the believing heart. It is from the “tree” of Revelation:[#14] it is the greatest blessed thing and most distant from deviation. It is intermediate and, indeed, it is the most just and best of all matters. It did not deviate like the deviation of Christanity and Judaism. In all things it is bound to a medium course between these two blameworthy extremes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the clarity of this oil is so intense such that it almost glows by itself, and then upon mixing with fire its illumination as well as that of the fire’s substance of light intensifes, then this becomes light upon light.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Something similar happens to the believer. His heart is lit such that he almost knows the truth by means of his <em>fitrah</em> and intellect. His heart, however, has no <em>maadah</em> (substance) within itself. But when the <em>maadah</em> of the <em>al-Wahy</em> (Revelation) touches his heart and the latter rejoices in its company, its light [of <em>fitrah</em>] increases by the light of <em>al-Wahy</em>. The light of <em>al-Wahy</em> adds up to that of <em>fitrah</em> and it becomes a light upon light. So, the believer would almost speak the truth even though he may have not heard an evidence. He later   hears of the evidence to be identical to what has been attested to by his <em>fitrah</em>. Thus, it is being a light upon light. This is the status of the believer. He acknowledges the truth, in general, by means of his <em>fitrah</em>. He then hears of the textual proofs and [authentic] traditions presenting what he has acknowledged, but in details. His faith, therefore, stems from the attestation of <em>al-Wahy</em> and <em>fitrah</em>&#8230;” [#15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah, <em>An-Nur</em>, to enlighten my heart and yours, and to fill them with firm Eeemaan. He is the Most Generous, the Most Merciful.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[#1]TMQ: Translation of the meaning of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#2]In this <em>Aayah’s</em> construct, Allaah’s <em>Nur</em> is related (<em>mudaaf</em>) to <em>As-Samaawati wal Ard</em> (the heavens and the earth). Some had interpreted this aayah such that Allaah (<em>Azzawajal</em>), is the One Who illuminates (<em>Munawwir</em>) the heavens and the earth and guides their inhabitants. This is from His Actions, otherwise it does not preclude the fact that the <em>Nur</em>, which is one of His Attributes, is established with Him. It is common for the Salaf رحمهم الله تعالى , may Allaah’s Mercy be upon them, to mention all or some of the meanings of the attributes pertaining to Allaah&#8217;s Names. By mentioning some of the meanings they do not negate the other affirmed qualities of such names. As such, one of the meanings signified by Allaah being “<em>An-Nur</em> of the heavens and the earth” is that He has illuminated the heavens and the earth and guided their inhabitants by His Light. The saying that meaning is restricted to His illumination of the heavens and the earth by certain planets (sun, moon, stars), is wrong, because the illumination by their light does not cover the entire universe. [See Ibn Taymeeyah&#8217;s <em>al-Fatawaa</em>, 6: 390-393].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#3]For a full text of the Prophet’s invocation see <em>Saheeh Al-Bukhaari</em> (English/Arabic), V.9, <em>Hadeeth</em> # 482.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#4] Grammatically, the “Light” which is related (annexed) to Allaah in the construct of the <em>Aayah</em> (which means): “And the earth will shine with the Light of its <em>Rabb</em>&#8230;” is not an annexation denoting possession, creation, honor, or preferment as it is the case in many <em>aayaat</em> (Verses) of the Noble Qur’aan including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a. <em>Baytee</em> (My house), mentioned in the aayah (which means): That they (Ibraaheem and Ismaa’eel) may purify <em>Baytee</em> (My house, i.e the Ka’bah) for those who circel it, or stay (in <em>I’tikaaf</em> ), or bow, or prostrate themselves (near it, in prayer).” (TMQ 2:125)</li>
<li>b. <em>Naaqatullaah</em> (Allaah’s She-Camel) mentioned in Allaah’s Saying (which means): “This <em>Naaqatullaah</em> (She-Camel of Allaah) is sent to you (Prophet Saalih’s people, Thamood) as a sign. So allow it to graze in Allaah’s earth.”(TMQ 7:73).</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#5] Reported by at-Tabaraani (Mu’jam At-Tabaraani, V.9, # 8886), ad-Daarimiye in ar-Rad ‘alaa Bishr al-Mareesi (p.449), and al-Haythami in Majma’uz- Zawaa’id (V.1, p.85). Amongst its narrators, is Abu ‘Abdis-Salaam Az- Zubayr. Ibn Abee Haatim and Ibn Ma’een did not mention anything regarding the haal (status) of this narrator i.e. whether he is da’eef (weak), or thiqah (trustworthy transmittor), or otherwise. Ibn Hibbaan, however, mentioned him in his book ath-Thiqaat (The Trustworthy (men of Hadeeth). Al-Haythami realted that Abu Haatim (i.e. Ar-Raazi) described Abu ‘Abdis-Salaam Azubayr as majhool (unknown). Shayekhul Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah reported this narration and said: “It is affirmed upon the authority of Ibn Mas’oud (radhi Allaahu Anhu).” (See <em>Majmoo’ al-Fataawaa</em>, V.6, p.391). He also mentioned it in V.2, p.189 of the same reference. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#6] There is no contradiction between the interpreation that this aayah means that Allaah, Most High, is the Munawwir of the heavens and the earth and between the saying of ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’oud in which the Nur is related to Allaah’s Thaat. The interpretation that Allaah is the Munawwir (The One Who Illuminates) or Haadi (The One Who Guides) the heavens and the earth is true because it relates the act (verb) of Tanweer (Illumination) to the active &#8220;subject&#8221; i.e. Allaah, the Most Magnificent. There is no contradiction whether one says that Allaah is the Nur of the heavens and the earth bi-Thaatihi (by Himself) or bi-Fi’lihi (by His Act).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibnul Qayyim رحمه الله تعالى said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The truth is that Allaah is the <em>Nur</em> of the heavens and the earth taking into consideration all of the interpretations.” Being the <em>Munnawwir</em> and the <em>Haadi</em>, does not negate the fact that He (Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala), Himself, is Nur. Those who negate Allaah’s Attribute of An-Nur erred by thinking that if they would affirm the Attribute of An-Nur it would mean that Allaah is the light falling upon walls and gardens, etc.! The fact however is that the created light is an effect of the Attribute of An-Nur. We know that Ar-Rahmah (Mercy) is an Attribute of Allaah established with Him (<em>Azzawajal</em>). The rahmah (mercy) present on earth is an effect of Allaah’s Attribute of Ar-Rahmah separted from Him (<em>Azzawajal</em>). The knowledge of the creature is a distinct and separate effect of Allaah’s Attribute of Knowledge. The saying of ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’oud (radhi Allaahu anhu) does not mean or imply that the light on walls and on the surface of the earth is the essence of the Light of Allaah’s most honourable Face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[See Ibnul-Qayyim, Mukhtasar as-Sawaa’iq al-Mursalah ‘alal-Jahmiyyah al-Mu’attilah, checked by Ridwaan Shaakir Ridwaan (Makkah and Riyadh: Saudi Arabia, Maktabat Nizaar Al- Baaz), pp. 547-548 and Ijtimaa’ al-Ju-youoshil-Islaamiyyah, ‘Awaad ‘Abdullaah Al-Mi’tiq, ed. (Riyadh: Saudi Arabia, Maktabat Ar-Rushd, 1415/1995], pp.45-46.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#7]In another narration instead of the word “light” it is fire, due to the doubt of the narrator Abu Musa al-Ash’ari. Reported by Muslim (Saheeh Muslim &#8211; English translation, V.1, Hadeeth # 343), Ahmad (4:405) and others. Both narrations stating the “light” and “fire” are in Saheeh Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pure “fire” which Allaah mentioned in the Qur’aan when He (Azzawajal) spoke to Musa (peace be upon him) (Qur’aan 27:7-8) is also called a light and it is a light which illuminates without burning. Allaah also called the fire of the lamp a light (Qur’aan 24:35), contrary to the dark fire of Hell which is not called a light. Therefore, the doubt of the narrator between the words “light” and “fire” does not prevent [from affirming] that the “Light” is His Hijaab. [See Shayekhul- Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah’s Fataawaa, V.6, pp.384-386 and Ibnul Qayyim’s Mukhtasar as-Sawaa’iq al-Mursalah, p.551. Shayekhul Islaam said: “There are three kinds of (created light): The first is characterized by Isharaaq bila Ihraaq (illumination but without burning) and this is the “pure” light like that of the moon. The second kind burns without illumination and this is the dark fire (a black burning fire). The third being a light and a fire, like the sun. Also the fire of the lamps in this world is described by being being both (a light and a fire)&#8230;” Imaam Ibnul Qayyim added “This is the case with the created and witnessed lights. The Hijaab of ar-Rabb (Allaah), Most Blessed and Most High, is a Nur (Light) and it is a Fire. All of the [three] kinds of the created lights are real relative to their proper classifications&#8230;And if the light of His creation, like that of the sun, the moon, and fire, are real, then how could His Light be not real? The Light of His Face is real too [and fits His Majesty] and it is not figurative.” Ibid, pp.551-552 (with a slight adaptation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#8] Ibnul Qayyim in <em>Ijtimaa’ al-Juyoushil-Islaamiyyah</em>, pp.45-54.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#9] It does not get sun-rays only in the morning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#10] Nor it gets sun-rays only in the afternoon, but it is exposed to the sun all day long.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#11] Ibnul Qayyim in <em>Ijtimaa’ al-Ju-yoush al-Islaamiyyah</em>, pp.45-54.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#12] Allaah (<em>Subhanahu wa Ta&#8217;ala</em>) Says: { نورهم يسعى بين أيديهم } (The believer’s) Light will run forward before them. (Qur’aan 66:8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#13] Siraat: The Bridge over the midst of Hell; It is extremely slippery; On it there are hooks, claws, and bars; Over it mankind will pass. The believers, as the Prophet (Peace be upon him) explained, “Will pass like the blink of an eye, like the lightning, like the wind, like the birds, and like the fast horses and camels. Some will be saved, some will be lacerated then set free, and some will be thrown into the Fire&#8230;”. See Saheeh Muslim, V.1, Hadeeth # 352.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#14] What Allah reveals in His Books and (or) inspires to His Messengers. The strength of its “roots” in the heart of the believer depends upon His compliance with its content. That is why there is a variation amongst the degree of faith amongst Muslims. Some are stronger than others in their adherence to the teachings of Islam. There are the obedient and disobedient Muslims. Those who mixed the substance (al-maadah) with ways not condoned by Islam, became corrupt, or were led astray. If they do not repent, and clean their hearts and follow the way of Revelation, they may subject themselves to the punishment of Allah, which may manifest itself in different ways on the individual and (or) the society levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the way of uncontrolled lusts and desires takes over the heart of man, he will turn away from the Revelation and may choose for himself ways of “worship” or “religions” that ascribe best to his desires. The goal becomes the life of this world only, turning man to forget as to what occurs after death. He is overwhelmed by the “developments” taking place around him in all walks of life and wants to keep “on track”! Life turns to “drug stores” asking for “pills” to ease down the “rush”, or to “therapeutic clinics” to “relief” the worry and the sad heart! Or to suicide! Sometimes taking other lives with him.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Meaning of <em>Ar-Rabb</em>, the Lord</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ar-Rabb</em> is the owner who has full authority over his property. <em>Ar-Rabb</em>, linguistically means, the master or the one who has the authority to lead. All of these meanings are correct for Allah. When it is alone, the word <em>Rabb</em> is used only for Allah. As for other than Allah, it can be used to say <em>Rabb Ad-Dar</em>, the master of such and such object. Further, it was reported that <em>Ar-Rabb</em> is Allah&#8217;s Greatest Name.</p>
<p><strong>Source</strong> : <em>Tafseer Ibn Kathir</em>, <em>Surah Fathiha</em>, Dar-us-salam English publication</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;</p>
<p>Shaikh Saalih ibn Saalih al-Fawzaan <em>haafidhahullaah said in Sharh Usool-ith-Thalaathah:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And Ar-Rabb (the Lord) is the One Who is worshipped</strong></span>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ الَّذِي خَلَقَكُمْ وَالَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَتَّقُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>الَّذِي جَعَلَ لَكُمُ الْأَرْضَ فِرَاشًا وَالسَّمَاءَ بِنَاءً وَأَنزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَأَخْرَجَ بِهِ مِنَ الثَّمَرَاتِ رِزْقًا لَّكُمْ ۖ فَلَا تَجْعَلُوا لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا وَأَنتُمْ تَعْلَمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind, single out your Lord with all worship, He Who created you and those who came before you so that you may be dutiful to Him, seeking to avoid His anger and His punishment. He Who made the earth a resting place for you and the sky a canopy, and He sent down from the clouds rain, and He brought out with it crops and fruits from the earth as provision for you, so do not set up rivals for Allaah whilst you know that you have no Lord besides Him</span></strong></span>. [2:21-22] (#9)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[#9]: His saying, “<strong>And <em>Ar-Rabb</em> (the Lord) is the One Who is worshipped</strong>”: meaning, He is the One Who deserves to be worshipped, as for other than Him, then it does not deserve worship, because it is not a Lord. This is the intent of the speech of the Shaikh rahimahullaah in his saying, “<em>Ar-Rabb</em> (the Lord) is the One Who is worshipped”, meaning He is the One Who deserves worship. Then also it is not sufficient that a person just affirms <em>Ar-Ruboobiyyah</em> (Lordship), rather he must affirm <em>Al-‘Uboodiyyah</em> (Allaah’s deserving all worship), He the Perfect and Most High, and he must carry it out making it purely and sincerely for Him, the Perfect and Most High. So since he has affirmed that He is <em>Ar-Rabb</em> (the Lord) then it is binding upon him to affirm that he is <em>Al-Ma‘bood</em> (the One Who therefore deserves to be worshipped), and that others besides Him do not deserve anything from worship.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p align="center"><strong>وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ<br />
</strong><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> [Allaah]<strong> is the Most High, the Most Great</strong>.</span><br />
[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This sentence, with both of its boundaries defined, denotes exclusivity that He (Allaah) <strong>alone</strong> is the Most High, meaning that He possesses the <strong>absolute Transcendence</strong> (<em>al-’uluw al-mutlaq</em>). The restricted or limited <em>‘uluw</em> (transcendence) is affirmed for the humans. Allaah تعالى said:</p>
<p align="center"><strong>وَلَا تَهِنُوا وَلَا تَحْزَنُوا وَأَنتُمُ الْأَعْلَوْنَ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">So do not become weak</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (O you pious believers),<strong> nor be sad, and you</strong> <strong>will be superior</strong> (in victory)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.</span> </strong>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Aal-’Imraan </em>(3: 139)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This superiority is restricted such as being above the <em>kuffaar</em> [in victory], not an absolute transcendence. The latter is exclusively restricted to Allaah, for He, the One who is most High and free from all imperfection, is above everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it must be known that the attribute of Transcendence of Allaah in the creed of <em>ahlu-sunnah</em> <em> wal jamaa’ah </em>is classified into two types:</p>
<p><strong>(a)</strong>    <strong>The <em>‘uluw</em> of the <em>thaat</em> :</strong> The Transcendence of Allaah’s Essence.</p>
<p><strong>(b)   The <em>‘uluw</em> of the <em>sifaat</em> :</strong> The Transcendence of Allaah’s Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>‘uluw</em> of the <em>thaat</em> means that Allaah (تعالى) in His Essence is above everything, and everything is below Him, Most Majestic and Mighty is He. Regarding the <em>‘uluw </em>of the <em>sifaat</em> , it means that Allaah is qualified with the superlative qualities as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p align="center"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> وَلِلَّهِ الْمَثَلُ الْأَعْلَىٰ</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">And for Allaah is the Highest Description</span><br />
</strong>[Qur’aan<em>, Soorat An-Naml</em> (16:60)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Attribute which Allaah (تعالى) qualified Himself with is an Attribute of Perfection and in every respect is free from any kind of imperfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you ask: “What is the reason behind this kind of classification? Do you have a proof of it from the Qur’aan or the<em> sunnah</em> ? Did you find this in the sayings of the <em>sahaabah</em> ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is: “No! But I found it to be necessary when it has been determined that the people of negation (<em>an-nufaat</em>), who themselves are <em>ahlu-ta’teel</em> (those who deny the Attributes), restrict the <em>‘uluw</em> to the <em>sifaat</em> (qualities) only. They said that Allaah’s Transcendence is in His <em>sifaat</em> only not in Essence (<em>thaat</em>). The people of <em>ta’teel</em> (<em>ahlu-ta’teel</em>) themselves became divided regarding the <em>‘uluw</em> of the <em>thaat</em>, as discussed below.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is important is that the Imaams of  <em>as-salaf</em> <em>-us-saalih </em>(رحمهم الله) and the scholars who came after resorted to this classification out of necessity because they were tested by the people of <em>ta’teel</em> (who denied the <em>‘uluw</em> of the <em>thaat</em>), and thus they were obligated to affirm the Transcendence in this way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, if we say only that, “Allaah is the Most High,” and if someone from the people of <em>ta’teel</em> says that, “the <em>‘uluw </em>relates to His Attributes,” then what would the common Muslim understand? The only thing he will understand is that Allaah is qualified with the <em>‘uluw </em>of the <em>sifaat</em> only. But if we say, “Allaah is Most High in His <em>sifaat </em>as well as in His Essence,” the common Muslims will understand this meaning. In fact, the first thing that is obvious to the common Muslim is that Allaah’s <em>‘uluw</em> concerns His Essence. Certainly the <em>‘uluw </em>of the <em>sifaat </em>is part of the meaning of the <em>‘uluw</em> but the strange thing is that the people of negation and <em>ta’teel </em>establish it while it is not obvious to many people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In their denial of the <em>‘uluw</em> of Allaah’s <em>thaat</em> (Essence), the people of <em>ta’teel</em> ended up being divided into two groups:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first group</strong>:  They said that Allaah, in His Essence, is everywhere, and if so then He, according to their claim, either occupies a <em>hayyiz</em> [70] <em> </em>or He does not. If He occupies a <em>hayyiz</em> then it is necessary that He would occupy the “places” and there would remain no single “place” present. And if He does not occupy a <em>hayyiz</em>, then He is <em>ma’doom</em> (none-existing). [71]  They would not say that what does not occupy a <em>hayyiz</em> is like the “air” or the like thereof, because this would not be harmonious with their position. [72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second group:</strong> They said, “He (تعالى) is neither in <em>‘uluw</em> (loftiness) nor in <em>sufl</em> (opposite <em>‘uluw</em>: lowness); He is neither inside the world nor outside it; neither to the right nor to the justify; neither joined nor separate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This position is absolute <em>ta’teel</em> (negation) because it is a description of <em>al-’adam </em>(none-existence). Some scholars said, “If we were asked to describe <em>al-’adam</em> we would not find a more comprehensive definition than this description [above].”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So contemplate as to how their negation of what has been affirmed by the way of <em>naql</em> (texts) and <em>‘aql</em> (rational) led them to say what cannot be accepted neither by sensory perception (<em>hiss</em>), nor by <em>naql </em>or <em>‘aql</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have explained earlier that the <em>‘uluw</em> of Allaah is proven by the way of the <em>kitaab </em>(the Book, i.e. the Qur’aan), the <em>sunnah</em> <em>, ijmaa’</em> (general consensus of the <em>salaf</em> ), <em>‘aql</em> <em>, </em>and <em>fitrah</em> . [73]  The proofs of the Book and <em>sunnah </em>are diverse:</p>
<p>Some of which mention the <em>‘uluw</em> like in the saying of Allaah (تعالى):</p>
<p align="center">        { وهو العَلِيُّ العَظِيم } [البقرة:255].<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He </strong>[Allaah]<strong> is the Most High, the Most Great.</strong></span></p>
<p align="center">{ سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الأَعْلَى } [الأعلى،1]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And make</strong> <em>tasbeeh</em> [declaring that Allaah is far removed above all imperfection] <strong>of your <em>Rabb</em></strong> <em>, </em><strong>the Most High, above everything</strong>.<br />
</span>[Qur’aan<em>, Soorat Al-A’laa </em>(87:1)].</p>
<p>Others state the <em>fawqiyyah</em> [Allaah being above creation], as in Allaah’s saying in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p align="center">{ وَهُوَ القاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبادِهِ } [الأنعام،1].<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> [Allaah] is <strong><em>al-Qaahir</em></strong> [74] <em> </em><strong>above His slaves</strong>.</span><br />
[Qur’aan<em>, Soorat Al-An’aam </em>(6:18)].</p>
<p>Some <em>aayaat </em>(verses) mention the <em>su’ood</em> (ascent) of things up to Him :</p>
<p align="center">{ إليهِ يَصعَدُ الكَلِمُ الطَّيِّبُ والعَمَلُ الصالِحُ يرفَعُهُ } [فاطر،10].<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>To Him ascend [</strong>all]<strong> the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt it</strong> [the goodly words, i.e. the goodly words are not accepted by Allaah unless and until they are followed by good deeds]<strong>. </strong></span>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Faatir </em>(35:10)].</p>
<p align="center">{ تَعرُجُ الملائِكَةُ والرُّوح إليه } [المعارج،4].<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The angels and the <em>rooh</em></strong> [Jibreel u]<strong> ascend to Him</strong>.</span><br />
[Qur’aan<em>, Soorat Al-Ma’aarij </em>(70:4].</p>
<p>Sometimes the Qur’aan mentions the descent of things from Him (تعالى):</p>
<p align="center"><strong> { </strong>يُدَبَّرُ الأمر من السَّماء إلى الأرض } [السجدة،5].<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He</strong> [Allaah] <strong>arranges</strong> [every] </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">affair from the heavens to the earth.</span><br />
</strong> [Qur’aan<em>, Soorat As-Sajdah </em>(32:5)].</p>
<p align="center"> { إنَّا نحنُ نَزَّلْنَا الذِّكْرَ } [الحجر،9].<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily We: It is We Who have sent down the <em>thikr </em></strong> [the Qur’aan]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.</span><br />
</strong> [Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Hijr </em>(15:5)].</p>
<p>In the Book there is also the affirmation that Allaah (تعالى) is above the heavens:</p>
<p align="center">{ ءأمنْتُم من في السَّماء أن يخسِفَ بِكُمُ الأرْضَ } [المُلك،16].<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you feel secure that He, who is above the heaven</strong> [Allaah], </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">will not cause the earth to sink.</span> </strong>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Mulk</em> (67:16)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to the above <em>aayaat</em>, there are many other references in the Qur’aan which affirm the <em>‘uluw</em> of Allaah. Similarly the <em>sunnah</em> affirms Allaah’s <em>‘uluw </em>in His Essence by the way  of  saying, action, and approval. The affirmation in the saying as in the statement of the Prophet (peace be upon him):</p>
<p align="center"><span style="color:#808000;">“<strong>Our Rabb</strong> <strong> is Allaah Who is in the heaven</strong> &#8230;”</span> [75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in his action as when he (peace be upon him) pointed towards the heavens when he said: “<strong>O! Allaah be witness</strong> [saying it thrice],” before the greatest assembly of Muslims then. [76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to his approval, the Prophet (peace be upon him) asked a slave girl: <span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;<strong>Where is Allaah?</strong>&#8220;</span> <em>She replied: “Above the heavens.” He</em> (peace be upon him)<em> then ordered her master, </em><span style="color:#808000;">“<strong>Grant her freedom, because she is a believer</strong> .”</span> [77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>ijmaa,’ </em> it is acknowledged that the <em>salaf</em> are in agreement that Allaah is above His <em>‘arsh</em> . No one among them had ever said that He is everywhere or that He is neither above the world nor below it, or that He is neither to the right nor to the left, or that He is neither separated from the world nor associated with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, the proof of the ‎<em>‘aql </em>(intellect), has two angles to it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1.</strong> The <em>‘uluw</em> is an attribute of perfection and therefore being as such necessitates that it is an affirmed attribute of Allaah because Allaah is qualified with the attributes of perfection from every angle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2.</strong> For the sake of argument, if we say that, “Allaah is either above the world or under it or on its right or left,” then which of these descriptions denote perfection? The answer is, “Allaah is above the world,” because if he is “under it” then He would be less perfect than the created! And if He is in the same place as the created, then Allaah (تعالى) would be equal to him in perfection. Thus it is necessitated that Allaah (تعالى) is above everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, as far as the <em>fitrah</em> (natural inclination or disposition) is concerned, each person naturally acknowledges the fact that Allaah is above the heavens. That is why whenever a person supplicates His <em>Rabb</em> (Allaah) he (she) takes refuge towards the direction of the sky (i.e. upward). [78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[In this regard it is noteworthy to mention] that because Abul Ma’aali al-Juwayyni, [79]  may Allaah bestow His mercy upon him and may He forgive him, denied the ascending of Allaah above the <em>‘arsh</em> (<em>istiwaa’ ‘ala al-’arsh</em>) and the ‘<em>uluw </em>of Allaah in His Essence, he had  decided that, “Allaah was and there was nothing, [80]  and He is now as He ever has been,” [81]  denying the <em>istiwaa</em> <em> ‘ala al-’arsh</em>. Abul ‘Alaa al-Hamadaani, [82]  may Allaah bestow His mercy upon him, said, “Teacher! There is no need to mention the <em>‘arsh.</em> [83] Just tell us about this necessity which we find within ourselves: Whenever an <em>‘aarif</em> (one who knows of Allaah) says: ‘<strong>O! Allaah</strong>,’ he finds within his heart a compelling intent aspiring upward? [84]  Al-Juwayyni slapped his hands against his head screaming, “Al-Hamadani rendered me perplexed. Al-Hamadaani rendered me perplexed.” He was unable to respond because the matter is natural and cannot be denied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The strange thing is that those who deny the Transcendence of Allaah themselves raise their hands upward in the direction of the heavens when they invoke Allaah. I do not know of the situation of the person who believes that Allaah is everywhere in His Essence or that He is not inside the world nor outside it or He is neither above nor below, how is he going to face His <em>Rabb</em> on the Day of Resurrection?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allaah تعالى said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">{ <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>العَظِيم</strong></span> }<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Most Great, </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning the One Who possesses the absolutely perfect Greatness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great of a certain kind of things is the majestic whose qualities attained the utmost degree of perfection, as Allaah تعالى has said about the throne of the Queen of Sabaa’ :</p>
<p align="center"> { <strong>وَلَهَا عَرْشُُ عَظِيم</strong> }<br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And She has a great throne.</span><br />
</strong>[Qur’aan<em>, Soorat An-Naml </em>(27:23)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this sense the great of a certain kind of things is that which is characterized by utmost importance and utmost degree of perfection in its qualities.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[70] <em>Hayyiz</em>: Linguistically the word hayyiz signifies:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) Drawing, collecting, or gathering.<br />
(b) To hold in one’s possession.<br />
(c) To drive the camel gently to water.<br />
(d) To rise, turn away, or turn towards.<br />
(e) Remove, withdraw, or retire to a distance.<br />
(f) Draw back.<br />
(g) Leave a place to another.<br />
(h) Turn aside to a place or to a different company and<br />
(i) What is annexed to the house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is noticed that these linguistic meanings entail: change, moving or turning from place to a place or from a direction to another. In addition, the term <em>hayyiz</em> refers to an existing external thing that surrounds and contains something. The lateral portions (or outer surfaces) of the contained thing itself form an existing <em>hayyiz</em>. Anything that surrounded by an existing <em>hayyiz</em> is called <em>mutahayyiz</em>. Accordingly, what is in between the heavens and the earth is <em>mutahayyiz</em>. [Refer to Appendix A for further important information.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[71] They negate the ‘<em>uluw</em> of Allaah above the creation because they consider what is above the world is itself a <em>hayyiz</em>. Saying that Allaah is above the world means to them that he is in a <em>hayyiz</em> although they acknowledge that it is ‘<em>adami</em> (non-existing)! It is clear that the way of the scholastic theologians is fallacious argumentation. The fact is that above the world there is nothing except Allaah. So could He be in something “non-existing”? Being “in it” is no more than being alone by Himself and that He is distinct and separate from creation, His <em>thaat</em> is not commixed with any part of His creation..</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[72] Because the air does not occupy a <em>hayyiz</em>, yet it exists. To Allaah belongs the best example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[73] The Shaykh refers to his explanation of <em>Al-’Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> of Shaykh-ulIslam Ibn Taymeeyah [Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: Daar Ibnul Jawzi, 1415/1994], vol. 1, pp. 373-400.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[74] Allaah is <strong>al-Qaahir</strong>: The Most Mighty and the Magnificent, is dominant over all his slaves being Himself above creation, the Ever-living, the Mighty, and the AllPowerful. He is the One who subdued all of his creatures; everything in the upper and lower worlds is subservient to His Will, and Authority; whatever He willed to happen will certainly occur and as He wanted it to be, and whatever He willed not to occur will never take place; All creatures are in need of Him, they have no control of good or harm to themselves; nor can they control death nor life nor Resurrection. The most powerful creature is nothing before the domination and power of Allaah, the AllMighty; the creatures which people have taken as “gods” besides Allaah, cannot protect themselves let alone to dominate others. Allaah, the perfect is His domination deserves to be worshipped alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[75] Reported by Abu Daawood, Ahmad, and others. It was declared hasan by Ibn ‘Adiyy (Al-Kaamil 3:1054) and by Al-Baihaqi (Al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat, p. 892), ath-Thahabi (Al-’Uluw, p. 48), and ad-Daarimee (Ar-Rad ‘Alal-Jahmiyyah, p.70). Other scholars of hadeeth considered it weak because of the weakness of one of its narrators, Ziyaadah bin Muhammad al-Ansaari. According to al-Bukhaari, his hadeeth falls in the category of munkar that, according to him, is a strong state of criticism meaning “denounced”. Other scholars of hadeeth sometimes consider the munkar to mean the absolutely singular (al-fard al-mutlaq) narration which is not supported by any follow up (mutaaba’ah). [See Shifaa’ul-‘Aleel bi-Alfaath wa Qawaa’id Al-Jarh Watta’deel (Jeddah, Saudi Arabia: Maktabatul-’Ilm, 1411/1991), pp. 306-311, and Shaykh alAlbaani’s Da’eef Sunan Abee Daawood, no. 839]. However, another hadeeth by Qataadah in which Bani Israa’eel have said: “O Our Rabb!, You are in the heaven, and we are on the earth&#8230;,” is declared hasan by Shaykh al-Albaani (رحمه االله). See ath-Thahabi’s <em>Al-’Uluw</em> (Beirut, Lebanon: al-Maktab al-Islami, 1412/1991; checked by Shaykh alAlbaani)], no. 107.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[76] As in the long hadeeth of Jaabir (رضي االله عنهما) describing the Farewell Hajj of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) which was reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (English Translation), vol. 2. pp. 611-617.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[77] This is a clear response to those who say, “Allaah is everywhere.” The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) used the term “Where,” and the answer of the girl was “Above.” Those who say that Allaah is exalted above any particular direction are to be asked, “What do you mean by ‘direction’?” If they deny that Allaah is above the creation because it would mean that He is in a “particular direction,” then they are wrong because there is no one from the creation who exalted Allaah more than the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and yet he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) affirmed that He (تعالى ) is above the heavens and pointed skyward because it is a direction of ‘uluw. This direction of ‘uluw does not limit, contain, or envelop Allaah, the Most Great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nothing is above Him, the Most High. Are they more eloquent in speech than the Prophet is (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)? Are they more sincere with respect to the teachings of this deen than the Prophet is (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)? Certainly, they are not. And the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) did not intend confusion to his followers. Had there been any false meaning necessitated by affirming the &#8216;uluw of Allaah the way the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) affirmed, he would have made it clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The texts, however, do not necessitate the false conclusions made by those who deny the ‘uluw of Allaah in His Essence above the creation. Neither in the Qur’aan nor in the authentic sunnah, does the affirmation of the ‘uluw imply hat Allaah is contained in a place or that he is a compounded body (jism), or “within limits,” for He is above everything and that there is no creation above the world, there is only Allaah above everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[78] People naturally raise their hands and seek the direction of ‘uluw (highness) in their hearts when they supplicate Allaah, the Most High. This does not mean that they do so because the sky is the qiblah of invocation just as the ka’bah is the qiblah (direction) of the prayer as claimed by those who deny the ‘uluw of Allaah is His Essence! There is no legal evidence that the sky is the qiblah of du’aa. Had this been one of the proven matters, it would have been known by the salaf. In addition, the qiblah of invocation is the qiblah of the prayer. It is praiseworthy that the Muslim face the qiblah while making du’aa. In fact the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) faced the qiblah many times and invoked Allaah, the Most High. A qiblah is something that a person is face to face with, just like the positions in the prayer, invocation, thikr, sacrifice, etc. Had the sky been the qiblah of du’aa then it would have been permissible for the Muslim to invoke Allaah turning his face up in its direction, something not legally approved.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Linguistically, the upward position towards which the hands are raised is not called a qiblah. Directing the heart upward while in a state of du’aa is something ingrained in the fitrah and done by the Muslim, the kaafir, the learned and the ignorant, especially in times of distress. The one facing the qiblah knows well that Allaah is not there, however, while in a state of du’aa the person turns to his Creator who is above the creation. He does not turn towards the sky seeking refuge in something created, but he seeks the Creator of the heavens and the earth who is High above the entire creation. Ask those in times of distress, “Do you turn towards the heavens or to Allaah who is above the heavens?” Naturally, they turn to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[79] Al-Juwayyni, ‘Abdul Maalik Ibn ‘Abdullaah Ibn Yusuf Ibn Muhammad Abul Ma’aali (419/1028-478/1085), nicknamed imaamul haramayyn (lit. the Imaam of the Two Sanctuaries i.e. Makkah and Madeenah). He lived in Makkah for four years and then moved to Madeenah where he taught. He never was, however, an Imaam of the two sacred Mosques. His followers exaggerated in him and gave him this title.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Originally, he was from Juwayyn (present-day Afghanistan). He was a Shaafi’ee scholar and an Ash’arite. It is important to remember that he is said to have been the first to resort to the figurative interpretation of the sifaat. He (رحمه االله) however, retracted from this position, but like many of the late ashaa’irah, he resorted to <em>tafweed</em>: consigning the meaning of the <em>sifaat</em> to Allaah claiming that the <em>thaahir</em> (obviously−understood meaning), is not the intended meaning, something that they erroneously attributed to the <em>salaf</em>. The truth, however, is that the <em>salaf</em>, affirm the obviously understood meaning of the Attributes of Allaah, but they consign the “how” of the <em>sifaat</em> to Allaah (تعالى ). For example, the obvious meaning of Pleasure is known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We affirm it to Allaah as He has affirmed to Himself. The manner of Allaah’s Pleasure, however, is consigned to Allaah. So the Pleasure of Allaah is true and like all of His Attributes, nothing is like unto Him in His Pleasure. The kayyfiyah (specification, i.e. how is His Pleasure) is known only to Allaah. Imaam ath-Thahabi reported that before his death, al-Juwayyni denounced scholastic theology and fully supported the position of the salaf. (Al-’Uluw, p. 175, checked by Shaykh al-Albaani).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[80] Meaning that Allaah was and there was no &#8216;<em>Arsh</em> as confirmed by the full report in ath-Thahabi’s <em>Al-’Uluw</em> (p. 276, no. 337; checked by Shaykh al-Albaani).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[81] Meaning that He is not ascending above His &#8216;<em>Arsh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[82] Muhammad Ibn ‘Ali al-Hasan Ibn Muhammad al-Hamadaani (d. 531/1137).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[83] Because the proof for the &#8216;Arsh is sam’ee, meaning it is established by evidence from the Qur’aan and (or) authentic sunnah. Had it not been established through this means, we would have not known of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[84] i.e. because of the Transcendence of Allaah. In the detailed report, al-Hamadaani said: “Whenever an ‘aarif says: ‘O! Allaah,’ except that before his tongue starts moving, a compelling intention arises in his heart. It turns neither to the left nor to the right but heads for above. Do you have a way to avert this necessitated intention?” His saying “heads for above” affirms that it seeks Allaah who is absolutely above the universe, it does not turn to the heavens nor to the &#8216;Arsh because these are created things.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p>Regarding Allaah’s Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">{ <strong>الحَيُّ القَيُّومُ</strong> }<span style="color:#008000;"><strong><br />
Al Hayy (The Ever living), <em>Al-Qayyoum</em><br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, <em>Aayatul-Kursi</em> , <em>Surah Al-Baqarah</em> 2:255]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are two of Allaah’s names which comprise the perfection of Attributes and Actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name: { <strong>الـحَيُّ</strong> } comprises the perfection of Attributes, and { <strong>القَيُّوم</strong> } the perfection of Actions. The meaning of { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>الحَيُّ</strong></span>} is the one who possesses the perfect living. This is inferred from the [34] { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>ال</strong> </span>} in { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>الـحَيُّ</strong></span>} which is grammatically used to denote [amongst other things] [35]  the combination of all perfection [in properties and (or) applications in the term that it accompanies (<em>al-istighraaq</em>)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also indicated in as far as existence and none-existence, and perfection and imperfection are concerned. In fact, if we consider man’s life, we find it imperfect because it originates in <strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘<em>adam</em> (none-existence)</span></strong> and ends in ‘<em>adam</em>. [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also imperfect as far as his attributes and actions are concerned. For his hearing, sight, sayings, and actions are all imperfect. As such, man’s life is imperfect from all angles: in existence and ‘<em>adam</em> , and with regard to the inseparable attributes of life itself. However, with respect to Allaah, Most Mighty and Majestic, His life is perfect,  neither preceded by ‘<em>adam</em> nor coming to naught. Allaah, Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَتَوَكَّلْ عَلَى الْحَيِّ الَّذِي لَا يَمُوتُ</strong> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And put your trust and reliance upon the One who is Ever Living, who does not die.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Furqaan</em> (25:58)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He  also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ</strong><br />
<strong>وَيَبْقَىٰ وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whatsoever is on it <em>(the earth)</em> will perish, and the Face of Your <em>Rabb</em> , full of Majesty and Honour, will abide forever. </strong></span>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Ar-Rahmaan</em> (55:26-27)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why some of the salaf said: “The person should make a connection and not pause [when he recites the word perish in the above verse] because this signifies the right manner of  perfection.&#8221; The true aspect of Allaah’s perfection lies not only in the fact that creation will perish but also in the <em><strong>baqaa</strong></em>’ (endless existence) of Allaah, the Most Mighty and Most Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, Allaah’s <em>hayaat</em> (Life) is one which is neither accompanied by annihilation nor by ‘<em>adam</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<strong> كُلُّ شَيْءٍ هَالِكٌ إِلَّا وَجْهَهُ </strong>]<strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;">Everything will perish save His Face. </span></strong><br />
[Qur’aan, S<em>oorat al-Qasas</em> (28:88)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, belongs the eternally- perfect Life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore Allaah’s <em>hayaat</em> is characterized by the perfection of Attributes: hearing, sight, knowledge, ability, might and all qualities of perfection. That is why the particle { ال } which denotes <em><strong>al-istighraaq</strong></em> with regard to <em><strong>baqaa</strong></em>’ (endless existence) and <em><strong>al-kamaal</strong></em> (perfection) was introduced.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding [Allaah’s] Saying: { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>القَيُّوم</strong></span> }: <em><strong>al-Qayyoum</strong></em> , its origin is the word <em>al-qiyaam</em>, and the measure of {<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> القَيُّوم</strong> </span>} is <em>fayy’ool</em> and it is a form of intensiveness. The name <em>al-Qayyoum</em> means the One Who is established on His Own, Self-subsisting, by Whom all things subsist. [37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<strong> أَفَمَنْ هُوَ قَائِمٌ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ </strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Is He </strong>(Allaah)<strong> Who takes charge </strong>(guards, maintains, provides, etc.)<strong> of every person and know all that he has earned </strong>(like any other deities who know nothing)<strong>?</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Ar-Ra’d (13:33)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is established on His Own (<em>qaa’im bi-nafsihi</em> ) as He, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<strong> وَّاسْتَغْنَى اللَّهُ ۚ وَاللَّهُ غَنِيٌّ حَمِيدٌ </strong>]</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:center;"><span style="color:#339966;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah is the Rich </strong>(Free of all wants)<strong>, worthy of all praise. </strong></span><br />
</span>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat At-Taghaabun</em> (64:6)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah is absolutely free of any need from all creation. He is Self-subsisting. He needs not food nor drink, for He is the One Who feeds but is not fed. He needs not a supporter, nor a helper, nor a deputy, nor an advisor. He is established in perfection by Himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone says, “How do we reconcile the above meaning of <em>al-Qayyoum</em> with the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:center;">[ <strong> إِن تَنصُرُوا اللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ </strong>]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong><br />
O you who believe! If you “help Allaah,” He will help you. </strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, Soorat Muhammad (47:7)],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:center;">[<strong> وَلَيَنصُرَنَّ اللَّهُ مَن يَنصُرُهُ </strong>]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong><br />
Verily Allaah will help those who “help Him”? </strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Hajj (22:40)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by His affirmation that He “is being helped”? The answer is that the intended meaning is help in the cause of Allaah’s deen , for He is the One Who is in full charge of all things. So, everything other than Allaah is dependent upon Him in existence, preparation of affairs, and sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[34] {ال}, “al”is a particle of determination and specification.<br />
[35] See Lane, E.W., Arabic-English Lexicon (Cambridge, England: Islaamic Texts Society, 1984), vol. 1, p. 74.<br />
[36] In the present world, otherwise man will end up in an eternal life in the Hereafter.<br />
[37] He sustains, protects, prepares, and runs the affairs of all things as He wills in accordance with His Knowledge, Wisdom, and Justice.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: I heard a Khatib (preacher) saying in his Du`a&#8217; (supplication): O Allah, You are <em>Hannan</em> (the Ever-Kind), O Allah, You are <em>Mannan</em> (the Bestower). Are these Names of Allah which we may use when supplicating to Him?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A:  Allah&#8217;s Most Beautiful Names are <strong>Tawqifiy</strong> (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion), and Allah (Exalted be He) should not be given a name unless it is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an or the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, <strong>Hannan</strong> is not one of the Names of Allah (Exalted be He). In fact, it is a description of one of His Actions. It means the One Who shows mercy and it is derived from mercy. Allah (Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;">&lt;&lt;<strong>And (made him) sympathetic to men as a mercy (or a grant) from Us</strong>&gt;&gt; (Surah Maryam 19:13)</span> The Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) means a mercy from Allah (Exalted be He) according to one of its two interpretations. The Hadith that indicate that Allah (Exalted be He) has the Name Al-Hannan are not authentically reported.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Mannan</strong>, on the other hand, is one of the Most Beautiful Names of Allah that are authentically reported. In Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) of Abu Dawud and Al-Nasa&#8217;y, it was related on the authority of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) heard someone supplicating to Allah saying: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;<strong>O Allah! I ask You thatall praise is Yours. There is no true god except You, You are Al-Mannan, the Originator of the Heavens and Earth, Possessor of Majesty and Honor. O the Ever-Living, O Self-Subsisting</strong>&#8220;</em></span>. The Prophet (peace be upon him) then said: &#8220;He has supplicated to Allah using His Greatest Name; when supplicated with this Name, He answers, and when asked with this Name He gives&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh ‘Abd ur-Razzaaq al-Badr</strong> (hafidhahullaah) comments:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And indeed as a result of having faith in the name of Allaah ‘Al-Mujeeb,’ the slave’s certainty in Allaah strengthens, and his turning to Him and hoping for what is with Him increases, and the disease of despairing from His Mercy departs from him. And how can the Muslim not trust in his Lord, the Most Generous, while in His Hand, subhaanah, is the kingdom of everything. So whatever He wills, will be, at the time that He wills, in the way that He wills, with no addition nor omission, no precedence nor delay; and His decree, subhaanah, is carried out in the heavens, and the earth and what is upon it and what is under it, and in the seas and the air, and in all the parts and atoms of the world. To Him belongs the creation and the command, to Him belongs the kingdom and the praise, to Him belongs the dunyaa and the aakhira.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="color:#993300;">And His Name, ta’aala, ‘Al-Mujeeb’ shows that He, subhaanah, hears the du’aa of those who supplicate, and answers the request of those who ask, and does not disappoint a believer who has called upon Him, and He, subhaanah, loves that the slaves ask Him for all their needs of the deen and dunyaa</span></span>, such as food, drink, clothing and shelter, just as they ask Him for guidance, forgiveness, success, assistance to obey (Him), and the like; and He promised them the response to all of that, no matter how great the request is, how much it is, and how diverse the wishes are; and in this, there is evidence of the absolute power of Allaah, subhaanah, and that His treasures will are not depleted nor diminished by (His) giving, even if He granted the first and the last of the jinn and mankind all that they asked Him, as is in the hadeeth qudsee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has been mentioned in the Prophetic Sunnah that Allaah, tabaarak wa ta’aala, answers those who supplicate and gives those who ask, and that He, jalla wa ‘alaa, is Shy and Generous, too Generous to turn away the one who calls upon Him or disappoint the one who confides in Him with humility or prevent the one who asks Him.”</p>
