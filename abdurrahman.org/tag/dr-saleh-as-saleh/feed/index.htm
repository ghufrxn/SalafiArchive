<p>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/a-man-will-be-rewarded-only-for-what-he-intended" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Souncloud Audio Link</strong></a>]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The First Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this introduction, the first hadeeth concerns the intention. This is the hadeeth of ‘Umar ibn al Khataab (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>), the leader of the believers and the second khalifah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ameerul-Mu’mineen, Abi Hafs (may Allaah be pleased with him) said that: “The Messenger of Allaah (<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">(The value of)<strong> an action depends on the intention behind it. A man will be rewarded only for what he intended. The emigration of one who emigrates for the sake of Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>) is for the sake of Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) ; and the emigration of one who emigrates for gaining a worldly advantage or for marrying a woman is for what he has emigrated.”</strong></span> [Sahih Muslim, Book 020, Number 4692]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Narrator</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Umar ibn al Khataab (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>), the second khalifah, was from the notables of Quraysh. He accepted Islaam in the fifth or sixth year after the advent of Prophet Muhammad’s (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>) message, and in his acceptance of Islaam there was a might for the Muslims. He attended all the battlefields and took the line after Abu Bakr’s (<em>radiyallaahu ‘anhu</em>) covenant to him and he established the Khilafah in the best way after Abu Bakr. In the 23rd year (after Hijrah), four nights before the end of the month of Dhul Hijjah, he was stabbed by a magian after he made the <em>takbeer</em> for Salaatul-Fajr. He was carried to his home and he died three nights later. He was buried with the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), and Abu Bakr in the apartment of ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her). And his Khilafah lasted ten years six months and a few days. May Allaah be pleased with him and with all the companions.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Subject and Overall Explanation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of the hadeeth is making clear the rank of the intention vis-a-vis the actions. This is a great and comprehensive hadeeth, making clear that the intention is comprehensive, covering all actions such that there is no action without intention. And therefore, the actions correctness or corruption, the reward upon it or the punishment, is dependent upon the intention. And each person shall have but that which he intended, whether it is a noble objective or a lowly, despicable one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), made that clear in order to incite the doer to aim high in his intention seeking Allaah’s Face and the Final Abode and to keep away from the lowly intentions and base ranks. So if the intention is correct, intending the Face of Allaah (<em>subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa</em>), then it is acceptable and if otherwise then it will not be (acceptable) because Allaah (<em>subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa</em>) is Most Sufficient and in no need of partners.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>) gave a similitude in migration so that it may be reference for the rest of actions. So those who migrate have different intentions and thus the reward will vary to a great extent, even though the action is one (and that is the migration). So whoever migrates to Allaah and His Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), seeking the reward of Allaah and the victory for the Deen and giving help to the Deen then he is the sincere <em>Muhaajir</em> (immigrant), who attained in his intention the highest and most noble objectives. And whoever migrates seeking this lowly life and its vanishing enjoyments is the one who went base in his intention and therefore of the Hereafter he shall have no share. The one who migrates from the land of shirk seeking the reward of Allaah and the protection of His Deen and the support of the Deen and seeking to learn the Shari’ah, so his <em>hijrah</em> (migration) is <em>fee sabeelillaah</em> and Allaah will keep him steadfast on that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the intention distinguishes the worship from the habit. Take for example <em>al-ghusl</em> (taking a bath): If it is done intending to lift the <em>janabah</em> (the sexual defilement) then it is ‘<em>Ibaadah</em> (worship). And if it is done for cleansing or to cool off then it is <em>&#8216;aadah</em> (a habit).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>From the Benefits of this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Emphasizing the importance of the <em>Niyyah</em> (intention) concerning the actions. And that the correctness of deeds and the recompense is in accordance with the intention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Inciting to have sincerity in the intention and making clear the merit of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Warning from seeking and intending this lowly life in our actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Showing that people differ concerning their intentions and that each will have that which is in accordance with his own intention. (A man will be rewarded only for what he intended.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. <em>At-Taharatu minal `amal</em> (purification is from actions), and therefore it cannot be established without a <em>Niyyah</em> (intention). Everyone who performs the purification, then his purification is in accordance with his intention (and this is the point of evidence in this hadeeth which fell under the chapter of purification).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The excellence in teaching by the Prophet (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), and his perfect eloquence and clarification where he mentions the foundations and the principles foundations then he explains them by examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is evidence for the intentions place is the heart and utterance of it is an innovation. Also, it is a must to be careful concerning <em>ar-Riyaa</em> (showoff and seeking fame for the sake of this life). And that the <em>hijrah</em> (the migration) from the land of shirk to the land of Islam is from the most meritorious of deeds if the Face of Allaah is intended in that. This is in summary the points relevant to this matter.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Questions for this Hadeeth</span></strong></h3>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">What is intended by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/hijrah"><em>hijrah</em> </a>(migration) in this hadeeth?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">How is the manner of migration to the Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam</em>), after his death? What does it mean?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Why did the author (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) chose this hadeeth of ‘Umar in this chapter of purification? What is the point of relevance?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">When did ‘Umar accept Islaam?</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">What is the Islaamic meaning of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/tahara-purification/"><em>Taharah</em> </a>(purification)?</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#999999;">Smoking: Is It <em>Haraam</em> (Unlawful)?</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Author: Sheikh (Dr) Muhamad Bin Ahmad Bin Ismaa’eel</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Translated by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (<em>rahimahullaah</em>)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many Muslims regard smoking as disliked by <em>Sharee’ah</em> but not forbidden. When an advice is given about smoking and its ruling you often hear a defensive response. People know the killing effects of smoking, but Satan wants them to keep on spending and burning their chests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, cigarettes were not present in the lifetime of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). However, what was present and will continue to be present is the Revelation in its forms, the Qur’aan and authentic Sunnah. The Qur’aan formulated the prohibition of everything that is evil:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>He allows them all that is good and lawful, and prohibits them as unlawful all that is evil</strong>.” (Qur’aan 7: 157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Evil manifests itself in things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, drinks, etc. Let us see whether smoking is evil or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1-Smoking is a killer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It causes lung cancer, tuberculosis, and heart diseases, to mention a few. We know that Allaah forbids us from killing ourselves. He says:</p>
<h3>وَلَا تَقْتُلُوا أَنفُسَكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ بِكُمْ رَحِيمًا</h3>
<h3>وَمَن يَفْعَلْ ذَٰلِكَ عُدْوَانًا وَظُلْمًا فَسَوْفَ نُصْلِيهِ نَارًا ۚ وَكَانَ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And do not kill yourselves</strong> (nor kill one another)<strong>. Surely, Allaah is Most Merciful to you. And whoever commits that through aggression and injustice, We shall cast him into the Fire, and that is easy for Allaah.”</strong> (Qur’aan 4: 29-30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And do not throw yourselves into destruction”</strong> (Qur’aan 2: 195)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above ‘<em>Ayaat</em> are sufficient to prove the <em>Tahreem</em> of smoking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2-Smoking burns wealth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<h3> وَلَا تُبَذِّرْ تَبْذِيرًا</h3>
<h3>إِنَّ الْمُبَذِّرِينَ كَانُوا إِخْوَانَ الشَّيَاطِينِ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;But spend not wastefully </strong>(your wealth)<strong> in the manner of a spendthrift. Verily, spendthrifts are brothers of the devils.”</strong> (Qur’aan 17: 26-27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You see some Muslim smokers, may Allaah guide them to the truth, reserving their cash to buy a pack or a twelve-pack carton of cigarettes, or for the “pipe stuff”, etc. wasting their money and their chests: waste on top of waste.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3-Smoking inflicts harm on non-smokers: </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“There should be neither harming, nor reciprocating harm”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[An authentic hadeeth reported in Saheeh Al-Jaam’, # 7517.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>a-Smoking harms the body.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>b-It is harmful to others.</strong> Many people encounter breathing problems when they smell a pipe or a cigarette, especially people suffering from bronchial asthma.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>c-It is the cause of many devastating fires, etc.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">4-Smokers cause the spread of evil:</span></strong> They smoke openly and thus encourage others to smoke.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5-Smoking effects worship:</strong></span> Many smokers dislike fasting and praying because they become impatient. They want to go for the next “round”. The smoker becomes like an addict.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6-Smoking makes people smell bad:</strong></span> His car, clothes, home, etc. Carry the bad smell too! He hurts others with his smell while in prayer. In fact the angels also get affected by the smell, because the Prophet ρ said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever has eaten from such greens: garlic, onions, or leek should keep away from our mosque. Truly, the angels are harmed by that which harms the offspring of Adam.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Al-Bukaree, Muslim, At-Tirmithee, and An-Nassaa’ee from the hadeeth of Jaabir. See Saheeh AlJaami’ # 6089.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above points are clear evidences that smoking is evil, and thus it is <em>Haraam</em> (unlawful). If the Muslim is under any kind of stress, then he must turn to Allaah for help. The Book of Allaah, the Qur’aan is a healing. When the urge for smoking arise, resort to the Qur’aan and strive to comply with Allaah’s commands:</p>
<h3>وَإِنَّ اللَّهَ لَمَعَ الْمُحْسِنِينَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Those who strive hard in Us </strong>(Our Cause)<strong>, We will surely guide them to Our Paths.&#8221;</strong> (Qur’aan 29: 69)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>You may want to take by some of the following means while depending upon Allaah, seeking His help and guidance:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-Try to minimize drinking the drinks that became “mentally related” to smoking:coffee, tea, etc.<br />
2-Whenever there is an urge for smoking, try to make yourself busy with something else.<br />
3-Minimize contact with smokers.<br />
4-Try not to accept a cigerette from anyone.<br />
5-Try not to finish smoking the whole cigarette. Go to two thirds, then half, etc.<br />
6-Try not to deeply inhale the smoke.<br />
7-Try to drink a lot of water one you quit smoking.<br />
8-Try to remember that you want to gain the pleasure of Allaah.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ALL praise is due to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds, the Most Merciful, the Beneficent, and the Master of the Day of Judgment. O Allah! Have Your <em>Salat</em> (1) and <em>Salam</em> (peace) and blessing upon Your slave and Messenger Muhammad and upon all of his companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Extraordinary consideration has been given by the Islamic Law to women&#8217;s affairs, all meant to protect her chastity, to honor her and to secure her position in life. The so called &#8220;restrictions&#8221; placed upon her regarding her dress and the display of her beauty and ornament is only to guard against all ways of corruption arising from such dazzling displays. What Islam has established is not a restriction on the freedom of women but is a firm protection for her from falling down to the lowest levels of humiliation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the means of this protection is the HIJAB. The characteristics of the Hijab are discussed, bringing the glad tidings promised (by Allah) to those women adhering to it. We also point out the danger of dazzling displays of ornaments and beauty as well as the terrible repercussions in this life and in the hereafter for those who practice <em>Tabar&#8217;ruj </em>(display of beauty).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It comes at a time when more women are throwing away their revealing clothes, and wearing the Hijab. This comes at a time when Muslim women wearing Hijab are attacked in &#8220;civilized&#8221; Europe (2)! and inFrance (3) Muslim women are prevented from wearing the head scarf / Hijab at school. These are times of trials for Muslims and particularly for Muslim women. We all have to remember the path of the Prophets: endurance, patience, holding on, and aiming high by keeping the way of Allah above everything.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;"> (1) The <em>Salat</em> of Allah upon prophet Muhammad is His Praise and mentioning of the Prophet to the angels in the Most High place in Paradise</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">(2) Bosnia is a testimony against the &#8220;civility&#8221; of Europe and the West. Civility stops at the word: Muslim or Islam!</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">(3) The country that raises the banner of: equality, brotherhood, and freedom.!!!</span></p>
<h2><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE VIRTUES OF HIJAAB</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(1) AN ACT OF OBEDIENCE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab is an act of obedience to Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) (4) and to His Messenger Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم (5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا كَانَ لِمُؤْمِنٍ وَلَا مُؤْمِنَةٍ إِذَا قَضَى اللَّهُ وَرَسُولُهُ أَمْرًا أَن يَكُونَ لَهُمُ الْخِيَرَةُ مِنْ أَمْرِهِمْ ۗ وَمَن يَعْصِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ فَقَدْ ضَلَّ ضَلَالًا مُّبِينًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have an option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, has indeed strayed in a plain error.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) also says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">فَلَا وَرَبِّكَ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ حَتَّىٰ يُحَكِّمُوكَ فِيمَا شَجَرَ بَيْنَهُمْ ثُمَّ لَا يَجِدُوا فِي أَنفُسِهِمْ حَرَجًا مِّمَّا قَضَيْتَ وَيُسَلِّمُوا تَسْلِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But no by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) a judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4:65)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed,, Allah ordered that women must put on the Hijab (6)<a href="https://wp.me/p1VJ3-d3v">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ يَغْضُضْنَ مِنْ أَبْصَارِهِنَّ وَيَحْفَظْنَ فُرُوجَهُنَّ وَلَا يُبْدِينَ زِينَتَهُنَّ إِلَّا مَا ظَهَرَ مِنْهَا ۖ وَلْيَضْرِبْنَ بِخُمُرِهِنَّ عَلَىٰ جُيُوبِهِنَّ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things) and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.) and not to show off their adornment except what must (ordinarily) appear thereof, that they should draw their veils over their <em>Juyubihinna</em> </span>(7)<span style="color:#008000;">.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:31).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah considered the dazzling display of beauty an act of ignorance:</p>
<h3>وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ</h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of <em>Jahiliyeeyah</em></span>(8)<span style="color:#008000;"> (ignorance). &#8220;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He<a href="https://wp.me/p1VJ3-d3v">,</a> Most Glorified, says:</p>
<h3> وَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُنَّ مَتَاعًا فَاسْأَلُوهُنَّ مِن وَرَاءِ حِجَابٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when you ask the Prophet&#8217;s wives for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above Ayah (verse) does not apply only to the Prophet&#8217;s wives but to all of the believing women. Carefully read the following saying of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى):</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed.</span> (9) (Qur&#8217;an 33:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The woman (i.e. any woman) is <em>A&#8217;wrah</em> (10)&#8221;, that is she must be covered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(4) <em>Subhanahu Wata&#8217;ala</em>, Most Glorified and Most High is He.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(5) صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم: <em>Salla Allahu Alaihi Wassalam</em>: May the <em>Salat</em> and Salaam (Peace) of Allah be upon His Prophet Muhammad</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(6)This is not something cultural. It is Allah&#8217;s order. Its conditions are not Arabian, Egyptian, Pakistani, Black or White American, etc. Its conditions are specified in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah to provide a protection and safeguarding of women. No one knows about what is good for men and women more than their Creator, Allah. His laws are Wise as it is the case with all of His actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(7) <em>Juyubihinna</em>: The respected scholars from <em>As-Salaf As-Saleh</em> (righteous predecessors) differed whether the veil cover of the body must include the hands and face or not. Today, respected scholars say that the hands and face must be covered. Other respected scholars say it is preferable for women to cover their whole bodies.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(8) <em>Jahilyeeyah</em>: The days of ignorance prior to the Revelation of the Qur&#8217;an.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(9) No one can ignore the molestation of women that exists in the so called &#8220;open&#8221; societies. The question is: why it is happening? The answer begins to shape up when people think about the purpose behind creation. Allah created us for the single purpose of worshipping Him alone. He detailed all the ways to fulfill this purpose in the Last Revelation to all mankind, the Qur&#8217;an. In it we can find how women and men can safeguard their dignity, honor, and morality. The worship of Allah is manifested in the following of His orders. Allah orders that men and women must avoid all the roads that lead to animalistic ways of living. The Hijab is one of Allah&#8217;s commands. It is an honor and protection for women as well as a true freedom for her body from the hands and eyes of aggressors and molesters.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(10) This hadeeth is narrated by Abdullah bin Masoud and collected by At-Tirmidhi who said it is <em>Hassan-Ghareeb</em> i.e. good and <em>Ghareeb</em> (The <em>Ghareeb</em> is a narration by one narrator either in each level of the levels of the chain of narrators or in some levels of the chain). Also As-Suyouti hinted that it is authentic.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(2) THE HIJAB IS <em>IFFAH</em> (MODESTY):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) made the adherence to the Hijab a manifestation for chastity and modesty:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَنِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed.</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above Ayah there is an evidence that the recognition of the apparent beauty of the woman is harmful to her. When the cause of attraction ends, the restriction is removed. This is illustrated in the case of elderly women who may have lost every aspect of attraction. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) made it permissible for them to lay aside their outer garments and expose their faces and hands reminding, however, that it is still better for them to keep their modesty:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَالْقَوَاعِدُ مِنَ النِّسَاءِ اللَّاتِي لَا يَرْجُونَ نِكَاحًا فَلَيْسَ عَلَيْهِنَّ جُنَاحٌ أَن يَضَعْنَ ثِيَابَهُنَّ غَيْرَ مُتَبَرِّجَاتٍ بِزِينَةٍ ۖ وَأَن يَسْتَعْفِفْنَ خَيْرٌ لَّهُنَّ ۗ وَاللَّهُ سَمِيعٌ عَلِيمٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And as for women past child-bearing who do not expect wed-lock, it is no sin for them if they discard their (outer) in such a way as not to show their adornment; but it is best to be modest and Allah knows and sees all things provided they do not make a display of their beauty; but it is best to be modest and Allah knows and sees all things.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how about young women? Clearly they must stay modest find not display their beauty.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(3) THE HIJAB IS TAHARA (PURITY)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) had shown us the Hikma (Wisdom) behind the legislation of the Hijab:</p>
<h3> وَإِذَا سَأَلْتُمُوهُنَّ مَتَاعًا فَاسْأَلُوهُنَّ مِن وَرَاءِ حِجَابٍ ۚ ذَٰلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when you ask them (the Prophet&#8217;s wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen, that is purer for your hearts and their hearts.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab makes for greater purity for the hearts of believing men and women because it screens against the desire of the heart. Without the Hijab, the heart may or may not desire. That is why the heart is more pure when the sight is blocked (by Hijab) and thus the prevention of <em>fitna</em> (evil actions) is very much manifested. The Hijab cuts off the ill thoughts and the greed of the sick hearts:</p>
<h3> تَخْضَعْنَ بِالْقَوْلِ فَيَطْمَعَ الَّذِي فِي قَلْبِهِ مَرَضٌ وَقُلْنَ قَوْلًا مَّعْرُوفًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy or evil desire for adultery, etc.) should be moved with desire, but speak in an honorable manner.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:32)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(4) THE HIJAB IS A SHIELD</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allah, Most High, is Ha&#8217;yeii </strong>(11)<strong>, Sit&#8217;teer </strong>(12)<strong>, He loves Haya&#8217; (Bashfulness) and Sitr (Shielding; Covering)&#8221;</strong>(13).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husband&#8217;s home (to show off for unlawful purposes). has broken Allah&#8217;s shield upon her&#8221;</strong> (14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth demonstrates that depending upon the kind of action committed there will be either reward (if good) or punishment (if bad).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(11) <strong>Ha&#8217;yeii</strong>: Allah is Bashful: He does not unravel the acts of disobedience by His slaves. They openly disobey Allah while they are in need of Him, yet He (being <em>Ha&#8217;yeii</em>) is ashamed of humiliating them leaving the door of repentance opened for them. If, however, they become arrogant and persist on the spread of evil, and disobedience, Allah certainly is All-Just in His infliction of punishment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(12) <strong>Sit&#8217;teer</strong>: Allah is <em>Sit&#8217;teer</em>: He provides means that shield against the uncovering of disobedient acts. The slaves commit acts of disobedience while Allah is providing them with many of His favors. He (سبحانه و تعالى) gives the opportunity for each one of us to return to Him in repentance and to seek His forgiveness. He loves those who do not like the spread of sin. He dislikes the Muslim who publicizes his acts of sin and disobedience. He loves the Muslim who does not unravel the sins of his brother in Islam while at the same time calls him to repent. The Hijab is something beloved by Allaah because it is a shield against the spread of evil manifested in the display of beauty to strangers.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(14) Collected by Abu Dawoud and At-Tirmidhi who said: it is a good hadeeth&#8221; .</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(5) THE HIJAB IS TAQWAH (RIGHTEOUSNESS)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<h3>يَا بَنِي آدَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَارِي سَوْآتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا ۖ وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts, etc.) and as an adornment. But the raiment of righteousness, that is better.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7:26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The widespread forms of dresses in the world today are mostly for show off and hardly taken as a cover and shield of the woman&#8217;s body. To the believing women, however, the purpose is to safeguard their bodies and cover their private parts as a manifestation of the order of Allah. It is an act of <em>Taqwah</em> (righteousness ).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(6) THE HIJAB IS <em>EEMAN</em>(BELIEF OR FAITH)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) did not address His Words about the Hijab except to the believing women, Al-Mu&#8217;minat:</p>
<h3>وَقُل لِّلْمُؤْمِنَاتِ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And say (O Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to the believing women.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Ayah Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) also says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">يَا أَيُّهَا النَّبِيُّ قُل لِّأَزْوَاجِكَ وَبَنَاتِكَ وَ<span style="color:#008000;">نِسَاءِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ</span> يُدْنِينَ عَلَيْهِنَّ مِن جَلَابِيبِهِنَّ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ أَدْنَىٰ أَن يُعْرَفْنَ فَلَا يُؤْذَيْنَ ۗ وَكَانَ اللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And the believing women&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33: 59).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A&#8217;isha (<em>Radiya Allahu anha</em>)(15)) the wife of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), addressed some women from the tribe of Banu Tameem who came visiting her and had light clothes on them:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(7) THE HIJAB IS <em>HAYA</em>&#8216; (BASHFULNESS)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Each religion has a morality and the morality of Islam is haya&#8217; (bashfulness).&#8221;</strong> (17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Bashfulness is from belief and belief is in Al-Jannah (Paradise).&#8221;</strong>(18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Bashfulness and belief are fully associated together if one is lifted the other follows suit.&#8221;</strong> (19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mother of the believers, A&#8217;isha said: &#8220;I used to enter the room where the Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and my father were later buried in without having my garment on me, saying it is only my husband and my father&#8221;. But when Umar (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) was later buried in (the same place), I did not enter the room except that I had my garment on being shy from Umar (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>).&#8221;(20) The Hijab fits the natural bashfulness which is a part of the nature of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(17) Related by Imam Malik in his &#8220;Mu&#8217;wata&#8221; (2: 905-Arabic). The hadeeth chain is Mursal i.e. the chain of narrators is disconnected at one point or another. For example to say: &#8220;On the authority of A, on the authority of B, on the authority of C that the Prophet said &#8220;&#8230;.&#8221; . The hadeeth is Mursal if for example C did not hear directly from the Prophet. In the case of the above hadeeth, Ibin Habban connected the chain by two ways of narrators, both of them are weak.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(18) collected by At-Tirmidhi who said it is: &#8220;a good and authentic hadeeth&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(19) Narrated by Abdul&#8217;lah bin Umar as Related by Al-Hakim in his &#8220;Mustadrak&#8221; (1/22-Arabic) who said: &#8220;it is a good and authentic Hadeeth…..&#8221; and Al-Thahabi confirmed Al-Hakim on this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(20) As-Simt Ath&#8217;ameeen Fee Maniqib Ummahat Ul-Mu&#8217;mineen, p.91:A Book by Ibn As-Sakir that represents a collection of the great attributes of the Mothers of Believers (The wives of the Prophet-صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). AlHakim reported a similar narration and said that it is &#8220;good according to the conditions of Imam Bukhari and Imam Mulslim&#8221;, noting that both Imams did not discuss the chain of narration itself. Al- Thahabi had no comment about Al-Hakim&#8217;s narration.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(8) THE HIJAB IS <em>GHEERAH</em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab fits the natural feeling of <em>Gheerah</em> which is intrinsic in the straight man who does not like people to look at his wife or daughters. <em>Gheerah</em> is a driving emotion that drives the straight man to safeguard women who are related to him from strangers. The straight Muslim man has <em>Gheerah</em> for all Muslim women. Many in the world had lost this great moral aspect. In response to lust and desire men look (with desire) at other women while they do not mind that other men do the same to their wives or daughters! In &#8220;free&#8221; societies you see men sitting with strange women who are half-naked &#8220;enjoying&#8221; the scene! They introduce their wives to other strange men. Mutual looks here and there! Affairs develop and phone calls are exchanged. &#8220;Love affairs&#8221; destroys many families and children suffer most. What kind of &#8220;love&#8221; is this? The mixing of sexes and absence of Hijab kills the <em>Gheerah</em> in men. The eyes &#8220;eat up&#8221; other men and women! The inner &#8220;justification&#8221; is: since I can look they can look. It&#8217;s a &#8221; free choice&#8221;!! Few are those who feel anything when they discover their wives have &#8220;affairs&#8221;. They become numb!! No dignity ! No honor! The bottom line is that in many societies of this modern World the animalistic behaviors are becoming very apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ali (<em>radi Allaahu anhu</em>) said: &#8220;It was related to me that you women used to crowd the Kuffar (disbelieving men) from the non-Arabs in the markets; don&#8217;t you have <em>Gheerah</em>? There is no good in the one who does not have <em>Gheerah</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam considers <em>Gheerah</em> an integral part of faith .The dignity of the wife or daughter or any other Muslim woman must be highly respected and defended.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(1) COVERING ALL OF THE BODY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This respected author is in agreement with the position that the face and hands of the woman must be covered as he has detailed this in discussions of the Hijab issues in his book: &#8220;The Return of the Hijab, Part 3&#8221;. Some scholars say it is permissible to uncover the face and the hands of the woman as long as there is no <em>fitna</em> (infatuation) caused by her or inflicted upon her. They see that if: a) she is beautiful and beautifies her face and hands with external substances, and b) the society around her is corrupt where men do not lower their gaze, then it is prohibited for her to uncover her face and hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(2) THE HIJAB MUST NOT BE A DISPLAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab itself must not be a display. Allah ordained it so as to cover the beauty of women and not for show off. He (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And not to show of their adornment except only that which is apparent.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 31)</p>
<h3>وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not logical that the Hijab itself be a source of display.(41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(41) Some women put on attractive covers on their heads. This is against the purity of the Hijab and its essence.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(3) THE HIJAB MUST NOT BE TRANSPARENT</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The purpose must be achieved. In order for the Hijab to be a cover, it must not be made of transparent material making the woman covered only by name(!) while in reality she is naked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;In the latest part of my Ummah (nation of Muslims) there shall be women who would be naked in spite of being dressed, they have hair high like the humps of the <em>Bukht</em> camel, curse them, for they are cursed&#8221;</strong>(42).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) added in another hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They will not enter <em>Al-Jannah</em> and would not perceive its odor, although its fragrance can be perceived from such and such distance</strong>.(43)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that a woman could cause herself a grave and destructive sin if she puts on a garment that is thin and transparent and which clearly shapes her body&#8217;s features.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(42) At-Tabarani reported it and Al-Albani in his book &#8220;Al-Hijab&#8221; said it is authentic.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(43) At-Tabarani related this hadeeth in &#8220;Al-Mu&#8217;jam As-Sagheer&#8221; p.232 and Al-Albani said it Saheeh as in his book &#8220;The Hijab&#8221; p.56. As-Suyouti related on behalf of Ibin Abdul&#8217;Barr that: &#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intended women who put on light clothes that shows off and shapes the body descriptions. In reality they are naked although they have clothes on them! &#8220;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(4) HIJAB MUST BE ROOMY, FLOWING AND NOT TIGHT</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hijab is a safeguard against Fitna. If tight, it will be descriptive of the woman&#8217;s body and this violates the purpose of Hijab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Usaama Bin Zaid (رضي الله عنه) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) dressed me with a thick Qubtyeeyah (cotton dress from Egypt) which was a gift that he received from Duhia Al-Kalbi. So I gave it to my wife to wear. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said : &#8220;What made you not to wear the Qubtyeeyah?&#8221; I said: &#8220;I dressed my wife with it. &#8221; He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: &#8221; <strong>Order her to put an undergarment (or gown) under it, because I am afraid it may describe the size of her bones</strong>.(44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(44) Reported by Ad&#8217;Diya&#8217; Al-Maqdissi, Imam Ahmed, At-Tabarani, AlBaihaqi, and Ibn Sa&#8217;d. It is also reported that Al-Haithami said: &#8220;amongst the chain of narrators is Abdullah Ibn Aqeel whose narrations are good; yet according to some scholars there is Da&#8217;eef (weakness) associated with him, and that the rest of narrators are Thuqat (men of confidence regarding reporting). Ad-Dahabi said: &#8221; the level of Abdullah Ibn Aqeel&#8217;s narration is not below the rating of &#8220;good&#8221; (In Meezan AlI&#8217;tidal: Measure of Balanced (verifications); Arabic).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(5) THE HIJAB MUST NOT BE PERFUMED WITH INCENSE</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman who perfumes herself and passes by some people that they smell her scent, then she is a Zaniyah (prostitute).&#8221;</strong>(45)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(45) Related by Imam Ahmed, An-Nissa&#8217;ee, and Al-Hakim who said: &#8220;it has an authentic chain of narration&#8221; and Ad-Dahabi agreed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(6) THE HIJAB SHOULD NOT RESEMBLE MEN&#8217;S DRESS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Women who assume the manners of men are not from us and also those of men who assume the manners of women.&#8221;</strong>(46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu-Huraira (رضي الله عنه) narrated that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The prophet </strong>(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)<strong> cursed the man who wears the dress of a woman and the woman who wears the dress of a man.&#8221;</strong> (47)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(46) Reported by Imam Ahmed and Abu Na&#8217;eem. Al-Albani authenticated it in his book &#8220;Al-Hijab&#8221; (PP 66-67).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(47) Related by An-Nissa&#8217;ee, Imam Ahmed, Ibn Khuzayemah, Ibn Hab&#8217;ban and authenticated by the scholar Ahmed Shakir.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(7) THE HIJAB MUST NOT RESEMBLE THE GARMENTS OF THE KUFFAR</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The one who takes the similitude (manner) of a certain people becomes one of them.&#8221; </strong>(49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah bin Umar (رضي الله عنه) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) saw me wearing two clothes dyed in saffron, whereupon he said: these are the clothes (usually worn) by the Kuffar, so do not wear them.&#8221;</strong> (50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(49) Related by Abu Dawoud, Ahmed (as part of a another hadeeth), Ibn Taymeeyah said that the hadeeth has a good chain of narration (i.e. that reported by Abu Dawoud) and that it is a &#8220;good hadeeth&#8221;; As-Suyouti said :&#8221;it is &#8220;Hassan: Good&#8221; and Ibn Hajar reported it in &#8220;<em>Fath Al-Bari</em>&#8221; and supported it with another evidence (a <em>Murssal</em>) with a good chain of narration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(50) Saheeh Muslim, V. 3, hadeeth # 5173</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(8) THE HIJAB IS NOT FOR FAME!</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The one who wears a garment designed for a worldly fame, Allah will make him wear a garment of humiliation on the Day of Resurrection then he will be set ablaze.&#8221;</strong> (51)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The garment of fame is any garment a person wears to make him/her look famous. This applies whether the garment is highly precious and shows admiration to the life of this world or if it is chosen of a low quality to show lack of interest to this worldly life. The person may put on clothes with distinct colors so as to draw attention, act proudly and/or arrogantly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(51) Related by Abu Dawoud, Ibn Majah, and Al-Munthari said that it is <em>hassan</em> (good) as well as Ibn Muflih. Imam As-Shawkani said: &#8220;The narrators of the chain are <em>Thuqat</em>&#8221; and Al-Alabni reported in his book &#8220;Al-Hijab&#8221; p. 110 that it is <em>hassan</em> .</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(9) WATCH FOR &#8220;CONCEALED&#8221; WAYS OF DISPLAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examining the various conditions about the Hijab one can clearly recognize that many of the young Muslim women are not fulfilling these conditions. They consider what they put on now, wrongly as &#8220;Hijab&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The enemies of the Islamic revival wanted to destroy it in its infancy by oppression and cruelty. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) defeated their plots and held the believing men and women steadfast in their obedience of Him (سبحانه و تعالى). The enemies of Islam realized that they should deal with the Islamic revival in a wicked way in order to sway this revival away from its course towards Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They started to spread innovated forms of &#8220;Hijab&#8221; as a &#8220;midway&#8221; solution by which the Muslim woman can &#8220;please&#8221; Allah (they claim so!) and at the same time &#8220;accommodate&#8221; her society and preserve her &#8220;beauty&#8221; and &#8220;glamour&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The modern &#8220;boutique&#8221; stores were declining in their trade due to the widespread use of the true Islamic Hijab. Suddenly, the markets were flooded with altered forms of <em>Tabar&#8217;ruj</em> under the name &#8216;modern/contemporary Hijab&#8217;. In the beginning this was protested and women were cautious. A group of &#8220;displaying women&#8221; who were embarrassed with the Islamic Hijab rushed towards the &#8220;contemporary Hijab&#8221; to &#8220;relief&#8217; themselves from the pressing social realities caused by the spread of Hijab. With time the phenomenon of &#8220;concealed display&#8221; became widespread and known as &#8220;contemporary Hijab&#8221;. Women friendly to this course think they are the best of girls and best of wives while in fact they are as one poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>If they relate to the Hijab</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong> It is the relation of an intruder</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So! O women of this kind be mindful to Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) and His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and do not be deceived by those who may &#8220;bless&#8221; this action of yours and conceal their true intentions. Do not be deceived and let your response be: &#8221; I am better than those who are in a complete state of display!&#8221; There is no excuse to follow the evil. Know that the fire of Hell has different lower levels while Paradise has different higher levels. So it is proper to follow your sisters who truly adhere to the Islamic Hijab and its conditions. Aim high towards the highest levels of Al-Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been related that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Look at those who stand at lower levels than you (regarding worldly wealth) and those who stand at higher levels than you in religion (adherence to faith). for this would not make the favors (conferred upon you by Allah) insignificant (in your eyes).&#8221;</strong> (52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zohri reported (53) that Ummar Ibn Al-Khatab (رضي الله عنه) recited the saying of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى):</p>
<h3>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ قَالُوا رَبُّنَا اللَّهُ ثُمَّ اسْتَقَامُوا تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْمَلَائِكَةُ أَلَّا تَخَافُوا وَلَا تَحْزَنُوا وَأَبْشِرُوا بِالْجَنَّةِ الَّتِي كُنتُمْ تُوعَدُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily those who say: &#8220;Our Lord is Allah (Alone), and then they stood straight (i.e. they believed in the Oneness of Allah and worshipped none but Him (Alone) and obeyed Him for all that He ordered them) on them the angels will descend (at the time of their death) (saying); &#8220;Fear you not, nor grieve! But receive the glad tidings of <em>Al-Jannah</em> which you have been Promised!)</span> (Qur&#8217;an 41:30).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They, by Allah, followed the straight path of Allah by obeying Him and did not dodge like wolves.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hassan Al Basri, may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">&#8220;If Shaytan (Devil) looks and finds you continuously adhering to the obedience of Allah he will seek you (i.e. check you) one time after the other. If he finds that you are still holding, he becomes weary of you and rejects you. But if you adhere one time and you do not another, then he becomes covetous: he wants to have you for himself.&#8221;</span> (54)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So come on to a straight path that has no crookedness and a guidance that has no misleading ways in it, and to an honest repentance that has no disobedience in it:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">وَتُوبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا أَيُّهَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And turn you all together to Allah (and beg Him) to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(52) The origin of this hadeeth was reported in Saheeh Al-Bukhari in the Book of Riqaq and Muslim in the Book of Az-Zuhd V.4, hadeeth # 7070, P 1530, and At-Tirmidhi in the Book of Qiyamah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(53) Reported by Imam Ahmed and Ibn Al-Mubarak. Imam Ahmed reported it in the Book of Az-Zuhd p. 115 and 110, respectively.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(54) Reported by Ibn Al-Mubarak in his book &#8220;<em>Az-Zuhd</em>&#8221; p. 7 # 20</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE HONEST MUSLIM</strong> receives the order of Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) and hastens to manifest his love to Islam into action and listens to and obeys the Sunnah of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). He does not give attention to the lost and misleading ways of the masses of human beings who do not realize their awaiting destiny. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) negated the existence of belief in those who turn away from Him and from His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) saying:</p>
<h3>وَيَقُولُونَ آمَنَّا بِاللَّهِ وَبِالرَّسُولِ وَأَطَعْنَا ثُمَّ يَتَوَلَّىٰ فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم مِّن بَعْدِ ذَٰلِكَ ۚ وَمَا أُولَٰئِكَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ</h3>
<h3>وَإِذَا دُعُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ إِذَا فَرِيقٌ مِّنْهُم مُّعْرِضُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;They (hypocrites) say: &#8220;We have believed in Allah and in the Messenger (Muhammad-صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), and we obey&#8221;, then a party of them turn away thereafter, such are not believers. And when they are called to Allah (i.e. His Words-the Qur&#8217;an) and His Messenger to judge between them, lo! a party of them refuse to come and turn away.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 47-48 )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand:</p>
<h3>إِنَّمَا كَانَ قَوْلَ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِذَا دُعُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ وَرَسُولِهِ لِيَحْكُمَ بَيْنَهُمْ أَن يَقُولُوا سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</h3>
<h3>وَمَن يُطِعِ اللَّهَ وَرَسُولَهُ وَيَخْشَ اللَّهَ وَيَتَّقْهِ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْفَائِزُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The saying of the faithful believers when they are called to Allah (His Words-the Qur&#8217;an) and His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to judge between them is only that they say: &#8216;We hear and we obey.&#8217; And such are the successful (who will live for ever in <em>Al-Jannah</em>).&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24: 51-52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safiyyah, the daughter of Shayebah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;While we were at A&#8217;isha&#8217;s (<em>radi Allahu anha</em>) we mentioned the women of Qureish and their good favors, then A&#8217;isha said: &#8220;indeed the women of Qureish have a good favor and by Allah I have not seen better than the women of Al-Ansar in their strength of acceptance of the Book of Allah and in the belief in the Revelation: At the time when Surat An-Nur was sent down (and in it Allah says): &#8220;<strong>Let them (believing women) draw their veils over Juyubihinna</strong>.&#8221; soon their husbands turned to them reciting what Allah had sent down to them (i.e. the above Ayah), the man recites to his wife, his daughter, his sister and to every female relative. Not a single woman of them except that she took up her engraved <em>Mirt</em> (55) (wrapper) and covered her head and face in acceptance and belief in what Allah had sent down from His Book. The next morning they were behind the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), covered as if black crows were on top of their heads.&#8221; (56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is no choice but to submit the order of Allah and no hesitation should exist in following the ruling of Allah. So come for repentance, O My Muslim Sister, and watch for words like &#8220;<strong>I will repent, I will pray, I will cover with Hijab</strong>&#8220;, because delaying the repentance is a sin that you must repent from! Say as Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) said on the tongue of Moosa (May Allah&#8217;s peace be upon him) :</p>
<h3>عَجِلْتُ إِلَيْكَ رَبِّ لِتَرْضَىٰ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I HASTENED TO YOU, O MY LORD, TO PLEASE YOU&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 20:84)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And say as the believing men and women said:</p>
<h3> سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا ۖ غُفْرَانَكَ رَبَّنَا وَإِلَيْكَ الْمَصِيرُ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;WE HEAR AND WE OBEY. (WE SEEK) YOUR FORGIVENESS, OUR LORD, AND TO YOU IS THE RETURN&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(55) With pictures of houses and dwellings.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">(56) Reported in The <em>Tafseer</em> of Al-Qur&#8217;an Al-Ath&#8217;eem by Ibn Katheer 5:90 (Arabic)</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(1) TABARRUJ IS A DISOBEDIENCE TO ALLAH &amp; HIS MESSENGER</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who disobeys Allah and his Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) can only harm himself and cannot in any way harm Allah. The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/03/05/the-disgrace-of-tabarruj-display-of-womans-charm/">:</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;All of my followers will enter <em>Al-Jannah</em> except those who refuse.&#8221; They said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Who will refuse? &#8221; He said, &#8220;Whoever obeys me will enter <em>Al-Jannah</em>, and whoever disobeys me is the one who refuses (to enter it).&#8221;</strong> (21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that Mu&#8217;awiyah (رضي الله عنه) gave a sermon in Humss (Syria) and mentioned that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) prohibited seven things and that he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) named <em>Tabarruj</em> as one of them (22).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah bin Mas&#8217;oud (رضي الله عنه) reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) &#8220;Used to dislike ten kinds of behavior and he (Abdullah) mentioned amongst them: &#8220;<strong><em>Tabarruj</em> by means of displaying beautification in an improper place</strong>.&#8221;(23). Imam As- Suyouti, may Allah&#8217;s mercy be upon him, said: &#8220;<em>Tabarruj</em> by displaying beautification is showing off to strangers and this is disliked. This is the explanation of &#8220;an improper place.&#8221; It is not so if the beautification is done for the husband<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/03/05/the-disgrace-of-tabarruj-display-of-womans-charm/">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(21) Saheeh Al-Bukhari (English-Arabic, Dar Al-Arabia, Publ. Beirut,Lebanon), V.9, hadeeth # 384, p.284</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> (22) Related by Imam Ahmed in his Mussnad 4/101-Arabic.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> (23) Related by An-Nissa&#8217;ee in his &#8221; Sunan &#8220;Arabic 8/141.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(2) TABARRUJ IS A GRAVE DESTRUCTIVE SIN</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umay&#8217;mah, the daughter of Ruqay&#8217;ah came to the Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to acknowledge the message of Islam and that he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is the Messenger of Allah. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) told her:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I give my acknowledgment that you must not set partners to worship besides Allah and that you don&#8217;t steal or commit fornication and adultery, that you don&#8217;t kill your child, that you don&#8217;t commit any falsehood before your hands and between your legs, that you don&#8217;t wail, and that you don&#8217;t make <em>Tabarruj</em> like that of <em>Jaahiliyyah</em>&#8220;</strong> (24).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) associated <em>Tabarruj</em> with grave destructive sins<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2018/03/05/the-disgrace-of-tabarruj-display-of-womans-charm/">.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(24) Related by Imam Ahmed in his &#8220;<em>Mussnad</em>&#8221; 2/196. The scholar Ahmed Shaker, may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, said : &#8220;Its chain of narration is good&#8221;. He also said that Ibn Katheer in his &#8220;<em>Tafseer</em> :Explanation of the Qur&#8217;an 8: 327-328&#8243; mentioned this hadeeth saying, &#8220;its chain of narration is good&#8221; and he related it to At-Tirmidhi, An-Nissa&#8217;ee and Ibin Majah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(3) TABARRUJ BRINGS THE CURSE AND EXPULSION FROM THE MERCY OF ALLAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There shall be, in the latter part of my nation, women who are dressed but </strong>(in fact)<strong> naked, on their heads are humps like those of <em>Bukht</em> </strong>(one kind of camel)<strong>, curse them for they are surely cursed.&#8221;</strong>(25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(25) At-Tabarani related this hadeeth in &#8220;<em>Al-Mu&#8217;jam As-Sagheer</em>&#8221; p.232 and Al-Albani said it <em>Saheeh</em> as in his book &#8220;The Hijab&#8221; p.56. As-Suyouti related on behalf of Ibn Abdul&#8217;Barr that: &#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intended women who put on light clothes that shows off and shapes the body descriptions. In reality they are naked although they have clothes on them! &#8220;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(4) TABARRUJ IS AN ATTRIBUTE OF THE PEOPLE OF HELL</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Of the people of Hell there are two types whom I have never seen, the one possessing whips like the tail of an ox and they flog people with them. The second one, women who would be naked in spite of their being dressed, who are seduced </strong>(to wrong paths)<strong> and seduce others with their hair high like humps. These women would not get into <em>Al-Jannah</em> and they would not perceive its odor, although its fragrance can be perceived from such and such distance.&#8221;</strong> (26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(26) Saheeh Muslim (English-Arabic, Published by Dar Al-Arabia, Beirut. Lebanon) V. 4 hadeeth # 6840 p. 1486.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(5) TABARRUJ IS DARKNESS ON THE DAY OF RESURRECTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The parable of a woman who moves with slow sweeping motion, trailing her beautified clothes, performing not for her husband, is like darkness on the Day of Judgment; she has </strong>(or comes with)<strong> no light&#8221;</strong> (27)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(27) Related by Imam At-Tirmidhi in his &#8220;Sunan&#8221; # 1167. Al-Albani said it is a weak hadeeth (See Al-Albani&#8217;s collection &#8220;Ad-Da&#8217;eefah&#8221; (Collection of Weak Hadeeths) # 1800. Abu Bakr Bin Arabi, may Allah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, said: &#8220;At-Tirmidhi related this hadeeth and said it is weak but its meaning is correct because the &#8220;enjoyment&#8221; in disobedience is in fact torture and suffering……&#8221;. The meaning indicates that this type of women will come on the Day of Judgment Blackened in darkness as if she physically originated from darkness. In contrast, what appears to be difficult and painful in performance of obedient acts, is a true enjoyment because of the reward awaiting those who obey Allah and His Messenger e.g. the odor of the mouth of a fasting Muslim may not be pleasant in this world. To Allah, however, it is better than the odor of Musk because the Muslim had obeyed Allah and performed what is due upon him from fasting. Similarly the woman wearing her Hijab may be looked upon as &#8220;reactionary, old fashioned, a walking tent! etc.&#8221; She is the winner on the Day of Judgment and those who mock her put themselves on a dangerous road. They may be subjected to the wrath of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(6) TABARRUJ IS NIFAQ (HYPOCRISY)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The best of your women is the affectionate , the fertile (in productivity), the propitious (favorable), the consultative if they fear Allah. The Most evil of your women are the <em>Mutabar&#8217;rijat</em> (those who do <em>Tabarruj</em>), the <em>Mutakhayelat</em> (who strut/swagger), and they are the hypocrite ones. Those who enter <em>Al-Jannah</em> are like the Cough Crow.&#8221;</strong> (28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Cough Crow has a red beak and red legs. This is an expression of metonymy indicating that few women enter Heaven because this kind of crow is rare.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(28) Reported by Al-Baihaqi in &#8220;As-Sunan&#8221; V.7 p.82. Also reported by Abu Na&#8217;eem in &#8220;Al-Hiliyah&#8221; V. 8, p. 376 with a reference to Abdullah bin Masoud (رضي الله عنه) as the narrator. See also Al-Albani&#8217;s &#8220;Chain of Authentic Hadeeths &#8211; Arabic&#8221; # 1849 and 632.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">(7) TABARRUJ IS DISGRACEFUL</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husbands home </strong>(to show off for an unlawful purpose)<strong>, has broken the shield between her and Allah.&#8221;</strong> (29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Al- Man&#8217;nawi, may Allah have Mercy upon him, said: &#8220;The saying of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) &#8216; any woman who takes off her clothes in other than her husbands home&#8217; means showing off her beauty to strangers by taking off her shield of clothes. She &#8220;has broken the shield between her and Allah&#8221; because Allah had said:</p>
<h3>يَا بَنِي آدَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَارِي سَوْآتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا ۖ وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts etc.) and as an adornment. But the raiment of righteousness, that is better.&#8221;</span>(Qur&#8217;an 7:26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a woman does not fear Allah and uncover her private parts then she is breaking the shield between her and Allah, Most High. And because she uncovered and dishonored herself and committed a treason with her husband, Allah will uncover her shield, she will be in a scandal&#8230; &#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(29) Related by Imam Ahmed and Al-Hakim in his &#8220;<em>Mustadrek</em>&#8221; (Arabic) V.4, p.288 who said it is <em>Saheeh</em> (authentic) according to the conditions of Muslim and Al-Bukhari, and Ad-Dahabi agreed as well as Ibin Majah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(8) TABARRUJ IS AN UNCHASTE AND DISGRACEFUL SIN</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman is <em>A&#8217;wrah</em>, All of her body is not to be shown (30). To wear the clothes that show off and shapes her body features is disgraceful and Allah  orders His slaves to stay away from disgraceful sins:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;">وَإِذَا فَعَلُوا فَاحِشَةً قَالُوا وَجَدْنَا عَلَيْهَا آبَاءَنَا وَاللَّهُ أَمَرَنَا بِهَا<br />
قُلْ إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَأْمُرُ بِالْفَحْشَاءِ ۖ أَتَقُولُونَ عَلَى اللَّهِ مَا لَا تَعْلَمُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;When they commit a <em>Fahisha</em> (evil deed, going round the <em>Ka&#8217;ba</em> in naked state as in the times of <em>Jahilyeeyah</em>, every kind of unlawful sexual intercourse etc.), they say: &#8216;We found our fathers doing it and Allah has commanded us of it.&#8217; Say: &#8220;Nay, Allah never commands of <em>Fahisha</em>. Do you say of Allah what you know not?&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7:28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is <em>Shaytan</em> (Satan) who orders such disgraceful sins. Allah  says:</p>
<h3><strong>الشَّيْطَانُ يَعِدُكُمُ الْفَقْرَ وَيَأْمُرُكُم بِالْفَحْشَاءِ</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<em>Shaytan</em> threatens you with poverty and orders you to commit sins.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 268)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Mutabar&#8217;rijah</em> is a sinful virus that spreads disgraceful sins amongst the Muslim society. Allah, the Most High, says:</p>
<h3>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ يُحِبُّونَ أَن تَشِيعَ الْفَاحِشَةُ فِي الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا لَهُمْ عَذَابٌ أَلِيمٌ فِي الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, those who like, that (the crime of) illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated among those who believe, they will have a painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter. And Allah knows and you know not.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tabarruj is a leading cause for the spread of <em>Zina</em> (illegal sexual intercourse).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(30) See footnote # 7.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(9) TABARRUJ IS A SATANIC WAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The story of Adam and his wife demonstrates how the enemy of Allah, Satan, was so covetous to incite them to show their private parts in order to spread evil and disgraceful sins. It also shows that the <em>Tabarruj</em> of women is a primary goal for <em>Shaytan</em> to achieve. Allah says:</p>
<h3>يَا بَنِي آدَمَ قَدْ أَنزَلْنَا عَلَيْكُمْ لِبَاسًا يُوَارِي سَوْآتِكُمْ وَرِيشًا ۖ وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O children of Adam! We have bestowed raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts etc.) and as an adornment. But the raiment of righteousness, that is better.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7:26)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear that Satan is the one who established the call for <em>Tabarruj</em> and show off and that he is the leader of those &#8220;leaders&#8221; who call for the &#8220;liberation of women&#8221;. Satan is the &#8220;Imam&#8221; of everyone who obeys and follows him in disobedience to Allah (The Most Merciful), especially those <em>Mutabar&#8217;rijat</em> who harm the Muslims and deceive their youth. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I have not left after me any (chance) of turmoil more harmful to men than the harm done to the men because of women</strong>.(31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Adam forgot, made a mistake, repented and asked forgiveness from Allah and Allah the Oft-Forgiving accepted Adam&#8217;s repentance. The struggle between Adam&#8217;s off-springs and Shaytan continues. The devil still whispers to drive us , men and women, to disobey Allah and follow sin. There is no safeguard except in the return to Allah in good faith and repentance, remembering Allah, asking His help to overcome lust and desire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(31) Saheeh Muslim (English translation; published by Dar Al-Arabia) V. 4, hadeeth # 6603, p. 1431</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(10) TABARRUJ IS THE WAY OF JEWS</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jews have an important role in the destruction of nations through the <em>Fitna</em>. (seduction/temptation) of women. The spread of <em>Tabarruj</em> is an effective weapon of their widespread establishments. They have an extensive experience in this field. One should look around only to see who runs Hollywood and famous Houses of &#8220;Fashions&#8221; and &#8220;Magazines&#8221; as well as the world of advertisement!. R-rated, X-rated movies and clothes are widespread. In fact the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Watch out for this worldly life (safeguard yourselves from its temptations); avoid the allurement of women: verily, the first trial for the people of Israel was caused by women.</strong> (32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their Books also testify to this fact. In the Third Chapter of Isaiah ( 16, 17):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Lord said: &#8220;Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with necks outstretched ogling and mincing as they go, their anklets tinkling with every step. The Lord shall cover the scalps of Zion&#8217;s daughters with scabs, and the Lord shall bare their heads.&#8221; Furthermore, &#8220;On that day the Lord will do away with the finery of the anklets, sunbursts, and crescents; the pendants, bracelets, and veils; the headdresses, bangles, cinctures, perfume boxes, and amulets; the signet rings, and the rose rings; the court dresses, wraps, cloaks, and purses; the mirrors,..&#8221; (Isaiah, 3, 18-23; The New American Bible).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) warned against mimicking the <em>Kuffar</em> (non-believers) and their ways, especially the ways of women. Many Muslims do not abide by this warning (33). This is a testimony for the prophecy of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;You would tread the same path as was trodden by those before you inch by inch and step by step so that if they had entered into the hole of a <em>Dhab</em> </strong>(a desert lizard)<strong>, you would follow them in this also. We said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, do you mean Jews and Christians </strong>(by your words)<strong>&#8221; those before you&#8221;? he said: Who else (than those two religious groups).</strong> (34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The similarity of those women who disobey Allah and his Messenger to the Jews is very evident because their response to Allah&#8217;s commands was similar to that of the Jews:</p>
<h3>قَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَعَصَيْنَا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We have heard and disobeyed&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 93)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is unlike the response of the believing women:</p>
<h3>َقَالُوا سَمِعْنَا وَأَطَعْنَا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We hear and we obey.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 285)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They remember the saying of Allah:</p>
<h3>وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَىٰ وَيَتَّبِعْ غَيْرَ سَبِيلِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ نُوَلِّهِ مَا تَوَلَّىٰ وَنُصْلِهِ جَهَنَّمَ ۖ وَسَاءَتْ مَصِيرًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers&#8217; way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen and burn him in Hell; what an evil destination!&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 115)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(32) Ibid, footnote # 31; Hadeeth # 6606, p.1432</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(33) It is sad to see many who dislike the Kuffar in certain ways imitate them in their ways of living thinking that their materialistic progress could not be achieved except in acting, dressing, eating, jogging, sleeping ..like them. The true Muslim, however, remembers that any progress must meet the purpose for our presence on earth: all action must be related to the worship of Allah. The Kuffar have taken some of the means which Allah had created and used it for worldly gains. We are ordered to make the means adhere to the purpose of our creation: the worship of Allah Alone and thus uses the means to defend Islam and Muslims and secure the needs of life as well. Why should some of us dress the way Allah ordered and some does not? Should we choose Allah&#8217;s way or the Kuffar way? All the success is measured by one criterion: does it meet the pleasure of Allah or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(34) A famous and Saheeh hadeeth reported by Al-Bukhari, Muslim and others. The text here is as reported in Saheeh Muslim V. 4, hadeeth # 6448, p.1403</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(11) TABARRUJ IS A FILTHY JAHILYEEYAH (IGNORANCE)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says:</p>
<h3>وَقَرْنَ فِي بُيُوتِكُنَّ وَلَا تَبَرَّجْنَ تَبَرُّجَ الْجَاهِلِيَّةِ الْأُولَىٰ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 33:33)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) described the times of ignorance as filthy and wicked and ordered us to reject it. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) described the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as :</p>
<h3>يُحِلُّ لَهُمُ الطَّيِّبَاتِ وَيُحَرِّمُ عَلَيْهِمُ الْخَبَائِثَ</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;He allows them as lawful <em>At-Tayyibat</em> (all i.e. good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.), and prohibits them as unlawful <em>Al-Khaba&#8217;ith</em> (all i.e. evil and unlawful as regard things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods, etc.)&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call to bring about the times of Jahilyeeyah is similar to the call for Tabarruj, both of which are wicked ways that the Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) made unlawful. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Verily! every matter of Jahilyeeyah is under my feet!&#8221;</strong> (35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tabarruj and all forms of Jahilyeeyah such as false pride and haughtiness, ill thoughts about Allah, call for falsehood, setting up rivals with Allah, ruling by other than the laws of Islam, usury, etc., are all included.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(35) Related by Abu Dawoud, At-Tirmidhi, Ibin Majah, and Ad-Darime&#8217;i and Imam Ahmed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(12) TABARRUJ IS AN ANIMAL ACT, RETARDATION (DECADENCE) AND DECLINE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To reveal and expose are natural behaviors of animals. Whenever man inclines towards such behaviors he starts his decline to a level lower than the level of manhood which Allah had bestowed upon him. Allah bestowed a natural inclination (<em>Fitrah</em>) towards covering, preservation, and safeguarding modesty. To consider the acts of display, exposition, and uncovering as acts of beauty reflects a corruption to the <em>Fitrah</em> and a degeneration in taste and a sign of decadence and decline.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The progress of man&#8217;s civility is linked to his/her covering of the body. The Hijab cover is fitting to the instinct of <em>Gheerah</em> which draws its strength from the soul. The so called &#8220;liberation from the chains of covering&#8221; is an instinct that draws its strength from lust which incites <em>Tabarruj</em> and mixing of the sexes. The one who is satisfied with this latter instinct must sacrifice the first one in order to silence the voice of the innate <em>Gheerah</em> in his heart in return for the &#8220;enjoyment&#8221; of <em>Tabarruj</em> and mixing. From this we understand that the <em>Tabarruj</em> is a sign of corruption of <em>Fitrah</em>, lack of bashfulness, <em>Gheerah</em>, and insensitivity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(13) TABARRUJ IS A DOOR TO WIDESPREAD EVIL</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who carefully examines the Islamic Texts (Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah) and the lessons of history, becomes convinced about the evils of <em>Tabarruj</em> and its harm, both on religious and worldly matters especially when it is associated with the mixing of sexes. Some of its underlying consequences are:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Competition amongst the Displaying Women in Showing Off their Beauty. This is seduction, and it leads to the spoiling of morality and leaves women as merchandise articles exhibited for anyone to look at.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Corruption of the Morality of Men, Especially the Youth and Those in Adolescence. It pushes them to commit various kinds of sins (36).</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Destruction of Family Ties and Causing a Lack of Trust Between Family Members and the Spread of Divorce.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Commercial Abuse of Women In The World of Advertisement, Entertainment And Other Areas As Well.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Doing Harm to Women by Declaring Their Ill Intentions and Evil Conscience Thus Rendering Her Venerable To Harm By The Wicked And The Insolent.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The Spread of Diseases.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Sins didn&#8217;t spread in any particular nation until they openly conduct it and as a result, plague and other illnesses that were not present among their predecessors became widespread amongst them.&#8221;</strong> (37)</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Facilitates The Sin of <em>Zina</em> (Fornication) By The Eye.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The adultery of the eyes is the lustful look. .&#8221;</strong> (38)</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tabarruj</em> Makes it Difficult to Lower The Gaze.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Justifiably Brings Down Allah&#8217;s Punishment</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The punishment of Allah is more severe than atomic bombs and earthquakes. Allah  says:</p>
<h3>وَإِذَا أَرَدْنَا أَن نُّهْلِكَ قَرْيَةً أَمَرْنَا مُتْرَفِيهَا فَفَسَقُوا فِيهَا فَحَقَّ عَلَيْهَا الْقَوْلُ فَدَمَّرْنَاهَا تَدْمِيرًا</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when We </span>(39)<span style="color:#008000;"> decide to destroy a town (population), We (first) send a definite order (to obey Allah and be righteous) to those among them [or We (first) increase in number those of its Population] who are given the good things in this life. Then, they transgress therein, and thus the word (of torment) is justified against it (them). Then We destroy it with complete destruction.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 17: 16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;When people see wrong </strong>(or evil)<strong> and they don&#8217;t change it, then it is imminent that the punishment of Allah will fall upon them.</strong> (40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(36) You may have seen teen-age kids on the corners of many streets in Europe and in North America rooming around, smoking to get high, half naked, and on drugs looking to engage in sex. Why? What happened? Many try to hide from the hard facts! The drive for lust and materialistic life became the &#8220;god&#8221; of the new generations: the Pepsi-Michael-MTV- Jackson generations. The result: AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(37) Part of a lengthy hadeeth related by Ibin Majah, Abu Na&#8217;eem, and Al- Hakim who said: &#8220;it has a good chain of narrators&#8221;. Ad-Dahabi agreed to Al-Hakim&#8217;s report.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(38) Saheeh Muslim V.4, hadeeth # 6421 p. 1397</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">(39) &#8220;We&#8221; Plural Pronoun: Is used to stress the Greatness and Power of Allah Who is One. It is common with Semitic languages for any Monarch to use Plural Pronoun. It is also used by members of the Royal Family in England. To Allah, however, belong the Highest and most Perfect Example.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Mu’aawiyah</strong> (رضي الله عنه) is the Sahaabee Sakhr Bin Harb Bin Umayyah Bin ‘Abd Shams Bin ‘Abd Manaaf Bin Qusay Bin Kilaab, Abu’Abdur Rahmaan. The Ameer of Al-Mu’mineen, and the King of Islaam. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O Allaah! Bestow upon him the knowledge of the Book </strong>(i.e. the Qur’aan)<strong> and save him from torment.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Imaam Ahmad in Fadaa ‘il As-Sahaabah, V. 2, p. 913.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The checker said its <em>Isnaad</em> is <em>hasan</em> because of other narrations]. He also invoked Allaah saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O Allaah! Make of him </strong>(i.e. Mu’aawiyah)<strong> a guide (to the truth), cause him to be rightly directed, and cause others to be rightly directed by him.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#808080;">Reported by Imaam Ahmad, V. 5 #17438, and by At-Tirmithee. Al-A!baanee said it is saheeh (see Saheeh Sunan At-Tirmithee, #3018)</span>.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was one of the Sahaabah who recorded the Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contrary to many false reports, Mu’aawiyah (رضي الله عنه) did not seek to take over the Khilaafah from ‘Ali (رضي الله عنه).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah, Imaam Ath-Thahabee, At-Tabaree, and many other scholars from the Salaf asserted that Mu’aawiyah (رضي الله عنه) used to acknowledge that ‘Ali is better than him and that he [Mu’aawiyah] does not deserve the Khilaafah. His position, however, was that he wanted ‘Ali to punish the assassins of ‘Uthmaan (رضي الله عنه) before he would give his loyalty to him. He thought that he was on the truth regarding this matter. ‘Ali on the other hand, conditioned that Mu’aawiyah must give the pledge of loyalty to him because he was the Khaalefah and that he thought it is wise to wait until he consolidates his power and then seek ‘Uthmaan’s assassins. ‘Ali had nothing to do with the killing of ‘Uthmaan. Based upon many authentic narrations and prophecies from the Prophet Ahlus-Sunnah consider to be on the side of the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fitnah was ignited by a group of dissidents known as As-Saba’iyyah whose leader, ‘Abdullah Bin Saba’, was a Jew who considered ‘Ali to be Allaah incarnate! Most of the Sahaabah kept themselves away from the fitnah and only a few, not exceeding thirty, shared in the fighting between the army of ‘Ali and Mu’aawiyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Islamic rule at the time of Mu’aawiyah’s Kingdom was very strong whereby the Muslims ruled a vast area extending from Khurasaan in the East to the West African coast, and from Cyprus in the Mediterranean to the Yemen in the South. <span style="color:#808080;">[See Tahqeeq Mawaaqif AsSahaabah Fee Al-Fitnah; Establishing the (True) Position of the Sahaabah During the Fitnah (i.e. Between ‘Ali and Mu’aawiyahby Dr. Muhammad Amakhzoon, V. 2, pp. 93-130, published by Daar Tayebah and Maktabat Al-Khawthar, Riyaadh, KSA, 1415/1994.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason why that I have highlighted some of these important facts is that most of what had been written about this fitnah is either</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) fully historical and not authenticated,<br />
b) compiled by orientalists, or<br />
c) promoting baseless accounts by the Raafidhah (the rejectionists of the Shee ‘ah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fully documented and authenticated reports from the Muhadditheen regarding the fitnah gave us the true positions of the Sahaabah regarding this matter. An excellent source is Al- ‘Awaasim Minal Qawaasim by Abu Bakr Bin ‘Al-Arabi AI-Maalikee (not the infamous mystic Sufi Ibn ‘Arabi) with commentary by Muhib-ed-Deen AI-Khateeb, 5th edition, Maktabat AsSunnah, Cairo, 1408. See also Tahtheeb Siyar ‘Alaam An-Nubalaa’, V. 1, #257. And Allaah knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It is said that <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is a hidden trap that one must not feel secure from. Ash-Sha&#8217;bee <sup>[34]</sup> said: <strong>&#8220;It is called <em>Hawaa</em> because it throws down its&#8217; adherent.&#8221;</strong> In its general and unrestricted meaning, it demands ready pleasure without thinking about the outcome. It incites the immediate obtainment of lusts even though it is, sooner or later, the cause of greater sufferings. This life has an outcome before that of the Hereafter, and <em>Al-Hawaa</em> blinds its follower from giving notice to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man&#8217;s <em>Muroo&#8217;ah</em>, <sup>[35]</sup> religion, and rationalism all forbid the pleasure whose outcome will be painful and prohibit lust whose legacy is sorrow and regret, each telling the self when it desires [pleasure and lust], &#8220;Don&#8217;t do it!&#8221; The self would obey the winner.<sup>[36]</sup> Don&#8217;t you see because of the weakness of the rationalistic restraint in a child, he prefers what he desires even though it may lead to his own destruction. On the other hand, the one who does not abide by the <em>Deen</em> prefers and likes what he desires even if it would lead to his destruction in the Hereafter because of the weakness in compliance to the Deen&#8217;s prohibitive code. The one who does not respect his <em>Muroo&#8217;ah</em> prefers what he likes even if he injures [or shatters] or even loses his <em>Muroo&#8217;ah</em> because of the weakness in adhering to its prohibitive code. What place does this hold in comparison with the saying of Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee <sup>[37]</sup>: &#8220;<strong>If I knew that cold water would injure my <em>Muroo&#8217;ah</em>, I would not drink it</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since man has been distinguished from other forms of creation by being subjected to the trials of Al-Hawaa, and because at all times he encounters all kinds of events and occurrences, two references of judgment have been established in order to deal with him: The <em>Deen</em> and reasoning. He is always commanded to refer all of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> related incidents to these judges [Deen and reasoning] and to submit to their ruling. He should train himself to ward off <em>Al-Hawaa</em> whose consequences are safe in order to train himself to abandon Al-Hawaa, which have harmful consequences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let the reasonable person know that lust addicts reach a state in which they do not find pleasure therein. Yet, they are unable to give it up, because it becomes to them like an indispensable form of living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why you see the alcoholic and <em>Al-Jimaa&#8217;</em> [38] addict does not reach one tenth of the enjoyment achieved by those who sometimes infrequently drink [39] or engage in <em>Al-Jimaa</em>&#8216;. However, it is the habit which requires that of him. Consequently, he drives himself into destructive paths to attain what is demanded by the habit. Had he been relieved from the <em>Rayn</em> [40] of <em>Al-Hawaa</em>, he would have known that he was miserable wherefore he anticipated happiness, depressed wherefore he thought he was glad, and in pain where from he sought pleasure. He is like a bird that was deceived by a grain of wheat, neither he was able to get it, nor he was able to free himself from the trap he got caught in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, if it is asked: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>&#8220;How could a person who fell in <em>Al-Hawaa</em> free himself from it?</strong></span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The response is: &#8220;By the help and success granted by Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى), he will be able to liberate himself from <em>Al-Hawaa</em> by holding to the following matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A determined free will: having a vigilant care and sense of honor for himself, jealously protecting it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A dose of patience making himself endure the bitter taste of the moment (i.e. the time his <em>Hawaa</em> is active).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Strength and self-determination that encourages him to drink that dose [of patience]. His courage is a moment of forbearance, and the best of living attained by an &#8216;<em>Abd</em> is through his perseverance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Being aware of the splendid impression of the outcome and the cure achieved by that dose [of perseverance].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Being aware of the pain that exceeds the pleasure arising from following his <em>Hawaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Keeping his good standing before Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) and in the hearts of Allaah&#8217;s &#8216;<em>Ibaad</em>. Certainly this is better and more beneficial to this than taking pleasure in following his <em>Hawaa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Preferring the joy of &#8216;<em>Iffaah</em> [41] and its honor and sweetness over the pleasure of disobedience and wrong-doing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Having delight in overcoming his enemy and driving him away disgraced in his rage, grief, and worry, being unable to get hold of him as he wishes. In fact, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) loves for His &#8216;<em>Abd</em> to abandon and enrage his enemy as He has said in his noble Book:</p>
<p><strong> وَلَا يَطَئُونَ مَوْطِئًا يَغِيظُ الْكُفَّارَ وَلَا يَنَالُونَ مِنْ عَدُوٍّ نَّيْلًا إِلَّا كُتِبَ لَهُم بِهِ عَمَلٌ صَالِحٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Nor they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy but is written to their credit as a deed of righteousness.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan,SooratAt-Tawbah. 9:120].</p>
<p><strong> لِيَغِيظَ بِهِمُ الْكُفَّار</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>That He may enrage the disbelievers with them</strong> (i.e. the Sahaabah)<strong>.</strong> </span>[Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-Falh, 48:29].</p>
<p><strong>وَمَن يُهَاجِرْ فِي سَبِيلِ اللَّهِ يَجِدْ فِي الْأَرْضِ مُرَاغَمًا كَثِيرًا وَسَعَةً</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>He who emigrates </strong>[from his home]<strong> in the Cause of Allaah, will find on earth many dwelling places and plenty to live by.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat An-Nisaa&#8217;. 4:100],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means, &#8220;A place where he abandons and assails the enemies of Allaah.&#8221; The sign of true love is to enrage the enemies of the Beloved and to forsake them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Contemplating the fact that he has not been created to [be a slave of] Al-Hawaa, but that he has been prepared for a great task that will not be achieved unless he disobeys his Hawaa, as it was said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;Indeed they have prepared you for a task such that if you are aware of it (i.e. its importance and great outcome);</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Then you would hold yourself above giving respect to the negligent.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. That he should not choose for himself a state such that the unintelligible animal is better than him. Indeed the animal is able by means of his natural instincts to distinguish between beneficial and harmful situations, preferring the beneficial above the harmful. For the same purpose, man has been endowed with the faculty of reason. If he does not differentiate between what hurts or benefits him, or, in the case he realizes this but prefers what is harmful to him, then the status of an unintelligible animal is better than his. The evidence for this lies in the fact that an animal takes a share of enjoyment in the taste of food, drinks, and sexual relations that is not attainable by man, and that it lives a comfortable life free from thought and worry. Hence it is driven to its slaughtering place preoccupied with its lusts [42] due to the lack of knowledge about the consequences. Man will not procure the same damage done to the animal because of the intensity of the preoccupying thought, and the weakness of the used male organ, and so forth. Had the attainment of what is desired been a virtue, the right of man, who is the pure extract of the world, to it would have not been diminished while making it abundant to the animals. In the augmentation of man&#8217;s share of reasoning, knowledge, and cognition is a substitute for that (i.e. animalistic lust).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Let him lead his heart through the consequences of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> and contemplate:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many virtues were missed because of his disobedience? And how much Ratheelah (vices) did it make him commit?</li>
<li>How many meals became inaccessible because of few meals?</li>
<li>How often a pleasure caused the loss of many?</li>
<li>How often did a desire break a rank, lower a head, [43] render a good reputation bad, inherit blame, leave behind it humiliation and dishonor that water cannot wash away. Yet, the eye of the follower of Hawaa is blind!</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. The intelligent person should imagine the attainment of his desire, his condition after his wish was fulfilled, what did he miss, and what occurred to him?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;The most excellent of people is the one who does not embark upon a means to accomplish something </strong>[44]<br />
<strong> Until he distinguishes (the evil,harms) that may be incurred by its consequences.&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. The intelligent person should really imagine what would the situation of another person be after he fulfills his desire then think of himself as being in the same standing. Indeed, the judgment respect of a thing is the same as respecting the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. He should give a thought as to what his self really demands from him regarding the thing he desires. He should then question his <em>Deen</em> and rationale about it, they will inform him that it is nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullaah Ibn Mas&#8217;oud [45] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>If anyone of you admires a woman, let him remember Manatinaha&#8230;</strong>&#8221; [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. He should keep himself far from the humiliation of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> because whenever someone obeys his <em>Hawaa</em> he will sense disgrace within himself. He should not be deceived by the force, assault, and pride of the followers of <em>Al-Hawaa</em>, for they have the most lowly internal character of men; they have mustered both arrogance and humiliation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. He should compare the safety of Deen, honor, and property, and rank to the attainment of the desired pleasure. He will not find any suitability whatsoever between them. Thus he should be aware that he is from the most ignorant of men if he would trade this (Deen, honor, property, rank, etc..) for that (i.e. <em>Hawaa</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. He should keep himself far from being under the subdual of his enemy, the Shaytaan, who, if he sees the &#8216;<em>Abd</em> in a state of weak determination and motivation and having an inclination towards his <em>Hawaa</em>, he would eagerly hope to overcome and possess him and control him with the bridle of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> leading him wherever he wants. And whenever he senses in him a strong determination, self-honor, and high motivation, he would not hope to get hold of him except secretly and by the way of deceit or circumvention. [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. He should realize that <em>Al-Hawaa</em> does not associate with any affair except that it corrupts it. If it gets to the knowledge, it causes him to go to Bid&#8217;ah and <em>Dhalaalah</em> [48] and its follower will become from amongst <em>Ahlul Ahwaa&#8217;</em> [49] If it affects <em>Al-Zuhd</em> [50], it will lead its adherent to Ar-Riyaa&#8217; [51] and to stand in opposition to As-Sunnah.[52] If it gets in a legal judgment, it leads its follower to injustice and hinders him from the truth. If it gets to the division of <em>Al-Qismah</em>,[53] it changes from a just into an unjust division. If it gets to the decisions of <em>Wilaayah</em> [54] and &#8216;<em>Azl</em> [55] it leads its adherent to commit treason against Allaah  (سبحانه و تعالى) and against the Muslims whereby he puts in charge or removes from duty according to his <em>Hawaa</em>. If it enters into worship it will deviate him from obedience and means of closeness [to Allaah]. Thus it associates not with anything but renders it corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. He should realize that there is no way for the Shaytaan to come in upon the son of Adam except from the gate of his Hawaa. He goes around him trying to find how to invade him so that he renders his heart and deeds corrupt. The only means of entrance he finds is that of Al-Hawaa, and so he creeps along with it like poison creeping in the body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has made <em>Al-Hawaa</em> an opposite to what He has revealed to His Messenger. He has made its following directly opposite to the following of His Messengers, and He classified mankind into two groups: The followers of Revelation and the followers of Al-Hawaa, And this is found in many places in the Qur&#8217;aan, as in His saying:</p>
<p><strong>فَإِن لَّمْ يَسْتَجِيبُوا لَكَ فَاعْلَمْ أَنَّمَا يَتَّبِعُونَ أَهْوَاءَهُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if they answer you not </strong>(i.e. do not follow the doctrine of Tawheed, nor follow you)<strong>, then know that they only follow Ahwaa&#8217;ahum</strong> (i.e. their evil inclinations: lust, desire, etc.)</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat AI-Qasas, 28:50].</p>
<p><strong>وَلَن تَرْضَىٰ عَنكَ الْيَهُودُ وَلَا النَّصَارَىٰ حَتَّىٰ تَتَّبِعَ مِلَّتَهُمْ ۗ قُلْ إِنَّ هُدَى اللَّهِ هُوَ الْهُدَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And if you</strong> [O Muhammad]<strong> were to follow their </strong>[Jews and Christians] <strong>desires after what you have received of Knowledge</strong> (i.e. Qur&#8217;aan),<strong> then you would find neither a Waliy </strong>[protector or guardian]<strong> nor any helper against Allaah.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Ai-Baqarah. 2-120].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are other Aayaat of similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) likened the followers of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> to the most contemptible animals in form and in concept. Sometimes He compared them to a dog, as in His saying:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَٰكِنَّهُ أَخْلَدَ إِلَى الْأَرْضِ وَاتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ ۚ فَمَثَلُهُ كَمَثَلِ الْكَلْبِ إِن تَحْمِلْ عَلَيْهِ يَلْهَثْ أَوْ تَتْرُكْهُ يَلْهَث</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>But he clung to the earth and followed his own vain desires. So his description is the description of a dog: If you drive him away, he lolls his tongue out, or if you leave him alone, he [still] lolls his tongue out.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-&#8216;Araaf, 7:176].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes He compared them to wild donkeys:</p>
<p><strong>كَأَنَّهُمْ حُمُرٌ مُّسْتَنفِرَةٌ</strong><br />
<strong>فَرَّتْ مِن قَسْوَرَةٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>As if they were frightened [wild] donkeys. Fleeing from a hunter, or a lion, Or a beast Of prey.</strong> </span>[Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat At-Muddaththir, 74:50-51].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sometimes He changed their forms into that of monkeys and pigs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. The one who follows <em>Al-Hawaa</em> neither deserves to be obeyed, nor to be an Imaam or to be followed, because Allaah removed him away from Imaamah (leading as an Imaam) and forbade obedience to him. As to his removal, it is because Allaah said to His Khaleel [56] Ibraaheem:</p>
<p><strong>إِنِّي جَاعِلُكَ لِلنَّاسِ إِمَامًا ۖ قَالَ وَمِن ذُرِّيَّتِي ۖ قَالَ لَا يَنَالُ عَهْدِي الظَّالِمِينَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, I am going to make you a leader </strong>[Prophet]<strong> of mankind.&#8221; </strong>[Ibraaheem] <strong>said: &#8220;And of my offspring</strong> [to make leaders]<strong>.&#8221; </strong>[Allaah] <strong>said: &#8220;My Covenant includes not Ath-Thaalimeen </strong>(polythe&#8217;ists and wrong-doers)<strong>.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan Soorat Al-Baqarah, 2:124).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means that &#8220;My Covenant regarding Imaamah (Prophethood, leadership, etc.) does not include a Thaalim (polytheist and wrongdoer}.&#8221; Anyone who follows his Hawaa is a Thaalim as Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said:</p>
<p><strong>بَلِ اتَّبَعَ الَّذِينَ ظَلَمُوا أَهْوَاءَهُم بِغَيْرِ عِلْمٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Nay, but those who do wrong follow their own Ahwaa&#8217;ahum Without knowledge.</span></strong> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Ar-Room, 30:29].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prohibition to obey the follower of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> because of Allaah&#8217;s (سبحانه و تعالى) saying:</p>
<p><strong>وَلَا تُطِعْ مَنْ أَغْفَلْنَا قَلْبَهُ عَن ذِكْرِنَا وَاتَّبَعَ هَوَاهُ وَكَانَ أَمْرُهُ فُرُطًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our Remembrance, one who followed his Hawaa and whose affair </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">[deeds]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> has been lost.</span> </strong>[Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-Kahf, 18:28],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. Allaah has made the one who follows <em>Al-Hawaa</em> at the same rank as that of the image-worshipper. He said in two places of His Book:</p>
<p><strong>أَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَٰهَهُ هَوَاهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Have you </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">[O Muhammad]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> seen him who has taken as his Ilaah </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">[god]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> his own Hawaa?</span> </strong>[57] {Qur&#8217;aan,Soorat Al-Furqaan, 25:43].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan [58] commented: &#8220;He is the hypocrite; there is nothing that he desires except that he follows it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: &#8220;The hypocrite is a slave of his Hawaa: there is nothing that he desires except that he commits it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. Verily, <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is the <em>Hithaar</em> [59] of Hell-Fire which surrounds it, he who walks across it will fall in Hell, just as the Prophet  (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said in the hadeeth reported in As-Saheehain:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Al-Jannah is surrounded by all kinds of disliked and undesirable things, while the Fire (Hell) is surrounded by all kinds of desires and passions.&#8221;</strong> [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the &#8220;Sunan&#8221; of At-Tirmithee in the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah which he attributed to the Prophet  (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) [he said]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) created Al-Jannah and An-Naar [the (Hell) Fire], He send Jibreel to Al-Jannah and said: <strong>Go and look at it and at what I have prepared therein for its people.</strong> He went and looked at it and at what Allaah has prepared therein for its people, then came to Him and said: By Your Might, no one who hears of it will fail to enter it. He gave an order respecting it, and accordingly it was surrounded with undesirable things, and said [to Jibreel]: <strong>Go and look at it and at [the things] which I have prepared therein for its people</strong>. He went and looked at it, and found that it was surrounded with disliked and undesirable things, then came to Him and said: By Your Might, I am afraid that no one will enter it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, [Allaah] then said: <strong>Go to An-Naar and look at it and at [the things] which I have prepared therein for its people</strong>. [He went] and found that it was heaped up, one part upon another, then he came to Him and said: By Your Might, no one who hears of it will enter it. He gave a command respecting it, and it was surrounded with desirable things and passions and then said: <strong>Go back to it</strong>. He went and said: By Your Might, I am afraid that no one will remain who does not enter it.&#8221; [61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. It is feared that he who follows <em>Al-Hawaa</em> may become altogether detached from <em>Eemaan</em> (Faith) while being unaware. In fact, it has been confirmed that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>None of you is a true believer until his Hawaa is in accordance with what I have brought forth</strong>. &#8221; [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>The most dreadful thing I fear in regard to you is the seductive lusts in your bellies and in your private parts, and the misleading ways of Al-Hawaa</strong>&#8221; [63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. The following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is from the destructive sins. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Three [things} lead to safety and three cause destruction. Those that lead to safety are: fearing Allaah in secrecy and in the open, uttering the truth at times of satisfaction and anger, and moderation at times of poverty and wealth. As to the [three] that cause destruction, they are: the Hawaa being followed, niggardliness being obeyed, and conceitedness.&#8221; [64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. The opposing of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> inherits strength in the heart, tongue and body of [Allaah&#8217;s] &#8216;Abd. Some of As-Salaf (righteous predecessors) said: &#8220;The one who overcomes his Hawaa is like him who conquers a city by himself.&#8221; And in the authentic hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The strong is not the one who overcomes the people by his strength, but the strong is the one who controls himself-while in anger.&#8221;</strong> [65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever he trains himself on opposing his Hawaa, he would gain additional strength to his own.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. The most enriched in Al-Muroo&#8217;ah of the people is him who has the strongest opposition to his Hawaa. Mu&#8217;aawiyah [66] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<em>Al-Muroo&#8217;ah</em> is the abandonment of desires and passions, and the disobedience of <em>Al-Hawaa</em>. The following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> weakens the <em>Al-Muroo&#8217;ah</em>, and its opposition strengthen it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. There isn&#8217;t a day that passes except that <em>Al-Hawaa</em> and the mind fight within its follower. Whoever of them overpowers its master, it will expel the other and take full control; and the decision will be its. Abu Ad-Dardaa&#8217; [67] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When a man wakes up, both his Hawaa and deeds meet; if his deeds are in accordance with his Hawaa, then his day is an evil one; and if his Hawaa is pursuant to his deeds, then his day is a good one.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has made the wrong and the following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> .associates of each other, and has made the right and the opposition of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> as associates. As some of As-Salaf said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If two affairs were dubious to you and you don&#8217;t know which one is right, then oppose the one close to your Hawaa for it is more likely that error is committed when <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is being pursued.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is a disease and its remedy is in opposing it. Some learned men said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you wish, I will inform you of your illness, and if you wish I will tell you of your remedy: Your disease is your Hawaa, and your treatment is to abandon and oppose it.&#8221; Bishr Al-Haafee, [68]  &#8220;All kinds of affliction are manifested in your Hawaa, and the complete healing is in your opposition of it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. The Jihaad against Al-Hawaa, if it is not more important than the Jihaad against the Kuffaar, certainly it is not less in importance. A man told Al-Hasan Al Basree &#8220;O Abaa Sa&#8217;eed! What kind of Jihaad is the best? He said: &#8220;It is the Jihaad of your Hawaa&#8221; I heard my Shaykh [69] saying: &#8220;The Jihaad against one&#8217;s self and against Al-Hawaa constitutes the basis for the Jihaad against the Kuffaar and the Munaafiqeen (hypocrites), because one is unable to make Jihaad against them until he makes Jihaad against himself and his Hawaa first, so that he can go out to [confront] them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is Takhleel (disorder and confusion of the intellect) and opposing it is Himiyyah [70] It is feared for the one who became excessive in Takhleet and retired himself from Al-Himiyyah, that his disease [mental sickness] may cause him to fall in a state of Sara&#8217;.[71] &#8216;Abdul Malik Ibn Quraib [72] said: &#8220;I passed by a bedouin who was suffering from an intensive inflammation in his eyes and his tears were shedding on his cheeks. I said: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you wipe off your eyes?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;The doctor prevented me from doing this, and there is no good in him who if urged to refrain [from doing something wrong] does not abstain, and if he is being commanded [to do something good] does not comply.&#8221; I said then: &#8220;Would you like something?&#8221; He said: &#8220;Yes! But I am in a state of Hitniyyah; the lusts of the people of [Hell] Fire overcame their Himiyyah, and thus they were destroyed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. The pursuing of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> renders the doors of success closed for the &#8216;Abd, and opens for him the doors of failure. So you see him often repeating the [following statement]: &#8220;Had Allaah bestowed His success, then it [the affair] would have been as such and such,&#8221; while in fact he barred himself from the ways of success by pursuing his Hawaa. Al-Fudayyl Bin &#8216;lyaad [73] said; &#8220;Whoever has been overtaken by his Hawaa and by the following of lusts, the sources of success will be severed from him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the scholars said: &#8220;Al-Kufr [74] originates from four things: anger, lust, hope, and fear.&#8221; He then added, &#8220;I have seen two of them manifested: a man who got angry and then killed his mother, and another who fell in love and became a Christian&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. The one who stands by his Hawaa, his intelligence and mental perception will become corrupt because he acted unfaithfully towards Allaah in his mind and, consequently, Allaah perverted it for him. This is the way He deals with anyone who betrays Him in any affair: He renders it in a bad state for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. The one who broadens for his self the scope of pursuing Al-Hawaa, will put it under restriction in his grave and on the Day of his Return, The one who restrains it by opposing Al-Hawaa, brings ease upon it in his grave and on the Day of his Return. Allaah pointed to this in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And their recompense shall be Al-Jannah and silken garments, because they were patient.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan: Soorat Al-lnsaan, 76:12],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since patience, which is holding oneself from pursuing Al-Hawaa, includes harshness and restrictions, accordingly Allaah will recompense them with the smoothness of silk and the wideness of Al-Jannah, Abu Sulaimaan Ad Daaraanee [75] commented on the above Aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah shall recompense them for taking patience against lusts.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. The following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> throws down the &#8216;Abd preventing him to stand up and walk with those saved on the Day of Resurrection, just like when his heart fell [in a state of Sara&#8217;] in this life which kept him from their company. Muhammad Bin Abee Al-Ward said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is one of Allaah&#8217;s days when no one who pursues his Hawaa shall be saved of its evil. The slowest in his ability to stand up amongst those thrown down on the Day of the Resurrection is the one whose thrown in a state of Sara&#8217; by his lusts&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38. The pursuing of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> breaks up and weakens one&#8217;s resolution, and opposing [Al-Hawaa] solidifies and strengthens it. Resolution is the thing upon which one rides upon in his journey to Allaah and the Last Day. If that which is ridden became inactive, the traveler would almost be disabled to proceed in his journey.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yahyaa Bin Mu&#8217;aath [77] was asked: &#8220;Who is most sound in resolution of men?&#8221; He answered: &#8220;The one who overcomes his Hawaa&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39. The parable of the one who follows his own whim is like that who rides on a tough, strong-tempered, Jamooh [78] horse without a bridle, about to be thrown down by his horse during its run or it would lead him to his death. A learned man said: &#8220;The most rapid means to ride onto Al-Jannnah is the Zuhd respecting this life, and the most rapid means to get on to An-Naar is the love of lusts. And him who boards his Hawaa, it will hastily take him to the valley of perdition.&#8221; Another said: &#8220;The most endowed with honor of the scholars is the one who flees with his <em>Deen</em> from this Dunya [79] and who is hard to be led to follow Al-Hawaa.&#8221; &#8216;Ataa&#8217; [80] said: &#8220;The one whose Hawaa overtakes his rationale causing him to become affected with grief and agitation because of lacking the strength to be patient, would be put to shame.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40. The Tawheed and the following of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> are two contrary matters: because <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is an idol, and each &#8216;Abd has an idol in his heart, the magnitude of which depends upon his Hawaa; Rather, Allaah sent His Messengers to destroy the idols and to call for His worship Alone, having no partners or associates. Nay, Allaah&#8217;s intent is not just to demolish the corporeal images and leave the images imbedded in the heart, but rather to destroy those in the heart first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan Bin &#8216;AH Al-Muttawwi&#8217;ee [81] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The idol of each person is his Hawaa, he who breaks it by the way of opposition deserves the title of honourableness.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just contemplate about the saying of AlKhaleel (Ibraaheem to his people [as Allaah said]:</p>
<p><strong>مَا هَٰذِهِ التَّمَاثِيلُ الَّتِي أَنتُمْ لَهَا عَاكِفُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">What Are these images, to which you are devoted?</span></strong> [Qur&#8217;aan,Soorat Al-Anbiyaa&#8217;, 21:52],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and you will certainly find it identical to those images which the heart likes and devotes itself to and worships it besides Allaah. He, Allaah, said:</p>
<p><strong>أَرَأَيْتَ مَنِ اتَّخَذَ إِلَٰهَهُ هَوَاهُ أَفَأَنتَ تَكُونُ عَلَيْهِ وَكِيلًا</strong><br />
<strong>أَمْ تَحْسَبُ أَنَّ أَكْثَرَهُمْ يَسْمَعُونَ أَوْ يَعْقِلُونَ ۚ إِنْ هُمْ إِلَّا كَالْأَنْعَامِ ۖ بَلْ هُمْ أَضَلُّ سَبِيلًا</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Have you </strong>[O Muhammad] <strong>seen him who has taken his illaah </strong>(god)<strong> as his own desire? Would you be then a Wakeel </strong>[a protecting guide]<strong> over him? Or do you think that most of them hear or understand? They are only like cattle. Nay, they are even farther astray from the Path </strong>[i.e. even worst than Cattle]</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-Furqaan, 25:43-44].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41. Opposing <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is the means to drive away diseases from the heart and from the body, and its following brings forth diseases to the heart and to the body. Heart diseases are all from following of Al-Hawaa. If you search for the causes behind diseases of the body, you will find that most of it are because of preferring <em>Al-Hawaa</em> over what should be abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42. The origin for the enmity, evil, and envy that occurs between people is from the following of Al-Hawaa. The one who opposes his Hawaa relieves his heart, body, and limbs, putting himself to ease and thus relieves others. Abu Bakr Al-Warraaq [83] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When the Hawaa prevails, the heart turns dark and when it does so, the breast becomes straitened and when that happens, the moral character deteriorates and consequently people will hate him and he will hate them. Then think of the evil, enmity, neglect of rights, etc. that arise from this mutual hatred!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43. Allaah has created in man an intellect and a Hawaa; whichever of the two becomes manifest, the other will hide, as Abu &#8216;Ali Ath- Thaqafee said;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever is overcome by his Hawaa, his intellect will be hidden from him. So, look at the end of him whose intellect is masked from him and became overpowered by something else.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Ali Bin Sahl [84] said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The intellect and <em>Al-Hawaa</em> are in conflict. Success is the associate of the intellect and defeat is the associate of Al-Hawaa. The self stands between both; whichever of the two prevails, the self will side with it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44. Allaah has made the heart the king of the limbs and the place of the origination of knowledge, love, and &#8216;Uboodiyyah of Him. He tested him with two kinds of authority, two armies, two aids, and two sets of preparations. The truth, Zuhd, and guidance is one authority. Its aids are the angels, and its army is truthfulness and sincerity, and its preparation is in avoiding Al-Hawaa. The other authority is falsehood. Its aids are the Shayaateen and its troops and the preparation is the following of Al-Hawaa. The self stands between the two armies. The army of falsehood will have access to the heart only from its direction and frontier breaches, for it pervades the heart and aligns itself with its enemy against it (the heart) and thus the calamity will overtake it. It is the self, therefore, that offers its enemy from its own preparations, and opens for him the gate of the city and thus he enters and takes full control, and the heart takes the defeat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45. The worst of enemies to man is his Shaytaan and his Hawaa, and the best friend he has is his intellect and his associate angel who gives him advice. If he follows his Hawaa, he gives his hand in surrender to his enemy, submitting himself as a captive to him, making him [the enemy] rejoice at his affliction, and causing displeasure to his friends and supporters. These are precisely the difficult moments of a calamity, wretchedness, the manifested divine decree of an evil ending, and the malicious joy of enemies. [86]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46. Each &#8216;Abd has a beginning and an end. He whose start is the following of AlHawaa, shall end up in a state of disgrace, humiliation, bereavement, and trials. What is being followed commensurate with the [&#8216;Abd&#8217;s] degree of dependency upon his Hawaa. Rather, at the end, the followed turns to a suffering that agonizes him in his heart as one poet put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>&#8220;Desires that were, at the age of youthfulness, sweet to those who wished</strong><br />
<strong> then, became a suffering at Al-Masheeb (an old age)&#8221;</strong> [87]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you contemplate about the case of everyone who is in a bad and miserable state, you would find that it began with him embracing his Hawaa and giving it preference over his intellect. Anyone who begins by opposing his Hawaa and obeying the call of his Rushd,[88] his end will be that of honor, might, richness, and high rank before Allaah and before the people. Abu &#8216;Ali Ad-Daqqaaq89 said: &#8220;The one who controls his lust in his youthfulness, Allaah will honor him when he is in his age of maturity.&#8221; AlMuhallab Bin Abee Sufrah90 was asked: &#8220;How did you attain this status of yours? He said: &#8220;Through firm obedience and rebellion against Al-Hawaa.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are the situations regarding the stand against <em>Al-Hawaa</em> in the beginning and in the end of one&#8217;s life in this world. With respect to the Hereafter, however, Allaah has made Al-Jannah the end for him who opposed his Hawaa and An-Naar the end for the one who followed his Hawaa [91]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47. <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is slavery to the heart, an iron chain round the neck, and a fetter to the leg. Its follower is a captive to everyone with a bad character. Thus whoever opposes it, liberates himself from slavery and becomes free, and takes off the chain round his neck and becomes in a state similar to that of a man belonging entirely to one master after belonging to many partners disputing one another.[92]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48. Opposing <em>Al-Hawaa</em> puts the &#8216;Abd in the rank of the one whose oath Allaah fulfills. The goals that He will accomplish for him will be many-fold that which he was unable to attain as a result of neglecting his Hawaa. He is like the one who relinquished a Ba&#8217;arah and was given a pearl as a compensation for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever he is able to gain from the way of following <em>Al-Hawaa</em> is incomparable with what he looses from present and future benefits and from good living. So try to comprehend the stretching forth of the hand of Yoosuf, theSiddeeq95 in expenditure, the unconstriction with his tongue, the establishment of his feet [in power], and the rejoice that touched him after he came out of the jail because he restrained himself from the Haraam [unlawful].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49. Opposing <em>Al-Hawaa</em> entitles the honor in this world and in the Hereafter and self-esteem, outwardly and inwardly. Following it, however, lowers the rank of the &#8216;Abd in this life and in the Hereafter and humiliates him, outwardly and inwardly. When Allaah gathers mankind on one plane [on the Day of Resurrection], an announcer will call, &#8220;This day the people of generosity will be distinguished from those who amassed wealth. Now let the pious stand.&#8221; [97] They will stand and walk toward the place of honor while the followers of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> bending their heads down before Allaah] in the Mawqif [98] amidst the &#8220;heat of AI-Hawaa&#8221; its sweat and its suffering. The others [the pious] will be in the shade of the &#8216;Arsh. [99]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50. If you contemplate about the seven whom Allaah will shade in the shade of His &#8216;Arsh wherein there is no shade but His,[100] you will find that they deserved that shade because of their opposition to Al-Hawaa. Indeed the Imaam having authority and power will not be able to establish justice except by opposing his Hawaa. And with respect to the youth who prefers the sincere worship of Allaah over the urge of his youthfulness, had it not been for the opposition of his Hawaa, he would not be able to accomplish this state of worship. As to the person whose heart is attached to the mosques, the thing that drove him to this condition is the opposition of <em>Al-Hawaa</em> which invites him to the places of lusts. Concerning the person who gives charitable gifts secretly so that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given, had it not been for his subduing of his Hawaa, he would have not been able to attain this state.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the person who was invited by a charming woman of noble birth [to have illegal sexual intercourse with her], feared Allaah and opposed his Hawaa. As to the one who remembers Allaah in seclusion and his eyes becomes flooded with tears for fearing Him, the thing that made him reach this state is the opposing of his Hawaa. Consequently, they were saved from being affected by the intense heat of the Al-Mawqif on the Day of Resurrection and the sweating therein. The people [adhering to] <em>Al-Hawaa</em> will experience the utmost degree of intense heat and sweating while they are still waiting to enter the &#8220;Prison of Al-Hawaa&#8221; Allaah is the One to be petitioned to grant us protection from the Ahwaa&#8217; (Sing. Hawaa) of ourselves which are inclined to evil, and that He makes our Hawaa in accordance with what He loves and is acceptable to Him. He has power over all things, and He is most worthy of answering our petition.</p>

He reported Ahaadeeth from Sa&#8217;d Ali Abee Waqaas, Abu Hurairah, Abee Sa&#8217;eed, &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah, Ibn &#8216;Umar and others from the Sahaabah (radi Allaahu anhum)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[35] <em>Muroo&#8217;ah</em>: Moral goodness, comprising all virtues, especially manliness, valor, generosity, sense of honor, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[36] The winner in the struggle between the call for prohibition by <em>Muroo&#8217;ah</em>, religion, or rationalism and the self&#8217;s inclination</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[37] <strong>Imaam Ash-Shaafl&#8217;ee:</strong> (150/767-204/820): Muhammad Ibn Idrees Ash-Shaaf&#8217;ee, was born in Ghazza, Palestine, and traveled to Al-Madeenah in his youth to study under Imaam Maalik. He also studied in &#8216;Iraaq under Imaam Muhammad Ibn al-Hassan, the famous student of Imaam Abu Haneefah. Imaam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee holds the distinction of being the first Imaam to systematize the principles of Islaamic Law or Fiqh (Jurisprudence).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[38]<em> Al-Jimaa</em>&#8216;: Legal sexual intercourse between a man and his wife.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[39] Islaam prohibits all forms of intoxication. The evil associated with alcoholic drinks is much greater than the little enjoyment that may be felt by few drinks. In fact the few drinks demand more of it until the person feels high. Then the demand grows to reach a state higher than with his first one. Addiction slowly creeps to destroy the drinker&#8217;s life and in many cases his family. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They ask you </strong>[O Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم]<strong> concerning alcoholic drink and gambling. Say: &#8220;In them is a great sin, and </strong>[some] <strong>benefit for men, but the sin of them is greater than their benefit.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan,SooratAl-Baqarah, 2:219].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] <em>Rayn</em>: Much dirtiness from rust, or simply, dirt, filth, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[41] &#8216;<em>Iffah</em>: Abstinence from what is unlawful and base, virtuousness and decency.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[42] Eating, drinking, etc</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[43] By reason of abasement</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[44] And then regrets it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[45] <strong>&#8216;Abdullaah Bin Mas&#8217;oud</strong>, the honorable companion who accepted Islaam early when Faatimah (the daughter of &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab radiAllaahu anhu) and her husband became Muslims. He was the first to openly recite the Qur&#8217;aan in Makkah. The Mushrikeen harmed him for his recitation. He prayed to the first Qiblah (Al-Quds, Jerusalem) and to the second and last Qiblah (Makkah). He migrated twice, once to Abyssinia (the first migration) and the second to Al-Madeenah. He attended the battle of Badr, Uhud and all the other confrontations with the Mushrikeen. The Khaleefah &#8216;Umar Ibn AI-Khattaab assigned him to teach Islaam to the people of Al-Khoofah in &#8216;Iraaq. Later &#8216;Uthmaan (radiAllaahu anhu) called him to Al-Madeenah where he died in the year 32/654. He was known for his great knowledge in Qur&#8217;aan and its Tafseer. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) attested to &#8216;Abdullaah&#8217;s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[46] That is when he is inclined by his desire and lust to indulge in an unlawful act with her, let him remember something that may turn off his desire, like manatinaha: all forms of her menses and the odor associated with that. [I asked Shaykh Muhammad Bin Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaymeen about this explanation of Ibn Mas&#8217;oud&#8217;s saying and, alhamdulilaah, he affirmed it.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[47] Especially at times of unawareness. &#8216;Abdullaah Bin Mas&#8217;oud said: &#8220;You are at a time when the truth leads <em>Al-Hawaa</em> and there shall come a time when <em>Al-Hawaa</em> will lead the truth. So, we seek refuge in Allaah from that time to come.&#8221; [See Al-Jaami&#8217; li Ahkaam Al-Qur &#8216;aan by Al-Qurtubee (Beirut, Lebanon: Daarul-Kutub Al-Ilmiyyah, 1413/1993), V. 19, p. 135.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[48] Deviation from the right path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[49] <em>Ahlul-Ahwaa&#8217;</em> (The People of Corrupt Desires): The people who follow concepts of belief and methodologies of understanding and practices deviating from the right path, or from the truth, thus following their [corrupt] desires. [Some of their qualities are presented in the Appendix],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[50] <em>Zuhd</em>: To lead a pious life devoted to Allaah taking the least that is sufficient of the lawful things of life. It does not mean to abandon lawful means of earning, property, children, etc., nor exaggerating in performing acts of worship. [See a discussion on this subject in the Appendix],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[51]<em> Ar-Riyaa&#8217;</em>: Showing off, and not doing an action solely for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[52] Mystic Sufism adopted ways of Zuhd that stand in direct opposition to the guidance of the Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah. [See the Appendix under <em>Zuhd</em>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[53] <em>Al-Qismah</em>: Generally it refers to the division of property, shares, booties, profits, etc. In the Qur&#8217;aan it refers to the division of the deceased&#8217;s property in accordance with the laws of inheritance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[54] <em>Wilaayah</em>: Appointing a person in charge of an office or an authority over a thing (town, district, country, province or the like).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[55] &#8216;<em>Azl</em>: Removal of someone from his office or exercise of authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[56] <em>Khaleel</em>, i.e. Allaah&#8217;s Khaleel: The one whom Allaah has distinguished by love and honor. Ibraaheem Al-Khaleel is Prophet Ibraaheem whom, like Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) Allaah has distinguished by love and honor.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[59] <em>Hithaar</em>: Anything forming a barrier, an obstruction, a partition, or a fence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[60] An agreed upon hadeeth. [See Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 8, Hadeeth #494.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[61] Reported by At-Tirmithee who said that it is &#8220;hasan-saheeh&#8221;.- It is also reported by An-Nasaa&#8217;ee and Abu Daawood. Shaykh Al-Albaanee concluded that it is authentic in Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217; #5210 and in Mishkaatul Masaabeeh #5696. The terminology &#8220;hasan-saheeh &#8221; used by At-Tirmithee refers to one of two situations regarding the hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-That it is reported through one way of narration and there is a disagreement regarding the status of one narrator in the chain: Some consider him sound while others consider him &#8220;hasan,&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-It is reported via two chains of narration, one &#8220;Hasan&#8221; and the other &#8220;saheeh&#8221;. (See Al-Haafith Ibn Hajar&#8217;s An-Nukal &#8216;Alaa Nuzhatin-Nalhar fee Tawdeeh Nukhbatul-Fikar (Dammaam, KSA: Daar Ibnul-Jawzee, 1414/1994)], pp. 93-94.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8220;hasan&#8221; (fine) is itself authentic but does not reach the level of authenticity of the &#8220;saheeh&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[62] Shaykh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee, may Allaah protect him, said: The Isnaad (chain of narration) of this hadeeth is weak because of the status of weakness of Nu&#8217;aim Bin Hammaad (a narrator). See Shaykh Al-Albaanee&#8217;s comments on Al-Tabreezee&#8217;s Mishkaatul Masaabeeh [Beirut, Lebanon: AI-Maktab Al-Islaamee, 1405/1985], V. l,p. 59. Al-Haafith Ibn Rajab observed another cause of weakness of this hadeeth in his commentary on An-Nawawee&#8217;s authentication of the same hadeeth. [See Ibn Rajab&#8217;s Jaami&#8217; Al-&#8216;Uloom wal Hikam (Beirut, Lebanon; Muassasatur-Risaalah, checked by Shu&#8217;ayeb Al-Ama&#8217;out and Ibraaheem Baajis, 1412/1991], V. 2, p. 394.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[63] Reported by Imaam Ahmad, and Al-Haithamee said: &#8220;It was reported by Ahmad, Al-Bazzaar, and At-Tabaraanee in his  Ma&#8217;aajim: As-Sagheer, Al-Awsat. and Al-Kabeer, and its narrators are &#8216;men of Saheeh1 [i.e. generally classified in the category of sound, reliable, or even less. This does not necessarily mean that the rest of conditions required to authenticate the Isnaad (chain of narration), not to mention the hadeeth itself, are usually met.] [See Shaykh Al-Albaanee&#8217;s introduction to Saheeh At-Targheeb war Tarheeb by AlMunthiree, pp. 43-50.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[64] Al-Muhaddith Shaykh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee said that the hadeeth is hasan. See As~Silsi!ah As-Saheehah, #1802, and Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217;, #3045.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[65] An agreed upon hadeeth, [See Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 8, Hadeeth #135.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[66] <strong>Mu&#8217;aawiyah</strong> is the Sahaabee Sakhr Bin Harb Bin Umayyah Bin &#8216;Abd Shams Bin &#8216;Abd Manaaf Bin Qusay Bin Kilaab, Abu&#8217;Abdur Rahmaan. The Ameer of Al-Mu&#8217;mineen, and the King of Islaam. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allaah! Bestow upon him the knowledge of the Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) and save him from torment.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Imaam Ahmad in Fadaa &#8216;il As-Sahaabah, V. 2, p. 913.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The checker said its Isnaad is hasan because of other narrations]. He also invoked Allaah saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;O Allaah! Make of him (i.e. Mu&#8217;aawiyah) a guide (to the truth), cause him to be rightly directed, and cause others to be rightly directed by him.&#8221; </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Imaam Ahmad, V. 5 #17438, and by At-Tirmithee. Al-A!baanee said it is saheeh (see Saheeh Sunan At-Tirmithee, #3018).] He was one of the Sahaabah who recorded the Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contrary to many false reports, Mu&#8217;aawiyah did not seek to take over the Khilaafah from &#8216;Ali Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah, Imaam Ath-Thahabee, AtTabaree, and many other scholars from the Salaf asserted that Mu&#8217;aawiyah used to acknowledge that &#8216;Ali is better than him and that he [Mu&#8217;aawiyah] does not deserve the Khilaafah. His position, however, was that he wanted &#8216;Ali to punish the assassins of &#8216;Uthmaan^ before he would give his loyalty to him. He thought that he was on the truth regarding this matter. &#8216;Ali on the other hand, conditioned that Mu&#8217;aawiyah must give the pledge of loyalty to him because he was the Khaalefah and that he thought it is wise to wait until he consolidates his power and then seek &#8216;Uthmaan&#8217;s assassins. &#8216;Ali had nothing to do with the killing of &#8216;Uthmaan Based upon many authentic narrations and prophecies from the Prophet Ahlus-Sunnah consider to be on the side of the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fitnah was ignited by a group of dissidents known as As-Saba&#8217;iyyah whose leader, &#8216;Abdullah Bin Saba&#8217;, was a Jew who considered &#8216;Ali to be Allaah incarnate! Most of the Sahaabah kept themselves away from the fitnah and only a few, not exceeding thirty, shared in the fighting between the army of &#8216;Ali and Mu&#8217;aawiyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Islamic rule at the time of Mu&#8217;aawiyah&#8217;s Kingdom was very strong whereby the Muslims ruled a vast area extending from Khurasaan in the East to the West African coast, and from Cyprus in the Mediterranean to the Yemen in the South. [See Tahqeeq Mawaaqif AsSahaabah Fee Al-Fitnah; Establishing the (True) Position of the Sahaabah During the Fitnah (i.e. Between &#8216;Ali and Mu&#8217;aawiyahby Dr. Muhammad Amakhzoon, V. 2, pp. 93-130, published by Daar Tayebah and Maktabat Al-Khawthar, Riyaadh, KSA, 1415/1994.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason why that I have highlighted some of these important facts is that most of what had been written about this fitnah is either a) fully historical and not authenticated, b) compiled by orientalists, or c) promoting baseless accounts by the Raafidhah (the rejectionists of the Shee &#8216;ah). The fully documented and authenticated reports from the Muhadditheen regarding the fitnah gave us the true positions of the Sahaabah regarding this matter. An excellent source is Al- &#8216;Awaasim Minal Qawaasim by Abu Bakr Bin &#8216;Al-Arabi AI-Maalikee (not the infamous mystic Sufi Ibn &#8216;Arabi) with commentary by Muhib-ed-Deen AI-Khateeb, 5th edition, Maktabat AsSunnah, Cairo, 1408.

He is known as the <em>Hakeem</em> (the wise man) of this Ummah. He was from the few amongst the Sahaabah who collected the Noble Qur&#8217;aan. He reported one hundred and ninety seven Ahaadeeth.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is considered a Sufi in the context of the early practice of sufism in which some of its followers were mostly interested in leading a pious life of Zuhd (an abstemious way of life), patience, clemency, sincerity, truthfulness, etc.. Overall they were close to the teachings of the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah, although some of them exaggerated and (or) introduced innovated forms of worship and concepts. [See Majmoo&#8217; Fataawaa Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah, 10:366-367, and Ibnul Jawzee in Talbees Iblees, p. 156.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Historically the process started in Basra, &#8216;Iraaq by the time when the majority of <em>Taabi&#8217;ee</em> (the followers of) <em>At-Taabi&#8217;een</em> passed away (Ibid, 10:358). Many of them used to wear woollen (<em>suf</em>) clothing a sign of disassociation from the wordly life. The first to establish a &#8220;house for the sufiyyah&#8221; was a man by the name of &#8216;Abdul Waahid Bin Zayed (Ibid, 10:359). In their works there is a blend of truth and falsehood. The majority of the scholars, including Imaam Shaafi&#8217;ee, Ahmad, Maalik, and others from Ahl-ul-Hadeeth, criticized their ways especially their so-called <em>Samoa</em>&#8216; [singing aimed to stimulating a state of <em>Wajd</em> (ecstasy)] and excessive worship. Whatever opposes the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah and the way of the Salafis to be rejected and whatever is in agreement is accepted because it is not innovated. The acceptance is not an approval of the terminology or the essence of Sufism in any of its stages. It remains to be remembered that it is not true that every pious and <em>Zaahid</em> Muslim is necessarily a Sufi. The <em>Zuhaad</em> (Sing. <em>Zaahid</em>) of the later times were more influenced by scholastic theology (<em>Ilm Al-Kalaam</em>) which began to creep into the Ummah following the translations of many of the philosophical concepts of the Hindus, Greeks, Romans, and Persians (Ibid, 10:367). Consequently, they deviated from the way of the Sahaabah and their followers from At-Taabi&#8217;een (Ibid, 10:358;366-367). It is known that <em>Zuhd</em> practices developed into organized forms of hunger, poverty, self-strive, seclusion, sleeplessness, wandering, handclapping, dancing, going to the markets in strange ways, abandoning the interest in hadeeth knowledge, and other extremes. Sufism further developed into a school of mysticism and corrupt creed and methodology. [See Talbees Iblees, pp. 156-165, published by Maktabat-ul Qur&#8217;aan, Cairo, Egypt.]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Muslim. See Saheeh Muslim, V. 4, Hadeeth #6757.] In another narration by Muslim and Ahmad, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;There is none amongst you with whom there is not an companion from amongst the jinn </strong>[devils] <strong>and an attache from amongst the angels.&#8221;</strong></p>

[See Al-Ashqar&#8217;s book &#8216;Aalam Al-Malaa&#8217;ikah AlAbraar (Kuwait, State of Kuwait: Maktabat Al-Falaah and Daar An-Nafaa&#8217;is, 1411/1991), p. 44.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[86] These are the moments of difficulty which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) used to seek refuge with Allaah from: Abu Huraira narrated that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;he Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) used to seek refuge with Allaah from the difficult moments of calamity and from being overtaken by Ash-Shaqaa&#8217; (wretchedness in the Hereafter or destruction etc.) and from being destined to an evil end, and from the malicious joy of enemies.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyaan (Bin &#8216;Uyainah) said: &#8220;This narration contained three items only, but I added one. I do not know which one that was.&#8221;[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, and An-Nasaa&#8217;ee. See Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 8, Hadeeth #358.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[87] <em>Al-Masheeb</em>: The period of whiteness of the hair, or hoariness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[88] <em>Rushd</em>: Maturity of intellect enabling the person lo follow a right course of action and providing a good management of affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[89] Abu &#8216;Ali Ad-Daqqaaq is Al-Hasan Bin &#8216;Ali Bin Muhammad Bin Ishaaq Bin &#8216;Abdur Raheem Bin Ahmad, a Zaahid Sufi who excelled in fiqh, Islaamic Fundamentals, and Arabic language. According to some reports, he died around 406/1016. See Al-&#8216;Ibar, V. 2, p. 212, and ShatharaatAth-Thahab,V.3,p. 180. Daar Ihyaa&#8217; At-Turaath Al-&#8216;Arabi.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[90] Al-Muhallab Bin Abee Sufrah is Thaalim Ibn Saariq Al-&#8216;Aatakee Al-Azdee, Abu Sa&#8217;eed AI-Basree, One of the trustworthy leaders and heroes who was knowledgeable about war plans and strategies. He reported Hadeeth transmissions from &#8216;Abdullaah Bin &#8216;Amr Bin Al-&#8216;Aas, Samrah Bin Jundhub, Ibn &#8216;Umar, Al-Baraa&#8217; Bin &#8216;Aazib, and others from the Sahaabah [See <em>Tahtheeb Siyar &#8216;AlaamAn-Nubalaa</em>&#8216;, V. 1, #532, and <em>Taqreeb At-Tahtheeb</em>, #6986.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[91] Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said:</p>
<p><strong>فَأَمَّا مَن طَغَىٰ</strong><br />
<strong>وَآثَرَ الْحَيَاةَ الدُّنْيَا</strong><br />
<strong>فَإِنَّ الْجَحِيمَ هِيَ الْمَأْوَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> Then, for him who Taghaa </strong>[transgressed all bounds, in disbelief, oppression, and evil deeds of disobedience to Allaah]<strong>, and preferred the life of this world </strong>[by following his evil desires and lusts]<strong>, verily, his abode will be Hell-Fire.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat An-Naazi&#8217;aal, 79:37-39).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<p><strong>وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَافَ مَقَامَ رَبِّهِ وَنَهَى النَّفْسَ عَنِ الْهَوَىٰ</strong><br />
<strong>فَإِنَّ الْجَنَّةَ هِيَ الْمَأْوَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>But as for him who feared standing before his Rabb </strong>[Allaah]<strong>, and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts, verily, Al-Jannah will be his abode.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat An-Naazi &#8216;aat, 79:40-41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[92] Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said:</p>
<p><strong>ضَرَبَ اللَّهُ مَثَلًا رَّجُلًا فِيهِ شُرَكَاءُ مُتَشَاكِسُونَ وَرَجُلًا سَلَمًا لِّرَجُلٍ هَلْ يَسْتَوِيَانِ مَثَلًا ۚ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ۚ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Allaah puts forth a similitude: A </strong>[slave]<strong> man belonging to many partners </strong>[like those who worship others along with Allaah] <strong>disputing with one another, and a </strong>[slave]<strong> man belonging entirely to one master </strong>[like those who worship Allaah Alone],<strong> Are those two equal in comparison? All the praises and thanks are due to Allaah! But most of them know not.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Az-Zumar (39:29)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[93] Ba&#8217;rah(Pl. Ba&#8217;r) A piece of animal dung. This signifies what is low.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[94] Signifying what is precious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[95] The man of truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[96] In his eloquent and clear speech with the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[97] &#8220;This is from the Ghaybiyaat ( matters of Al-Ghayb) and it is not confirmed by an authentic evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[98] The standing before Allaah on the Day of Resurrection awaiting His Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[99] Know, may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon you, that the shade sometimes is mentioned in relation to Allaah and sometimes in relation to His &#8216;<em>Arsh</em>. Many authentic narrations reported by Imaam Ahmad, Ad-Daarimee, Al-Baghawee, At-Tirmithee, Al-Haakira, At-Tabaraanee and others state that the shade is that of the &#8216;Arsh. As Al-Haafith Ibn Hajar explained, these narrations when related to the context of the agreed upon hadeeth: &#8220;<strong>Allaah will give shade to seven, on the Day when there would be no shade but His&#8230;</strong>&#8221; preponderates that the shade is that of the &#8216;<em>Arsh</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muhammad Al-&#8216;Uthaymeen commented that the Prophet&#8217;s statement: &#8220;<strong>On the Day when there would be no shade but His&#8230;</strong>&#8221; means that there would be no shade except that which He creates and that the belief that the shade is that of Allaah&#8217;s Essence is false, because this would imply that the sun is above Allaah the Most Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[See <em>Fathul Baaree</em> V. 2, p. 144, and <em>Sifaatullaah Al-Waaridah Fil Kitaabi-wasSunnah</em>, by &#8216;Alawee Bin &#8216;Abdul QaadirAs-Saqqaaf pp. 171-174, and <em>Sharhul &#8216;Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> by Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaymeen, V. 2, p. 136.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[100] The seven were mentioned in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah will give shade to seven, on the Day when there will be no shade but His. [These seven persons are]:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(1) a just ruler,</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(2) a youth who has been brought up in the worship of Allaah [i.e. worships Allaah sincerely from his childhood},</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(3) a man whose heart is attached to the mosques [i.e. he offers the five compulsory <em>Salaat</em> (prayers) in the mosques],</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(4) two persons who love each other only for Allaah&#8217;s sake and they meet and part in Allaah&#8217;s Cause only.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(5) a man who refuses the call of a charming women of noble birth for illegal sexual intercourse with her and says: I am afraid of Allaah.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(6) a man who gives charitable gifts so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right hand has given [i. e. nobody knows how much he has given in charity}, and</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(7) a person who remembers Allaah in seclusion and his eyes become flooded with tears, &#8220;</li>
</ul>
<p>[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. The text is that of Al-Bukhaaree: Saheeh AI-Bukhaaree, V. 1, Hadeeth #629.]</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَهُوَ الْقَاهِرُ فَوْقَ عِبَادِهِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> [Allaah] is <strong><em>al-Qaahir</em></strong> </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em> </em><strong>above His slaves</strong>.</span><br />
[Qur’aan<em>, Soorat Al-An’aam </em>(6:18)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah is <em>al-Qaahir</em></strong>: The Most Mighty and the Magnificent, is <strong>dominant</strong> over all his slaves being Himself above creation, the Ever-living, the Mighty, and the AllPowerful. He is the One who <strong>subdued</strong> all of his creatures; everything in the upper and lower worlds is subservient to His Will, and Authority; whatever He willed to happen will certainly occur and as He wanted it to be, and whatever He willed not to occur will never take place; All creatures are in need of Him, they have no control of good or harm to themselves; nor can they control death nor life nor Resurrection. The most powerful creature is nothing before the domination and power of Allaah, the AllMighty; the creatures which people have taken as “gods” besides Allaah, cannot protect themselves let alone to dominate others. Allaah, the perfect is His domination deserves to be worshipped alone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Allaah</strong> is the ‘<em>alam</em> (identifying name or title) of the majestic, sole, and true God. This noun, which is the name of Allaah, applies to none other than Him. He, Most Majestic and High, has other names all of which follow on from His name Allaah. The meaning of the name “Allaah” is the <em>ma’looh</em> (that which is worshipped out of love, magnification, deification, and longing).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[See Shaykh Muhammad Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharhul ‘Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> (Dammaam, KSA: Daar Ibnul Jawzi, 2d. ed. 1415/1994], p. 38, and <em>Sharh Lum’at Al-’Itiqaad</em> (<em>Ismaa’eeliyyah</em>, Egypt: MaktabatulImaam al-Bukhaari (checked by Ashraf Maqsood), 1412/1992)], p. 29.]</span></p>
<p><b>Source</b> : From the eBook: <b><a href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Tafseer Ayatul-Kursi</a></b> – By Shaykh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-’Uthaymeen (<em>rahimahullah</em>). With Related Points of Benefit From the Shaykh’s Commentary on Imaam ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Sharhul ’Aqeedatil-Waasitiyyah</em>, Prepared by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (<em>rahimahullah</em>)</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the name <em>Allaah,</em> <strong>Ibn ul-Qayyim</strong> said in <em>Midaarij us-Saalikeen:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The name <em>Allaah</em> indicates all of the perfect names and lofty attributes in all three ways of indication since it indicates His Divinity, which indicates affirmation of all the characteristics of divinity for Him along with negation of their opposites for Him. So, the attributes of divinity are the attributes of perfection being free from any likeness with the creation and free of any deficiency or imperfection.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the author of the explainer of <em>Kitaab at-Tawheed</em> in <em>Tayseer ul-`Azeez al-<u>H</u>ameed</em>, brings a quote from Ibn ul-Qayyim also with regard to the excellent qualities of the name <em>Allaah</em> that Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the particular virtues of the meaning of this name <em>Allaah</em> then in this regard the most knowledgeable of the creation <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> himself said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“I could not praise You enough as You deserve, You are as You have praised Yourself.”</span></strong></p>
<p>[Reported by Muslim from the <u>h</u>adeeth of A’ishah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anha</em>.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, so how could we enumerate the special virtues of the name of the One Who comprises every perfection unrestrictedly and every praise and commendation and every laudation and exaltation and all splendour and all perfection and all glory and all beauty and all good and all eminence and all generosity, excellence and goodness is for Him and is from Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this name <em>Allaah</em> is not mentioned upon a small amount of something except that it causes it to increase. Nor is it mentioned in a state of fear except that it removes it. Nor is it mentioned upon any misfortune except that it relieves it. Nor in any state of anxiety and distress except that it brings relief. Nor upon any state of difficulty except that it brings ease to it. None who is weak resorts to it except that it brings strength to him. Nor anyone in a state of humiliation except that it brings honour to him. Nor anyone in poverty except that he is enriched. Nor anyone who feels estranged and uneasy except that it causes him to feel at ease. Nor is it mentioned by one who has been overcome except that it brings aid and victory for him. Nor by one who is in straitened circumstances except that his difficulty is removed. Nor is it mentioned by a fugitive except that he finds refuge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the name, meaning Allaah’s name <em>Allaah</em>, it is the name through which distress is removed through which the descent of blessings is sought and through which supplications are answered. Through it slips are corrected, sins are warded away and good deeds are brought closer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the name with which the earth and heavens were established and with which the revealed books were sent down and with which the messengers were sent. With it the legislated laws were prescribed, through it the prescribed punishments were established and with it <em>jihaad</em> was prescribed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Through this name the creation will become divided into the fortunate and the wretched. With it the true and tremendous day is established and with it, the scales of justice are set up, the bridge laid down and the Paradise and the Fire established. With it, the Lord of all creation is worshipped and praised, for its right the messengers were sent and it will be asked about in the grave and for it, there will be the resurrection. Dispute is regarding it and judgement is to it and alliance and enmity are for it. Through it those who know it and establish its rights will be the fortunate ones and through it those who are ignorant of it and leave its rights will be the wretched ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is the reason for creation and command and through it, they are established and confirmed and to it they arrive at a conclusion. So, the creation comes about through it, returns to it and exists because of it. So, there is nothing in creation and no command nor reward and no punishment except that it starts from it and ends with it. That is what brings it about and its reason. Then he quotes the <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>رَبَّنَا مَا خَلَقْتَ هَٰذَا بَاطِلًا سُبْحَانَكَ فَقِنَا عَذَابَ النَّارِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O our Lord, You have not created all of this without purpose, free and far removed are You from that. So save us from the punishment of the Fire.</span> </strong> (Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah</em> 191)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then with regard to the name <strong>الله</strong>  <em>Allaah</em>, brief indication of the meaning which is – <strong>t</strong><strong>he One Who is truly venerated and worshipped, the One deserving that He be singled out with all worship because of His perfect attributes of divinity.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>البَرّ <em>al-Barr</em>:</strong> The One Who is Most Subtle, Kind, Courteous, and Generous; the One Who is ample in goodness and beneficence; Who gives manifold increase of reward to the righteous, and Who overlooks many of the faults of the wrong-doers with gracious forgiveness; whoever brings a good deed, Allaah, <em>al-Barr</em>, rewards him ten times the like thereof to his credit, and whoever brings an evil deed He (تعالى) decrees for him only the recompense of the like thereof, and they will not be wronged. If somebody intends to do a good deed and he does not do it, then Allaah, <em>al-Barr,</em> will write for him a full good deed in his account with Him; and if he intends to do a bad deed and he does not do it, then Allaah will write a full good deed in his account with Him. He loves piety towards Him, goodness, justice, righteousness, honesty, truthfulness, benevolent regard or conduct to parents and others, as well as every incumbent duty.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<strong>Six</strong>]: In the sixth statement, Allaah (تعالى) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills.<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pronoun of the verb { <strong>يُحِيطُونَ </strong>}<strong> &#8220;compass</strong>” refers to either all that is in the heavens and the earth or to the letter haa’ (ـهـ) in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{ <strong>مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong> ] “<strong>What happens to them [the creatures] in the future and what happened to them in the past</strong>.” In the latter case, the meaning would be “Those who Allaah knows what happens to them in the future and what happened to them in the past, will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He Wills.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this statement, Allaah (تعالى) makes clear the perfection of His knowledge and the imperfection of the creature’s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And thus, He (تعالى) compares His Attributes to that of His ‘<em>ibaad</em> in order that His perfection and the imperfection of the creatures become clearly evident. This is also clear in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>كُلُّ مَنْ عَلَيْهَا فَانٍ</strong><br />
<strong>وَيَبْقَىٰ وَجْهُ رَبِّكَ ذُو الْجَلَالِ وَالْإِكْرَامِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Whatsoever on it </strong>(the earth)<strong> will perish. And the Face of your <em>Rabb</em>, full of Majesty and Honour will abide forever.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Ar-Rahmaan (55:26-27)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As far as the word ‘<em>ilm</em> (knowledge) in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>عِلْمِهِ </strong>]<br />
“<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His Knowledge</strong></span>,”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">it is an infinitive (verbal noun) denoting either</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) the ‘<em>ilm</em> of His <em>thaat</em> (Essence) and <em>sifaat</em> (Attributes), or<br />
(b) His <em>ma’loom</em> (What Allaah Knows).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the meaning of the aayah: {<strong>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</strong>} &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills</strong></span>&#8220;, means either</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) that we do not know anything about Allaah, His <em>thaat</em>, and His <em>sifaat</em> except that which He willed for us to know, or</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) that we do not know of what Allaah knows except that which He willed to be known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aayah implies both meanings, and both are correct since we do not know of Allaah’s <em>thaat</em> or <em>sifaat</em> except that which He willed for us to know. Indeed, He is the One Who made it known to us that He ascended upon the ‘<em>arsh</em> (Throne); and He is the One Who taught us on the tongue of His Messenger [Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم] that He descends to the lowest heaven [in the last third of the night]; and this is the case with the rest of His <em>sifaat</em>: We have no knowledge of them except that He wills. Similarly, what Allaah knows regarding what is in the heavens and what is on the earth, our knowledge thereof is restricted to that which He willed for us to know. After all, He is the One Who informed us of the existence of the angels in the heavens and that there are seven heavens. So it is with respect to the rest of what Allaah knows, we are aware of that which He willed for us to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even that which He has made known, many of us are unaware of it; the knowledge thereof are attained only if He wills. In the human being, there are many things which people [i.e. scientists] are not yet fully aware of. They gradually attained the knowledge that they knew not before. So, the aayah comprises both of the meanings discussed above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus we do not know anything of what Allaah knows even that which concerns ourselves except that which He wills, and that we do not compass anything about Allaah’s <em>thaat</em> and <em>sifaat</em> except that which He wills. Therefore, whatever Allaah wills for His creatures to know, whether in relation to His <em>thaat</em>, <em>sifaat</em>, <em>asmaa</em>’ (Names), or Actions; or with respect to His creation or His legal ways which He revealed to His Messengers, then He (تعالى) will make it known for them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Five]: Then Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) said in the Fifth Statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Allaah Knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them in the Hereafter.<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge, according to the scholars of <em>usool</em> (the fundamental principles of <em>deen</em>), is the definitive comprehension of a thing in conformity with its true nature.Thus, the lack of comprehension is ignorance, the indecisive comprehension is doubt, and the assertive comprehension that does not concur with reality is compounded ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if you were asked, “When did the expedition of Badr [59] take place?” And you say, “I do not know,” then this is <strong>ignorance</strong>. If you were asked the same question and you said, “It happened in the second or the third year of <em>hijrah</em>,” then this is <strong>doubt</strong>.[60] And if your answer to the same question was, “The fifth year,” then this is <strong>compounded ignorance</strong>.[61]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most Mighty and Most Majestic, knows things comprehensively and with perfection, overall and in detail. His knowledge is unlike the knowledge of ‘<em>ibaad</em>. That is why He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And Allaah knows what happens to them [the creatures] in the future and what happened to them in the past.</span></strong>[62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The conjunctive noun {<strong>ما</strong>} is a form of generalization (gram.) This comprises everything be it small or great, or whether it is from the actions of Allaah or from the creatures’ deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing what happens to them in the future implies that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is not unaware of the future, and that His knowledge of the past necessitates that He does not forget the past. That is why when Fir’awn said to Mûsa (<em>alaihissalam</em>):</p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">قَالَ فَمَا بَالُ الْقُرُونِ الْأُولَىٰ</span><br />
</strong><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“What about the generations of the old?”</strong> </span>[Qur’aan, Soorat Taha (20:51)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mûsa (<em>alaihissalam</em>) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>قَالَ عِلْمُهَا عِندَ رَبِّي فِي كِتَابٍ ۖ لَّا يَضِلُّ رَبِّي وَلَا يَنسَى</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The knowledge thereof is with my Rabb, in a Record. My Rabb is neither unaware nor He forgets.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Taha (20:52)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is neither unaware of the future nor does He forget the past.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[59] The Battle of Badr occurred between the army of the believers lead by Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and the polytheists of Quarysh and it took place on the 17th of Ramadaan of the second year of Hijrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[60] Because you give another answer, which you think has the same possibility of being the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[61] This is known as <em><strong>al-jahlul-murakkab</strong></em>, which is to comprehend something in a way contrary to its true reality. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharh Thalaathat Al-Usool</em> (Burmingham, UK: Al-Hidaayah Publication, 1st. ed. 1418/1997)], p. 37.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[62] This is one of the meanings of this great aayah. It signifies that Allaah’s knowledge encompasses everything in the past, present, and the future; nothing escapes Allaah’s knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note</strong>: One of the Names of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>العليم</strong> </span><strong>al-&#8216;Aleem</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The One Who knows what has been and what will be; Who ever has known, and ever will know, what has been and what will be; His knowledge comprehends all things, the covert and the overt, the small thereof and the great, the possible and the impossible, the lofty and lower spheres, etc. in the most complete manner. Nothing is concealed from Him in the earth or in the heavens.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Seven]: Then Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong> وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ ۖ وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His kursi extends over the heavens and the earth encompassing them all, He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>kursi</em> [literally: footstool] is <em>mawdi’ul qadamayn</em> (place of the Feet) of Allaah, Most Mighty and Most Majestic, and it is before the ‘<em>arsh</em> like a front to it. This was authentically related by ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) in a <em>mawqoof</em> [63] type of narration. This is agreed upon by the majority of <em>ahlussunnah wal jamaa’ah</em>. In fact, this is asserted by Shaykh-ulIslam Ibn Taymeeyah, [Imaam] Ibnul Qayyim, and others from the people of knowledge and from the verifying scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some have said that <em>al-kursi</em> is the ‘<em>arsh</em> itself. However, this is not true because the ‘<em>arsh</em> is greater, more spacious, and more profound in its extent of encompassing than <em>al-kursi</em>. It has also been narrated on the authority of ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) that <em>al-kursi</em> represents Allaah’s Knowledge. But I do not think that this narration is authentic because this meaning (i.e. knowledge) is not the true meaning for the word al-kursi in the classical Arabic language nor in the common (‘urfi) language. In fact, it is very unlikely that this transmission from ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) is an authentic one [64]. Hence, <em>al-kursi</em> is <em>mawdi’ul qadamayan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatness of <em>al-kursi</em> is clearly stated in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The seven heavens and the seven earths by the side of <em>al-kursi</em> are naught but as a ring thrown down in a desert land, and such is <em>al-kursi</em> with respect to <em>al-’Arsh</em> (the Throne).”</strong></span> [65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth indicates the vastness of these immense creations and which are, with respect to us, from the world of <em>al-ghayb</em>. That is why Allaah سبحانه و تعالى says:</p>
<p><strong>أَفَلَمْ يَنظُرُوا إِلَى السَّمَاءِ فَوْقَهُمْ كَيْفَ بَنَيْنَاهَا وَزَيَّنَّاهَا وَمَا لَهَا مِن فُرُوجٍ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Have they not looked at the heavens above them, how We have made it and adorned it, and there are no rifts in it.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Qaaf (50:6)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He سبحانه و تعالى did not say: “<strong>Have they not looked at al-kursi (or al- ‘arsh)&#8230;</strong>,” because this is something that is not seen by us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Had it not been that Allaah had informed us about it (<em>al-kursi</em> or <em>al-‘arsh</em>), we would not have known of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>His kursi extends over and encompasses the heavens and the earth&#8221;</strong></span>, supports the opinion held by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah and by other verifying scholars that the heavens and the earths all have a spherical shape, because this is a matter acknowledged by sensory perception, and through information, though the latter method may have been hidden from many of the preceding people. The proof for this from the Qur’aan is in the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِذَا السَّمَاءُ انشَقَّتْ</strong><br />
<strong>وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ</strong><br />
<strong>وَإِذَا الْأَرْضُ مُدَّتْ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">When the heaven is split asunder [on the Day of Resurrection], and listens and obeys its Rabb,—and it must do so; And when the earth is stretched forth&#8230;</span></strong>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Inshiqaaq (84:1-3)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And when the earth is stretched forth,&#8221;</span> </strong>necessitates that it is now unstretched. In addition, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said that on the Day of Resurrection, the earth will be stretched forth like stretched leather, the example of which is drawn for emphasis. [66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another proof is the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p><strong>يُكَوِّرُ اللَّيْلَ عَلَى النَّهَارِ وَيُكَوِّرُ النَّهَارَ عَلَى اللَّيْلِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong><em>Yukawwiru</em> the night around the day </strong>[making it to be a covering upon the day]<strong> and <em>Yukawwiru</em> the day around the night.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Az-Zumar (39:5)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Yukawiru</em> means: “to wind round,”[67] like in our saying, “the <em>akwaar</em> (singl. <em>kawr</em>) of the turban,” meaning the turns of the turban upon the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that the day and night succeed each other upon earth and in doing so, this entails that the earth is spherical, because a thing would not be wound around in a round form except upon something ball-shaped. Nowadays, it is witnessed that the earth is spherical in form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fact that <em>al-kursi</em> extends over and encompasses the heavens and the earth is evidence that it is wound round in a round form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding <em>al-‘arsh</em>, it has been reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) described it as being like a dome above the heavens.[68] The dome-shape being round but neither fully spherical nor flat, and its middle is high like that of a tent. [69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And He</strong> [Allaah سبحانه و تعالى]<strong> feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them </strong>[i.e. the heavens and the earths]<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This attribute of Allaah [feeling no fatigue] is an Attribute of negation. So, what are the Attributes required for guarding and preserving [the heavens and the earths] such that we know that this negation [of fatigue] is in fact an affirmation of their perfection? It is essential that the guarding and preserving require Life, Knowledge, Ability, Might, Mercy, and possibly other attributes. What is important is that the negation implies the perfection of Allaah’s Knowledge, Ability, Might, and Mercy as well as the other related Attributes that are entailed by His (سبحانه و تعالى) preserving and guarding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[63] <em>Mawqoof</em>: lit. “stopped”. It is a narration from a companion only. The hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is called <em>marfoo</em>’. Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) commented, “Had it not been that Ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما) is one whom it is said that he takes from the Israelite transmissions (<em>israa’eeliyyaat</em>: narrations from the traditions of the People of the Book), we would have said that this transmission (regarding <em>al-kursi</em>) takes the form of <em>marfoo</em>’ tradition, because it deals with knowledge of <em>al-ghayb</em> (the world of unperceived realities). When it comes to this kind of knowledge, there is no room for <em>ijtihaad</em> (scholarly deductions). When a <em>sahaabi</em> (companion) says or does something which is not within the scope of <em>ijtihaad</em>, then it takes the <em>marfoo</em>’ type of tradition. The exception, however, is that if the narration from the <em>sahaabi</em> is of the form of <em>akhbaar</em> (news telling, relating information), then, if it is known that a <em>sahaabi</em> narrates from Bani Israa’eel, his transmission would not be <em>marfoo</em>’ because of the possibility that its source may be from Bani Israa’eel (an Israelite transmission). Knowing that the scholars are scrupulous in their inspection of what is attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), they do not rule that a particular transmission is <em>marfoo</em>’ except when all of the possibilities that may hinder this ruling are ruled out.” Tafseer Aayat Al-Kursi, pp. 19-20.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: This report from Ibn ‘Abbaas is related by ‘Abdullaah Ibn al-Imaam Ahmad (As-Sunnah: 586), Ibn Abee Shaybah (al-&#8216;Arsh: 61), Ibn Khuzaymah (At-Tawheed: 248), and by alHaakim (Al-Mustadrak: 2:282) who said it is saheeh according to the conditions of alBukhaari and Muslim. Imaam ath-Thahabi agreed to the authentication of al-Haakim. Ad-Daaraqutni reported it in his book As-Sifaat (36) as mawqoof from Ibn ‘Abbaas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani said: “Its <em>isnaad</em> is <em>saheeh</em>, and its narrators are all reliable.” (Mukhtasar Al-’Uluw: 45).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[64] Shaykeh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah (Al-Fataawaa, 6:584), and Shaykh al-Albaani (AsSilsilah As-Saheehah, no. 109), stated the weakness of this narration from Ibn ‘Abbaas (رضي االله عنهما).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[65] Reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah (Al-&#8216;Arsh, 58), and by Al-Baihaqi (Al-Asmaa’ wasSifaat, 862) with both narrations being from the way of Abee Thar (radhi Allaahu anhu). Shaykh al-Albaani (As-Silsilah As-Saheehah, no. 109) stated that there is no single authentic hadeeth attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) regarding <em>al-kursi</em> except this one.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[66] Reported by Ibn Jareer at-Tabari (Tafseer at-Tabari, 30:115-116) on the authority of ‘Ali Ibn al-Hussain. The transmission, however, is mursal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: A hadeeth is categorized as <em>mursal</em> when the link between the <em>taabi’ee</em> (successor of the <em>sahaabah</em>) and the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is missing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[67] The infinitive noun is <em>takweer</em>, which means to round a thing in a round form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[68] This has been reported in Sunan Abee Daawood (English Translation), no. 4708 and in the Sunnah by Ibn Abee ‘Aasim, no. 575, and by others. There is disagreement regarding the authenticity of its isnaad. Imaam ath-Thahabai and other scholars of hadeeth including al-Albaani graded its isnaad as weak. Imaam Ibn al-Aye supported its authenticity. The text describing al-&#8216;Arsh as a dome over the heavens is supported by the context of an authentic narration reported by Imaam al-Bukhaari in his Saheeh (Arabic/English), vol. 9, no. 519 and in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“There are one-hundred degrees in al-Jannah which Allaah has prepared for those who carry on jihaad in His Cause. The distance between every two degrees is like the distance between the sky and the earth, so if you ask Allaah for anything, ask Him for the Firdaws for it is the middle and highest part of al-Jannah and at its top is al-&#8216;Arsh of ar-Rahmaan (Allaah), and from it gush forth the rivers of al-Jannah.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8216;Arsh being the roof of the Firdaws, which is the middle and highest part of alJannah, indicates that it has a dome-shape because a thing cannot be at the middle and at its highest point (peak) unless it is round. [See Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Al-Fataawaa</em>, vol. 5, pp. 150-155, and the book of <em>Al-&#8216;Arsh</em> by Muhammad Ibn ‘Uthmaan Ibn Abee Shaybah (Riyadh, KSA: Maktabat ar-Rushd (checked by Dr. Muhammad Ibn Khaleefah at-Tameemi), 1418/1998), p. 333].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[69] This is based upon additional explanation of the translated text which the author, Shaykh Ibn ’Uthaymeen, may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, directly related to me on Wednesday the 16th of Safar 1419Hj, corresponding to the 10th of June 1998. He stated that this explanation fits with that of the hadeeth on the Firdaws as mentioned above. And Allaah knows best.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>aayah</i> contains <i>ismullaahi al-aa’tham</i> (Allaah’s Most Greatest Name) affirmed in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> الحيُّ الَقيُّوم</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Allaah, there is no god worthy of worship except He, the one who possesses the perfect living, and Who is established on His Own, Self-subsisting, and by Whom all things subsist.</b></span>[88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two Names were mentioned in three places in the Qur’aan, in the two soorahs known as <i>az-zahraawayn</i> [89] (AlBaqarah and Aal-’Imran), and in Soorat <i>Taha</i>.[90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of <i>‘ilm</i> (<i>ahlul-‘ilm</i>) said: The Most Great Name of Allaah is only in these two Names since they comprise the Most Beautiful Names in their entirety, and hence the attribute of Perfection is implied in the Name [ <b>الحيُّ </b>]and the attribute of <i>ihsaan</i> (beauty) is entailed in the Name: [ <b>الَقيُّوم</b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[88] Allaah is the one who sustains, protects, prepares, and runs the affairs of all things as He wills in accordance with His Knowledge, Wisdom, and Justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[89] <em>Zahraawayn</em> (dual form of <em>zahra</em>): The bright ones. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Recite the Qur’aan, for on the Day of Resurrection it will come as an intercessor for those who recite it. Recite the two bright ones, Al-Baqarah and Soorat Aal-’Imraan, for on the Day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds or two shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them. Recite Soorat Al-Baqarah, for to take recourse to it is a blessing and to give it up is a cause of grief, and the magicians cannot confront it.”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported in <em>Saheeh Muslim</em> (English Translation), vol. 2, no. 1757.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[90] In Al-Baqarah (2:255), in Aal-’Imraan (3:2), and in Taha (20:111).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Umaamah (رضي االله عنه) reported that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Allaah’s Most Great Name is in three soorahs in the Qur’aan, in Soorat Al-Baqarah and in Aal-’Imraan and in Soorat Taha.”</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qaasim bin ‘Abdur-Rahmaan, one of the narrators of this hadeeth, searched the Qur’aan and found</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">Aaytul-Kursi in Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:255):<br />
<strong>[ االلهُ لا إله إلاَّ ُ هوَ الحَيُّ القَيُّوم ]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And in Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:2):<br />
<strong>[ اللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ الْحَيُّ الْقَيُّومُ ]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">And in Soorat Taha (20:111)<br />
<strong>[ وَعَنَتِ الْوُجُوهُ لِلْحَيِّ الْقَيُّومِ ]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by al-Haakim, Ibn Maajah, at-Tabarani, at-Tahaawi, and others. Shaykh al-Albaani authenticated its isnaad (<i>As-Silsilah As-Saheeha</i>), vol. 2, no. 746.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[FOURTH]: In the fourth statement, Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ<br />
Who is it that can intercede with Him except with His Permission?</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word { ْ<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن</strong></span> } &#8220;Who” is an interrogative noun [46] and the intended use of the interrogation in the sentence is to assert the <strong>negation</strong> [that there is none who can intercede] as evident in the <strong>affirmation</strong> phrase which followed it: { ِ<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> إإِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong> </span> } “<strong>Except with His Permission</strong>.” Whenever a negation takes the form of an interrogative construct, then the statement is infused with the meaning of challenge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Intercession (<em>Ash-Shafaa’ah</em>):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">{ <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>يَشْفَعُ </strong> </span>}<br />
“<strong>Intercedes</strong>,”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">know that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 . Linguistically, the term “<em>shafaa’ah</em>” means to make an odd number an even one.[47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 . Traditionally, it refers to the laying of a petition (interceding, mediating) with someone in favor of another, in procuring a benefit or warding off harm. Thus the <em>shafaa’ah</em> of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) for <em>ahlul-mawqif</em> [48] after the worry and distress which befalls them and which they are unable to bear is an intercession to ward off a harm. On the other hand, the Prophet’s <em>shafaa’ah</em> for <em>ahlul-Jannah</em> [49] to enter <em>al-Jannah</em> is aimed at procuring a benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. None can intercede except by Allaah’s Permission: { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong></span> } His Leave is <em>kawni</em>. [50] Even Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) who has the greatest rank with Allaah cannot intercede except with the prior leave from Allaah. He will be granted this permission after he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) prostrates before Allaah and praises Him with the great praises and glorifications which Allaah guides him to it on that day. Then it will be said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;ارفع رأسك وقل يُسمَع واشفَعْ تُشَف َّع.&#8221;<br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Raise your head and speak; you will be listened to, intercede and your intercession will be accepted.”</strong> </span>[51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[It is known] that no one have a rank with Allaah greater than that of the Messenger [Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم], nevertheless, he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) cannot intercede except with the prior leave of Allaah. It is so because of Allaah, Most Majestic and Most High’s, perfection of Authority and <em>hayybah</em>.[52] The more a king’s authority becomes fully established, the more reverent and respected he becomes. People would not even speak in his court unless he speaks. Consider the Prophet’s (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) relation with his companions and which Quraysh’s [53] emissary [‘Urwah bin Mas’oud] described [after finalizing the treaty of AlHudaybiyah]: &#8220;<em>And when they spoke to him they would lower their voices</em>.&#8221; [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is out of respect. You find that if a king is revered by his flock, then no one can speak in his court and in his presence because of the might of his authority. [55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[The Conditions of Confirmed Intercession]:</strong></span> [56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, (تعالى ), has made it clear that He does not permit intercession except for the one whom He approves of and whose word is acceptable to Him, and for the one He is pleased with and on whose behalf intercession shall be made. It is inevitable that Allaah is pleased with <em>ash-shaafi</em>’, the intercessor, and al-<em>mashfoo’i lahu</em>, the one on whose behalf intercession is sought.[57] Consequently, the idols of the polytheists could not intercede on their behalf with Allaah because Allaah does not approve of them. The Prophets and the righteous do not intercede on behalf of the polytheists because the latter are not approved with Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, the conditions for the confirmed <em>shafaa’ah</em> are three:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah’s permission of it.<br />
2. Allaah being pleased with the <em>shaafi</em>’.<br />
3. His approval of the one on whose behalf intercession is sought (<em>al-mashfoo’i lahu</em>).[58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[46] In the grammatical sense, the noun { ْ<strong>مَن</strong> ] is the subject, and the term { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>ذَا</strong> </span>] is omitted for being redundant. The term { <strong>الَّذِي</strong> } &#8220;<em>he that</em>&#8221; is a relative pronoun standing as the predicate of the subject {مَن } &#8220;<em>Who</em>.” [Author’s note].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[47] Allaah (تعالى) said: { <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>وَالشَّفْعِ وَالْوَتْرِ </strong></span> }, [which means], <strong>And by the <em>shaf’a</em></strong> (even) <strong>and the <em>witr</em> </strong>(odd) [of all the creations of Allaah]. [Qur’aan <em>Soorat Al-Fajr</em> (89:3)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[48] <strong>Ahlul-Mawqif:</strong> All human beings gathered on one plane on the Day of Resurrection awaiting their accounts to be taken by Allaah. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said, “<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The sun will come so close to the people that they will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to tolerate it or to bear it</strong></span>.” The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intercedes with Allaah to pronounce His Judgment among the people of <em>al-Mawqif</em>. They will be relieved from their long standing by virtue of his interceding with Allaah on their behalf. [See <em>Saheeh alBukhaari</em> (Arabic/English)], vol. 6, no. 236.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[49] <em>Ahlul-Jannah:</em> The believers who will be admitted to reside forever in <em>al-Jannah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[50] <em><strong>Kawni</strong></em>: Pertaining to the Universal Will of Allaah, the Most Majestic and Most Magnificent, and which is in accordance with His Foreknowledge and Wisdom. Creation, provisions, life, death, permission to intercede, and so forth exists by the Will of Allaah. Everything that Allaah Wills is certain to occur. He Willed that <em>eemaan</em> (belief in Allaah) and <em>kufr</em> (disbelief) occur, although He Loves <em>eemaan</em> and Hates <em>kufr</em>. On the other hand, the Legislative Decree (<em>al-hukm ash-shar’i</em>) comprises the Revealed Laws (<em>sharee’ah</em>) which the Messengers came with and what is stated in the Revealed Scriptures. Under this Decree, Allaah Loves that mankind believe in Him (<em>eemaan</em>) and does not Love for them to commit <em>kufr</em>. Mankind, however, may or may not believe in Allaah. In short, under His Universal Will, everything Allaah Wills is certain to pass while under the Legislative Will, what is beloved to Allaah may or may not take place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[51] Part of a long and agreed upon <em>hadeeth</em>. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em> (Arabic/ English)], vol. 6, no. 3 and no. 236.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[52] <em>Hayybah</em>: An attribute inspiring reverence, or veneration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[53] Quraysh is the tribe of the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[54]This is part of a long hadeeth detailing the story of the treaty of Al-Hudaybiyah. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em>, vol. 3, hadeeth 891 (English/Arabic).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[55] Kings are in need of intercessors because of the imperfection of their knowledge, might and authority. Allaah, Most Perfect in His Might, Knowledge, and Authority, is in no need for intercessors. That is why intercession with Allaah takes place only if He permits it. With kings, however, intercession is permitted with or without a king’s permission. Those close to the king, for example, may intercede without permission. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s<em> Al-Qawlul Mufeed ‘Alaa Kitaabit-Tawheed</em> (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia: Daarul ‘Aasimah, 1st ed. 1415/1994)], vol. 1, p. 330, 332.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[56]The intercessions permitted by Allaah تعالى are six. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) will have the privilege of making three of these intercessions. They are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Prophet’s intercession for <em>ahlul-mawqif</em>. This is known as the Prophet’s greatest <em>shafaa’ah</em> and it is part of the highest station of praise and honour (<em>almaqaam al-mahmood</em>) with which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is distinguished, and for which he will be praised by all creatures. It is mentioned in the Qur’aan [17:78].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The Prophet’s intercession for <em>ahlul-Jannah</em> to enter <em>al-Jannah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The Prophet’s (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) intercession with Allaah تعالى to reduce the punishment of his uncle, Abu Taalib because of his protection and support of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). He will be placed in a shallow part of Hell-Fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other intercessions are not restricted to the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). They include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The Prophet’s intercession with Allaah تعالى that He does not cast into Hell the one who deserves it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. His intercession of taking out from Hell those admitted to it because of their sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The intercession to raise the ranks of the believers. This is the du’aa of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to believers and by the believers for each other.</p>
<p>[See (1) Shaykh bin Baaz’s commentary on Ibn Taymeeyah’s <em>Al-’Aqeedah Al-Waasitiyyah</em> which Shaykh ‘Ali Hasan ‘Abdul Hameed compiled in his verification of Shaykh ‘AbdurRahmaan As-Sa’di’s book <em>At-Tanbeehaat Al-lateefah ‘Ala Al-Waasitiyyah</em> (Dammaam, Saudi Arabia: Daar Ibnul Qayyim, 1409/1989), p. 73, and (2) Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Al-Qawlul-Mufeed</em>, pp. 332-335].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intercessions mentioned above are the ones approved by Allaah (تعالى). The annulled intercession is any intercession not approved by Allaah(تعالى ).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[57] The conditions are stated in the following aayaat:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Who is he that will intercede with Him except by His permission.</strong> </span><br />
[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Baqarah</em> (2:255)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>يَوْمَئِذٍ لَّا تَنفَعُ الشَّفَاعَةُ إِلَّا مَنْ أَذِنَ لَهُ الرَّحْمَٰنُ وَرَضِيَ لَهُ قَوْلًا</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>On that day, no intercession shall avail, except the one for whom ar-Rahmaan has given permission and whose word is acceptable to Him.</strong> </span>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Taha</em> (20:109)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Allaah (تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong> وَلَا يَشْفَعُونَ إِلَّا لِمَنِ ارْتَضَىٰ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased.</span> </strong>[Qur’aan,<em>Soorat Al-Anbiyaa’</em> (21:28)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[58] The case of intercession on behalf of the Prophet’s uncle, Abu Taalib, is excluded and in a very limited sense from the ruling stated in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>فَمَا تَنفَعُهُمْ شَفَاعَةُ الشَّافِعِينَ</strong></span><br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">No intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> [unbelievers, polytheists]</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">.</span></strong>[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Muddathir</em> (74:48)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Taalib stood in support of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and protected him from his enemies of Quraysh. The intercession on behalf of Abu Taalib is special for the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). Other than this special intercession, none is allowed to intercede for a kaafir. Even Abu Taalib is not saved from the Fire of Hell. Had it not been for the intercession of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), Abu Taalib “<strong>would have been in the bottom of the (Hell) Fire</strong>,” as the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said. “<strong>Perhaps my intercession will be helpful to him on the Day of Resurrection so that he may be put in a shallow fire reaching only up to his ankles with which his brain will boil</strong>,” he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) added. [See <em>Saheeh al-Bukhaari</em>, vol. 5, no. 222 and no. 224, and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Al-Qawlul Mufeed</em>, vol. 1, p. 334].</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[THIRD]: In the Third statement, Allaah (تعالى) said:</p>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>To Him belongs whatever </strong>(maa)<strong> is in the heavens </strong></span>[44]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong> and whatever is on the earth. </strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]<span style="color:#008000;"><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name {<strong>ما</strong>} &#8220;maa&#8221; here is a conjunctive noun (gram. <em>ism mawsool</em>) taking a form of generalization. The term is used in this form in order to indicate that it comprises both the beings and their states. The meaning, therefore, is that Allaah is the One Who masters the affairs of everything in existence in the heavens and the earth: <strong>creating</strong>, <strong>sovereignty-kingship,</strong> and <strong>management</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sentence <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</strong> &#8221; <strong>&#8220;To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth&#8221;</strong></span> is a declarative clause in which the predicate (gram. khabar) { <strong>له</strong> } “To Him” has preceded the subject (gram. <em>mubtada</em>’) which is the conjunctive noun {ما} &#8220;Whatever”. In this way, there is a grammatical state of <em>hasr</em> (exclusivity, restriction) which signifies that to Him (Allaah) alone belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth. Accordingly, since creating, sovereignty-kingship, and management of affairs belong to Allaah alone, it is incumbent that we should surrender to Him alone because we are His slaves, and a slave must surrender to the One Who Owns and Masters him, Allaah, the One free of all imperfection, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, we must stand to <strong>persevere Allaah’s pre-decree</strong> because we are His possession and anything that is owned by Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, then it follows that is His right to administer its affairs as He Wills. This right is the same whether His pre-decree applies to the person himself, his family, wealth, friends, country, or the rest of mankind. The important thing is that since the dominion belongs to Allaah, then it is His exclusive right to do whatever He Wills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the saying of Allaah (which means),<span style="color:#008000;"> <strong>“To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth,”</strong> </span>the term “heavens” came in the <strong>plural form</strong> [45] while the word “earth” was stated in the <strong>singular</strong> though what is meant is the plural. In this regard, the intended usage of the term “earth” refers to the <em>jins</em> (kind).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[44] From the angels, jinn, and all that which exists, including which we have no knowledge of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[45] The Qur’aan has stated that there are seven heavens:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>قُلْ مَن رَّبُّ السَّمَاوَاتِ السَّبْعِ وَرَبُّ الْعَرْشِ الْعَظِيمِ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: Who is the Rabb of the seven heavens and the Rabb of the great &#8216;Arsh?</strong></span><br />
[Qur’aan, <em>Soorat Al-Mu’minoon</em> (23:86)].</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following is excerpted from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s explanation of <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2011/11/03/tafseer-ayatul-kursi/">Aayatul-Kursi</a>, Translated by <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/audio-saleh-as-saleh/">Dr. Saleh as-Saleh</a> rahimahullaah</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">[ <strong>لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ </strong>]<strong><br />
</strong></span><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him,<br />
</strong></span>[Qur’aan, Aayatul-Kursi , Surah Al-Baqarah 2:255]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah did not say (what means): “<strong>He does not sleep</strong>,” instead He said<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/asma-wa-sifaat-com/">:</a><span style="color:#008000;">{<strong> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ</strong> }</span> (which means) “<strong>does not overtake Him</strong>” in order to comprise the sleep that overcomes and that arising by choice. If you say, “Does not sleep,” it would imply that He does not sleep by choice. However, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, does not sleep neither by <em>ghalabah</em> (overcoming) nor by choice, because sleep is an imperfect attribute which contradicts both the perfection of the Self and the perfection in relation to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person who is given to sleep misses a lot of his work because of His sleeping. Consider, for example, the case of a person who has many people working for him and he sleeps a lot. He is unable to neither reckon with nor manage the business or other related matters. This is an imperfection with respect to others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regard to self-perfection, sleep is a deficiency because it indicates that the person’s body got tired and thus he needed the sleep as a rest from what has passed, as well as a means to renew his activity to engage in what will come ahead. That is the why <strong>the people of <em>al-Jannah</em> do not sleep</strong>—because of the perfection of their lives and bodies. No illness or the like touches them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone says, <span style="color:#993300;">“We know that the person who does not sleep is unable to do so because of some kind of sickness or a defect, while you say that the lack of sleep is perfection. Explain.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say, “This applies to the creature, and in this case perfection is a relative matter [with respect to Allaah it is perfection]. There is no doubt that the person who does not sleep because of an illness has a defect, and that is why he stays always in a state of languor and exhaustion. Thus, his welfare will not be established. This is evident from the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَجَعَلْنَا نَوْمَكُمْ سُبَاتًا </strong>]<br />
<strong style="color:#008000;font-size:1rem;">And have made your sleep as a thing for rest<br />
</strong>[Qur’aan, Soorat An-Naba’ (78:9)],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">meaning that sleep is something that will discontinue the hardship and tiredness. If Allaah would sleep, and far is He above such imperfection, then this would necessitate that He needs to rest. In addition, the creation will be ruined because they are in need of Him; even the sleeping person is in need of Allaah. In fact, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) used to invoke Allaah at night when he was about to sleep:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>فَإِنْ أَمْسَكْتَ نَفْسِي فَارْحَمْهَا، وَإِنْ أَرْسَلْتَهَا فَاحْفَظْهَا، بِمَا تَحْفَظُ بِهِ عِبَادَكَ الصَّالِحِين</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“If You take my soul, bestow mercy on it [and forgive it, as in another narration], and if You release it then protect it as You protect your righteous slaves.”</strong></span> [38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, it is impossible that Allaah, the One free of all imperfections and the Most High, sleeps. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>إِنَّ اللَّهَ لاَ يَنَامُ وَلاَ يَنْبَغِي لَهُ أَنْ يَنَامَ</strong><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily Allaah does not sleep and it does not befit Him to sleep.&#8221;</strong></span> [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word [ ”<strong>لا يَنبَغِي</strong> &#8220;] does not befit] when used in the Qur’aan and sunnah means “the thing which is absolutely impossible to be,” as Allaah (تعالى ) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَمَا يَنبَغِي لِلرَّحْمَٰنِ أَن يَتَّخِذَ وَلَدًا </strong>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>But it is not befitting for </strong>(the Majesty of) <strong>ar-Rahmaan </strong>(Allaah)<strong> that He should beget a son </strong>(or offspring or children)<strong>.</strong></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Maryam (19:92)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[It should be noted] that Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</strong> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him,</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">signifies <em><strong>as-sifaat as-salbiyyah</strong></em> (attributes of negation: negating any imperfection and implying perfection). The rule with respect to the Names and Attributes of Allaah, the Most High, is that there is no such thing as a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">pure</span> attribute of negation.[40] Indeed, when <em>as-sifaat as-salbiyyah</em> are mentioned, it is because they imply the perfection of the attributes that are in contradiction to those of negation.[41] So, because of the Perfection of Allaah’s Life and <em>qayyoumiyyah</em>,[42] then neither slumber nor sleep overtake Him.[43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[38] Saheeh al-Bukhaari (Arabic/English), vol. 8, no. 332.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[39] Saheeh Muslim (English Translation), vol. 1, no. 343.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] This is because mere negation does not denote any attribute, and therefore it is not considered praise. In addition, the attributes of negation are of two kinds:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. General, and<br />
2. Specific.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of generality in negation is that Allaah, Most High, negates all imperfections implicitly denoting that all Perfection is His. For example: Allaah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[ <strong>لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ</strong> ], [which means], “<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is nothing like unto Him</strong></span>.” So, there is nothing unto Him in His Knowledge, Ability, Hearing, Seeing, Might, Wisdom, Mercy, and so forth. In this general negation, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) did not specify the negation. Accordingly, all imperfections are denied and all perfections are denoted, and it is stated that there is <strong>nothing like unto Him</strong> in all of His Perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, the specificity in negation is to negate specific allegations of imperfection. For example to deny that defects and drawbacks like forgetfulness, sleep, ignorance, having son or partner, etc. are associated with Allaah, the Exalted. Again, the Perfection is implied as against the negation. [See Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen’s <em>Sharhul Waasitiyyah</em>], vol. 1, pp. 145-146.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[41] For example, the negation of ignorance stands for the affirmation of Allaah’s unlimited knowledge. The negation of death, which is in contradiction of life, implies the perfection of Allaah’s attribute of Life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[42] <em>Qayyoumiyyah</em>: The Attribute denoted by Allaah’s Name <em>al-Qayyoum</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[43] The Perfection of His Life negates that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) needs to sleep and the same is due to the Perfection of His <em>qayyoumiyyah</em>, as the created living creatures due to their imperfection need sleep. Although sleeping and eating may be considered as attributes of perfection with respect to man, as a person who does not sleep or eat is considered ill, they are perfection from one angle and defects from another. They are perfection in the sense that they indicate that the body is sound and healthy, and are defects because the body needs them to function. In reality, therefore, they are defects. Accordingly, the &#8220;perfection&#8221; in the created is only relevant, i.e. particular to the created, not shared by the Most Perfect, i.e. Allaah. Eating, drinking and sleeping are relative “perfections” with respect to the created and negated defects with respect to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why Allaah, the Most High, said about Himself:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <strong>وَهُوَ يُطْعِمُ وَلَا يُطْعَمُ </strong>]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And it is He </strong>(Allaah) <strong>Who feeds and is not fed.</strong></span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Historically, the <em>Khawaarij</em> are those who rebelled against ‘Ali ibn Abee Taalib (رضي االله عنه) in the 37th year of Hijrah (657 C.E.) and imputed <em>kufr</em> upon ‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) upon the arbitration that followed the Battle of Siffeen. They hated ‘Ali’s decision to end the <em>fitnah</em> which occurred with Mu’aawiyah (رضي االله عنه), calling ‘Ali’s acceptance of the arbitration a compromise. They also imputed <em>kufr</em> upon many of the <em>sahaabah</em> who accepted the arbitration. They did not even accept the whole of ‘Uthman’s (رضي االله عنه) Caliphate. This position stems from their misunderstanding of the Qur’aan. They deduced, wrongly, that major sins are <em>kufr</em> and thus forfeit salvation. Sin is a contradiction that nullifies faith! ‘Ali and the other <em>sahaabah</em> sinned in the eyes of the <em>Khawaarij</em> and that sufficed to nullify their state of belief! Their doctrine became famous in their rebellions against any Muslim leader who, in their eyes, committed a sin or a mistake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) informed us before his death of the emergence of this sect and that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>They will kill the Muslims and leave the idolaters. Should I live until they appear, I would kill them as the killing of the nation of ‘Aad</strong></span>.”[103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The <em>Khawaarij</em> are the dogs of the Fire.</strong></span>”[104]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) delegated ibn ‘Abbaas ( رضي االله عنهما) to call them to the truth. He succeeded in convincing several thousands of them. Those who rejected continued to spread mischief even after ‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) warned them against it. He finally fought them in the battle of an-Nahrawaan (38Hj/658) and only few of them escaped and continued the secession. ‘Ali (رضي االله عنه) was himself killed by a Kharijite by the name of Ibn Muljam. They split into many groups and today they survive in ‘Oman, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, and in Tanzania and they are known as the <em>Ibaadiyyah</em> (<em>ibadi</em> Kharijism).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Khawaarij</em> sect was later influenced by scholastic theology and its principles became very close to those of the <em>Jahmite</em> and <em>Mu’tazilite</em> sects. They center upon the following matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) Imputing <em>kufr</em> upon ‘Ali, ‘Uthmaan and other sahaabah  (رضي االله عنهم أجمعين)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) The right to rebel and fight the Muslim rulers who may err or sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Justifying the rebellion and fight against disobedient Muslims (rulers and/or ruled) and that it is permissible for them to secede from the general body of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) They believe that the Qur’aan is created.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the Qur’aan is the literal Word of Allaah Who uttered it in letter and sound and which He Spoke to Jibreel (alaihissalam), directly without a mediator, and who then brought it down to the Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). The Qur’aan is neither the word of Jib reel nor the word of Prophet Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) They distort the meanings of Allaah’s Attributes by resorting to figurative interpretation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) Like the twelver <em>Shee’ites</em> and other deviant sects, they deny that the believers will see Allaah on the Day of Resurrection. This contradicts what is asserted in the Qur’aan and authentic <em>sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(7) Imputing <em>kufr</em> on the Muslims who commit major sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(8) The majority of the <em>Khawaarij</em> deny the actual punishment in the grave that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) inflicts upon those who deserve it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforementioned are some of the major characteristics of the <em>Khawaarij</em>. I intended to give the reader some background about this very dangerous sect and which has influenced many Muslim groups and parties in our times leading to bloodshed in many parts of the Muslim World. The bloody confrontations are hard to stop in some places and that has distorted the view of Islam in many parts of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The truth, however, is emerging and will <em>inshaa’ Allaah</em> completely emerge on the hands of the true followers of Islam who are working hard to correct this problem with the good word without compromising the ‘<em>aqeedah</em> nor the <em>manhaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should be able to present the truth without imitating the <em>kuffaar</em> and their ways. In this respect, the words of Imaam Maalik (رحمه االله) are remembered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Nothing will benefit this ummah to come except that which benefited its early generations.”</strong> [105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This refers to the correct creed, methodology and righteous deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another point of benefit is that the Muslim should be aware that the principles of many of these sects are still alive and propagated by certain individuals and/or groups, and accordingly the believer must be cautious. [106]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;"><i>Related Points of Benefit from the Shaykh Uthaymeen&#8217;s Commentary on Imaam ibn Taymeeyah’s Sharhul ’Aqeedatil-Waasitiyyah, Prepared by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh (rahimahullah)</i></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Affirming Five Names of the Names of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i><b>Allaah</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-Hayy</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-Qayyoum</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-’Aliyy</b></i><i>, </i><i><b>al-’Atheem</b></i>. [85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Affirming that Allaah is singled out with all worship (<i>al-uloohiyyah</i>): He is the One Who alone has the right to be worshipped, or that He is the One who is worshipped rightfully and deservingly:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">{<b> لا إلهَ إلاَّ ُ هوَ</b> }<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">None has the right to be worshipped but He [Allaah].</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Refuting the claim of the polytheists who affirm other gods beside Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Affirming the <i>sifah</i> (attribute) of <i>hayaat</i> (Life) for Allaah, and that His life is one of perfection, neither preceded by <i>‘adam</i> nor coming come to naught nor characterized by imperfection. On the contrary, our life originates in <i>‘adam</i> and will come to an end, and it is accompanied by imperfection. If fact, all of our life is imperfect, and that is why Allaah described it by <i>ad-dunya</i>. [86] The Life of Allaah, however, is perfection from all angles because of His saying: {<b><span style="color:#008000;">الْحَيُّ</span></b>}The Living, where the particle <b>ال</b> is for <i>al-istighraaq</i>, which comprises all the meanings of the qualities of the perfect life, as if He says, <b>“There is no one who is truly living except He.”</b> In fact, this is the case because there is none qualified with the life of perfection except Allaah, the Most Mighty and most Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Affirming the <i>al-qayyoumiyyah</i> [87] for Allaah (عزَّوجَلََّّ) because He said: {<b><span style="color:#008000;"> القَيُّوم </span></b>}. Such a description does not apply to the human being. There is not any person who is established on his own nor is there anyone who takes full charge of others by whom they subsist, because there is no human being except that he is in need of others. We need workers, and they need us. We need [our] women and they need us. We need our sons and daughters and they need us. There is no one who is absolutely in full charge (giving them care, maintenance, providing for them, etc.) of others. I may be able to take charge of someone else, but in a limited sense. That is why Allaah تعالى said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> أَفَمَنْ هُوَ قَائِمٌ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ نَفْسٍ بِمَا كَسَبَتْ </b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Is He </b>[Allaah]<b> Who takes charge </b>(guards, maintains, provides, etc.) <b>of every person and knows all that he has earned </b>(like any other deities who know nothing)<b>?</b></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Ar-Ra’d (13:33)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The <i>aayah</i> contains <i>ismullaahi al-aa’tham</i> (Allaah’s Most Greatest Name) affirmed in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> الحيُّ الَقيُّوم</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah, there is no god worthy of worship except He, the one who possesses the perfect living, and Who is established on His Own, Self-subsisting, and by Whom all things subsist.</span></b>[88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These two Names were mentioned in three places in the Qur’aan, in the two soorahs known as <i>az-zahraawayn</i> [89] (AlBaqarah and Aal-’Imran), and in Soorat <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><i>Taha</i></span>.[90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of <i>‘ilm</i> (<i>ahlul-‘ilm</i>) said: The Most Great Name of Allaah is only in these two Names since they comprise the Most Beautiful Names in their entirety, and hence the attribute of Perfection is implied in the Name [ <b><span style="color:#008000;">الحيُّ </span></b>]and the attribute of <i>ihsaan</i> (beauty) is entailed in the Name: [ <b><span style="color:#008000;">الَقيُّوم</span></b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The perfection of Allaah’s Life and qayyoumiyyah such that they are free from the slightest imperfection. The evidence is in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perfection may be generalized considering what is predominant or more numerous although it may be deficient in certain aspects. However, negation of imperfection means that the perfection is absolute and in every respect is free from deficiency. In this sense, the negation occurred in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Affirming <i>as-sifaat as-salbiyyah</i> for Allaah because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> لَا تَأْخُذُهُ سِنَةٌ وَلَا نَوْمٌ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>sifaat as-salbiyyah</i> are those attributes that Allaah has denied for His Self and which imply affirming the perfection of their opposites.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Affirming that Sovereignty of Allaah comprehends everything. The evidence is in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. This Sovereignty is exclusively His. The evidence lies in the same aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">To Him</span></b><b> belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth</b>, in which the predicate (gram. <i>khabar</i>) { <b>له</b> } &#8220;To Him” has preceded the subject (gram. <i>mubtada</i>’) which is the conjunctive noun { ما } &#8220;Whatever”. In this way, there is a grammatical state of <i>hasr </i>(exclusivity, restriction) which signifies that: “<b>To Him (Allaah) </b><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">alone </span></b><b>belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth</b>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Affirming the heavens and the earth, as in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The “<b>heavens</b>” is a number. They are seven in number and similarly is the number of the earths as proven from other texts.[91]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. The Perfection of the Kingship of Allaah, as evident in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Who is he that can intercede with Him except with His Permission?</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Kingship of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) is not the same as His all comprehensive Sovereignty. In fact, power and full kingship are more perfect than just all-comprehensive sovereignty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Affirming the intercession that is approved by Allaah as evident in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[None can intercede] <b>except by Allaah’s Permission</b>, otherwise, the exception would not be correct. Hence, had the approved intercession been not affirmed, the exception would not be correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Affirming the “Permission” which is His Command:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">[None can intercede]<b> except by Allaah’s Permission.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. Affirming the ‘<i>ilm</i> (Knowledge) for Allaah and that His Knowledge comprehends the past, the present, and the future. The evidence is in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> يَعْلَمُ مَا بَيْنَ أَيْدِيهِمْ وَمَا خَلْفَهُمْ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>And Allaah Knows what happens to them</b></span><span style="color:#008000;"> (His creatures)</span><span style="color:#008000;"><b> in the future and what happened to them in the past.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. Refuting the claims of the extremists from the <i>Qadariyyah</i>[92] by affirming Allaah’s all-encompassing Knowledge as in the statement. This constitutes a rebuttal of the extremist from the <i>Qadariyyah</i> who say that Allaah knows the actions of His salves only after they are carried out, denying that Allaah knowledge comprehends everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. The rebuttal of the two sects, the <i>Khawaarij</i> [93] and the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> [94] by affirming the <i>shafaa’ah</i>. Both sects deny the general intercession approved for the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and for others and which applies to the people who committed sin. This negation is based upon their doctrine that the person who commits a major sin and die without repenting from it will be punished in the Fire forever. The two sects differed, however, as to whether such a person is considered a <i>kaafir</i>, or neither a believer nor a <i>kaafir</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <i>Kharijites</i>, courageous against the truth and for it, said, “<i>The one who commits a major sin is kaafir and no longer belongs to the fold of Islam</i>.” The <i>Mu’tazilites</i> were fearful to oppose the people of <i>ahlus-sunnah</i> and the <i>kharijites</i>. They took a cowardly position and said, “<i>We will sit in the middle of the road and say that the one who has committed a grave sin is in a position somewhere between the two; we neither say he is a believer nor a kaafir!</i>” Both sects, however, agreed that in the hereafter he would be in the Fire of Hell forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why they denied the <i>shafaa’ah</i> (intercession). The generality of the aayah refutes the position held by both sects:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>مَن ذَا الَّذِي يَشْفَعُ عِندَهُ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِه</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Who is he that can interceded with Him except with His Permission?</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. None will ever encompass anything of Allaah’s knowledge nor of His Hearing or His Sight:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge except that which He wills.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. We comprehend no knowledge about Allaah or about His creation except that which He wills for us to know.[95]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. Forbidding the <i>takyeef</i> (assigning a manner or a “how”) to the Attributes of Allaah, because He did not inform us of the how they are. So if we claim the knowledge of the <i>kayfiyyah</i> (i.e. the condition or the “how”) of His Attributes, then we are lying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. Rebutting the <i>Mu’attilah</i>, due to His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ </b>]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is evidence against the <i>Mu’attilah</i> because they say, for example, that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) has no real Hand. This necessitates that they encompass the negation of one of His Attributes. In this respect, both sects, the <i>Mu’attilah</i> and the people of <i>takyeef</i> (<i>Mukayyifah</i>) lied because Allaah affirmed this Attribute (i.e. the Hand) to Himself. Accordingly, their claim that the true and real Attributes like the Hand, the Face, the Eyes, and so forth do not befit Allaah is false and void. The basis for this fact is that knowledge is of two kinds: (a) Affirmation, and (b) Negation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you cannot negate anything as being a quality of someone (something) except with knowledge, just like you cannot affirm anything for someone (something) except with knowledge. So if those sects would deny the realities of the aforementioned Attributes of Allaah then they must bring forth their proofs, if they are truthful. For example, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) did not negate that the Attribute of the Hand from His Self, not even in one single aayah in the Qur’aan, nor did the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) negate this Attribute in any hadeeth, nor did the righteous predecessors (<i>as-salaf-us-saalih</i>). Those sects, however, utter the negation of Allaah’s true and real Hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. Rebutting the position of the <i>Mumathilah</i> (those who liken Allaah to His creation). Since the aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِّنْ عِلْمِهِ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>And they will never compass anything of His Knowledge.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">implies a rebuttal of the <i>Mukayyifah</i>, then by all reason it is a rebuttal of the <i>Mumathilah</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. Affirming the <i>mashee’ah</i> (Will) for Allaah because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>إِلَّا بِمَا شَاءَ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">Except that which he Wills.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. Rebutting the <i>Qadariyyah</i> and the <i>Mu’tazilah</i> who say that Allaah, the Most High, does not Will anything as far as man is concerned.[96] This is evident in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يُحِيطُونَ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>And they will never compass&#8230;</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing that man’s compassing of something is from his qualities and his qualities are a creation of Allaah, [and hence man’s will is not independent from the Will of Allaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. The greatness of the <i>kursi</i>, for His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَسِعَ كُرْسِيُّهُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">His </span></b><b><i>kursi</i></b><b> extends over and encompasses the heavens and the earth.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26. The Greatness of the Creator of the <i>kursi</i> because the greatness of the created implies the Greatness of the Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27. The <i>kufr</i> of the person who denies the heavens and the earth because this necessitates accusing Allaah of lying. As far as the earth is concerned, I believe that no one denies it [its existence]. However, as regard to the heavens, there are those who deny them saying that what is above us is boundless and limitless space, and that there is only stars and diffused dust (<i>sadoom</i>) or the like. There is no doubt that the one who holds to this belief is a <i>kaafir</i>, whether he himself believes in this or he imitates those whom he reveres from the people who hold to this belief—while knowing the truth implied from the proofs of the Qur’aan and the sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28. Affirming the Strength of Allaah, and the proof is His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29. Denying the <i>mashaqah</i> (fatigue) from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the <i>sifaat as-salbiyyah</i> just like saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[<b> وَلَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا فِي سِتَّةِ أَيَّامٍ وَمَا مَسَّنَا مِن لُّغُوبٍ </b>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">And indeed We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in six Days and nothing of fatigue touched us.</span></b> [Qur’aan, Soorat Qaaf (50:38)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30. Affirming what is implied by the above statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-size:1rem;">[ <b>وَلَا يَئُودُهُ حِفْظُهُمَا</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them,</span></b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:1rem;">from the attributes of Knowledge, Ability, Life, Mercy, Wisdom, and Strength.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31. Affirming that the heavens and the earth are in need for someone who guards them, as stated in Allaah’s saying (which means): He feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them. Had it not been for the guarding and preserving of Allaah, they would have been ruined. Allaah Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>وَلَوْلَا دَفْعُ اللَّهِ النَّاسَ بَعْضَهُم بِبَعْضٍ لَّهُدِّمَتْ صَوَامِعُ وَبِيَعٌ وَصَلَوَاتٌ وَمَسَاجِدُ يُذْكَرُ فِيهَا اسْمُ اللَّهِ كَثِيرًا</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">Had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and masaajid (mosques), wherein the Name of Allaah is mentioned much would surely have been pulled down.</span></b><b> </b>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Hajj (22:40)].[97]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>وَيُمْسِكُ السَّمَاءَ أَن تَقَعَ عَلَى الْأَرْضِ إِلَّا بِإِذْنِهِ</b><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>He withholds the heavens from falling on the earth except by His Leave.</b></span><br />
[Qur’aan, Sooart Al-Hajj (22:65)].</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>إِنَّ اللَّهَ يُمْسِكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ أَن تَزُولَا ۚ وَلَئِن زَالَتَا إِنْ أَمْسَكَهُمَا مِنْ أَحَدٍ مِّن بَعْدِهِ</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>Verily! Allaah grasps the heavens and the earth lest they move away from their places, and if they were to move away from their places, there is not one that can grasp them after Him.</b></span> [Qur’aan, Sooart Faatir (35:41)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32. Affirming <i>al-’uluw ath-thaati</i> (the Transcendence of Allaah in His Essence) and <i>al-’uluw as-sifaati</i> (the Transcendence of Allaah’s Attributes) because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">And He [Allaah] is the Most High, above everything.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33. Rebutting both the <i>Hulooliyyah</i> [98] and the <i>Mu’atilah</i> who negate this Attribute of Allaah تعالى. The Hulooliyyah say, “<i>Allaah is not above everything but rather He is everywhere</i>.” And the Mu’attilah, the people who deny Allaah’s Attributes, say, “<i>He cannot be described as being High or low, to the left or the right, or as being separated from or associated with His creation</i>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34. Warning against transgression upon others because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>وَهُوَ الْعَلِيُّ الْعَظِيمُ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>And He is the Most High, above everything, and He is the Most Great.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why Allaah (تعالى) said in Soorat An-Nisaa’ [(4:34)]:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>فَإِنْ أَطَعْنَكُمْ فَلَا تَبْغُوا عَلَيْهِنَّ سَبِيلًا ۗ إِنَّ اللَّهَ كَانَ عَلِيًّا كَبِيرًا</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>And if they </b>[women] <b>return to obedience </b>[to their husbands]<b>, then seek not against them means </b>[of annoyance]<b>. Surely, Allaah is ever Most High, above everything, Most Great.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you think proudly of yourself, then remember the Highness of Allaah above everything, the Most Mighty and Majestic. And if you think of yourself as being great, then remember the Greatness of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35. Affirming the Greatness of Allaah because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>الْعَظِيمُ</b> ]<br />
<b><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Great.</span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36. Affirming the Attribute of Perfection that is implied in the combined Attribute of Transcendence and Greatness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37. Knowing that the <i>mulk</i> (Sovereignty) belongs to Allaah then:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must not behave or act in His kingdom except in accordance with that which He is pleased, because of His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَّهُ مَا فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَمَا فِي الْأَرْضِ</b> ]<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><b>To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth.</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The judicial rulings and decreeing amongst the people must be based upon the Judgment of Allaah. Indeed the reliance of man upon the judicial decrees laid by the created and the system of laws laid down by man is one kind of setting up rivals with Allaah (<i>shirk billaah</i>)[99], the Most Mighty and Most Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contentment with the Pre-decree of Allaah, the Most Mighty and Most Majestic, because if you know that the Sovereignty exclusively belongs to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى ) then you would say, “This is the disposal of affairs by a Sovereign in His Kingdom, and He has the right to do whatever He wants.”</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[ <b>لَا يُسْأَلُ عَمَّا يَفْعَلُ وَهُمْ يُسْأَلُونَ</b> ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#008000;">He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they [the creation] will be asked</span></b>. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Anbiyaa’ (21:23)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, this understanding was part of the condolence of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to his daughter [following the death of her child] when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><b>“Whatever Allaah takes belongs to Him, and to Him belongs what He grants, and everything with Him has an appointed fixed term </b>[in this world]<b>.”</b> </span>[100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man should not act conceitedly upon accomplishing something because this accomplishment is from Allaah and the Sovereignty is exclusively His.</p>
<p><b><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes:</span></b></p>
<p>[85]The Shaykh Uthaymeen also stated that he is in doubt whether the word إله is a Name of Allaah because it is an indefinite noun (gram. nakirah).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[91] The Shaykh (رحمه االله) made the above statement in his explanation of Soorat Al-Kahf, in the month of Rabee’ al-Awwal,1419. Evidence from the Qur’aan is in Soorat AtTalaaq (65:12) and from the sunnah as in the agreed upon hadeeth, &#8220;<b><span style="color:#808000;">Whoever usurps the land of somebody unjustly, his neck will be encircled with seven earths [on the Day of Resurrection].</span></b>&#8221; [See Saheeh Al-Bukhaari (Arabic/English)], vol. 3, no. 632.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[92] Those who say that whatever man does it is entirely of his own ability and free will, and that Allaah’s <i>mashee’ah</i> (Will) and <i>qudrah</i> (Ability) have no influence whatsoever on what man does. They also claim that the knowledge of Allaah does not comprehend the actions of the creation until after they are executed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[98] <i>Hulooliyyah</i> [from <i>hulool</i> (lit. “settling,” “alighting,” “lodging,” “descent,” and by extension “incarnation”]. The most common definition is that it refers to the doctrine of Divine incarnation in the human form. In mystic <i>sufism</i>, it refers to the Divine incarnation in the <i>sufi</i> saints.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Taymeeyah classified the <i>Hulooliyyah</i> into two kinds. The first is the <b>specific hulool</b> like the claim of the Christians that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Eesa (alaihissalam) and like that of the extremist <i>raafidah</i> and <i>sufi</i> mystics who claim that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Ali Ibn Abee Taalib (رضي االله عنه) and in special <i>sufi</i> saints, respectively. The second kind is the <b>general hulool</b> and it is the saying that “Allaah, in His Essence, is everywhere.” [See <i>Al-Fataawaa</i>], vol. 2, pp. 171-172.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[99] It could be a major or a minor form of <i>shirk</i> depending upon the motive behind his reliance. <i>Al-Hamdullilaah</i>, the author, Shaykh Muhammad bin ‘Uthaymeen (رحمه االله ) personally affirmed this explanation to me in Jamaada Al-Aakhirah, 1419Hj.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Based upon the work of Shaykh Ibn Al-‘Uthaymeen</strong><br />
<strong>Explained by Dr Saleh As-Saleh, rahimahumaa Allaah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most honorable and greatest knowledge is the knowledge of Allaah, whom there is no God except Him, the true God, the Lord of all that exists. And the knowledge of Allaah is the basis of every other knowledge, for the one who knows of Allaah knows other than Him.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="130" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F338564062&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&visual=false&show_comments=true&color=false&show_user=true&show_reposts=false"></iframe>
<p><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/the-knowledge-of-allaah-is-the-basis-of-every-other-knowledge" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Souncloud Audio Link</a>]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The one who knows of Allaah knows other than Him, and the one who is ignorant of Allaah is therefore by all means ignorant of every other thing.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَلَا تَكُونُوا كَالَّذِينَ نَسُوا اللَّـهَ فَأَنسَاهُمْ أَنفُسَهُمْ ۚ أُولَـٰئِكَ هُمُ الْفَاسِقُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘And be not like those who forgot Allaah, so He made them forget themselves. Those are the defiantly disobedient.’</span> {Suraah Anfaal 8: 47}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And don’t be like those who forgot Allaah- because of their disobedience, so He let them forget their own selves- for they were not able to do righteous deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you contemplate this aaayah, you will find a noble and honourable meaning and a great one implicated in this verse that anyone who forgets Allaah, Allaah will make him forget his own self, and therefore will not realise his reality nor would he realise that which benefits or harms him.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he will be crippled like cattle, even cattle could be more knowledgeable of its benefits in this sense. What is meant is that<strong> the knowledge of Allaah is the basis and foundation of every other knowledge and it is the basis of the slave of Allaah to know of his happiness, and to perfect his affairs and to work for his other life</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore he would properly estimate Allaah, the proper estimation He deserves. And it will lead him to be shy of Allaah, out of love and magnification- his heart being attached to Him, yearning to meet Allaah and be close to Him, turning His affairs to Him and having awe and fear of Him. And mankind, with this respect, differ in such an estimation of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet  said in invocation to Allaah,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8230;لا أحصي ثناء عليك أنت كما أثنيت على نفسك</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">[صحيح مسلم و غيره]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘I cannot enumerate praising You, as You (o Allaah) are as You have praised Yourself’</span> [Muslim and others]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The prophet  indicating those most knowledgeable of Allaah, even invoke Allaah with this saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;لا أحصي ثناء عليك أنت كما أثنيت على نفسك</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘I cannot enumerate praising You, as You are as You have praised Yourself (O Allaah)’</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Love and eagerness</strong> are matters that follow the knowledge of Allaah, so the knowledge of Allaah brings forth and leads to love of Him and yearning to meet Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And therefor the knowledge of Allaah, is the most great and honorable knowledge and this leads to the proper estimation of Allaah, loving Him and eagerness to meet Him. The more a person is knowledgeable of Allaah, the more perfection he is in his love of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ad therefore ‘<strong>whoever believes in Allaah and His names and attributes</strong>’ and knows of Him in this respect will love Him more, and then he would achieve a state of sweetness in his heart, and this sweetness puts him in a state whereby he will always love to meet Allaah and be close to Him, and to sense and look at His Face, and listen to Him and to His words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The knowledge itself leads to the proper estimation of Allaah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Maalik ibn Dinaar rahimahullaah said ‘<span style="color:#993300;">the people of this life they left it and didn’t take the best of it</span>,’ they said to him, ‘and what is it o Abaa Yahya?’ He said, ‘knowing  of Allaah The Most Mighty and Majestic.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who know of Allaah are the ones who have really tasted what is best in this life, and that is the knowledge of Allaah in this life as Maalik bin Dinaar stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَا قَدَرُوا اللَّـهَ حَقَّ قَدْرِهِ إِذْ قَالُوا مَا أَنزَلَ اللَّـهُ عَلَىٰ بَشَرٍ مِّن شَيْءٍ ۗ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">‘And they did not appraise Allaah with true appraisal when they said, &#8220;Allaah did not reveal to a human being anything.&#8221;’</span> {Suraah Al-An’aam 6: 91}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘They (kuffar) did not estimate Allaah with the estimation due to Him’ when they said that Allaah sent nothing down to the human being- so what is meant by saying what is due to Him is what is meant by the proper estimation of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When the knowledge of Allaah is strengthened then his eagerness for Allaah also strengthens.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah ibn Masoud radhi Allaahu anhu said, ‘the believer will not feel at rest without the meeting of his Lord Allaah, therefore anyone who sets his resting coat in this life in the meeting of Allaahسبحانه و تعلى, then it is as if He has reached that.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning the believer would not have any real rest without being keen about the matter of meeting Allaah, yearning so that he can reach Him. As Allaah سبحانه و تعلى says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَتَطْمَئِنُّ قُلُوبُهُم بِذِكْرِ اللَّـهِ ۗ أَلَا بِذِكْرِ اللَّـهِ تَطْمَئِنُّ الْقُلُوبُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allaah. Unquestionably, by the remembrance of Allaah hearts are assured.&#8221;</span> {Suraah Ar-Ra’ad 13: 28}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what ibn Masoud was speaking about in his saying that there will be no real rest for the believer unless he meets Allaahسبحانه و تعلى; therefore this matter should be alive, as mentioned in the aayah in Suraatur Ra’ad, they will achieve that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah gave the prophets عليهم السلام the choice between increasing their stay on earth or death, and they would choose the meeting with Allaah the most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As Imaam Bukhaari entitled the chapter in his saheeh &#8211; &#8220;the one who loves to meet Allaah, Allaah will love to meet Him&#8221;. Under this chapter he gave the situation with the prophet  from his wife,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">حدثنا بشر بن محمد حدثنا عبد الله قال يونس قال الزهري أخبرني سعيد بن المسيب في رجال من أهل العلم أن عائشة قالت كان النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم يقول وهو صحيح إنه لم يقبض نبي حتى يرى مقعده من الجنة ثم يخير فلما نزل به ورأسه على فخذي غشي عليه ثم أفاق فأشخص بصره إلى سقف البيت ثم قال اللهم الرفيق الأعلى فقلت إذا لا يختارنا وعرفت أنه الحديث الذي كان يحدثنا وهو صحيح قالت فكانت آخر كلمة تكلم بها اللهم الرفيق الأعلى</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">موطأ مالك, صحيح البخاري, صحيح مسلم, مسند أحمد</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Aisha (رضي الله عنها) who said, ‘Rasoolullah صلى الله عليه وسلم used to say, ‘no prophets soul will be taken by Allaah until he sees his seat in Paradise then he will be given the choice’ so when he صلى الله عليه وسلم  became ill and the moment of death approached and his head was on my thigh, when he صلى الله عليه وسلم used to go into the state of unconsciousness and woke up, finally I saw him gaze in the direction of the roof and said ‘O Allaah, the Highest companionship.’ Aisha said, ‘so I knew he didn’t choose us, and I remember the statement he  صلى الله عليه وسلم used to say to us and it is true. And the last words he spoke was ‘Allaahumma rafeequl a’laa.’ (O Allaah, the Highest companionship)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muwatta of Maalik, Bukhaari, Muslim and Ahmed (with slight difference in wording)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how is it that these rough hearts and stone hearts are able to accuse other Muslims when they speak about knowing Allaah’s names and attributes and defending them in the proper way, as Allaah intended and as Allaah affirmed for Himself, and by the prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person shows off in his worship, then this falls under four categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. If showing off is the driving force behind doing the act of worship, then the worship is invalid. It is reported in the hadeeth qudsi that Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I am the One, One Who does not stand in need of a partner. If anyone does anything in which he associates anyone else with Me, I shall abandon him with one whom he associates with Allaah.”</span></strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. If a person begins his worship sincerely and showing off occurs later at which point he tries to stop showing off, then his worship is valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Otherwise, if he continues and does not attempt to ward it off, inclining towards it, then one examines whether the latter part of this worship depends on its earlier part or vice verse. For example, with salaah and wudhu, these worships would become invalid in this case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if the worship is distinguished such that the parts are independent, then whatever occurred before showing off is valid, and whatever occurred after the person began to show off is invalid. For instance, a person gives $50 in charity sincerely. Later, he gives $500 to show off. His first donation is valid while the $500 are invalid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. If a person begins to show off after concluding the worship, then the worship is valid. However, this nullifies the reward for the worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe! Do not render in vain your Sadaqah (charity) by reminders of your generosity or by injury, like him who spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he does not believe in Allaah, nor in the Last Day. His likeness is the likeness of a smooth rock on which is a little dust; on it falls heavy rain which leaves it bare. They are not able to do anything with what they have earned. And Allaah does not guide the disbelieving people.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surah al-Baqarah (2:264)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The showing off is in the descriptive manner of the worship, not its origin. As such, the person initiates the action for the sake of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) but shows off in its description.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, someone begins his salaah sincerely, but he hears someone come, at which point he begins to perfect his salaah more than normal. In this situation, all of that which he added to the sincere part of the salaah will have no reward.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Hamdulillaah</em> (all praise is due to Allaah), the Most High, the One who said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُم بِشَيْءٍ مِّنَ الْخَوْفِ وَالْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَنفُسِ وَالثَّمَرَاتِ ۗ وَبَشِّرِ الصَّابِرِينَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to the patient ones. Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly! To Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221; They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided-ones.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surah al-Baqarah (2:155-157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May the <em>salaah</em> and <em>salaam</em> of Allaah be upon His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم : <em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>), the one who was tried and tested in various ways and who was patient and persevered. And may Allaah’s (سبحانه و تعالى : <em>subhannahu wa ta’ala</em>) <em>salaah</em> and <em>salaam</em> be upon his household, the noble companions who also were also tested and tried, as well as upon the righteous predecessors and those who follow them in righteousness until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Nature of Tests and Trials</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear that this life is filled with calamities, tests, and trials and that every believer will be subjected to many of these. Sometimes these trials are within himself, sometimes with his wealth and sometimes with his loved ones. These preordained trials and calamities, from the One who is All-Wise, will touch the believer in various ways and manners; if the believer does not have the correct view regarding the matter of testing, then he may err seriously, especially since some of the calamities are painful and profound.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many people are negligent about the wisdoms behind trials and testing; they may not understand that Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) does not test us as a punishment, but rather as a mercy. The believer should look at the matter of <em>ibtilaa</em>’ (testing and trials) through the textual proofs in the Qur’aan and authentic Sunnah of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) so that he can stand on a firm ground regarding these matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yes, life is a test and a trial; we are tested everyday in this life. Our wealth is a test; the spouse is a test; the children are tests; poverty and wealth are tests, and likewise health and illnesses are tests. We are tested in everything we possess and in that which we encounter in this life until we meet Allaah, the Most High.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَائِقَةُ الْمَوْتِ ۗ وَنَبْلُوكُم بِالشَّرِّ وَالْخَيْرِ فِتْنَةً ۖ وَإِلَيْنَا تُرْجَعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Everyone is going to taste death, and We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good, and to Us you will be returned.</span></em> &#8211; Surah al-Anbiyaa’ (21:35)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) stated (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَحَسِبَ النَّاسُ أَن يُتْرَكُوا أَن يَقُولُوا آمَنَّا وَهُمْ لَا يُفْتَنُونَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ فَتَنَّا الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِهِمْ ۖ فَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ اللَّهُ الَّذِينَ صَدَقُوا وَلَيَعْلَمَنَّ الْكَاذِبِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: &#8220;We believe,&#8221; and will not be tested. And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allaah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allaah knows all that before putting them to test).</span></em> &#8211; Surah al-‘Ankabut (29:2-3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even the one who is healthy is tested, and also, the one who is ill is tested. The one who is healthy may not know this until he is touched by a trial, and the one who is ill will may not feel that he is in a testing situation until he is cured. No one is safe from trials because of their prestige or status; such things do not safeguard us from the tests as proven by the <em>hasan</em> (good) <em>hadith</em> in which the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The people who receive the severest trial are the Prophets, then those most like them and then those most like them.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by at-Tirmidhi, hadith no. 2400 and ibn Maajah, hadith no. 4023; at-Tirmidhi said &#8220;hasan-saheeh; authenticated by Ibn al-Qayyim (Tareequl Hijratayen, p. 226), Ahmad Shaakir (Musnad Ahmad 3/52), and al-Albaani (see as-Silsilah as-Saheehah, p.19).]</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Response of the Believer to Tests and Trials</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst us, there is no one who possesses the ability to reject the tests, but there are those who are tested and succeed through good faith in Allaah, patient persevering, and by anticipating Allaah&#8217;s reward. Also, amongst us are those who are tested but fail because of weak faith and objection to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى); we seek refuge in Allaah from that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Fudayl ibn ‘Iyaad (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“As long as people are in a state of good welfare, then once they are tested, they will return to their reality. The believer will go to his faith, and the hypocrite will go to his hypocrisy.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) preordained everything for us including our sustenance and our lifespan. He (سبحانه و تعالى) said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">نَحْنُ قَسَمْنَا بَيْنَهُم مَّعِيشَتَهُمْ فِي الْحَيَاةِ الدُّنْيَا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;It is We Who portion out between them their livelihood in this world&#8221;</em> </span><br />
[Surah az-Zukhruf (43:32)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sustenance and livelihood are preordained in certain measures; illness is preordained, and one’s welfare is preordained; everything in this life is preordained. The person should accept what Allaah has preordained for him and should not hate, dislike, or show discomfort towards these preordainments. Since this is the nature of the matter, one should submit his entire affair to Allaah and know that whatever befalls him will not miss him and whatever misses him will not befall him. It is as if the one who prefers this life to be monotonic wants the predecree of Allaah to be in accordance with his desires, and this is wishful thinking. Irrespective of the preordinance or test, it is a matter that is good for the believer; however, this is with the condition that one gives thanks for Allaah’s favor and is patient, as in the authentic hadith of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Amazing is the matter of the believers, his affair to him is all good, and this is for none except for the believer, if he is touched by something good and then he thanks, then this is good for him. And if he is touched by a calamity or hardship, then he is patient and this is good for him.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Muslim, hadith no. 2999]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High, stated (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِن كَرِهْتُمُوهُنَّ فَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَيَجْعَلَ اللَّهُ فِيهِ خَيْرًا كَثِيرًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;It may be that you dislike a thing and Allaah brings through it a great deal of good.&#8221;</span> </em>&#8211; Surah an-Nisa (4:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعَسَىٰ أَن تَكْرَهُوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ ۖ وَعَسَىٰ أَن تُحِبُّوا شَيْئًا وَهُوَ شَرٌّ لَّكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And it may be that you dislike a thing which is good for you and that you like a thing which is bad for you. Allaah knows but you do not know.</em></span> &#8211; Surah al-Baqarah (2:216)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone should know that the One who tests us is also the One who bestows favors upon us. Furthermore, we should know that not everything we dislike is to be disliked in reality and that not everything that we desire is really beneficial for us; Allaah knows and you do not know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Salaf (<em>rahimahumullaah</em>) said that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If you were afflicted by a calamity, and you were patient, then your calamity is one; however, if you were impatient, then your calamity is double because of the loss of the reward as well as the beloved one, the Hereafter (i.e. Paradise). </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This saying was in relation to what Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) mentioned in Surah al-Hajj (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمِنَ النَّاسِ مَن يَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ عَلَىٰ حَرْفٍ ۖ فَإِنْ أَصَابَهُ خَيْرٌ اطْمَأَنَّ بِهِ ۖ وَإِنْ أَصَابَتْهُ فِتْنَةٌ انقَلَبَ عَلَىٰ وَجْهِهِ خَسِرَ الدُّنْيَا وَالْآخِرَةَ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ هُوَ الْخُسْرَانُ الْمُبِينُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And among mankind is he who worships Allaah as it were, upon the very edge (i.e. in doubt); if good befalls him, he is content therewith; but if a trial befalls him, he turns back on his face. He loses both this world and the Hereafter. That is the evident loss.&#8221;</span></em> &#8211; Surah al-Hajj (22:11)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Rewards Associated with Tests and Trials</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, testing is a station for a while, which will erase the sins. The sins will be removed as the leaves of a tree fall down, as in the ahaadeeth of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri and Abu Hurairah (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhumaa) from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“No fatigue, nor disease, nor sorrow, nor sadness, nor hurt, nor distress befalls a Muslim even if it were the prick he receives from a thorn but that Allaah expiates some of his sins for that.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by al-Bukhaari, hadith no. 5641 &amp; 5642 respectively]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu) also narrated that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“If Allaah wants to do good for somebody, He afflicts him with trials.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by al-Bukhaari, hadith no. 5645]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Umar (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu) narrated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I visited the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) during his ailments, and he was suffering from a high fever. I said, ‘You have a high fever. Is it because you will have a double reward for it?’ He said, ‘Yes, for no Muslim is afflicted with any harm but that Allaah will remove his sins as the leaves of a tree fall down.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by al-Bukhaari, hadith no. 5647]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reward is affirmed regarding every kind of harm or hurt, tangible or intangible, if the believer is patiently persevering and anticipates the reward. It was reported by Anas ibn Maalik (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu) that he heard the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Allaah said, ‘If I deprive my slave of his two beloved things (i.e. his eyes) and he remains patient, I will let him enter Paradise in compensation for them.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by al-Bukhaari, hadith no. 5653]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tests and trials remove sins from the believers of the children of Adam, and all of the children of Adam commit sins. The tests and trials can also raise one to a higher degree in Paradise. It is reported that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says to His angels when they take the soul of a person’s child, ‘You took the fruit of his heart.’ They (the angels) say, ‘Yes.’ So Allaah says, ‘What did My slave say (upon that)?’ They say, ‘He praised you and made <em>istirjaa</em>’ (meaning he said, <em>Innaa lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon</em>’ &#8211; verily to Allaah we belong and to Him we shall return). So Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says, ‘Build for My slave a house in Paradise and name it the house of praise.’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Imaam Ahmad in his musnad and graded hasan (good) by Shaykh al-Albaani].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said in the authentic hadith:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“No Muslim is hurt by a thorn or something greater than a thorn except that Allaah elevates him in rank or effaces his sins because of that.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Muslim, hadith no. 6238]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer’s degree will be raised until he reaches his final degree in Paradise; this will be due to his patience and more importantly because of the favor of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى). Allaah, the Most High, said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّمَا يُوَفَّى الصَّابِرُونَ أَجْرَهُم بِغَيْرِ حِسَابٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Only those who are patient shall receive their rewards in full, without reckoning.&#8221;</span> </em>&#8211; Surah az-Zumar (39:10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Calamities, trials, and tests are signs of Allaah’s love for the believer. Indeed, they are like a cure; although it may be bitter, we accept them since they are from the One whom we love, and to Allaah belongs the best example. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The greatest reward comes with the greatest trial. When Allaah loves a people, He tests them. Whoever accepts that wins His pleasure, but whoever is discontent with that earns His wrath.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by at-Tirmidhi (2396) and ibn Maajah (4031). Shaykh al-Albaani (rahimahullaah) considered it hasan]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The <em>ibtilaa</em>’ (testing) of the believer is like medicine for him. It extracts from him the illnesses which if they had remained, would destroy him or diminish his reward and level. The tests and the trials extract these illnesses from him and prepare him for the perfect reward and the highness of degree.”</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Ighaathatul Lahfan, p. 286]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, the affliction by test and trials is better to the believer than punishment in the Hereafter, and in that, there is an elevation of his rank and expiation for his sins. Therefore, it is better for him. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“When Allaah wills good for His slave, He hastens the punishment for him in this world, and when Allaah wills ill for His slave, he withholds the punishment for his sins from him until he comes with all his sins on the Day of Resurrection.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by at-Tirmidhi (2396) and Shaykh al-Albaani (rahimahullaah) classified it as saheeh (authentic) in Saheeh at-Tirmidhi]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahlul-‘Ilm (the people of knowledge) made it clear that this hadith refers to the hypocrites; Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) withholds the punishment from them in this life in order to give them their full account on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Lessons of the Tests and Trials</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the test and trials, there are lessons.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The first lesson</strong> is that tests and trials are beneficial to the believer’s tawheed (worship of Allaah), imaan (Faith), and tawakkul (reliance upon Allaah). They force mankind to examine the reality that they are in fact a weak creation who has no power or strength, except in their Lord, Allaah. As such, we should resort to Him and depend upon Him, at which point arrogance, false pride, puffing, and negligence will be removed. We will come to know that we are really poor and in need of our Creator, the Almighty, the Most Perfect, so that we resort to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The second lesson</strong> is that the tests unravel the reality of this life. They show that this life is a temporal stay for amusement, and the perfect life is the one after that, where there is no toil, worry, fatigue, or disease. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) stated (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا هَٰذِهِ الْحَيَاةُ الدُّنْيَا إِلَّا لَهْوٌ وَلَعِبٌ ۚ وَإِنَّ الدَّارَ الْآخِرَةَ لَهِيَ الْحَيَوَانُ ۚ لَوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And this life of the world is only amusement and play! Verily, the home of the Hereafter, that is the life indeed (i.e. the eternal life that will never end), if they but knew&#8221;</span></em> &#8211; Surah al-‘Ankabut (29:64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even with amusement and play, there is also toil and fatigue. This is the reality of this life; one day it smiles at you, and the next day it turns its back to you. This is its nature, but man forgets that. Therefore, the trials and tests come, and they make the person understand the nature of this life and that he should not attach himself to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third lesson</strong> is that the test and trials remind the person of Allaah’s favor upon him and how this is only a transitional existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fourth lesson</strong> is that they remind us that we should not be in such a state of joy that we feel arrogant. Likewise, we should not be in such a state of sadness and grief that one feels despair. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) affirmed (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَا أَصَابَ مِن مُّصِيبَةٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا فِي أَنفُسِكُمْ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مِّن قَبْلِ أَن نَّبْرَأَهَا ۚ إِنَّ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى اللَّهِ يَسِيرٌ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">لِّكَيْلَا تَأْسَوْا عَلَىٰ مَا فَاتَكُمْ وَلَا تَفْرَحُوا بِمَا آتَاكُمْ ۗ وَاللَّهُ لَا يُحِبُّ كُلَّ مُخْتَالٍ فَخُورٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (al-Lauh al-Mahfuz), before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allaah. In order that you may not be sad over matters that you fail to get, nor rejoice because of that which has been given to you. And Allaah likes not prideful boasters.</span></em> &#8211; Surah al-Hadid (57:22-23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The fifth lesson</strong> is that trials and tests remind the person of his shortcomings and defects so that he can repent from them. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) stated (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَّا أَصَابَكَ مِنْ حَسَنَةٍ فَمِنَ اللَّهِ ۖ وَمَا أَصَابَكَ مِن سَيِّئَةٍ فَمِن نَّفْسِكَ ۚ وَأَرْسَلْنَاكَ لِلنَّاسِ رَسُولًا ۚ وَكَفَىٰ بِاللَّهِ شَهِيدًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Whatever of good reaches you, is from Allaah, but whatever of evil befalls you, is from yourself. And We have sent you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as a Messenger to mankind, and Allaah is Sufficient as a Witness</span></em>. &#8211; Surah an-Nisa (4:79)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, He (سبحانه و تعالى) said (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا أَصَابَكُم مِّن مُّصِيبَةٍ فَبِمَا كَسَبَتْ أَيْدِيكُمْ وَيَعْفُو عَن كَثِيرٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And whatever of misfortune befalls you, it is because of what your hands have earned. And He pardons much</em></span>. &#8211; Surah ash-Shura (42:30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, there is still chance for repentance before the greater torment may occur. In addition, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) affirmed (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَنُذِيقَنَّهُم مِّنَ الْعَذَابِ الْأَدْنَىٰ دُونَ الْعَذَابِ الْأَكْبَرِ لَعَلَّهُمْ يَرْجِعُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And verily, We will make them taste of the near torment (i.e. the torment in the life of this world, i.e. disasters, calamities, etc.) prior to the supreme torment (in the Hereafter), in order that they may (repent and) return (i.e. accept Islam).</em> </span>&#8211; Surah as-Sajdah (32:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lesser torment in this life is calamities, disasters, and hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The sixth lesson</strong> is that test and trials are a great teaching process whereby the person learns to become patient. We cannot stand on the truth and obedience, except with patience, and we cannot stay away from falsehood, except with patient perseverance regarding disobedience; we cannot walk the paths of this life, except with patience regarding the preordinances of Allaah. The outcome is jannat al-khuld war-ridwan (endless bliss in Paradise and the pleasure of Allaah). Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) mentioned (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلَّا الَّذِينَ صَبَرُوا وَمَا يُلَقَّاهَا إِلَّا ذُو حَظٍّ عَظِيمٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>But none is granted it (the above quality) except those who are patient, and none is granted it except the owner of the great portion (of the happiness in the Hereafter i.e. Paradise and in this world of a high moral character)</em></span>. Surah al-Fussilat (41:35)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, if a calamity befalls us and we pass it, then we have learned the lessons. The Salaf (rahimahumullaah) more appropriately dealt with tests and trials than us. They left magnificent examples of patience in anticipation of reward. It is reported that ‘Umar (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu) used to praise Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) for the test and trials. When he was asked about it, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I was never touched by a test, except that Allaah bestowed four favors upon me; they (the favors) were that the test was not one in my deen (religion), was not greater than me, was not greater than what befell me, and I was not deprived of contentment and patience, and I hoped for the reward of Allaah for it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, we should not forget that in the test there is a reward, and it cannot be attained except with patience and that patience cannot be attained except with a strong will and faith. We should not forget to remember Allaah, being thankful for His favors and be patient with His tests and trials. Let this be a sincere and hidden matter between us and our Rubb (Lord) because He knows and He sees; He is more Merciful to us than ourselves and of all of mankind, so we should turn our affairs to Him. As the poet said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“If you complain to the son of Adam, it is like you are complaining to the one who has no mercy towards you.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should not forget that if we are touched by a calamity, then we should praise Allaah and be thankful that He did not touch us with something more intense and far greater. Whatever befalls us is not going to miss us, and whatever has missed us is not going to befall us. The magnitude of reward is proportionate to the magnitude of testing and to Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) is that which He gives and to Him is that which He takes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Leave complaints and discontentment because it will not help, rather it will magnify our calamity and causes us to miss the reward and subject us to being held sinful. Let each of us remember that no matter the magnitude of the calamity that may befall us, it will not reach the level of the calamity which touched the entire Ummah because of the loss of its beloved one, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), who reminded of this when he stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“If any one of you is touched by a calamity, let him remember the calamity that befell him concerning me because it is of the greatest calamities.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by al-Bayhaqi and authenticated by Shaykh al-Albaani (rahimahullaah)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we are touched by a calamity, we should not forget to say “Innaa lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon. Allahumma aajirnee fee museebatee wakhluf lee khairan minha”(1)(Verily, to Allah we belong, and truly to Him we shall return, reward me for my affliction and give me something better than it in exchange for it&#8221;). The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;Allah will give him something better than it in exchange.&#8221;[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[1] Part of a hadith reported in Saheeh Muslim (English Translation No.1999; Chap 174)..</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should not despair regarding the Mercy of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) no matter how the calamity may befall us or how intense it may be, because Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) affirmed (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>So verily, with the hardship, there is relief. Verily, with the hardship, there is relief (i.e. there is one hardship with two reliefs, so one hardship cannot overcome two reliefs).</em></span> &#8211; Surah ash-Sharh (94:5-6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As ‘Umar (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu) stated, one hardship cannot beat two reliefs. We should not forget the favor of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) if He restores your welfare and soundness, lest we should become like those Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) mentioned in Surah az-Zumar (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذَا مَسَّ الْإِنسَانَ ضُرٌّ دَعَا رَبَّهُ مُنِيبًا إِلَيْهِ ثُمَّ إِذَا خَوَّلَهُ نِعْمَةً مِّنْهُ نَسِيَ مَا كَانَ يَدْعُو إِلَيْهِ مِن قَبْلُ وَجَعَلَ لِلَّهِ أَندَادًا لِّيُضِلَّ عَن سَبِيلِهِ ۚ قُلْ تَمَتَّعْ بِكُفْرِكَ قَلِيلًا ۖ إِنَّكَ مِنْ أَصْحَابِ النَّارِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And when some hurt touches man, he cries to his Lord (Allaah Alone), turning to Him in repentance, but when He bestows a favor upon him from Himself, he forgets that for which he cried for before, and he sets up rivals to Allaah, in order to mislead others from His Path. Say: &#8220;Take pleasure in your disbelief for a while: surely, you are (one) of the dwellers of the Fire!”</span></em> &#8211; Surah az-Zumar (39:8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We should not forget that tests, calamities and trials remind us of an hour that is surely coming; a time that will end. This life is not an endless abode. Therefore, we must work for the Hereafter. At the end, the reminder and the glad tidings lie in the same verse we began with (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَنَبْلُوَنَّكُم بِشَيْءٍ مِّنَ الْخَوْفِ وَالْجُوعِ وَنَقْصٍ مِّنَ الْأَمْوَالِ وَالْأَنفُسِ وَالثَّمَرَاتِ ۗ وَبَشِّرِ الصَّابِرِينَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الَّذِينَ إِذَا أَصَابَتْهُم مُّصِيبَةٌ قَالُوا إِنَّا لِلَّهِ وَإِنَّا إِلَيْهِ رَاجِعُونَ</span></h3>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أُولَٰئِكَ عَلَيْهِمْ صَلَوَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِمْ وَرَحْمَةٌ ۖ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُهْتَدُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And certainly, We shall test you with something of fear, hunger, loss of wealth, lives and fruits, but give glad tidings to the patient ones. Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: </span></em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Truly! To Allaah we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221; They are those on whom are the Salawat (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided-ones.</span> &#8211; Surah al-Baqarah (2:155-157)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn al-Qayyim (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;This statement is of the most effective and beneficial cure for the afflicted person in his sooner or later life since it comprises two great foundations such that if the slave comes to know them then he will be comforted in his affliction:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>One is that the slave and his wealth and family truly belong to Allaah, most Mighty and Majestic. Allaah made them as a loan. So if He takes them from him then it is like the lender taking his possession from the borrower (and to Allaah belongs the Best Example).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The second is that the slave will return to Allaah, his true Master, and it is inevitable that he will leave this worldly life behind him and comes unto Allaah alone (without wealth, companions, or anything else) as Allaah created him the first time [see verse 6:94]. He will come only with his deeds, the good and the bad. So if this is the beginning and end of the slave, then how could he be pleased for the existence of someone or grieved for a missed one? So his contemplation of his beginning and end is from the greatest cures of this illness.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) to make us from those who when afflicted with a calamity, truly remember and manifest the saying of Allaah, “<em><strong>Innaa lillaahi wa inna ilayhi raaji’oon</strong></em>,” asking Him to help us with the calamities, testing, and trials, to persevere patiently, to overcome, to ask Him for reward, to anticipate the reward from Him (سبحانه و تعالى), and to compensate us with that which is better.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Interview with Umm ‘Abdullaah Wife of Shaykh Muhammad ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Interview conducted by Sis. Maha bint Husein Ash-Shammari &amp; Published in &#8220;Al-Mutamayyizah&#8221; Magazine; Issue No. 45, Ramadhan, 1427. Confirmed &amp; Presented in English by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh. Transcribed from the audio presentation by Br. Abu Abdullah Al-Amreeki, Reviewed and finalized by Dr. Saleh As-Saleh January 7, 2007</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is an interview with Umm ‘Abdullaah, the wife of our Shaykh, Muhammad ibn Saleh al-‘Uthaimeen (رحمه الله : rahimahullaah). The interview was conducted by Sis. Maha bint Husein Ash-Shammari &amp; Published in &#8220;AlMutamayyizah Magazine,&#8221; Riyadh, KSA; Issue No. 45, Ramadhan, 1427.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 1: Was there any change in the motivation of the Shaykh regarding ‘ilm (knowledge), dawah, and worship between his youth and his elder years?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I did not find any diminishing or weakness in his motivation (رحمه الله ) in knowledge, dawah, and worship despite his progress in age. On the contrary, his busy schedule continued to increase with time, as was the case with his worship and call to the extent that during his intense illness, he (رحمه الله ) was not negligent with one moment; he would spend every second in remembrance of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى), worshipping Him, teaching, or directing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 2: What did you see that was amazing in the Shaykh’s (رحمه الله ) life?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: His life was an example to follow, especially his patience and motivation to seek the knowledge as well as teach and dissipate it. Also, his piety (رحمه الله ) was something that those who were not close to him may not have known about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 3: How did the Shaykh interact with his children in their private lives?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>s: His dealings with his sons and daughters fell into two stages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First, in their childhood, he (رحمه الله ) was keen to be close to them, take care of them, raise some of the Islamic principles in them, and follow their educational achievements. In addition, he made sure to direct, admonish, and incite them. For instance, he would sometimes take the children with him to the masjid to perform some of the fard prayers. Also, he would encourage them to fast some of the days of Ramadan. Furthermore, he would incite them to memorize some of the short surahs of the Qur’aan and reward them on that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the stage of youth and maturity, he (رحمه الله ) was firm concerning their fulfilling of the religious obligations and in discipline in cases of negligence. He would couple that with direction and leniency. At certain times, he was not hesitant to do what was sufficient to change or correct their mistakes. In addition, he (رحمه الله ) used to put full trust in them to do certain things so they could learn to depend upon themselves; he used to continuously encourage them on righteousness and check on them regarding that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 4: Why did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) not use henna on his beard?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Maybe he did not have the time to do that. I think I heard him saying something to this effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 5: When did the Shaykh anger intensify, and how did he deal with your anger?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: His anger used to intensify if the inviolable matters of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) were violated. Regarding my anger with the children, he would try to calm me down first and then give the admonition to the one that was mistaken. In general, he (رحمه الله ) was quiet and did not anger quickly; when he (رحمه الله ) did, his anger would quickly dissipate, and this is from the favors of Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) upon him, something which I wished for the like of his condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 6: How did he (رحمه الله ) get up from his sleep? Did he depend on an alarm clock, or would he ask someone to wake him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He used to depend upon Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى), then the alarm clock and then us. Usually he awoke before the alarm and before I would go to wake him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 7: Would the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) ever go outside with his family for a picnic?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, the family used to have a weekly picnic on Fridays after salaat aljumu’ah; we would go to an area in the wilderness close by and bring our lunch. He utilized this time to share in some activities with the children, like foot racing and solving puzzles. Also, he would bring a small rifle and compete with his children in aiming and shooting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 8: How did the Shaykh fast during the year?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) consistently fasted three days each month throughout his life. In addition, he would fast six days in Shawwal, the ten days of Dhul-Hijjah, and the day of ‘Aashooraa’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 9: How did the Shaykh select the names of his children?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He used to choose names like ‘Abdullaah and ‘Abd ar-Rahman [1]; he left the rest for consultation amongst us. We would pick a name and present it to him; he would either agree or ask us to select another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 10: What were some of the things that would please the Shaykh (رحمه الله )?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: There is no doubt that the Shaykh’s (رحمه الله ) happiness used to increase whenever he saw the strength of Islam and Muslims. Regarding happiness at home, it was manifested in meetings with his family and children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You would also see the signs of pleasure and happiness on him upon receiving his grandchildren. He used to open his cloak to allow them to enter underneath and then inquire about them a few times before reopening it; he would do this several times. Later, he would take them to his library where he kept a special kind of sweets they used to call “halawat abooye” (my father’s sweets). We were keen to ensure that they would not find it, except with him. In addition, despite his busy schedule, he made sure to visit his grandchildren at their homes or in the hospital if any of them were ill; this would have a great influence on them and their patents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 11: How many children did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) have?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh had five sons and three daughters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 12: Who amongst his children was the closest to his heart?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh used to deal justly with his children in all affairs, major and minor. If he found any kind of distinction between them, he would never declare it openly because this is not from justice. If he was keen to be just in matters lighter than this, then what should we expect here?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 13: Who amongst his children was most affected by his death?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: All of them were, and the reality of the matter is that I used to feel that we were not alone in this as he was a father to Muslims around the world, who all felt a great shock by his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 14: Who is his youngest child?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The youngest is a daughter who is 21 years old.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 15: What were the steps the Shaykh took in seeking knowledge, and what was your role in that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) began teaching in the Grand Mosque in Unayzah following the death of his Shaykh, ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Naasir as-Saa’di (رحمه الله ) even before I married him. At that time, he used to consider himself a student of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning my assistance, it was manifested in not distracting him from seeking knowledge and propagating it. I used to serve and make available to him what would support his efforts. I would also follow the children and take care of them, except in matters that required his notification so that he could direct, admonish, and seek a solution.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 16: How did he reconcile between the dawah, which took most of his time, and his familial and social responsibilities?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He used to organize his time and gave this great attention. For instance, he would dedicate time for teaching, fatawa, dawah, worship, the family, the children, social responsibilities, and upholding the ties of kinship. If he, at certain times, was unable to directly share in some of these responsibilities, he was still keen to share even by phone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 17: What was his policy regarding educating and directing his children?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: His policy was education; however, he did not force his children to seek a specialty but instead used to consult with them regarding this decision. The obvious proof is that his children graduated from different types of colleges, some sharee’, others military, and also educational.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 18: Taking into consideration the Shaykh’s work and commitments, this inevitably led to him being away from home and the family. What was your role regarding this matter, and how did you cover for his absence (رحمه الله )?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Even if he was away from home whether for teaching and propagating inside Unayzah or while traveling, he used to follow up with his children through phone calls and by checking on their affairs upon his return. My role is not even worth mentioning because we always felt his presence with us. In general, I used to make the children feel their father’s responsibilities were great and his works many. As such, I would incite them to be patient on that, and he (رحمه الله ) used to compensate them on his return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 19: Could you tell us about his worship at home?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He was keen to perform the as-sunan ar-rawatib (regular sunnah prayers), except in limited circumstances. He (رحمه الله ) used to wake up in the latter part of the night as much as possible and then make the witr before fajr, in addition to the remembrances and istighfar that he did not discontinue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 20: What was his daily program? For example, when did he sleep and wake, and when did he eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh used to get up in the last third of the night, praying as much as Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) wished and then make the witr before the adhan of fajr. Following the adhan, he would pray the regular sunnah of fajr. Next, he would wake his family before going to perform salaat al-fajr at the masjid. He would then return home to read his daily remembrances in the courtyard as well as some of the Qur’aan until about sunrise. He would then sleep till about 8 am. This was on the days that he was not teaching at the university.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After waking again, he would eat some breakfast and then finish his work and readings in his study. He would also pray salaat ad-duhaa before going to the masjid for salaat adh-dhuhr. Upon his return, he would eat lunch with his family at about 1:30. Next, he would take phone calls until about 20 minutes before ‘asr. He would then rest for fifteen minutes or less before going to the masjid to pray ‘asr and meet the needs of people who went to the masjid knowing he would be there. He would return to his study after addressing the people’s needs to read before going again to the masjid for maghrib and his daily classes that would last until isha. Usually he would return home after that to eat a light dinner before going to his study to either give lectures outside of the Kingdom via telelink or hold meetings. This was almost his regular schedule throughout most the year, although it would change during some seasons such as Ramadan, Hajj, and the summer break.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were also some weekly commitments, and these would take place either at home or outside. Some of his weekly commitments included: Wednesday night meetings with the judges, meetings with the imaams that were scheduled to give the khutbah of jumu’ah in the masajid, meetings with university staff and professors, and meetings with the people of hisbah (those that enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong) until 11 or 12 pm then he would go to sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 21: What was his schedule during Ramadan, especially after iftaar?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: During Ramadan, the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) had a different schedule. He would spend most of the time at the masjid reciting Qur’aan and meeting the needs of the people. Also, he would invite some of the students of knowledge and the poor to eat iftaar at our home. After salaat al-isha, he would return home for dinner and to give fatawa over the phone. In addition, many people would visit our house to either say salaam to the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) or seek a fatwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 22: Where did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) like to spend his rest time?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: In reality, the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) did not know rest time; all of his time was busy. Even when he was sitting with us, the phone sometimes would ring, and he would spend a long time addressing the call. His rest time was in propagating the knowledge, meeting people’s needs, and fatawa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 23: How many hours a day did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) sleep?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The connected time did not exceed 3 to 4 hours. In total, it did not exceed 6 hours daily.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 24: Who amongst the students of the Shaykh did he praise, mention often, and was pleased with their visits?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) looked the same upon all of his students. All of them were like his sons, and he did not praise any of them in particular, but he looked upon them equally when he would meet or welcome them to the house. Also, he would share in their special occasions, meetings, trips, or support them if they were in need of something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 25: How did the Shaykh’s (رحمه الله ) family deal with his asceticism and piety?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We used to see him (رحمه الله ) as an example in all things, and we used to revere his asceticism and piety, which would comfort us since he (رحمه الله ) did not like any unnatural mannerisms nor did he want that around him. He was a simple person who liked ease in all of his matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 26: Did he (رحمه الله ) cry upon the death of Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn Baaz (رحمه الله )?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He was greatly affected by the death of his Shaykh, from whom he took knowledge. Everyone around him felt the extent of the profound impact it had. May Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) make us meet them all in the Paradise of bliss.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 27: Did he travel for other than seeking knowledge?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, he did not travel except to seek knowledge. He used to travel to Makkah for ‘Umrah, where he would dedicate times for duroos (talks). In addition, he went to Riyadh and Ta’if to attend the meetings of the Grand Scholars Committee, where he would also schedule duroos and lectures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 28: Can you tell us about the apparent generosity of the Shaykh with those in need?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We used to feel his care (رحمه الله ) for the people in need, whether they were distant or close. For instance, he used to check on the affairs of his family and relatives that were in need. Also, he would do the same with his neighbors, helping them in all that they needed, comforting them concerning their worries, and sharing in their joyous occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 29: What did you learn from the Shaykh? Did you learn matters of fatawa? Did you ever give fatawa?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I learned from the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) everything that relates to the affairs of this life, whether from the social or legal aspects. Concerning giving fatawa, I would not even dare to do this. I only used to present the Questions I received to him and then relate the Answers and fatawa to those that had asked.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 30: Before the Shaykh’s (رحمه الله ) death, what did he admonish his household and beloved ones with?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) did not give a specific direction before his death, but throughout his life, he would direct everyone to that which benefited them in their life and in their deen (religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 31: We would like an admonition from you to the wives of the callers and students of knowledge.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: They should preserve their husbands, openly and secretly. In addition, they should prepare for them the best situations and conditions to continue providing their duties of dawah and knowledge. Also, I incite them that they should not be bothered by the busy schedule of their husbands and their time spent traveling, seeking knowledge, reading, and doing dawah. By Allaah’s (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) Will, they are sharing in the reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 32: Could you tell us about the way the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) used to receive his guests?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) would receive his guests with simplicity and a real sense of welcoming. He ensured that they felt like guests, and no day passed, except that he brought a guest either for lunch, dinner or in between. We were pleased with his guests and would honor them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 33: What about a rare and pleasing encounter he had with his children or neighbours?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) acted with simplicity towards his children and neighbors and all those surrounding him. And one of those rare and nice occasions is that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) used to record some short recitations and nasheed [2] for his children and sometimes in the presence of one of the neighbors&#8217; kids. He then would re-play the cassette to them during some meeting with them at older ages. We even still keep some of these recording to this date.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 34: What is your advice to those that spread mischief in our Kingdom?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We ask Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) to preserve our land and to continue to bestow upon us the favor of security and safety. The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) would often repeat and mention that he does not know any nation on the face of the earth that applies the sharee’ah and holds to the correct creed like this one. Similarly, he (رحمه الله ) used to incite us to deal with affairs using wisdom, good admonition, and leniency instead of resorting to violence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 35: Is there anything that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) asked you to do that seemed strange and made you feel hesitant?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: It may be unknown to most that I was illiterate and did not receive any kind of formal education. When I first married the Shaykh (رحمه الله ), I was fully busy in his service and in providing him the correct, comfortable environment to seek knowledge and teach. After we had our children, I was busy with them, and it took all my time to raise them, in addition to the time I used to spend to help and support the Shaykh ( rahimahullaah) in seeking knowledge. After the children grew up and my responsibilities began to ease slightly, I was surprised that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) began to incite me to join the schools for the elderly. Although hesitant at first, I decided to join. During this period, he followed my achievements and would not accept for any of my sons to sign my transcripts of record. He (رحمه الله ) would say, “I am the one to sign for all that relates to your academic achievements.” This moment of learning is a period that can not be forgotten because of the great, innumerable benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 36: What kinds of gifts would the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) give you, his children, and people in general?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: During his lifetime, he (رحمه الله ) would not withhold anything from those that were close and those that were distant, to the best of his ability. The greatest gift he used to give us was his dawah and du’aa; I ask Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) to accept his du’aa, hold them for him in his good record, and bestow upon us the ability to be righteous to him after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 37: Did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) relate to you anything nice that occurred in the masjid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) would always tell us those things that he thought were fit to mention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 38: When did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) travel for dawah, and how would you deal with him concerning that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: I used to incite and encourage him as well as make things easy for him by providing him what he needed. In general, his trips were few, and I used to join him on most of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning travel outside of the Kingdom, he did not leave the country, except to seek treatment in America for ten days, and I joined him during that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 39: Could you tell us about the Shaykh’s use of the internet when it was first introduced to the Kingdom?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He was one of the earliest to hasten to benefit from this service and tried to utilize it to dissipate, propagate, and serve the Islamic knowledge. There is nothing more evident of this than the establishment of his website, which contains all of his works. His site is currently supervised by the charitable organization that was setup after his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 40: When did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) buy the automatic, telephone <strong>Answer</strong>ing machine?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: From the things that are unknown to many is that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) was keen and had interest in modern electronic instruments. There were those that used to provide him with the newest technology, such that you would often find with him some electronics that had not yet been released to the open market; examples include: electronic watches, instruments that could determine the direction of the qiblah, audio recording devices, mobile phones, and automatic telephone Answering machines among many other gadgets. He (رحمه الله ) acquired the automatic Answering machine as soon as it became available in the Kingdom. He used it a great deal, often programming it and recording the messages himself, to the extent that when he would travel, he would leave a detailed message on how to contact him while he was away. He was in that, a reference to all of us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 41: Did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) buy newspapers, and how did he learn about local and national news?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We used to receive one of the newspapers at our home as a gift, and he ( rahimahullaah) would look at it if he had time. Sometimes he would ask us for scissors to clip out important articles or news so he could keep it. Also, he would hear the news on the radio, especially during breakfast around 7 or 8 in the morning when he would listen to either the Qur’aan broadcasting station from Riyadh or the BBC. In addition, he would listen sometimes at length to the analysis of the news if there were important developments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 42: Was there ever an offer for the Shaykh to move to Riyadh?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Several times he was asked to move to Riyadh, Madinah, and Makkah. He was even assigned as a judge in the eastern province of al-Ihsaa, but he used to see that his staying in Unayzah had a great benefit, so he (رحمه الله ) refused these offers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 43: During the visits of King Faisal (رحمه الله ), King Khaled (رحمه الله ), King Fahad (رحمه الله ), and other princes, what did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) offer them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: When he was at his home which is made of mud in Unayzah, he was visited by King Saud (رحمه الله ), King Khaled (رحمه الله ), and King Fahad (رحمه الله ); they were amazed by his humbleness, piety, simplicity, and asceticism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 44: Did anyone offer to install any echo instruments for the microphone in the Shaykh’s masjid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The Shaykh (رحمه الله ) did not see to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 45: Was the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) married to anyone else other than you, and how many wives did he have?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) was not married to other than me. He married two wives before me; his first wife died, and Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) did not intend for the second marriage to continue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 46: We need from you an admonition to men who have more than one wife. </span></p>
<p><strong>Answer</strong>: Justice. Justice. Justice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 47: If one would ask the father (i.e. the Shaykh) to admonish me as a girl, what would you expect him?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He would admonish you as he would admonish one of his daughters and all of the daughters of the Muslims to fear Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) openly and secretly, to be righteous to the parents, uphold the ties of kinship, preserve the husband, and fear Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) regarding raising the children Islamically based on leniency and kindness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 48: Did the Shyakh (رحمه الله ) use to tell you about the Mujaahideen in Sheeshaan (Chechnya) and other places especially since it reached us that he was keen concerning their news and Fatwa?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) was keen on following the status (affairs) of Muslims everywhere, in Palestine, Algeria, Afghanistaan, and Sheeshaan. [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 49: How did the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) receive the news of his illness, and how did he tell you about it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: He (رحمه الله ) received the news with patience, anticipating the reward. One of my sons reported to me that after they (رحمه الله ) received the news, he instructed them not to mention anything to their brothers, sisters, or me and that the matter should be left to him. He (رحمه الله ) related the news to us gradually. We ask Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) to forgive him and give him a spacious residence in Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>Question</strong> 50: We came to know that the Shaykh (رحمه الله ) during his illness refused to call his cancer the “evil disease,” choosing instead to simply refer to it as dangerous. Would you tell us about this and his patience?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: This was not only after his illness, but rather he had this opinion before because he disliked using the term “evil” for this disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his patience, this was manifested in his illness, and I knew that he suffered greatly from it. The pain would wake him many times during the night; whenever he was asked about it, he would confirm that it existed, adding that he only told them this as information and not as a complaint, since he (رحمه الله ) knew the reward for those that were patient.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Book of Purification</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Second Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Hurayrah (May Allaah be pleased with him): Allaah&#8217;s Apostle (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The prayer of a person who does hadath (passes, urine, stool or wind) is not accepted till he performs (repeats) the ablution.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 4, Number 137 and Sahih Muslim Kitaab at-Taharah #559]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Narrator</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The narrator is Abu Hurayrah (radiyallaahu ‘anhu). His name is ‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin Sakhir ad-Dawsee. He accepted Islaam in the year of the battle of Khaybar (6 AH), and he witnessed the battle. He was in the company of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam), and was very much interested in the hadeeth of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam), testified to Abu Hurayrah’s keenness regarding the hadeeths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Umar (May Allaah be pleased with him and his father) said: <em>“You were closest to the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam), being with him, and most knowledgeable in hadeeth”</em>. The same had been reported from ‘Umar (radiyallaahu ‘anhu) himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Imaam al- Bukhaaree (rahimahullaah) said: <em>“Abu Hurayrah was the most diligent one in preserving the narrations of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam), in his time”</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of knowledge related that Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with him) narrated 5,374 hadeeths. He died in the year 57 AH in the city of Madeenah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Subject and Overall Explanation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of this hadeeth is “The ruling concerning salaah without wudhuu’”. In this hadeeth it is clear that the importance of salaah ranks high with Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa), because it is the best of worship after the shahaadah. And it is the relation between the slave and his Lord. And for this reason, the believer is not permitted to indulge in the salaah until he is pure, as this hadeeth illustrates. So Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa), does not accept the salaah of the slave and will not reward him for it if he breaks the wudhuu’ until he repeats the ablution.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>From the Benefits of this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The hadeeth tells that from the salaah, there is the salaah which is accepted and the salaah which is rejected. The salaah which is in accordance with the shari’ah is accepted. And the salaah which is in opposition to the shari’ah is rejected. This applies to all types of worship, because the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wasallam) said: “Whoever does an action which is not in accordance with our matter, then it is rejected.” [Al- Bukhaaree and Muslim]. So it must comply with the shari’ah to be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Whether the salaah is an obligatory one or an optional one (even the salaatul-janaazah i.e. funeral prayer), it is not accepted if the person performs it while in a state of ritual impurity, even if he forgets being in such a state. It is only accepted when he repeats the wudhuu’. Similarly, the salaah of one in a state of sexual defilement is not accepted if he performs the salaah before taking the ghusl – the complete bath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The salaah of the muhdith (the one in a state of ritual impurity), is forbidden until he makes the wudhuu’, because Allaah does not accept it. And offering means of nearness to Allaah, knowing that Allaah does not accept them, is like mocking at Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. If a person makes wudhuu’ to perform a certain salaah then the second salaah approaches and he attains the time of the second salaah while in a state of purity then it is not an obligation on him to redo the wudhuu’. He or she can pray on the same wudhuu’ done for the previous salaah. And this is very important because some people think that it is an obligation to make wudhuu’ for each salaah. It is not an obligation as long as the state of wudhuu’ is maintained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Ritual purity is a condition for the correctness and acceptance of the salaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Breaking the wudhuu’ during salaah invalidates the salaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The invalidators of wudhuu’ are:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a. Responding to the call of nature or passing wind</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b. Intoxication, unconsciousness, deep sleep and insanity</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">c. Touching the genitals skin to skin, and some scholars conditioned that it must be with a sexual desire</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">d. Sexual activity which necessitates a ghusl</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">e. Eating camel’s meat</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">f. Apostasy (ar-Ridda)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">g. Washing a dead body or carrying it. There is a difference of opinion on this, but to be on the precautionary side, one does that. The Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam) said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“He who washes the dead let him take a bath, and he who carries the dead let him make wudhuu’.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Ahmed, Abu Daawood and at-Tirmidhee, and Al-Albani graded it as saheeh as in saheeh sunan Abi Daeeod, 2:609)].</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Questions for this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is the full name of Abu Hurayrah?<br />
2. When did he accept Islaam?<br />
3. How many Hadeeths did he report?<br />
4. When did he die?<br />
5. If someone prayed without having wudhuu’ due to forgetfulness, is his salaah acceptable or not?<br />
6. Is it a must to have (make) wudhuu’ for each salaah?</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the <em>salaah</em> and <em>salaam</em> be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection. This is a continuation of the explanation of <em>The Basic Rulings and Principles of Fiqh – The Beneficial, Eloquent Classifications and Differentiations</em> by Imaam ‘Abd ar-Rahman bin Naasir as-Sa’di (rahimahullaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Foundation eleven is entitled:</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The asl (i.e. previous state or condition) remains in effect, and certainty is not annulled by mere doubt.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>This great foundation covers many matters including:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Acts of worship<br />
2) <em>Salaah</em> (prayer)<br />
3) <em>Zakaah</em><br />
4) Fasting<br />
5) Hajj<br />
6) <em>Nikaah</em> (marriage)<br />
7) Divorce</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Evidence for Foundation 11</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This foundation is established on the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> from ‘Abbaad bin Tamim ( radiyallaahu ‘anhu):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“My uncle (radiyallaahu ‘anhu) asked Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (<em>sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) about a person who imagined to have passed wind during the <em>salaah</em>. Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) replied: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘<em>He should not leave his salaah unless he hears sound or smells something.</em>’”</strong></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the person should not discontinue his prayer due to mere doubt. He should only leave when he is certain he has invalidated his state of purity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) A person makes <em>wudhu</em> and later doubts whether he performed an act that would nullify it. In such a situation, the <em>asl</em> is the existence and continuity of purity. The fact that he thinks he may have done a ritual impurity is not to be considered as in origin, the person was in a state of purity. <strong>Certainty is never annulled except by certainty; it can never be annulled by mere doubt.</strong> Rather, it is strange that some people when they have doubts, they experience whispering which drives them to remove the doubt with certainty by intentionally invalidating their <em>wudhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) A person was certain that he was in a state of ritual impurity. Later, he doubts whether he made <em>wudhu</em>. In this case, the <em>asl</em> is that the state of ritual impurity remains in effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the <em>asl</em> remains, and it does not cease except when there is certainty that renders it annulled.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Doubt in the Purity of an Object</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Purity (<em>at-tahaarah</em>) is the origin of things (e.g. water, clothing, etc.); whenever someone doubts the purity of something, then he builds upon the <em>asl</em> that it is pure. For instance, if some water from a drain falls on him or he steps in moisture, then the origin is that this water is pure. However, if someone is sure filth has fallen on his garment but later doubts whether he washed it, then the <em>asl</em> is that the ritual impurity remains.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Doubt in the Number of Completed <em>Rakaah</em> in <em>Salaah</em></span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In <em>salaah</em>, a person may doubt exactly how many <em>rakaah</em> he has performed. Such situations are divided into two categories: preponderance and total doubt. For example, if someone doubts how many <em>rakaah</em> he has already prayed (e.g. three or four units) but preponderates a certain number, then he builds on that preponderance and later makes two prostrations of forgetfulness (<em>sujuud as-sahw</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence for relying on preponderance came in the <em>sunnah</em> from the <em>hadeeth</em> of Abdullaah bin Masood (radhi Allaahu anhu):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) prayed [and the subnarrator Ibrahim (rahimahullaah) said, ‘I do not know whether he prayed more or less than usual’], and when he had finished the prayers he was asked, ‘O Messenger of Allaah! Has there been any change in the prayers?’ He (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, <em>‘What is it?&#8217;</em> The people said, ‘You have prayed so much and so much.’ So the Prophet bent his legs, faced the <em>qiblah</em> and performed two prostrations (of <em>sahw</em>) and finished his prayers with <em>tasleem</em> (by turning his face to the right and left saying: <em>&#8216;As-salaamu ‘alaykum wa rahmatullaah’</em>). When he turned his face to us, he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, <em>‘If there had been anything changed in the prayer, surely I would have informed you, but I am a human being like you and liable to forget like you. So if I forget, remind me and if anyone of you is doubtful about his prayer, he should follow what he thinks to be correct (falyataharra as-sawab) and complete his prayer accordingly and finish it and do two prostrations (of sahw).’”</em> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, when a person is in total doubt concerning how many <em>rakaah</em> he has already completed (e.g. two or three), then he builds upon certainty which is the lesser number; he then makes <em>sujuud as-sahw.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) A person is unsure whether he prayed three or four <em>rakaah</em> and is unable to determine which is more likely. He should therefore build on certainty which is the lesser number (i.e. three) and make <em>sujuud as-sahw</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) A person is not certain whether he prayed three or four <em>rakaah</em> but preponderates that he prayed four. He should therefore build on the preponderance (i.e. four <em>rakaah</em>) and make <em>sujuud as-sahw</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, preponderance is used to determine the number of completed rounds in <strong><em>tawaaf</em> </strong>and walks in <em>saa’ee</em> between Safa and Marwah. For instance, if a person is in total doubt as to whether he completed six or seven walks in <em>saa’ee</em>, then he builds on certainty and considers it to be as if he made six trips. Similarly, if he is able to preponderate that it is the sixth walk, then he should consider it the sixth and bring the seventh. However, there is no <em>sujuud as-sahw</em> legislated for <em>tawaaf</em> or <em>saa’ee</em> given the weakness of the narration from ibn ‘Abbaas (radhi Allaahu anhu) that the <em>tawaaf</em> is salaah. This foundation also is applicable to washing a utensil seven times after a dog has licked it. If someone is entirely unsure whether he washed it three or four times, then he builds upon certainty, but if he is able to preponderate, then he builds upon that.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Doubt in the Number of Missed Prayers and Fasts</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When making up missed prayers or days of fasting, the person builds on certainty. However, this can be problematic. For instance, someone is unsure whether he broke his fast three or four days in Ramadan. In principle, he is certain he broke it at least three times. However, this origin is opposed by another <em>asl</em>, which is the obligation to fulfill that which is binding upon one’s self. This can not be attained except by fasting four days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, if someone does not know if he missed five <em>salaah</em> or six, then in origin he certainly missed at least five, but this is in opposition to the obligation to free one’s responsibility. This can not be fulfilled except by performing six. In this case, he brings that which is higher.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Doubt Concerning which Specific Prayer was Missed</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone knows that he missed one <em>salaah</em> on a given day but does not remember which prayer (e.g. <em>duhr</em>, ‘<em>asr</em>, etc.), then there are the following opinions concerning that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) The person should pray all five prayers because it is possible the missed salaah is any one of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) He should pray one <em>salaah</em> with four rakaah, another <em>salaah</em> with three <em>rakaah</em>, and one <em>salaah</em> of two <em>rakaah</em>. This is because the <em>salaah</em> of four <em>rakaah</em> would cover for <em>duhr</em>, ‘<em>asr</em>, and <em>isha</em>’ while the other two <em>salaah</em> would cover for <em>maghrib</em> and <em>fajr</em> respectively.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) Our Shaykh, Muhammad bin Saalih al-Uthaymeen (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said, “He should exert the effort until he preponderates which is the correct one.” If the person sincerely attempts to recall which <em>salaah</em> he missed, Allaah (<em>subhaanallaahu wa ta’aalaa</em>) will let him remember.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Doubt in Divorce</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many different situations in which doubt in divorce can occur. They include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) A person doubts whether he uttered the statement of divorce at all. In this situation, the asl is that he did not say it, and the couple is still married. This is because the marriage is certain and is not annulled by mere doubt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) If someone doubts whether he conditioned the divorce on something, then the asl is that the divorce is unconditional.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) Someone conditions his divorce on some matter. Later, he doubts whether the condition was fulfilled. The origin therefore is that it did not take place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4) A person divorced his wife but is uncertain how many times he uttered the statement (i.e. once, twice or thrice). The asl is that he said it once.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5) A man has two wives (for example Hind and Fatimah), and he doubts which of his wives he uttered the divorce concerning. This matter should be decided by drawing lots. If the lot came on Fatimah, then she is divorced, and Hind remains his wife. If he later remembers he actually divorced Hind or found a paper documenting that, then he leaves Hind and returns Fatimah as long as the drawing of the lots and the accompanying decree was not issued by a judge (if it was performed by a judge, then it would be classified as the judge’s direct ruling). However, if Fatimah got married to someone else in the meantime, then the husband can not return Fatimah because she is now the right of her new husband unless he brings proof, such as a document with testimony, that the divorce was for Hind; in this case, Fatimah can return to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6) A person doubts whether his wife finished her waiting period. The asl is that she has not finished it and is still in her ‘iddah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Doubt in Suckling</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning suckling, doubts affect whether or not there is prohibition (<em>tahreem</em>) to marry the wet nurse and her daughters. Cases include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Doubt exists concerning whether a particular child nursed from a woman at all. The asl in this situation is that he did not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) Someone doubts whether he suckled from a woman five times or less than that. This person builds upon certainty, which is that he suckled on less than five occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) There is doubt around when a child suckled from a wet nurse. In this matter, the scholars have two opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a. Some scholars hold that for <em>tahreem</em> to exist, the child must have suckled within the first two years. If there is doubt as to whether a child suckled from a woman within the first two years, then in principle the asl would be that he suckled within that period, which would entail <em>tahreem</em>. However, the scholars have explained that since this <em>asl</em> leads to tahreem, the origin is that there is no forbiddance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b. Other scholars have mentioned that the condition for <em>tahreem</em> is whether the child suckled before or after weaning. If there is doubt as to whether the child suckled before or after weaning, then in principle the <em>asl</em> would be before weaning. However, just as with the other opinion, the scholars have explained that in origin there is actually no forbiddance in this case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, with either opinion, there is no tahreem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4) A mother is certain that a woman in a particular household nursed her child but is unsure as to which specific woman did it. In this case, the tahreem is upon all of the women in the household. For example, if there are two women in that house, then both women and their daughters are haraam for him to marry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5) A woman is certain that she nursed a child in a particular household but is unsure as to which child. Therefore, it is as if she nursed all of them. Hence, all of the boys of this house are prohibited from marrying her as well as her daughters, and they become mahaarim (pl. of mahram) for her and her daughters.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Doubt in the Hunting of Game</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person is hunting game, doubt can exist concerning whether the animal was killed by his shot or some other cause. Such situations are divided into two categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) No cause is found for the death of the animal other than the shot. Therefore, the meat is halaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: Someone says the basmalah and shoots an animal. He later finds the animal dead with no sign of another cause for its death. As such, the asl is the nonexistence of another cause, which makes the meat halaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) Another cause is found for the animal’s death that is equally or close to equally as likely as the shot to have killed it. Therefore, the meat of the animal is haraam. This is proven by the hadeeth of Adi bin Hatim (radhi Allaahu anhu) that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#333300;"><em>When you set off your dog, recite the name of Allaah, and if it catches (game for you) and you find it alive, then slaughter it. If you find it dead and that (your dog) has eaten nothing out of that, (even then) you may eat it, but if you find along with your dog another dog and a kill has been made, then do not eat, for you do not know which of the two has killed it. And if you shoot your arrow, recite the name of Allaah, but if it (game) goes out of your sight for a day and you do not find on that but the mark of your arrow, then eat that it you so like, but if you find it drowned in water, then do not eat that.”</em></span> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: A person shot an animal, but the shot did not kill it immediately. The animal was later found dead in a pool of water. It can not be known whether the shot killed the animal or it drowned. Thus, as proven by the hadeeth of Adi (radhi Allaahu anhu), this meat is forbidden.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Under this foundation many matters fall; anyone that studies <em>fiqh</em> will surely be benefited by it and will be better able to relate matters to their principles and origins. In summary, the continuity of the <em>asl</em> remains whenever the existence of a cause to nullify it is doubted. Similarly, in every matter where there is a doubt about the number, we build on preponderance, and if there is no preponderance, then we build on certainty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eleventh foundation in Imaam ‘Abd ar-Rahman bin Naasir as-Sa’di’s book, al- Qawaa&#8217;id wal-Usool al-Jaami&#8217;ah wal-Furooq wat-Taqaaseem al-Badee&#8217;ah an- Naafi&#8217;ah (The Basic Rulings and Principles of Fiqh – The Beneficial, Eloquent Classifications and Differentiations), is entitled:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The asl remains in effect, and certainty is not annulled by mere doubt.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Basic Rulings and Foundations of Fiqh-2</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection. This is a continuation of the explanation of The Basic Rulings and Principles of Fiqh – The Beneficial, Eloquent Classifications and Differentiations by Imam ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Naasir as-Sa’di (rahimahullaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Foundation two is entitled:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The means take on the same rulings as their aims.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What branches from this foundation is the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Whatever is required to fulfill an obligation is itself an obligation.<br />
2) Whatever is required to fulfill a recommendation is itself recommended<br />
3) Whatever leads to the establishment of a haraam (prohibition) is itself prohibited.<br />
4) Whatever leads to the establishment of a makrooh (detested act) is itself detested.<br />
5) Whatever follows-on from acts of worship and actions takes the same rulings as they do (i.e. worship and actions).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of these stem from the second foundation, “<strong>The means take on the same rulings as their aims do</strong>.” In this comprehensive foundation, the phrase, “<strong>The means</strong>” refers to the methods and ways taken to achieve the aim or the cause that leads to the objectives; in addition, it implies the matters upon which the aims depend as well as what it entails from the existence of something and also the rulings’ conditions. If Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم command a matter, then it is a command concerning the matter itself and also what is required to fulfill it; this is because the One Who legislated the rulings is al-&#8216;Aleem (All Knowledgeable) al-Hakeem (All Wise) and knows rulings’ requirements, conditions, and fulfillments. Similarly, forbidding something means forbidding it in essence as well as all that leads to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Examples</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Walking to the congregational prayers, circles of knowledge or to uphold the ties of kinship as well as to visit the sick and to follow the funerals are parts of their respective acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) From the moment the person leaves his residence for Hajj, Umrah, or Jihaad in the cause of Allaah, he is in a state of continuous worship since these are means to the completion of those acts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى : subhannahu wa taa’alaa) says (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">It was not becoming of the people of Al-Madinah and the Bedouins of the neighborhood to remain behind Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Muhamamd صلى الله عليه وسلم when fighting in Allaah&#8217;s Cause) and (it was not becoming of them) to prefer their own lives to his life. That is because they suffer neither thirst nor fatigue, nor hunger in the Cause of Allaah, nor they take any step to raise the anger of disbelievers nor inflict any injury upon an enemy but is written to their credit as a deed of righteousness. Surely, Allaah wastes not the reward of the Muhsineen. Nor do they spend anything (in Allaah&#8217;s Cause) &#8211; small or great – nor cross a valley, but is written to their credit, that Allaah may recompense them with the best of what they used to do (i.e. Allaah will reward their good deeds according to the reward of their best deeds which they did in the most perfect manner)</span>. [Surah at-Tawbah (9:120-121)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point of evidence in this verse is clear. Also, in the Sunnah, it is reported that the Prophet ( : sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said concerning the seeker of knowledge,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever pursues a path to seek knowledge, then Allaah will thereby make easy for him a path to Paradise”</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) from His bounty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Replete are the evidences from the authentic Sunnah concerning the reward of the person who walks to the congregational prayers; one example is the authentic hadeeth reported by Abu Hurairah who narrated that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Prayer offered in congregation is twenty-five times better than prayer offered at home or in the marketplace alone. If any one of you does wudoo’ and does it perfectly, then comes to the masjid for no other purpose than to pray, then he does not take a single step but Allaah raises him in status one degree thereby and removes one sin from him, until he enters the masjid.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, concerning verse 12 from Surah Ya-Sin (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, We give life to the dead, and We record that which they send before (them), and their traces </span>[Surah Ya-Sin (36:12)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">some maintained that the phrase, “<strong>We record that which they send before (them), and their traces</strong>,” refers to the recording of their footsteps and of the deeds performed to conclude the acts of obedience or disobedience; in another interpretation, others asserted that this verse discusses that which is left behind from righteous deeds after one’s death, such as: beneficial knowledge, authorship, endowments, continuous charity, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the footsteps leading to the salaah are something that follows-on the worship. Correspondingly, the footsteps that lead to sin fall under the same ruling as the sins themselves do; as such, these footsteps would also be sins. The command to perform the salaah is a command to do the salaah as well as to do that, without which, the salaah would not be complete, such as the tahaarah (purification), placing a sutrah, facing the qiblah, learning the rulings of salaah, and the rest of the salaah’s conditions. The same applies to the other of the acts of worship. Thus, with this insight, the branches of this foundation that were mentioned previously become clear.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Additional Branches of This Foundation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) The &#8216;ulama’ (scholars) said that if the time of a prescribed prayer commences upon someone who has no water available, then he should seek it in the places he hopes to find it. Likewise, it is required that he buys water or a sutrah in situations where he may not have them available. This is because whatever is required to fulfill an obligation is itself an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) It is obligated for people to learn the industrial knowledge, small or great, that they need in their deen or dunyah. These skills will help reduce the people’s reliance on other nations, especially the kufar, through increased selfsufficiency. Beneficial knowledge is of two types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a. The first type of knowledge is an individual obligation (fard ‘ayn); it includes all that which is needed by the person for his deen, worship, and transactions, each in accordance with his own condition. This is required of every legally and morally responsible, mature, and sane individual. Example: if a person has wealth then it is binding upon him to learn the rulings of Zakaat, otherwise it is not mandatory if he does not possess wealth. Similarly with respect to the one who wants to go for Hajj or want to be an Imaam. He must learn the related rulings, otherwise the knowledge thereof is of the second type (collective duty).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b. The second type of knowledge is a collective obligation (fard kifaayah); it includes all that which people need but is not required of them individually. Examples of communal obligations are: the learning of the different branches of knowledge, the adhaan, the lesser and greater leadership, enjoining that which is right, forbidding that which is evil, preparing the deceased for burial, the funeral prayer, carrying the body to the graveyard, the burial itself, agriculture, and irrigation. The performance of these is sought from the morally responsible collectively, not from every person individually.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) The measures taken to earn that which is needed to establish the rights of the self, family, children, and animals fall under this principle. For instance, if a person does not have wealth and he fears his destruction, then saving the self is an obligation. Whatever is required to fulfill an obligation is itself an obligation; as such, the seeking of sustenance would be an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4) It is obligated to learn the evidences for the direction of the qiblah, time, as well as directions in general for those who need them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5) The sharee&#8217;ah knowledge is of two types, objectives and means. The objectives are learning the Book and the Sunnah; the means to that is the Arabic sciences. This is because the knowledge of the Book and Sunnah is dependant upon knowing the Arabic sciences and cannot therefore be completed except through that. However, if someone learns Arabic to become a writer or a poet, then this is mubaah (allowable) and will be neither for him nor against him, as it is independent of the sharee&#8217;ah knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6) Every allowable matter taken to abandon an obligation or to perform a forbidden act is itself haraam (forbidden). This is because in this foundation, the means take on the same ruling as there aims. That is why it is forbidden to trade or buy after the second call for jumu’ah; Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) states.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe (Muslims)! When the call is proclaimed for the Salaat (prayer) on the day of Friday (Jumu&#8217;ah prayer), come to the remembrance of Allaah [Jumu&#8217;ah religious talk (Khutbah) and Salaat (prayer)] and leave off business (and every other thing), that is better for you if you did but know! </span>[Surah al-Jumu’ah (62:9)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, it is forbidden to indulge in trade if someone fears missing the time of the salaah or the congregational prayers. In addition, it is not permissible to sell something to one who intends to use it in a sinful manner. For example, selling weapons to the people of fitnah or bandits is forbidden. Likewise, one can not sell an ingredient that is used in alcohol preparation if you know it will be used for that purpose. Moreover, deceptive practices in transactions are forbidden if they lead to haraam, such as the trade in ‘eena (selling a commodity to another person for a deferred price due at a certain time while then buying the same commodity from him at a lesser price).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7) Those who take wealth through illegal means will be prevented from achieving what they intend. An example of this would be the deliberate killing of person to whom a bequest has been made or an heir. Likewise, the one who divorces his wife during an illness he fears is incurable will be treated in a manner opposite to his intention; as such, she will still inherit from him since the man only divorced her in order to deprive her of the inheritance. Also, one cannot treat his wife harshly in order to take back some of the mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage) by forcing her to resort to khula’. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You should not treat them with harshness, that you may take away part of the Mahr you have given them</span><strong>.</strong> [Surah an-Nisa (4:19)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the husband should not send his wife to her parents’ house and leave her situation suspended in order to force her to seek khula’. In such situations, it is not permissible for him to take any of the mahr since anyone who hastens something before its proper time will be prevented from achieving what he intends.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8) If someone gives a gift out of bashfulness or fear, then it is obligatory that the gift to be returned to him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9) This foundation includes the deceptive approach used by some to make the wife permissible for her former husband who had divorced her three times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is forbidden, and the person who engages in this is cursed. For example, if an individual instructs someone to marry his former wife whom he had divorced three times, with the intention of marrying her later, and that person makes a contract to marry her, this is in fact adultery, even though it takes the form of a contract.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10) Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) forbade all fawahish (evil things and sins) as well as all the means of approaching them when it is feared that the person may fall into haraam. For instance, being in seclusion with women who are legally unrelated to person as well as looking at the haraam are both forbidden. That is why the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“That which is lawful is plain and that which is unlawful is plain, and between the two of them there are doubtful matters about which not many people know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his religion and his honor, but he who falls into doubtful matters falls into that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures around a sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a sanctuary, and truly Allaah’s sanctuary is His prohibitions.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11) The prohibition regarding that which instigates enmity and hatred between Muslims as well as the incitement to all that which encourages friendship and cooperation from sayings and actions are branches of this principle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12) This foundation includes what Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) said concerning trusts; He (سبحانه و تعالى) affirmed (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily! Allaah commands that you should render back the trusts to those, to whom they are due.</span> [Surah an-Nisa (4:58)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This verse covers all types of trusts, such as what someone deposits with you, taking care of an orphan’s wealth, taking care of an endowment, etc. One of the means of rendering back the trusts to their people is by preserving them and spending upon them if they are creatures with souls (e.g. animals). Likewise, the one who is entrusted must not be negligent nor do to them that which is not permissible.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The Association between the Act and the Intention</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many of the branches previously mentioned are governed by their intentions. For instance, the deceitful act done with the intention of achieving something forbidden or to abandon an obligation is haraam. However, if deceit is used to extract lawful, permissible rights, then this is lawful and may even be commanded, except in cases where it may be harmful to the person; this is because the slave is ordered to take his rights in open ways, but also sometimes in hidden ways. This is clear when we examine the situation of Prophet Yusuf (‘alayhis salaam); Allaah spoke about him, saying (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">So he [Yusuf (Joseph)] began (the search) in their bags before the bag of his brother. Then he brought it out of his brother&#8217;s bag. Thus did We plan for Yusuf (Joseph). He could not take his brother by the law of the king (as a slave), except that Allaah willed it.</span> [Surah Yusuf (12:76)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, the same applies to methods taken to protect lives or wealth. An example of this is the case of Khidr and the ship, in Surah al-Kahf, where he made a hole in the boat in order to save it from the oppressive king who would have unlawfully taken over any working vessel. Therefore, such plots depend on their intention, good or bad.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Exclusion of Vows</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Excluded from this foundation are vows due to a specific wisdom, particular to them. Vows of obedience are obligatory to fulfill. However, the making of the vow itself is makrooh (detested) as it does not bring good as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said; rather, vows simply extract things from the miser. Similarly, they diminish and reduce sincerity. What Follows the Objective Takes the Same Rulings as Objective Itself Finally, in is as much as the means taken to reach the objectives inherit the same rulings as the objective itself, what follows or completes the aims also takes the same ruling as their aims do. Accordingly, going to perform good deeds as well as returning to the place of departure are acts of worship. That is why some of the companions said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I anticipate my return to my home from salaah as I anticipate my departure from my home for salaah.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Conclusion</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second foundation in Imam ‘Abd ar-Rahman ibn Naasir as-Sa’di’s book, alQawaa&#8217;id wal-Usool al-Jaami&#8217;ah wal-Furooq wat -Taqaaseem al-Badee&#8217;ah anNaafi&#8217;ah (The Basic Rulings and Principles of Fiqh – The Beneficial, Eloquent Classifications and Differentiations), is entitled: The means take on the same rulings as their aims do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Most High, Knows Best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<strong> The Test</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The closest thing to man is himself. How many of us really know about ourselves before even thinking about the environment surrounding us? There are many great things in ourselves that we are either heedless regarding their magnificence or that we take for granted. Let us take the following journey back to the days when each one of us was an “embryo” inside the womb of his mother:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Who took care of me with utmost care and graciousness when I was a tiny seed settled on the wall of the uterine with three layers of darkness surrounding me?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who made my mother’s blood bring me food I need until I grew up to a stage in which my body was able to stand the air, the light, and the hands of people who turn me around?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, when the contractions pushed me, and I was “squeezed” out and to the world of tests and trials I came out!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who shielded you inside as a “fertilized egg”? Then who made your residence enlarge as you grew up? Who opened the way for you when you came out naked without belongings or wealth?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There you came so poor and needy. Two “containers” of milk hanging on your mother’s chest came to the rescue! Who commanded the milk to develop and then to stand ready for your lips to come and suck it out? A milk so agreeable to you, neither cold nor hot; neither salty nor bitter. You were so thirsty and so hungry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who turned the hearing of your mother and filled it with mercy, love and attachment? The moment she hears you crying she comes forth led by her mercy and love. She would prefer to see herself in pain not you! You enlighten her life. Who put all of that in her heart?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When your body got stronger and your belly size became bigger, you needed another kind of food. Who put in your mouth the cutting and grinding “tools”? Who held your teeth from growing during the period of your breastfeeding? It was a mercy for your mother when they were held and a mercy for you when they came out! And the stronger you became, the more you got from these “tools” of your mouth! Thereupon you used a new set of “tools”: the molars working on meat, bread and all kinds of solid food. Who provided you with these “instruments” and made them easy for you to utilize.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we came out we knew nothing. What a burden it would have been if we were born in a state possessing the intelligence of an adult wrapped in diapers? What kind of living it would be? Would we receive the care and kindness you normally get as developing newborns?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our intelligence developed gradually and we were able to slowly but surely familiarize ourselves with our surroundings. Who is the One Who is All-Wise and Most Merciful, the One Who is ever watching over us and providing us with the means we need in due proportions and exact measurements?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then who is the One Who fashioned our heads with hair as a beauty and protection from cold and heat? Who adorned the face of the growing man with the distinctive beauty of the beard and kept the woman’s face soft, radiant and hairless?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many are turning away from the one who created us and increasingly becoming heedless regarding the true objective behind our existence. They are misled by a concept and a “theory”. That is it! A “theory” that practically denies the existence of the true God (Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Darwin [1], presented a &#8220;theory&#8221; that denies the creation of man as well as creation itself. The theory was announced in the second half of the nineteenth century. Although it is an &#8220;assumption,&#8221; there are those who consider it scientific evidence to support their arguments against the reality of creation. The theory claims that the origin of life lies in a single small animal that was &#8220;developed&#8221; on its own from water. The &#8220;environment&#8221;, according to the theory, imposed specific structural changes on this organism producing new features in it. These changes were then inherited in the offspring and further transformed with time to produce more advanced creatures of which man is the highest form. This is the theory of Darwin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many critical aspects of the lives of people are still affected, knowingly or unknowingly, by some basic elements of Darwin&#8217;s theory, mainly the idea of &#8220;development&#8221; and its link to the &#8220;environment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The objectives of this book are to:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A) Examine the basics of the theory and the evidence supporting them.<br />
B) Provide the essential facts that disprove the validity of the theory&#8217;s assumptions.<br />
C) Discuss the influence of the theory on the life of this world.<br />
D) Relate man to his Creator and hence to the purpose of our creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah (God) to enlighten the hearts of those men and women who will read this book, and to guide them to worship Him alone by submitting their wills to His will. The submission and obedience to Allaah&#8217;s Will and Commands as detailed in the last Revelation to mankind, the Qur&#8217;an, is the meaning of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who is need of the Mercy of Allaah<br />

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From A Small Animal to Man!</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A Theory With A Broken Chain</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Background and Basics of The Theory:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) The theory depends on what was observed in archeological discoveries at the time of Darwin: old and new geological layers contained different remains from different forms of creation. The &#8220;old&#8221; layers contained &#8220;primitive&#8221; forms of creation while more recent layers contained more &#8220;advanced&#8221; forms. Darwin concluded that the &#8220;more advanced&#8221; creatures originated (evolved) from the &#8220;lower primitive” ones.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) The theory also depends upon an idea that was prevailing at the time of Darwin in which it was thought that all animal embryos were similar at their early stages of development. This brought a conclusion that &#8220;the origin of all beings is one&#8221; and that &#8220;evolution&#8221; on earth occurred in the same way it occurred inside the wombs of living beings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Furthermore, the theory cites &#8220;differences in the roles&#8221; of the appendix in man in comparison to that in monkey. Since it is assumed that it &#8220;does not have a role&#8221; to play in the function of the human body while it can digest plants in monkeys, the theory suggested that the appendix in man is an underdeveloped form that was a left over from monkeys.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) The theory assumes the presence of a &#8220;Natural Selection&#8221; process in which there are &#8220;elimination factors&#8221; that can abolish the weak living beings while the strong ones are kept, and that their characteristics are to be inherited in their offspring. With time these characteristics will accumulate in the new beings producing new characteristics. According to Darwin, this represents the &#8220;evolutionary&#8221; process that makes of these new characteristics &#8220;higher&#8221; forms of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) The theory suggests a &#8220;Sexual Selection&#8221; process by which there is a tendency of the male and female to mate with the strong and best members of both sexes. The characteristics of the &#8220;best&#8221; will be &#8220;inherited&#8221; and those associated with weak animals would be &#8220;eliminated&#8221; because of the lack of tendency and/or interest to mate the weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(6) Whenever a new characteristic is evolved it is inherited in the offspring.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">REALITY VS THEORY</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(1) The Points about Archeology</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The science of archeology is far from being complete and no one can claim that the search has been completed under the earth or sea layers. The door is still open for more discoveries that may contradict the theory. Assuming, however, that the findings of this science are completed, this does not establish that &#8220;higher&#8221; forms of life are developed from &#8220;lower&#8221; ones. This is only evidence for organized existence of these beings (in any form) at times when the environment is suitable for that. On the other hand, the archeological studies at the time of Darwin estimated that man&#8217;s life on earth was 600,000 years whereas new archaeological discoveries give an estimate figure of 10 Million years. This is a reflection of the incompleteness of these studies and that this science is still variable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also important to note that there are many &#8220;missing links&#8221; in the so-called &#8220;evolutionary chain&#8221; of Darwin&#8217;s theory. For example there are no archeological data to link animals of &#8220;single cells&#8221; and those of “multiple cells” nor between invertebrate animals and fish or amphibians. The same is true between amphibians and reptiles and between amphibians and birds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(2) The Point About Embryos</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a wrong conclusion made by some scientists because of the less sophisticated microscopy present at Darwin&#8217;s time. Today&#8217;s technology demonstrates that there are fine differences between the structure, build up and organization of animal embryos.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(3) The Point About The Appendix</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The presence of this organ in man does not represent a concrete evidence for the development of man from a &#8220;monkey&#8221;. Rather its presence is inherited from the grand-man who depended upon vegetation as a source of food to help him digest it. In addition, there could be other important functions for the appendix that are not discovered yet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(4) The Point About Natural Selectivity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(a) Elimination &#8220;Factors&#8221; &amp; Life &#8220;Factors&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surely there is a law and discipline that work to eliminate the living creatures, weak as well as strong. Allaah ordained death on every living being. The elimination factors are not the only factors that affect life on this planet. There are &#8220;life factors&#8221; as well, and that there is a discipline of mutual dependency and relationship between the living being and its environment. These &#8220;factors&#8221; represent the true means which Allaah has provided: sun, seas, wind, rain, plants, gravity, etc. All of these means are coordinated to provide survival for man, animals and plants. Considering the &#8220;elimination factors&#8221; alone and disregarding the &#8220;life factors&#8221; is confusion on the part of Darwin&#8217;s theory. When scientists try to formulate theories to explain certain matters in the outside world, they take into account all factors of influence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(b) Natural Selectivity or &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Surely those in support of the theory of evolution like to refer to &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221; as the &#8220;source&#8221; that provides and supports the &#8220;natural selectivity.&#8221; &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221;, however, lacks wisdom, power, self-coordination, will, and knowledge. Natural things such as wind, lightning, water, storms, warmth, severe cold, etc. can cause destruction or deformation. How could these conditions explain the beauty of the creation and its fine course of establishment and coordination? How could the minute elements in the egg of a bird &#8220;know&#8221; that the egg must appear in the form of a bird and thus it has to break its own shell to survive? The One Who had created nature provided all the means for its course of existence and activity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now we see that many who arrogantly deny Allaah&#8217;s existence try to divert the attention of the people to worship this &#8220;new&#8221; deity called &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221;! In many conversations some people are reluctant to say &#8220;God&#8221; when they want to refer to &#8220;supernatural&#8221; phenomena. Instead, they say: &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221; did such and such. They like to look &#8220;normal and advanced&#8221; and not &#8220;strange and backward&#8221; in front of others. The idea of &#8220;how people will look at me,&#8221; overshadows that God (Allaah) is more important than people. It is a reflection of psychological defeat in front of secularism, which itself is the major fruit of Darwin’s theory. It is lack of true faith in the true God, Allaah. A believer in Allaah would not fear saying the Name of his Creator, the Most Merciful, and the Most Compassionate. He knows that those around him will one day die, but Allaah is the Everliving. So, who must count first? He knows that Allaah is the Sustainer and Provider and not the “Chairman of the Boards” nor the “Chief Executives,” managers, or any other boss! This is the benefit of worship of Allaah: A liberation from slavery to anything and (or) anyone but Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(c) &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221; Is Not The &#8220;Creator&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A simple comparison between man and nature illustrates that man can see, hear, know, learn, reason, etc. whereas nature has none of these qualities. How could man then be &#8220;more advanced&#8221; than a &#8220;creator&#8221; known as “Mother Nature?&#8221; This proves the falsehood of the idea of god-Mother Nature. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad) [صلى الله عليه وسلم [2] to mankind): How do you worship besides Allaah something which has no power either to harm or benefit you? But it is Allaah, Who is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 5:76).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In many aspects, nature is under man’s service, and its resource is under his disposal, as Allaah had decreed in the Final Revelation to mankind, the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“See you not (O men) that Allaah has subjected for you whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth, and has perfected His graces upon you (both) apparent [3] and hidden [4]? Yet of mankind is he who disputes about Allaah without knowledge or guidance or a Book giving light.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 31: 20).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With the progress of technology some people became even more arrogant. Not only do they refer to &#8220;Mother Nature&#8221; as the &#8220;founder or creator,&#8221; but aim to control nature itself. It is a strange conclusion! Allaah has made it very clear that there will be this type of people:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The likeness of (this) worldly life is as the rain which We send down from the sky, so by it arises the intermingled produce of the earth of which men and cattle eat until when the earth is clad with its adornments and is beautified, and its people think that they have all powers of disposal over it. Our Command reaches it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday! Thus do We explain the Signs (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, laws, etc.) in detail for people who reflect.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 10: 24).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(d) The &#8220;Laws&#8221; of Nature</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some consider that &#8220;Nature&#8221; represents the &#8220;Laws&#8221; that govern the universe. They try to explain how things occur, but do not answer questions like: Who created this universe? Who put the &#8220;Laws&#8221; into effect? This leaves them separated by an artificial barrier into two &#8220;personalities&#8221;: one that best &#8220;fit&#8221; the society (i.e. the outside) and tries to give &#8220;interpretations&#8221; for what occurs in the universe; and one kept within themselves confessing that God (Allaah) is the One commanding these &#8220;supernatural&#8221; phenomena. But under dangerous circumstances, you hear them calling: “Oh my God!” or “God help me!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the old ages, man knew that rain came down from the sky. Today we know a lot about this process, from the evaporation of water up to the formation of raindrops, there is a reflection of real actions. In their references, scientists do not tell us how did these realities become laws. For example: why are these laws coordinated in ways allowing birds to fly in the air, fishes to live in the water, and man to live on the earth? &#8220;Nature&#8217;s&#8221; qualities are not its own. It has been given the attributes we feel and see around us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The true Creating Power has all the Perfect Attributes and All-Perfect Actions. He is Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad (peace be upon him)): Who is the Lord of the heavens and the earth? Say: &#8220;(It is) Allaah.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Have you then taken (for worship) Auliyâ&#8217; (protectors) other than Him, such as have no power either for benefit or for harm to themselves?&#8221; Say: &#8220;Is the blind equal to the one who sees? Or darkness equal to light? Or do they assign to Allaah partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Allâh is the Creator of all things; He is the One, the Irresistible.</span> (Qur’aan 13: 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The One Who has created (everything), and fashioned it in due order and proportion; Who has measured and granted guidance. </span>(Qur’aan 87: 2-3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“The One who has created the seven heavens one above another, you can see no fault in the creation of the One (Allaah) Whose Mercy encompasses everything. Then look again: “Can you see any rifts?” “Then look again and yet again, your sight will return to you in a state of humiliation and worn out.” </span>(Qur’an 67: 3-4).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah is He Who raised the heavens without any pillars that you see. Then He ascended the ‘Arsh (the Throne in a manner that suits His Majesty). He has subjected the sun and the moon (to continue going round)! Each running (its course) for a term appointed. He regulates all affairs, explaining the Aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) in detail, that you may believe with certainty in the meeting with your Rabb.</span> (Qur’an 13: 2).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“He has created the heavens without any pillars, that you see, and has set on the earth firm mountains, lest it shake with you. And He has scattered therein animals of all kinds. And We send down water (rain) from the sky, and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind you grow therein.”</span> (Qur’an 31: 10).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And indeed We [5] created the heavens and the earth and all between them in six Days and nothing of fatigue touched us [6].”</span> (Qur’an 50: 38).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;"><strong>(e) A God Other Than Allaah!?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In an Address to man, Allaah sends clear and vivid verifications as well as challenges for man and for these &#8220;gods&#8221; that some invoke and worship:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who has made the earth as a fixed abode, and has placed rivers in its midst, and has placed firm mountains therein, and has set a barrier between the two seas (of salt and sweet water). Is there any god with Allaah? Nay, but most of them know not.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 27: 61).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sends down for you water (rain) from the sky whereby We cause to grow gardens full of beauty and delight. It is not in your power to cause the growth of their trees. Is there any god with Allaah? Nay, but they are a people who ascribe equals (to Him)!”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 27: 60).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who guides you in the darkness of the land and sea, and Who sends the winds as heralds of glad tidings, going before His Mercy (Rain)? Is there any god with Allaah? High Exalted be Allaah from all that they ascribe as partner (to Him)!”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 27: 63).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Is not He (better than your gods) Who originates creation, then repeats it, and Who gives you sustenance from heaven and earth? Is there any god with Allaah? Say, &#8220;Bring forth your proofs, if you are truthful.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 27: 64).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (to the disbelievers): &#8220;Tell me, if Allaah took away your hearing and your sight, and sealed up your hearts, who is there-an &#8220;ilah&#8221; (a god) other than Allaah could restore them to you? Look, how variously We explain the Signs, yet they turn aside.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 6: 46).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many in this world have turned to worship many created things or beings. Divine attributes has been given to Buddha, ‘Eesa (Jesus), Saints, Monks, Musa (Moses), Prophets, Places, Rivers, Cows, Temples, etc., Do these &#8220;gods&#8221; benefit or harm?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And they worship besides Allaah things that hurt them not, nor profit them and they say: &#8220;These are our intercessors with Allaah.&#8221; Say: &#8220;Do you indeed inform Allaah with that which He knows not, in the heavens or on earth? Far is He removed from every imperfection! And far is He above all that which they associate as partners with Him!”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 10: 18).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Where did they find &#8220;Names&#8221; for them?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“You do not worship besides Him but only names which you have forged, you and your fathers, for which Allaah has sent down no authority. The command is for none but Allaah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him, that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 12: 40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Where are the things they have created?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“This is the creation of Allaah. So show me that which those (whom you worship) beside Him have created. Nay but the wrong-doers (and those who do not submit to Allaah) are in plain error.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 31: 11).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8216;Tell me or inform me (what) do you think about your (so-called) partner-gods to whom you call upon besides Allaah, show me, what they have created of the earth? Or have they any share in the heavens? Or have We given them a Book, so that they act on clear proof therefrom?&#8217; Nay, the wrong-doers (and those who do not believe in Allaah) promise one another nothing but delusions.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 35: 40).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In fact they are unable to create even a fly:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily! Those on whom you call besides Allaah, cannot create (even) a fly, even though they combine together for the purpose. And if the fly snatched away a thing from them, they would have no power to release it from the fly. So weak are (both) the seeker and the sought.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 22: 73).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They themselves are created, aren&#8217;t they?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Attribute they as partners to Allaah those who created nothing? But they themselves are created.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 191).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They cannot even help themselves!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“No help can they give them, nor can they help themselves.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 192).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): ‘Have you then taken (for worship) protectors other than Him, such as no power either for benef) it or for harm to themselves?’ Say: ‘Is the blind equal with the one who sees? Or darkness equal with light? Or do they assign to Allaah partners who created the like of His creation, so that the creation (which they made and His creation) seemed alike to them.’ Say: Allaah is the Creator of All things. He is the One, the Irresistible.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 13: 16).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They cannot answer those who invoke upon them!</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“So call upon them and let them answer you if you are truthful.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 194).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above proofs are sent down from Allaah to bring people to their senses. This is a Mercy and Kindness from Allaah for mankind. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah Is the One Who sends down manifest Aayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations etc.) to His slave (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) that He may bring you out from darkness into light. And verily, Allaah is to you Full of Kindness, Most Merciful.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 57: 9).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(6) The Point About &#8220;Sexual Selection&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The survival of the strongest is not evidence for selective developmental evolution. The only thing that can be understood about the mating tendencies is that they will maintain continuity in the same strong kind and an end to the weak kind. Thus:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The muscles of a strong athlete will not be inherited in his offspring.<br />
(ii) The mind of a high quality scholar will not be transferred to his children by inheritance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying that newly acquired characteristics can be inherited is rejected by modern genetic studies as well as known facts. Any quality that is not an intrinsic part of the genome is &#8220;temporal&#8221; and is not transmitted to the offspring by inheritance: Muslims circumcise their babies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their children are not born circumcised!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>(7) &#8220;Under-developed Theory&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have not seen (or heard about) certain types of animals coming to existence through the process of developmental transformation. There was no monkey transformed into a man even after hundred years or so!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The nose of a dog is more sensitive in its smelling function than that of man. Is the nose of the dog more &#8220;advanced&#8221; than that of man? Or are the birds (with flying abilities) and frogs (with amphibian abilities) more &#8220;developed&#8221; than man? The eye of the camel and that of the horse or donkey can see during day and night, is it true then that these animals represent more &#8220;advanced&#8221; forms than man?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The male man, like the male elephant, has breast marks while horses and male donkeys do not (except some resemblance to whatever their respective mothers were). So, why does the male man continue to possess this feature while it was not present in some &#8220;lower&#8221; beings?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scientists have called Darwin&#8217;s study a &#8220;Theory&#8221; and clearly there is always a difference between theory and reality. A theory by definition is falsifiable.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCES</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The idea of &#8220;selection for the strong&#8221; had a tremendous influence on humanity. It made it easy for some strong men and strong nations to think and feel that they are strong and superior because of an &#8220;evolutionary selective process.&#8221; They feel that they are entitled to certain practices of domination according to the idea &#8220;survival is for the best!&#8221; This is well manifested in the colonial expansions, racism, and in many practices by many of the so-called &#8220;democratic nations&#8221; who practice the principle of supremacy: &#8220;Might is Right.&#8221; The idea of &#8220;development&#8221; interprets life as a &#8220;constant struggle between living beings and that the survival is only for the one that best fits the environment around it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality this environment is a materialistic one and it dictates the type of development, its size, and its direction in an imposed way leaving no role for the living being. This idea is very well used in our times to support the materialistic life of the modern world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Materialism is imposed in a way as an integral part for &#8220;development.&#8221; In the name of &#8220;development&#8221; today&#8217;s &#8220;secondary&#8221; things for your home are becoming the &#8220;necessary&#8221; items of tomorrow and if you don&#8217;t buy them you are going to &#8220;look different,&#8221; &#8220;rejected&#8221; and a &#8220;drop out&#8221; because you do not &#8220;fit&#8221; the environment around you. Just look around and see the many thousands of things that were &#8220;secondary&#8221; a year ago and became &#8220;essential&#8221; a year later! Open a woman’s dresser today and see the latest &#8220;fashion&#8221; dresses and shoes. Come next month and you find &#8220;new&#8221; ones. She has to &#8220;fit&#8221; into the &#8220;environment&#8221; around her. Men are also influenced with this &#8220;fit the environment&#8221; concept. Who is doing this to the World? Many are those who contribute to this problem. They come from “big businesses”, media sectors, politicians, military establishments, academia, ‘the world of fashions’, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of progress, many people are influenced by the materialistic environment and are driven away from Allaah, their Creator. On the other hand, many are discovering the truth regarding the very essence of the purpose of existence. They are finding true, satisfactory and beneficial life in the code of life which their Creator has described in the final revelation to man: the Noble Qur’an. They came to know the beauty and reality of the following verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say: (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): “Truly, my prayer, my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allaah, the Rabb [the Creator, the Owner, and the One Who Commands and Administers everything] of the ‘Aalameen [all that exists].”</span> (Qur’an 6: 162).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Why Did The &#8220;Theory” Spread?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The theory came at a critical moment in the conflict between the church and many of its corrupted doctrines on one hand and the secular sector (especially scientists) in the 19th century Europe, on the other hand. During this conflict many scientists were killed and/or persecuted. This theory was one of the weapons that were raised by the scientists in their fight with the religious authorities in and outside Europe. It was presented as &#8220;The Scientific&#8221; reference of the mind. It was introduced in the education programs of most of the colonized countries as &#8220;Scientific Knowledge&#8221; to support its acceptance. Many colonized Muslim countries were targeted and this caused a great deal of negative influence on many generations, especially with the victory of the secular-scientific thoughts in Europe over the church-made laws. This played a role in the spread of secular thoughts in many parts of the world. For many it helped promote a stand against church oppression, and when it served its purpose it was transformed to serve the purpose of influence and secularism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most people had no idea about the theory itself and/or the its concept of &#8220;selectivity&#8221; that was used as a “pretext of justification” for colonization, reflecting the prejudice of “being better” than those “weak ones” from the “other” world communities.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE QUR&#8217;AN AND THE &#8220;THEORY&#8221;</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Allaah, the Most High, tells us about any matter, it comes from the One Who is All-Knowing. Whatever man knows is nothing compared to what Allaah, the Exalted, Knows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah knows and you know not.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 216).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Should He not Know, what He created? And He is the Most Kind and Courteous (to His slaves) All-Aware (of everything).”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 67: 14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why do people question their origin when they did not witness its creation? This is result of secular reasoning. Without the reality of creation, there is no purpose for man&#8217;s existence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“I called them not to witness (nor took their help in) the creation of the heavens and the earth, nor (even) their own creation.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 18: 51).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever Allaah decrees in relevance to man&#8217;s creation is different from &#8220;theories&#8221;! Allaah, the AllKnowing, tells us that He informed the Angels about the creation of Adam before it happened:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And (remember) when your Rabb said to the angels: Verily, I am going to place (mankind) generations after generations on earth.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 30).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, Most High, told us about the kind of material from which Adam was created: dust and water, and the offspring of Adam from sperm:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“O mankind! If you are in doubt about the Resurrection, then verily! We have created you from dust (i.e. Adam) then from a Nutfah (mixed drops of male and female sexual discharges i.e. offspring of Adam) then from a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood) then from a little lump of flesh, some formed and some unformed (miscarriage) that We may make (it) clear for you (to show our Power and Ability to do what We will). And We cause whom We will to remain in the wombs for an appointed term, then we bring you out as infants [7], then (give you growth) that you may reach your age of full strength. And among you there is he who dies (young), and among you there is he who is brought back to the miserable old age, so that he knows nothing after having known.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 22: 5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“He is the One Who has created you from clay and then decreed a stated term (for you to die).”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 6: 2).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah shaped Adam by His own Hands [8]:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah said:&#8221;O! Iblees (Devil) what prevents you from prostrating yourself to one whom I have created with both My Hands.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 38: 75).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Muhammad-صلى الله عليه وسلم) also informed us that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“When Allaah created Adam from a Handful from all of the earth (material), the children of Adam came just like the earth: amongst them the red, the white and the black and those who are in between; the easy and the sad; the evil ones and the good ones.&#8221;</span> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah then changed this clay into “sounding clay:”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“He created man (Adam) from a sounding clay like the clay of pottery.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 55: 14).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Exalted and Magnificent, breathed into this clay a created and honored soul and life came into Adam and he became Adam that can hear, see, talk and think:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“So, when I have fashioned him (in due proportion) and breathed into him his soul created by Me, then you (angels) fall down prostrating to him.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 15: 29).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Right after Adam&#8217;s creation he started to speak:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And He taught Adam the names (of everything); then He showed them to the angels and said &#8216;Tell Me the names of these if you are truthful.&#8217; They (angels) said: &#8216;Far is You (Allaah) removed from every imperfection, we have no knowledge except what you have taught us. Verily, it is You, the AllKnower, the All-Wise. He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names&#8230;”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 31-32).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even the first woman was created from the first man, Adam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“O mankind! Be dutiful to your Rabb, Who created you from a single soul (Adam) and from him (Adam) He created his wife, and from them both He created many men and women..”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 1).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the creation of Adam, Allaah commanded angels to prostrate to Adam; all of them obeyed. This is a great Honor to Adam. Iblees (the Devil) refused out of arrogance:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And (remember) when We said to the angels: &#8220;Prostrate to Adam.&#8221; So they prostrated except Iblees (the Devil). He was of the Jinns10; he disobeyed the Command of His Rabb.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 18: 50).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah expelled him from His Mercy, and warned Adam against him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Will you then take him (Iblees) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you? What an evil is the exchange for the wrong-doers (and polytheists).”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 18: 50).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE TEST</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Both Adam and his wife were tested in Paradise. They were allowed to eat from all the fruits of Paradise. They were ordered, however, to stay away from a particular tree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And We said: O Adam! Dwell you and your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you freely with pleasure and delight of things therein as wherever you will, but come not near this tree or you both will be of the wrong-doers.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 35).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They disobeyed Allaah by eating from it and Allaah sent them down to earth to live with their posterity, that He may test their obedience and submission to Him. Certainly they repented and Allaah, Oftforgiving, accepted their repentance. The status of the children of Adam is above that of monkeys or lizards:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And indeed We have honored the children of Adam, and We have carried them on land and sea and have provided them with At-Tayyibat (lawful good things), and have preferred them above many of those whom We have created with a marked preference.”</span> (Qur&#8217;an 17: 70).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the true origin of man: an honored being above that of a cockroach or a mouse! The response of man must be that of thanks to his Creator, Allaah, manifesting itself in true submission and obedience to Him. This is the meaning of Islam. It is the religion of man since Adam, peace be upon him and it is the same religion of Noah, Ibraaheem (Abraham), Musa (Moses), ‘Eesa (Jesus) peace be upon them all. It is manifested in its final, completed, and preserved form in the Qur&#8217;an that was revealed to Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم. It calls man to dissociate himself from any form of worship to other than his Creator, Allaah<a href="http://AbdurRahman.org/">.</a></p>

<span style="color:#808080;"> Saleh As-Saleh</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1]Charles Robert Darwin (1809-1882).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] The Arabic inscript صلى الله عليه وسلم is an invocation recited after the name of the Prophet Muhammad is stated. It reads: Sallaa Allaahu ‘Aleihi Wasallam, which means: May Allaah Praise his mention and safeguard him from every imperfection and from all kinds of evil.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] i.e. Islamic Monotheism, the lawful pleasures of this world, including health, good looks, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] i.e. One&#8217;s faith in Allaah, knowledge, wisdom, guidance for doing righteous deeds, and also the pleasures and delights of the Hereafter in Paradise, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5]The “We” refers to Allaah Himself. It is common with Semitic languages for any monarch to use the “We” and “Us” when referring to himself. And to Allaah belongs the best example. He Glorifies Himself as suits His Majesty. When Allaah says: “We” or “Us,” no one who is familiar with the Arabic lexicology understands that this refers to “more than one God united in one!” Allaah is One and Unique and all of His Attributes describe His Essence, not qualities of separate “gods”! He is the Most Merciful, the Provider, the Creator, the Oft-Forgiving, the Originator, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] The authenticity of the contents of any book, which describes Allaah with imperfect Attributes, is questionable. Allaah acts, originates, creates, and does what He wants such that neither tiredness nor slumber or sleep overtakes Him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Neither slumber, nor sleep overtakes Him. (Qur’an 2:255)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Prophet Muhammad, may Allaah exalt his mention and render him safe from every imperfection, said: &#8220;(As regards your creation), every one of you is collected in the womb of his mother for the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for another forty days, and then a piece of flesh for another forty days. Then Allaah sends an angel to write four words: He writes his deeds, time of his death, means of his livelihood, and whether he will be wretched or blessed (in the Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into his body&#8230;&#8221;(Collected in Saheeh Al-Bukhari which contains the most authentic traditions of the Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم (vol. 4, hadeeth # 549). The texts are published by Dar-Arabia (Beirut, Lebanon) in English and Arabic. This narration came from Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم who was un-lettered. These early stages of growth of the human body were known only approx.1400 years after the Prophet&#8217;s explanation. These statements, together with other prophecies by the Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم is a testimony that a) he was a true messenger of Allaah and b) the Qur&#8217;an he was trusted with is a true Revelation from Allaah. Those searching for the truth can find in the Qur&#8217;an their objective if they are sincere in their strive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] All of the Attributes of Allaah are real and true. He informed us about Himself and about His Attributes. He speaks only the truth. In all of His Attributes He is perfect and distinct from His creation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And nothing is like unto Him. He is the All-Hearer AllSeer.” ( Qur&#8217;an 42: 11).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Related by the scholars of Hadeeth: Al-Tirmithee and Abu Dawood and Al-Hakim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Jinns are beings created with free will, living on earth in a world parallel to that of man, and are invisible to human eyes in their normal state. The term &#8220;Jinnee&#8221; (English: Genie) is equivalent to Jinn, and Jaann may be used as its plural or as another singular form. In Islamic literature, Shaytaan (English: Satan, Devil) is a name given to disbelieving Jinns. Amongst them are the believers and non-believers.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">بسم االله الرحمن الرحيم</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. I begin to write</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE innate nature (<em>Fitrah</em>)</strong> in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognises that the attributes of God (Allah) must be true, unique, and all-perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes, nor does it relax towards attributing human-like qualities to the Creator. Many who became &#8220;<em>discontent with God</em>&#8221; did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of claims such as &#8220;<em>God dwells in a son</em>&#8221; and that &#8220;<em>everyone is born with an original sin</em>&#8220;. They “<em>escaped</em>&#8221; into worshipping a new thing called &#8220;<em>mother nature</em>.” With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different &#8220;religions&#8221; adopted the concept of &#8220;<em>forget God</em>&#8221; and &#8220;<em>let us live this life and enjoy it</em>.&#8221; They revived the old “god&#8221; of Rome, the &#8220;<em>god of desire</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Today</strong> we can see that all of this materialistic progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who &#8216;<em>fled</em>&#8221; their religions  are in search again. Some try to &#8220;<em>escape</em>&#8221; the complexity of their daily lives through various means. Those who examined the Qur&#8217;an and Islam found a complete code for life that requires man to fulfil the purpose of his existence on earth. Allah does not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other men or women, desire, or sex. This holds true for Muslims and non-Muslims as well. He gives the proofs that He Alone is the One Who can deliver man to free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator Alone. He is the <strong>First</strong>, nothing before Him. He is the <strong>Last</strong>, everything ends except Him. He is <strong>Most High</strong>, nothing above Him. He is <strong>Most Near</strong>, nothing is beyond His reach. <strong>He does not beget</strong>, <strong>nor is He begotten</strong>. He is the Lord of Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, the Praise and Mercy of Allah be upon them all.  To Him Alone man must submit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Mankind</strong> must know about the purpose of their existence on earth; their responsibility towards their Creator and what they must do in preparation for the Day on which they will return to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Saleh As-Saleh</em></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE PURPOSE AND THE RETURN</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ALLAH</strong> created man and man belongs to Him. He (سبحانه و تعالى) ordained that one day man shall die and return to Him. This world is a transitional period. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) wanted man to shape his life according to what He (سبحانه و تعالى) had decreed. This is the meaning of worship. Worship requires absolute obedience, humility and love for Allah, Who promised an Eternal life in Paradise for those who obey and worship Him alone, and an Eternal abode in Hell for those who reject Him and His orders:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“So those who believed (in the Oneness of Allah) and did righteous deeds will be in Gardens of Delight (al-Jannah, Paradise).”</strong></span> (Qur’an 22: 56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“But those who disbelieve and belie Our Ayaat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) such are the dwellers of the Fire, they shall abide therein forever.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 39)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man&#8217;s life at home, as a farmer, a car-dealer, an electrician, a computer consultant, a president, a company’s C.E., a spouse, etc., has to abide by a way of life according to the guidelines Revealed by Allah. He is the one who defined what is good and what is bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He stated that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever works righteousness, whether male or female, while he (or she) is a true believer (in the Oneness &amp; Uniqueness of Allah), verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e., AlJannah).”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 16: 97)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Revelation contains all the details about what is good and bad. It is not left for the limited nature of man to define what is good and what is bad:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur&#8217;an) as an exposition of every thing and a guidance, Mercy, and glad tidings for those who have surrendered (to Allah as Muslims).”</strong></span> (Qur’an 16: 89)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The command is for none but Allah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him (i.e. Pure Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 12: 40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah made it clear that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whosoever does righteous good deed it is for (the benefit of) his own self, and whosoever does evil, it is against his own self, and Your Rabb (Lord) is not at all unjust to (His) slaves.”</strong> </span>(Qur&#8217;an 41: 46)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Greatest good is achieved when the believer fulfils the role prescribed for him by his Creator, Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And I (Allah) created not the Jinns and men except they should worship Me (Alone).”</span></strong> (Qur’an 51:56)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Message of Islam fits the Fitrah in man. Allah created man in the best form. He (سبحانه و تعالى) gave this Fitrah the ability to believe in the Unseen. The animal lives within the framework of his senses while man can relate to a broader scheme amongst which is the ability to believe in the Unseen. Thus man&#8217;s soul and its horizon are broader and more open than that of animals. Man knows that the electric current is composed of small particles known as electrons. While we are unable to see these particles, their effects could be seen on an instrument known as the oscilloscope in the form of electron waves. In Nature and in ourselves we can see the Signs of Allah everywhere and we must relate, therefore, to the Creator in the perfect way He has chosen. This is His right upon us: to worship Him Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) asked his companion Mu‘adh ibn Jabal:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Mu’adh! Do you know what is due to Allah from His lbaad (the created beings) and what is due them? I responded: &#8220;Allah and His messenger know best.” He continued: &#8220;What is due to Allah from His Ibaad is to worship Him alone and never associate any other being with Him. What is due to them is not to punish any person who does not associate anyone (or anything) with Him.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man, through the faculties that Allah has bestowed upon him, can relate to the unseen atom with its unseen electronic &#8220;shells&#8221; that build up its characteristics. Man can also relate through his Fitrah to his Creator. The Fitrah recognizes the Attributes of the true God and His Signs in the creation although it is unable to see Allah in this life. One can then easily understand that the greatest reward Allah had given to the believers is the actual seeing of Himself on the Day of Judgement. Knowing Allah in His Names and His Attributes drives man to fulfil the purpose for his presence on earth as stated in the above verse and in Allah&#8217;s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The command is for none but Allah. He has commanded that you worship none but Him (i.e. Pure Monotheism), that is the (true) straight religion, but most men know not.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 12: 40)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Attributes and His Signs in His Creation testify for His Oneness and that He is the Only True God who deserves to be worshipped. The rejecting man underestimates His Lord. He may reject any worship to Allah or turn to worship other than Allah. Amongst the rejectionists, there are those who think that this Universe has founded itself or it came to exist by co-incidence. This necessitates that man &#8220;has no goal to fulfil,&#8221; because he came into being without a defined goal! Consequently, a moral or a value system becomes meaningless. Accordingly, man is just a responding &#8220;tool&#8221; for &#8220;mother nature&#8221; which, according to Darwin himself, &#8220;acts haphazardly&#8221;! This way of thinking is aimlessness, and it occurs when man does not recognize his relation with the One who has created life and death, the Universe and everything around man, all in due proportion:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Indeed Allah has set a measure for all things.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 65: 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who reject man’s need to His Creator, Allah, are the aimless ones. Allah refers to them in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They have hearts (minds) wherewith they understand not, they have eyes wherewith they see not, and they have ears wherewith they hear not (the Truth). They, are like cattle, nay even more astray; those! They are the heedless ones.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 7: 179)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">CREATION IS IN NEED OF ALLAH</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man always looks for what benefits him and what protects him from harm. However, to accomplish this, man must be able to realize what is harmful. He must then know whom he should need, trust, and love so that he can attain what is beneficial as well as feel good about his choice. He also must know the proper and good approach that would make him achieve this goal. This latter condition requires that man:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) Know about harm<br />
b) What ways can be used to drive harm away</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly, man can have no better guidance than that which comes from the One Who has perfected everything, and the One who Has No deficiency in Himself nor in His Attributes. The One Who is Ever-Living and who does not die. There can be no One better than the One Who Has no need for anything; the One Who is Rich; the Giver, the One Who, after all, controls man&#8217;s soul, and runs all affairs. Man is so poor to Him. He is Allah, the True and only God. Man can bring harm to himself if he seeks other than Allah for help. Allah is the One Who can help man drive away any harm for it cannot occur without His Will and His Power.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) sent down His Books and chose His Messengers to guide man to:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) Know His Lord as He (سبحانه و تعالى) has explained about Himself, and<br />
b) Seek Him Alone while living in accordance with His plan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes liberates man from worshipping any form of creation because creation is weak and imperfect and is in need of the Creator, Allah. The knowledge about Allah leads man to know that he is created to live according to Allah&#8217;s way as revealed to the last Messenger, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم). This Revelation contains a complete code of life. Everything that is beneficial or harmful is established so that man can focus his life around this Revelation. If man commits wrong and knows that Allah is Oft-Forgiving he would turn to Him and to Him Alone seeking His forgiveness:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Know, therefore, that there is no God who deserves to be worshipped except Allah; and ask forgiveness for your sins.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 47:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is wrong to think or believe that Allah created other “gods” besides Him so that man turns to them for help, loves them or fear them, etc. He is the same God of all nations. He does not order that people should make of stars, sun, fire, Jesus, Moses, etc. gods besides Him. He (Most Exalted) cannot be &#8220;contradictory.&#8221; He has one way (religion) that calls man to surrender his will only to Him. He (سبحانه و تعالى) warned that if man, even Muhammad-صلى الله عليه وسلم and any Prophet or Messenger, would take partners with Him, then his work will fail and he will be among the losers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And verily, it had been revealed to you (O Muhammad) as has been revealed to those before you: If you join others in worship with Allah (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain and you certainly be among the losers. Nay! But worship Allah and be among the grateful.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 39: 65-66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us think what Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), the man-Prophet, who knew Allah best, used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O Allah, I seek refuge in You for Your Pleasure and against Your Wrath, and in Your Forgiveness and against Your Punishment and in You from You, I cannot Praise You as You can Praise Yourself.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I have surrendered myself to You, I have directed my face to You, I have entrusted my affairs to You, I have compelled my back to refuge in You, in want and in fright of You, there is no resort nor survival from You except (in turning) to You, I have faith in your Book (i.e., the Qur&#8217;an) which You brought down and in the Prophet (Muhammad) you have sent.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When we read in the Qur&#8217;an that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whatever of Mercy (i.e., of good), Allah may grant to mankind, none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can grant it thereafter. And He is the All Mighty, the All-Wise”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 35:2),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and when we read:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;If Allah touches you with hurt, there is none who can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His favour which He causes it to reach whomsoever of His slaves He will, and He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 10: 107),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">we should be motivated to return to Him Alone at times of ease and at times of hardship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when we read that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“If Allah helps you none can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, who is there, after Him, that can help you? And in Allah (alone) let believers put their trust”</strong> </span>(Qur’an 3:160)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an, therefore, leads man to a true liberation from any false attachment. It brings peace to the heart. It helps the believer against hypocrisy and all forms of dishonesty. Imagine, for example, a believer facing a problem at work. He sees wrong and faces unlawful practices. He does not fear rejecting what is wrong. He knows that the job is only a mean to gain his sustenance. While he may be unable to correct what is wrong, he knows well that Allah is the One Who provides. If he leaves his job for the sake of Allah, Allah will give him a better one:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him. He will make a way for him to get out (from) every (difficulty), and He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 65: 2-3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above necessitates that man must depend upon Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) asking Him Alone for assistance. It also requires that man must love Allah and worship Him alone to gain His pleasure and His help. Is it not true that the people who consider this life as the &#8220;Final Goal&#8221; end up worshipping many things in it? You see them so careful about &#8220;having it all.&#8221; They torture themselves: pain; difficulty; constant worry; keeping their hands in the banks for loan after loan to keep up with the &#8220;demands&#8221; of development.&#8221; They are under the constant threat of fore-closure. They constantly see poverty in front of their eyes. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) says: Son of Adam: fill your time with My worship and I will fill your heart with richness, and end off your poverty. But if you do not, I would make your hands fully busy (i.e., in worldly affairs) and I would not end off your poverty.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our purpose of existence on earth is more meaningful than being slaves to worldly gains. There can be no meaningful life better than that prescribed by our Creator Allah. Every act done according to Allah&#8217;s way is an act of worship. Man is the beneficiary and Allah is in no need:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allah, but Allah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of All Praise.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 35: 15)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE MODERN CIVILIZATION</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We can pray to God yet live life as we like”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people think that: to live an Islamic life is &#8216;restrictive&#8217;! Islam, however, is the medium code of life. It recognizes that within the Fitrah there are motivations that influence man&#8217;s role on earth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• a drive to eat,<br />
• a drive to drink,<br />
• a drive to have a home,<br />
• a drive for sex,<br />
• a drive for ownership,<br />
• a drive for success, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without control, all of these legitimate motives could be very dangerous. What constitutes a perfect control is the discipline that gives an organised manifestation for these motivations without totally abolishing them or becoming enslaved to them. Islam deals with this Fitrah by providing a Divine Discipline that elevates man above animals. Man lacks perfect knowledge as well as perfect wisdom. Therefore, he is unable to provide a perfect way of life. Allah, Most Perfect in His Wisdom and Knowledge perfected a course of life and set limitations and rules all of which are beneficial to man:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“These are the limits (set) by Allah, so approach them not.”</strong> </span>(Qur’an 2: 187)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“These are the limits set by Allah, so do not transgress them.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 2: 229)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why Islam does not condone celibacy because it is against the Fitrah. The fo llowing incident describes the Islamic stand towards life:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Anas (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that some of the companions of Allah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) asked his (the Prophet&#8217;s) wives about the acts that he performed in private. Someone among them (among the companions) said: I will- not marry women; someone among them said&#8230; 1 will not eat meat (and fast all day); and someone among them said: 1 will not lie down in bed (and stand in prayer all night). He (the Prophet-صلى الله عليه وسلم) praised Allah and glorified him and said: What has happened to these people that they say so and so, whereas I observe prayer and sleep too; I observe fast and suspend observing them; I marry women also? And he who turns from my Sunnah (way), he has no relation with me.]&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam does not condone the surrender to lust as it is the case in this contemporary &#8220;civilization&#8221;! Islam recognises the natural inclination of man towards the love of women, children, gold, silver, possessions, etc. Such inclination is essential to drive man towards settlement and civilization:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;It Is He who had brought you forth from the earth and settled you therein.&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur’an 11: 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Beautified for men is the love of things they covet: women, children, much of gold and silver (wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. This is the pleasure of the present world&#8217;s life; but Allah has the excellent Return (Paradise with flowing rivers. etc.)”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 3: 14)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These inclinations are not the objective! They are to be taken in a balanced way. The way to deal with them is real, and Allah gives a detailed description of the balanced approach that gives man a perfectly balanced pleasure in this life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The use of the word &#8220;restrictive&#8221; comes from those who think that they live a &#8220;free&#8221; life. They accept many man-made restrictive rules that affect every aspect of our lives, although these rules are not perfect because man is imperfect. Man accepts these rules thinking that they benefit him. If the reward is high and the Benefit is eternal, should not man accept what is high and leave what is low? There is no sense in accepting what is lower!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower?”</strong> </span>(Qur’an 2: 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There are much more profits and booties with Allah.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 4: 94)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“You desire the good of this world, but Allah desires (for you) the Hereafter. And Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.”</strong> </span>(Qur’an 8: 67)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This worldly life has good things in it. They are, however, perishable. Allah, The AllWise, organised the way to achieve what is good without transgressing and/or oppressing others. Capitalism allows ownership without limits. This produces political, social, and economical injustice, as is evident in Capitalist countries. On the other hand the failed communism suppressed the inclination of man towards private ownership.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam responds in a perfectly balanced way when it deals with the human soul. As stated in the above verse (Qur&#8217;an 3:14), it is normal for man to love money, gold and silver, women, etc. The challenge, however, is to take a medium and just course in dealing with this love.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam prohibits usury, monopoly, compulsion, theft, robbery, hoarding gold and silver, luxurious spending, conceitedness (if wealthy). On the other hand Allah ordained a fixed annual charity that limits inflation and provides a sharing process for the poor. Also He decreed a medium course of spending. All of these represent control mechanisms to prevent social, political and economical injustice. Have we thought about the fact that usury (in the form of interests on loans) holds people as well as nations under the siege of the banks and multinational financial institutions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of “modern freedom,” men and women are easily driven by their lusts to &#8220;enjoy&#8221; a sexual &#8220;affair&#8221;. Nowadays, man knows that the consequences are harmful. Allah had provided man with a control mechanism for his sexual desires, in the form of legal marriage to more than one woman. He (سبحانه و تعالى) made of this mechanism a legal and a moral binding process to protect women. It is not an affair! It is a very real and medium course for those who are able to support more than one house, and for those who have strong sexual desires. It is very realistic. It is done in the open and not in motels, hotels, or private apartments such that when the woman gets pregnant the man takes a flight saying, “Bye, Bye honey!” The craze for lust is affecting the life of others! AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases are just some examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Man accepts the accountability principle laid down by his boss in a company. There are man-made restrictions on flights and on the use of many instruments. Man thinks they are there to protect him. In part this may be true, but how about the guidelines that are set by Allah to save the whole living of man? Such guidelines come from the One who is Perfect, not man who is imperfect! The “freedom” that leads a person to an eternal destruction in a Confined Place called Hell is the utmost restriction. The true freedom of man is that which builds a civilization that has a Divine value system and in which man submits to His Creator Alone. A civilization that reacts with the life of this world and links it to the Day of Return. On that Day everyone will be held accountable in front of the One Who is All-Just, All-Wise, All-Merciful, Sever in Punishment, and OftForgiving, Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“It is He Who has made the earth subservient to you (i.e., easy for you to walk to live and to do agriculture in it, so walk in the paths thereof and eat of His provision and to Him will be the Resurrection (of the dead).”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 67: 15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above verse there is a reminder for man that, while searching for his sustenance, he must abide by what Allah had decreed. Consequently, there is accountability, either reward or punishment. This calls for responsibility and not “restriction”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another reminder on the road to build the responsible society:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“But seek, with that (wealth) which Allah has bestowed on you the Home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of legal enjoyment in this world and do good as Allah has been good to you and seek not mischief in the land. Verily Allah likes not the mischief-doers.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 28: 77)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Civilization is not only professional progress in materialistic forms. Although this is required, it has to comply with the moral system as prescribed by the Creator to have a meaningful outcome. Otherwise this progress will bring man&#8217;s own destruction by promoting an attachment to desires as well as a power struggle to control the world&#8217;s resources. This is best explained in the verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O mankind! We have created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that you may know one another. Verily, the most honourable of you in the sight of Allah is that (believer) who is best in religion and best in good deeds. Verily Allah is All-Knowing. All-Aware.”</strong></span> (Qur’an 49: 13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who live according to Allah&#8217;s way will be the best in His sight. Those are the truly successful ones who can build a true civilization. The following Ayah illustrates some beautiful aspects of this civilization:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O you who believe! Enter not houses other than your own, until you have asked permission and greeted those in them, that is better for you, in order that you may remember. And if you find no one therein, still, enter not until permission has been given. And if you are asked to go back, go back, for it is purer for you, and Allah is Knower of what you do. There is no sin for you that you enter (without taking permission) houses uninhabited (i.e., not possessed by anybody) (when) you have any interest in them. And Allah has knowledge of what you reveal and what you conceal. Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and protect their private parts from sins. That is purer for them. Verily Allah is aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts, etc.)”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 24:27-31)</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">The Way Out</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The modern civilization has influenced many parts of the world. It attracted many people through its materialistic progress. In this civilization acts like dedication, honesty, honouring an appointment, respecting the rights of others, are not purely done for the sake of Allah, but for the sake of interest. Such features are limited within the frame work of social interactions. This mostly exists in the so called &#8220;pragmatic&#8221; or the &#8220;freeworld civilization&#8221;. When carefully examined, it is a narrow-minded, self-oriented, and eventually self-destructive approach. In the modem civilization, one hand is extended to shake with, while the other is ready to intervene when there are &#8220;conflicting&#8221; interests. Because of the actual worship of self-interests, people of this &#8220;civilization&#8221; must deal &#8220;nicely&#8221; with each other so as to minimise &#8220;friction.&#8221; There is a continuous &#8220;lubrication&#8221; of this system to keep it running with the least possible friction. But when it comes to people who are not part of the &#8220;free-world,&#8221; intervention, rather than &#8220;lubrication,&#8221; takes place under the banner of &#8220;Global Interests,&#8221; &#8220;Humanitarian Aid,&#8221; or &#8220;World Order&#8221;! The recent position towards systematic killings of Muslims in Bosnia is a vivid manifestation of this real nature of modem civilization. Compare the position towards Bosnia with the quick response and intervention for the sake of &#8220;interests&#8221; in other parts of the World. When it comes to politics, there is rarely any moral binding. Lying, cheating, and dishonouring the rights of others are practiced in the name of National Interests!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the economical front, the usury (interest system) is an open rip off that unlawfully uses people&#8217;s money making some rich and others poor. Every possible mean is used to advertize products regardless of their benefit. On the issue of sex, there is chaos never like it in history. The family structure is in disarray. Divorce rates are soaring. Teenagers are depressed. Many take antidepressant drugs on the job! The wide-spread psychology clinics on street corners of “effluent” suburbs is an evidence of complex social living. Suicide amongst the youth is alarming. Many people resort to take dogs or cats as &#8220;honest friends.&#8221; The market of drugs is depleting people&#8217;s money and health. AIDS is a direct response to arrogance against the natural and morally abiding decrees regarding sexual needs as set by the Creator. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Sins didn’t spread in any particular nation until they openly conduct it and as a result plague and other illnesses that were not present among their predecessors became widespread amongst them.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Cancer could have been a sufficient warning to reflect upon our estimate of Allah and His Attributes. However, the arrogance and disregard of Allah produced a &#8220;worship&#8221; of lust and brought what is worse than cancer. Could people stop neglecting to think about the purpose of life before more evil appears?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Evil (sins and disobedience of Allah, etc.) has appeared on land and sea because of what the hands of man have earned (by oppression and evil deeds, etc.), that (Allah) may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return (by repenting to Allah, and begging His Pardon).”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 30: 41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when man forgets Allah and His reminders:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“So, when they forgot that (the warning) which they had been reminded, We opened to them the gates of every (pleasant) thing, until in the midst of their enjoyment in that which they were given, all of a sudden, We took them to punishment, and lo! they were plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.”</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 6: 44).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For those who &#8216;worship&#8217; technology and who arrogantly think that they are building all powers of disposal over the earth, a reminder from Allah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>”Verily, the likeness of (this) worldly life is as the rain which We send down from the sky, so by it arises the intermingled produce of the earth of which men and cattle eat until when the earth is clad with its adornments and is beautified, and its people think that they have all powers of disposal over it, Our command, reached it by night or by day and We make it like a clean-mown harvest, as if it had not flourished yesterday! Thus do We explain the Signs (proofs, revelation laws, etc.) in detail for people who reflect”</strong></span> (Qur’an 10: 24)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many civilizations vanished before and were destroyed when they stood against the way of Allah. We do not have a special relationship with Allah that may save us when we ignore Him and follow our desires! The only true way of salvation is to submit to Him and His way as Revealed in the Qur&#8217;an and as explained by the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. This is the true way of Salvation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">A Final Word to Those Who Submitted to Allah in Islam</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is the perfect way of life. Muslims vary in terms of their adherence to the Faith. There are those whose beliefs and practices adhere well to the way of Allah. Some commit sins but repent and regret. Others disobey and think they will be forgiven just because they are Muslims. Many resort in their worship to other than Allah. They call upon righteous men, dead or alive, and love them like they love Allah. This is the only sin that Allah does not forgive. Any Muslim who sets up rivals with Allah exits the fold of Islam. What matters is the pure submission to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims are called to liberate themselves from any worship to other than Allah. Following deviated sects that call for Sufism (mystic ways), Shee’ism (which gives Divine Attributes to men like Khumeini, and to certain Imams), Ismaa’eelism (another mystic sect that, like Sheeism, gives Divinity to ‘Ali Bin Abee Talib, the honourable companion of the Prophet Muhammad-صلى الله عليه وسلم), and all other ways that lead Muslims out of Islam, must be avoided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the state, family, and individual levels, Muslims must apply the Law (Sharee’ah) of Allah in all of its aspects as detailed by Allah in the Qur’an and by the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم). This is the true way of Justice on earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The duty of the true Muslims is to call for the correction of beliefs and practices that contradict the purpose of man&#8217;s existence on earth. In the course of their duty, they can only depend upon Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) Alone, seeking His Guidance, Help and refuge in Him Alone.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that there is no true god worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is Allaah’s true slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The term <em><strong>worship</strong> </em>in Islam translates to a code of life, because worship means everything which Allaah loves from actions and (or) sayings that are apparent and (or) hidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many are those who do not believe in Allaah as the Only True God. Many as well believe that there is a Creator. However, they are in state of confusion as to who is this Creator. In this article a presentation is aimed to direct to the conclusion that Allaah is the true &#8220;God&#8221;, the Creator, and that man is in need of Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Creator must be the creator of everything, the heavens, the earth an all that is in between them, mankind and all that exists. It is anticipated that anyone who says “I believe in the Creator,” that he believes in this. It also entails that he should necessarily believe that the Creator possesses Perfect Attributes. He is Perfect in His attributes, in Himself, in His Names, and in His Actions. This is a natural flow, otherwise, it is a delusion not a true belief in the &#8220;Creator.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I believe in a Perfect Creator,&#8221; should lead to another obvious admission: if you believe that the Creator is Perfect then He is Perfectly Wise in all of His Actions. Does He then Create because of a Perfect Wisdom, or aimlessly? This is the important linkage. Does He Create for a need? Or He Creates based upon Wisdom? It is anticipated that to be in harmony with having belief in the Creator, that His Wisdom is necessarily is linked to His Knowledge, His Will and to all of His Attributes. The question, therefore, would you think the One who creates does so for a purpose or He creates to leave the creation aimless? The person who believes the Creator is Perfect, would agree that His creating is not aimless. If so, then Who else other than Allaah has stated this? And you know where? It is in His Final Revelation to man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contemplate what He has said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Did you think that We have created you in play without any purpose and that you will not be brought back to us, so exalted be Allaah the true king none has the right to be worshipped but He, the Lord of the Supreme Throne”</strong></span> [Quran 23: 115-116].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Does man think that he will be left aimless (without purpose)?</strong></span> [Quran, 75:36].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah is the One whom you believe to be &#8220;the Creator.&#8221; He chose this title for Himself and He stated that He is the Only Creator, and that He Creates with Wisdom:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, there is no god but He: Then how ye are deluded away from the Truth!</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 40:62].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So this creation which Allaah creates must have a code organizing its existence and its aims. Hence:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Allaah creates and His creating is all Wise and for a purpose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- Allaah did not leave us aimless. He set a code to live accordingly. So He legislates, commands, and prohibits, and justly sets reward and accountability, because He is all Just.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- In all aspects of this code, the manifestations of His Names and Attributes become known, contemplated and realized. Being the Creator necessitates creating as well as purpose, guidance and legislations. Whoever ascribes is rewarded, since He is the Most Generous. When one commits a sin, he realizes that his Creator accepts repentance and is oft-Forgiving. So the manifestations of Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes become realized on earth and this is beloved to Allaah, the Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Allaah gives man life, physical sustenance, and spiritual guidance through the revelation which He entrusted His Messengers with. He guides man to know how to benefit from the provisions, what is good for him and what is harmful. He raises in honor those who submitted to Him, and justly puts in humiliation those who disdain and are arrogant. He Forgives and is Merciful; He punishes and rewards in order that man shapes his life with the code that is all beneficial to man and which makes his life on this earth upright. And it cannot be upright unless man ascribes to the guidance sent to him by His creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- If all mankind come to ascribe to his code (i.e. worship) Allaah on one heart, then this does not oblige any change in Allaah&#8217;s Essence nor in His Attributes. If all the creation is on one heart, this does not increase in the dominion of Allaah anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why He stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>But Allah is free of all wants, and it is ye that are needy.</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 47:38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6-And that is why He mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“If you do good, you do good for your own selves”</span> </strong>[Qur&#8217;an, 17:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And whoever does righteous good deeds, then such will prepare a good place in paradise for themselves.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 30:44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) related in the authentic hadith that Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O My slaves, you will not attain harm in Me so as to harm Me, and you will not attain benefit in Me so as to benefit Me; O My slaves, were the first of you and the last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as pious as the most pious heart of any one man of you, that will not increase My Kingdom in anything; O my slaves, were the first of you and last of you, the human of you and the jinn of you to be as wicked as the most wicked heart of any one man of you, that will not decrease My Kingdom in anything; O My slaves, it is but your deeds that I reckon up for you and I recompense you for. So let him who finds good praise Allaah and let him who finds other than that blame no one but himself.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported in Saheeh Muslim, No. 6246]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On daily basis the person makes what is known as ritual purity (wudu). In every drop of water used to wash the face, hands, arms, head, and feet, sins fall off. It is therefore a tangible and intangible benefit to man. Listen to what Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah does not want to place you in difficulty but He wants to purify you and to complete His favour upon you that you may be thankful.&#8221;</strong> </span>[Qur&#8217;an, 5:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also concerning the ritual of offering a sacrificial animal (from the cattle) in the pilgrimage, we read in the Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“It is neither their meat nor their blood that reaches Allaah but it is piety from you that reaches Him.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 22:37].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In human to human relationship, people do good for each other to attain their own interests, or to be praised. But with Allaah, if you do good, you do good for yourself, because this good that you do does not benefit Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In light of the above, we need to contemplate the great purpose for which we have been created. This is clearly stated by Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And Allaah have not created not the jinn and the men except that they should worship me alone.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 51: 56-57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are called for what benefits them. Remember the definition of worship in the beginning of this discussion? They are the ones who, if they comply, will win. And that is why He asserted in the next verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I seek not any provision from them nor do I ask that they should feed Me.”</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an, 51:57].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why did Allaah mention food and provisions here? It is traditionally known that the greatest need for man is the need for food, clothing and residence. This requires means and provisions, and this is the wealth. That is why Allaah began with it: <strong>“I seek not any provision from them,”</strong> and then He referred to food, because it is the thing most needed by people: <strong>“nor do I ask that they should feed Me,&#8221;</strong> because He is all-Rich, free of all want; Self-Sufficient, needs nothing. He related to us in things we relate closely to so as to make this matter vividly clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the creation of man is not to bring a benefit for Allaah, but to establish this code of life which links him to his Creator. The Noble objective is to submit and deliver. Otherwise there can be no love of our Creator without submission. And to deliver so as to establish uprightness. But who defines what is good and upright? It is laid down by the one who is All-Knowing and Perfect: Allaah. If it is left to us, then your good is an evil to me and vice versa! So, the code of life is set in accordance with what Allaah has defined as worship, outwardly, and inwardly. So imagine someone saying he loves Allaah and worships others besides Him or to the exclusion of Him! This is neither submission nor compliance. That is why love and magnification of Allah means worshipping none but Him. This is the essence of all the revealed Messages to all the Prophets and Messengers. It is a single Message of Tawheed: singling Allaah alone as the true God worthy of worship and disassociating from any kind of worship to other than Him</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We often hear people say: what is important is &#8220;love.&#8221; In reality, the true love is the love of Allaah, our Creator, sustainer, and provider. No one is more beloved to Allaah than the one who loves Him and praises Him and complies with His code which He has set for us in this life. Shirk (opposite of Tawheed): associating partners with Allaah in worship is the most hated thing to Allaah because this diminishes (or may eliminate) the love of Allaah. It sets between Allaah and man an associate, and that is why Allaah does not love it. It takes away from the love of Allaah alone and equates Allaah, the Perfect, with the imperfect. This is not even acceptable in human relations. So one must not set up any rival to Allaah in worship. Allaah warned about this, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And of mankind are some who take for worship others besides Allaah as rivals, they love them as they love Allaah but those who believe love Allaah more than anything else.&#8221;</strong></span> [Qur&#8217;an 2, 165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the truly beneficial thing to man is to know of His Creator, magnify Him, and love Him so that he gains His love and thus be amongst the happy ones in this life and in the hereafter. However, since man has tendencies towards his own lusts and desires, then this objective cannot be attained except when man follows what is pleasing to His Creator, Allaah. The stronger man&#8217;s love of Allaah is, the more he gains of His love and guidance. In practice this needs to be translated into compliance with the code of life set by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who is in need of Allaah is the created, because the One who is Self Sufficient and Perfect is Allaah. It is out of His generosity and benevolence that He is rewarding for singling Him alone in worship. And in that, His names and attributes become manifested, and this is beloved to Him. He loves for the person to repent; He loves for the person to return to Him in repentance; He loves forgiving; He loves pardoning; He loves clemency, and He loves justice because He is All-Just. When man realizes the manifestations of Allaah’s Names, Attributes and actions in the creation, then he knows the meaning of worship and clings to that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that in this discussion, there is a benefit for the person who says that he believes in the Creator, and that it takes him to the final conclusion of submitting to Allaah in Islam. As to those who do not believe in Allaah, they are directed to the discussions we have on this matter under the title: <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2015/02/21/who-deserves-to-be-worshipped-alone-dr-saleh-as-saleh/"><strong>&#8220;who deserves to be worshipped alone”</strong></a> on the site <a href="http://www.understandislam.net" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">www.understandislam.net</a>. And all Praise is due to Allaah, the most Beneficent the most Merciful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Belief in the Oneness and Uniqueness of Allaah (Tawheed) does not only mean to accept that there is no Creator but Allaah, and that Allaah is the Sovereign Rabb (Lord). The person who admits to this fact yet at the same time insists to associate partners with Allaah in worship, is a Mushrik (committing Shirk) even though he may daily utter the Shahaadah. Tawheed, however, embodies the love of Allaah alone; submission, humility, complete obedience, and sincerity of worship to Allaah alone. All of our life must be for His sake. Whoever acknowledges this meaning of Tawheed then he understands the saying of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah forbade the admittance to Hell of anyone who says laa ilaaha illal-laah ‘There is no true God Who deserves to be worshipped except Allaah,’ seeking the Face of Allaah.”</strong></span> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Ahmad].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hypocrites may utter the Shahaadah yet it is known that they are in the lowest part of Hell . Their declaration is not sincere:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them.&#8221;</strong></span>(Qur&#8217;an, soorat an-Nisaa’, 4:145)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a must that the declaration of the Shahaadah be confirmed in the heart as well as by the tongue. The heart is the &#8220;king&#8221; and the rest of the body is the &#8220;army&#8221; under its command. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily, there is a piece of flesh in the body if it is good the rest of the body becomes good; and if it is bad, the rest of the body becomes bad, and that is the heart .”</strong></span> [Part of an authentic hadeeth reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once the Shahaadah is established in the heart it will then help transform the status of the person such that the Fire of Hell will be forbidden to him. It has been narrated that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Whoever says laa ilaaha illal-laah, &#8216;there is no true God Who deserves to be worshipped but Allaah&#8217; and declares Kufr (Disbelief) in whatever is worshipped besides Allaah then his money and blood are Haram (forbidden to be harmed in his money and blood) and the judgment (upon this person) is up to Allaah.&#8221;</span></strong> [Collected by Muslim and Ahmad].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above hadeeth is a great explanation for the true meaning of &#8216;There is no true God but Allaah&#8217;. It emphasizes that there must be a complete dissociation from anyone /anything taken as a deity besides Allaah.<span style="color:#ff0000;"> There can be no worship offered to a righteous man, a star, moon, fire, river, cow, Buddha, Ghandi, Jesus, Khomeini, Malcom X or Y!, Farakhan, graves, statues, money, lust, heads of states, and so forth</span>. Islaam abolishes all forms of man-made deities. When the person disbelieves in offering worship to other than Allaah, then he becomes a Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is very clear that the disbelievers (Kuffar) of Mecca knew what the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) meant by the word he brought to them from Allaah: &#8220;There is no true God but Allaah.&#8221; They believed that Allaah was the Sustainer, the One Who gives life and causes death. But when Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) told them to say: &#8220;There is no true God Who deserves to be worshipped except Allaah,” their answer was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Has he made the &#8220;gods&#8221; (all) into one God (Allaah) Verily, this is a curious thing !&#8221;</strong> </span>(Qur&#8217;an, soorat Saad, 38:5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They knew that the declaration of the Shahaadah meant the abolishing of everything introduced between them and Allaah; an end to their intermediary &#8220;gods.&#8221; This was the reason behind their rejection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This testimony of Tawheed is pure from any falsehood. It brings eternal abode in Paradise for those who fulfill its conditions and what it entails. Its rejection brings eternal abode in An-Naar (Hell). May Allaah guide me and you to be amongst those who love this declaration as well as abide by its meaning.</p>

<h3 id="h1-introduction" style="text-align:justify;">Introduction</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah, we praise Him, and seek His help and forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allah, the Most High, from the evils of our own selves and from our wicked deeds. Whomsoever has been guided by Allah, none can misguide him, and whomsoever has been misguided by Allah, none can guide him. I bear witness that there is no true god worthy of being worshipped except Allah, alone, without partner or associate. I further bear witness that Muhammad is His true slave and Messenger. May Allah, the Exalted, bestow His peace and blessings on the final Prophet Muhammad, upon his good and pure family, and upon all of his noble companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="quran">&#8220;O you who believe! Fear Allah (by doing all that He ordered and abstaining from all that He has forbidden) as He should be feared, and die not except in the state of Islam (as Muslims with complete submission to Allah).&#8221;</span></strong></span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 3:102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="quran">&#8220;O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (&#8216;Adam) and from him He created his wife, and from them both He created many men and women; and fear Allah through Whom you demand your mutual (rights) and (do no cut the relations of) the wombs (kinship). Surely, Allah is ever an All Watcher over you.&#8221;</span></strong></span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 4:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="quran">&#8220;O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allah and fear Him, and speak (always) the truth, He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins. And whosoever obeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed achieved a great success.&#8221; </span></strong></span>[<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 33:70-71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the most truthful speech is that of Allah&#8217;s Book (the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em>), and that the best of guidance is that of Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>. The worst of evils are innovations (foreign to the true teachings of Islam), and every innovated matter (in religion) is a <em>bid&#8217;ah</em>, and every <em>bid&#8217;ah</em> is a misguidance, and every mean of misguidance is in the Fire of Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an introductory book for every Muslim. It is a summary of basic Islamic beliefs and acts of worship. We ask Allah by His Names and Attributes to accept this work and make it a benefit for those who read it and / or distribute it.</p>

<h3 id="h2-the-first-lesson-memorise-the-small-chapters-of-the-qur-an" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The First Lesson &#8211; Memorise the Small Chapters of the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Memorizing the opening <em>surah</em> (chapter) of the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em>, <em>al-Fatihah</em> (the Opening) and some short passages and chapters from No. 99 (<em>az-Zalzalah</em>) to 114 (<em>an-Nas</em>). Every Muslim must make an effort to memorize, recite and understand passages and/or chapters from the Noble <em>Qur&#8217;an</em>.</p>
<h3 id="h3-the-second-lesson-the-conditions-of-the-shahadah" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Second Lesson &#8211; The Conditions of the <em>Shahadah</em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing the meaning and the conditions of the declaration of <em>ash-shahadatan</em> that, &#8220;There is no true God except Allah, and that Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, is the Messenger of Allah&#8221;. The phrase that &#8220;there is no true God&#8221; negates anything or anyone that is being worshipped other than Allah, and the phrase, &#8220;except Allah&#8221;, confirms that all forms of worship, submission and adoration must be for Allah Alone, without setting up rivals with Him. The conditions needed to fulfill the meaning of <em>ash-shahadatan</em> are:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Knowledge about what it means;</li>
<li>Certainty about its meaning which dispels doubts and suspicions;</li>
<li>Sincerity that purifies its declarer from any form of <em>shirk</em> (association);</li>
<li>Honesty which negates hypocrisy;</li>
<li>Love and attachment to the declaration of <em>ash-shahadatan</em>, which leads to the dispel of uneasiness, dislike, or hate to what it implies;</li>
<li>Adherance &#8211; conducting what Allah has decreed regarding His worship;</li>
<li>Accepting to obey Allah by this declaration; and</li>
<li>Dissociating from anything or anyone being worshipped other than Allah.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h4-the-third-lesson-the-six-fundamentals-of-faith" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Third Lesson &#8211; The Six Fundamentals of Faith</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The six fundamental articles of faith are:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Believing in Allah (His Oneness);</li>
<li>His Angels;</li>
<li>All of His Messengers;</li>
<li>All of His Scriptures (in their original and unaltered forms);</li>
<li>In the Last Day (of Judgment); and</li>
<li>Fate and Divine Decree (whether good or bad), which Allah Has measured and ordained according to His previous Knowledge and as deemed suitable by His Wisdom.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h5-the-fourth-lesson-what-is-tawhid-and-shirk" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Fourth Lesson &#8211; What is <em>Tawhid</em> and <em>Shirk</em>?</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Tawhid</em> (Faith in the Unity of Allah) is divided into three articles:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Believing in the Oneness of Allah in the sense of His being the only Creator, Preserver, Nourisher, etc. This belief is called <em>tawhid ar-rububiyah</em>;</li>
<li>Acknowledging that Allah Alone is the One and Only true God who deserves to be worshipped and thus abstaining from worshipping any other being or thing. This belief is called <em>tawhid al-uluhiyah</em>; and</li>
<li>Having faith and belief in the Oneness of Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes. This belief is called <em>tawhid al-asma was-sifat</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>shirk</em> (associating anything or anyone in worship with Allah), it is divided into three types:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Major <em>shirk</em> (<em>ash-shirk al-akbar</em>) which Allah does not forgive. Allah says regarding <em>shirk</em>:<span class="quran">&#8220;But if they had joined in worship others with Allah, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 6: 88]<span class="quran">&#8220;It is not for the <em>mushrikin</em> (polytheists) to maintain the Mosques of Allah (i.e. to pray and worship Allah therein, to looking after their cleanness and their building, etc.), while they witness against their ownselves of disbelief. The works of such bear no fruit, and in fire shall they dwell.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 9:17]The one who associate others with Allah and dies on this <em>shirk</em> will not be forgiven and<em>Jannah</em> (Paradise) is forbidden to him, as Allah, <em>Most Mighty and Honored</em>, says:<span class="quran">&#8220;Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be set up with Him in worship, but He forgives anything else, to whom He pleases; and whoever sets up partners with Allah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em>4:48]<span class="quran">&#8220;Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with Allah, then Allah has forbidden the <em>Jannah</em> for him.&#8221;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 5:72]Asking the dead or idols for help, slaughtering for them and making vows for them are examples of this <em>shirk</em>.</li>
<li>Minor <em>shirk</em> (<em>ash-shirk al-asgar</em>) which is stated in the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> or in the Prophet&#8217;s tradition but is not the same as major <em>shirk</em>. <em>Riya</em> (showing off) and swearing by other than Allah are examples of this kind of <em>shirk</em>. Prophet Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, said:<span class="hadith">&#8220;Of which I fear for you the most is minor shirk.&#8221;</span> When he was asked what was it, he said, <span class="hadith">&#8220;Riya.&#8221;</span>He, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, also said, <span class="hadith">&#8220;He who swears by anything other than Allah commits minor <em>shirk</em>.&#8221;</span>The Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, also warned, <span class="hadith">&#8220;Do not say, &#8216;Had Allah and such and such (person) willed&#8217;, but say, &#8216;Had Allah then such and such (person) willed.&#8217; &#8220;</span>. This kind of <em>shirk</em> does not necessarily lead to disbelief from Islam or an eternal stay in Hell. It negates, however, the completeness of faith.</li>
<li>Hidden <em>shirk</em>. Prophet Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, explained, <span class="hadith">&#8220;Shall I not tell you of which I fear for you more than I fear of the Antichrist?&#8221;</span> They said, &#8220;Yes, O Messenger of Allah&#8221;, and he said, <span class="hadith">&#8220;Hidden shirk, where one beautifies his way of praying only because another one is looking at him.&#8221;</span></li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Alternatively, <em>shirk</em> could be divided into two kinds &#8211; major and minor. In this case, the hidden<em>shirk</em> encompasses both the major and minor kinds depending upon the act committed. It is major if it is the same as the <em>shirk</em> of the hypocrites who hide their false beliefs while showing off Islam out of fear. It is minor if it is the same as <em>riya</em>.</p>
<h3 id="h6-the-fifth-lesson-the-five-pillars-of-islam" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Fifth Lesson &#8211; The Five Pillars of Islam</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The five pillars of Islam are <em>ash-shahadatan</em> (bearing witness that there is none worthy of being worshipped except Allah and that Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, is His Messenger), establishing prayers, paying the alms (<em>zakah</em>), fasting the month of <em>Ramadhan</em>, and performing pilgrimage (<em>Hajj</em>) if one can afford it.</p>
<h3 id="h7-the-sixth-lesson-the-nine-conditions-of-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Sixth Lesson &#8211; The Nine Conditions of Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The nine conditions of prayers are Islam, sanity, maturity, performing the ablution (<em>wudu</em>), cleanliness from impurities (on the body, clothes, and place of prayer), dressing properly, having the intention of prayers, facing the right direction of <em>qiblah</em> (direction of the <em>Ka&#8217;bah</em> at Makkah), and the praying at the proper time.</p>
<h3 id="h8-the-seventh-lesson-the-basic-elements-of-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Seventh Lesson &#8211; The Basic Elements of Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourteen basic elements (<em>arkan</em>) of prayers are standing (if one is able), saying <em>allahu akbar</em>(Allah is the Greatest), reading the opening <em>surah</em> of the <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> (<em>al-Fatihah</em>), lowering the head and back down at the right angle (<em>ruku&#8217;</em>), resuming the initial standing position, prostrating with the toes of both feet, both knees, both hands and the forehead touching the ground (<em>sujud</em>), rising in a sitting position, a short rest in a sitting posture between the two prostrations, tranquility in all actions, performing the basic elements of prayer in order, the last <em>tashahud</em> (the second part), sitting for the last <em>tashahud</em>, exalting the Prophet Muhammad, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, and turning the face to the right side and to the left one saying <em>as-salamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullah</em> (peace and mercy of Allah be upon you) one time on each side.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Note: <em>Salah</em> is invalid if any of the above is missing.)</p>
<h3 id="h9-the-eighth-lesson-the-obligatory-acts-of-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Eighth Lesson &#8211; The Obligatory Acts of Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eight obligatory acts of the prayer are all the occasions of saying <em>allahu akbar</em> other than<em>takbirat al-ihram</em> (which is basic); saying <em>samiallahuliman hamidah</em> (Allah accepts any who are thankful to Him) by the <em>Imam</em> as well as the one who is praying alone, and saying <em>rabbana wa laka al-hamd</em> (Our Lord, praise be to You) for both the <em>Imam</em> and the individual; saying <em>subhana rabbi al-athim</em> (Glory to my Lord, the Most Great) in <em>ruku</em>; saying <em>subhana rabbi al-a&#8217;la</em> (Glory to my Lord, the Most High) in <em>sujud</em>; saying <em>rabighfirli</em> (Oh my Lord, grant forgiveness to me) between the two prostrations; the first part (<em>at-tashahud al-awwal</em>); and sitting for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Note: if any of the above is missing, the Muslim needs to make <em>sujud al-sahw</em>).</p>
<h3 id="h10-the-ninth-lesson-the-contents-of-at-tashahud" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Ninth Lesson &#8211; The Contents of <em>At-Tashahud</em></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing the contents of <em>at-tashahud</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First Part: <em>&#8220;At-tahiyyato lillahi was-salawatu wat-tayyibat. As-salamu alayka ayyuha an-nabi warahmatullahi wa barakatuh, as-salamu alayna wa ala ibadillahi as-salihin, ashadu an la ilaha illallah, wa ashadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Greetings, prayers ant the good things of life belong to Allah . Peace be upon you, O Prophet, and the Mercy of Allah and His blessings. Peace be upon us all and on the righteous servants of Allah. I bear witness that there is no true God worthy of worship but Allah alone, and I bear witness that Muhammad is His true slave and Messenger.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second Part: <em>&#8220;Allahumma salli ala muhammad wa ala ali muhammad kama sallayta ala ibrahima wa ala ali ibrahim. Wa barik ala muhammad wa ala ali muhammad, kama barakta ala ibrahima wa ala ali ibrahim, innaka hamidon majid.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Oh Allah! Exalt Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as you did exalt Ibrahim (Abraham) and the family of Abraham. And bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad, as you did bless Abraham and the people of Abraham, verily You are the Most Praised, The Most Glorious.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the reciting of the <em>tashahud</em>, the slave asks Allah&#8217;s protection from the torment of Hell, the torment of the grave, the trials in life-time and after death, and from the impostor Anti-Christ. After that he may supplicate and ask Allah whatever he wishes, especially the type of invocation said by the Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="hadith">&#8220;O Allah help me to perform remembrance of You and to give all due thanks to You and allow me to worship you in the good way (i.e. as ordained by Allah and His Messenger). O Allah I have inflicted a great deal of wrong upon myself and there is none other than You who can offer forgiveness. Grant me forgiveness from You and grant me your Mercy. You are the All-Merciful, The Oft Forgiving.&#8221;</span></p>
<h3 id="h11-the-tenth-lesson-the-sunan-acts-of-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Tenth Lesson &#8211; The <em>Sunan </em>Acts of Prayer</span></h3>

<li>Reciting another passage from the Holy <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> after the opening <em>surah</em> of <em>al-Fatihah</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h12-the-eleventh-lesson-invalidation-of-the-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Eleventh Lesson &#8211; Invalidation of the Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any prayer is invalid and nullified if any of the following acts are committed &#8211; Intentional talking, laughing, eating, drinking, uncovering the parts of the body of which are not allowed to be uncovered during prayer, excessive alteration in the direction towards the <em>qiblah</em>, excessive moving outside the regular acts and movements of prayer, without a proper reason and nullifying the ablution.</p>
<h3 id="h13-the-twelfth-lesson-the-conditions-for-ablution" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Twelfth Lesson &#8211; The Conditions for Ablution</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ten conditions for performing ablution are:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Islam;</li>
<li>Sanity;</li>
<li>Maturity;</li>
<li>Intention;</li>
<li>&#8230; its continuity (i.e. the person should not intend to discontinue his ablution before its completion);</li>
<li>If one performs <em>istinja&#8217;</em> (cleaning the areas of natural discharges with water) or with stones, tissues, leaves etc. (<em>istijmar</em>) before ablution;</li>
<li>Water must be pure and <em>mubah</em> (i.e. it is not stolen or taken by force);</li>
<li>The removal of all things that prevent water from reaching the parts of ablution such as mud;</li>
<li>Those who continually lose their ablution (for example due to release of gas, urine, or any reason that nullifies ablution), must make prior to prayers; and</li>
<li>Causes that requires ablution (e.g. urine, eating camel meat, sleep, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="h14-the-thirteenth-lesson-the-obligatory-elements-of-ablution" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Thirteenth Lesson &#8211; The Obligatory Elements of Ablution</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The obligatory elements of ablution are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Washing the face, including rinsing out the mouth with water and cleansing the nostrils of the nose;</li>
<li>Washing the two hands up to and including the elbows;</li>
<li>Wiping the whole head including the two ears;</li>
<li>Washing the two feet including the heels; and</li>
<li>Doing the ablution in the prescribed sequence, without delays.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h15-the-fourteenth-lesson-the-six-nullifying-acts-of-ablution" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Fourteenth Lesson &#8211; The Six Nullifying Acts of Ablution</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The six nullifying acts of the ablution are:</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Natural excretion, such as urine, feaces, gas, etc.;</li>
<li>Any unclean substance excessively discharged from the body;</li>
<li>Losing one&#8217;s reason due to sleep, loss of consciousness or otherwise;</li>
<li>Eating camel meat (because the Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, ordered so);</li>
<li>Rejection of Islam; and</li>
<li>Touching the sexual organs with hand (without any barrier: clothes and so on).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Notice: Washing the dead does not nullify the ablution except for that the washer&#8217;s hand touches (without any barrier) the sexual organs. Kissing women with or without desire does not nullify ablution because the Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, once kissed one of his wives and prayed without performing ablution. This holds as long as there is no associated sexual excretions (e.g. semen). As for the saying of Allah, Most Glorified:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="quran">&#8221; &#8230; or you have been in contact with women (by sexual relations) &#8230; &#8220;</span> [<em>Al-Qur&#8217;an</em> 4: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The contact with women is the involvement in a full sexual relation as related by Ibn Abbas (companion) and others, and it is the correct opinion.</p>
<h3 id="h16-the-fifteenth-lesson-recommend-morals" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Fifteenth Lesson &#8211; Recommend Morals</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The recommended morals for every Muslim are truthfulness, honesty, abstinence, modesty, courage, generosity, loyalty, refraining from everything that Allah had made unlawful, being a good neighbor, helping the needy, and other morals stated either in the Holy <em>Qur&#8217;an</em> or in the Prophet&#8217;s, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, tradition.</p>
<h3 id="h17-the-sixteenth-lesson-islamic-decencies" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Sixteenth Lesson &#8211; Islamic Decencies</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islamic decencies &#8211; greeting, cheerfulness, eating and drinking with the right hand, adhering to the Islamic conduct in entering and leaving homes and mosques and while traveling, dealing kindly with parents, relatives, neighbors, the old man and the young; congratulating, lamenting, and other Islamic ethics.</p>
<h3 id="h18-the-seventeenth-lesson-warning-others" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Seventeenth Lesson &#8211; Warning Others</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Warning against <em>shirk</em> (association) and against other wrongdoing such as witchcraft, murdering, taking the money of the orphan, dealing with interest (<em>riba</em>), escaping on the day of<em>Jihad</em> (war), speaking evil of faithful women, disobeying parents, breaking up with one&#8217;s relatives, false witnessing, harming neighbors, committing outrage upon others, and other warnings as declared by Allah and His messenger, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<h3 id="h19-the-eighteenth-lesson-the-funeral-prayer" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Eighteenth Lesson &#8211; The Funeral Prayer</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Washing the dead body and performing the funeral prayer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) Washing the dead:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a Muslim is confirmed dead his eyes must be closed and his jaws brought together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When washing the dead body, the whole body beginning with the exposed parts of ablution must be washed. The abdomen is gently squeezed and followed by washing of the anus and the sexual organs using a wet piece of cloth. Normal ablution will then be performed. The body is washed starting with the head and beard using water mixed with the leaves of<em>sidr</em> (lote tree, if available). The right side must be washed before the left side and the body must be washed three times. Each time the abdomen is squeezed as above. The mustache and the nails are clipped, and when the body is clean, it is wrapped in three white cotton sheets covering all parts of the body and perfumed with incense. If the body is still unclean, ablution must be extended to 5-7 times after which the body is dried with a clean cloth. Men&#8217;s hair should not be combed while that of a woman is to be braided into three chains and left hanging down behind her (as done to the Prophet&#8217;s daughter).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is preferred to shroud men with three white sheets without a gown or <em>amamah</em> (head cover); children in one up to three sheets and women in five sheets, these sheets are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Dir&#8217;</em>: a loose outer garment with sleeves slit in front.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Khimar</em>: covering head and face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Izar</em>: a sheet wrapped around the waist, and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two overall wrapping sheets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Young girls can be wrapped with a gown and two sheets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who has the most right to wash the dead body of a man is his chosen guardian (if any) then his father, his grandfather, then the closest of his relatives. The woman is best washed by her chosen female then the mother, the grandmother, then the closest one of her female relatives. The husband can wash the body of his wife and vice versa because Abu Bakr, <em>may Allah be pleased with him</em>, was washed by his wife; and Ali ibn Abi Talib, <em>may Allah be pleased with him</em>, washed his wife, Fatimah, the daughter of the Prophet, <em>may Allah be pleased with her</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) The funeral prayer (<em>salat ul-janazah</em>):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying <em>takbir</em> (<em>allahu akbar</em>) four times. Reciting <em>al-Fatihah</em> after the first <em>takbir</em>. Following the second <em>takbir</em>, one prays for the Prophet, <em>sallallahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>, as he does in<em>tashahud</em>. Then after saying <em>allahu akbar</em> for the third time, one recites what is usually said in other prayers like asking Allah to forgive all Muslims or any supplications he knows, preferably this:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Allahumma ighfir li hayyina wa mayyitina, wa shahidina wa ghaibina wa sagheerina wa kabeerina wa thakarina wa unthana. Allahumma man ahyaytahu minna fa ahyihi ala al Islam, wa man tawaffaytah u minna fa tawaffahu ala al-iman. Allahmma la tahrimna ajrah, wa la taftinna badah.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Allah, grant forgiveness to our living and to our dead, and to those who are present and to those who are absent, and to our young and our old folk, and to our males and our females. O Allah, whomsoever you grant to live, from among us, help him to live in Islam and whomsoever of us you cause to die, help him to die in faith. O Allah, do not deprive us of the reward for patience on his (her, their) loss and do not make us subject to trial after him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or one could say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Allahumma ighfir lah u warhamhu wa&#8217;afihi wa&#8217;fu anhu, wa&#8217;akrim nuzulahu wa wassi&#8217; madkhalahu, wa&#8217;ghsilhu bil mae wathalgi walbarad, wanaqihi mina al-thunoubi walkhataya kama unaqa athawbo alabiado mina addanas, wa abdilhu daran khairan min darihi, wa ahlan khairan min ahlihi, wa adkhilhu al-jannah, wa aidhu min adhabi al qabr, wa adhabi an-nar; wafsah lahu fi qabrihi, wanawir lahu fehi. Allahumma la tahrimna ajrahu, wa la tudhlilna ba&#8217;dahu.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Allah forgive him (her, them) and have your Mercy upon him; protect him and pardon him, receive him with honor and make his grave spacious; wash him with water, snow and hail, and clean him from sins and wrong-doings as is cleaned a white garment from impurity; requite him with an abode more excellent than his, and with a mate better than his mate. Admit him to the Garden, and protect him from the torment of the grave and the torment of the Fire; widen his space in his grave and bring him light therein. O Allah don&#8217;t deprive us from his reward and don&#8217;t let us go astray after him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after saying <em>allahu akbar</em> for the fourth time one turns his head to the right (making<em>taslim</em>) and thus ending the funeral prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is best to raise one&#8217;s hand while saying <em>allahu akbar</em>. In the case when the dead is a child or an infant, the following <em>du&#8217;a</em> is made:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Allahumma ejalhu dhiktan liwalidayehi, washafeean mujaban. Allahuma thaqil bihi mawazeenahuma wa a&#8217;dhun bihi ujorahuma wa alhiqhu bi salih al-mu&#8217;minin, waj&#8217;alhu fi kafalati ibrahim alayhi as-salam, waqihi bi rahmatika adhaba al-jahim.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;O Allah make him a preceding reward and a reserve treasure (on the Day of Judgment) for his parents; a one whose intercession would be granted. O Allah make of him an excess in the measures and in the rewards (granted by Allah) to his parents. Let him join the company of the righteous believers and make him under the care of Abraham (may the peace of Allah be upon him), and protect him, by Your Mercy, from the torment of the blazing Fire.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tradition is for the <em>Imam</em> to stand right next to the head of the body if it is a man, and to the middle of the body if it is a woman. If the dead were many, men, women, male and female children in one funeral, the following positions are to be taken:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The men right in front of the <em>Imam</em>. The women further towards the <em>qiblah</em>. The male children are between the men and women and more towards the men while the female children follow women further down in the direction of <em>qiblah</em> (all of the dead bodies are to be laid parallel to those praying). The bodies are to be arranged such that the head of the male child lies next to that of a man while the middle of a woman lies next to the head of a man. The head of the female child lies next to the head of a woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The followers of <em>Imam</em> are to stand behind him just as in other prayers. It is acceptable for one to stand to the right of the <em>Imam</em> if he finds no place behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>All praise is due to Allah and His blessings and peace be upon His Prophet, his family and his companions.</em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Sixth : Menses &amp; Legal Sexual Intercourse</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is prohibited for a husband to have sexual intercourse with his menstruating wife, and it is not allowed for her to make it possible for him. Allah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{ويسألونك عن المحيض قُل هُوَ أذًى فاعتَزِلُوا النِّساءَ في المَحيض ولا تقربوهُنَّ حتى يطْهُرن }</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah Al-Baqarah 2:222]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;They ask you concerning menstruation. Say: that is an Adha (a harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual intercourse with his wife while she is having her menses), therefore keep away from women during menses and go not unto them till they have been purified (from menses and have taken a bath).&#8221;</strong> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 222).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Menses here refers to the period of menstruation and the private part of the woman is the prohibited place. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم) said: &#8220;<strong>Do everything except sexual intercourse</strong>.&#8221; [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Muslims had Ijmaa&#8217; prohibiting sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman. It is not permissible for anyone who believes in Allah and in the Day of Judgment to practice this act. Anyone who does this then he had disobeyed Allah and His Messenger and followed a path other than the believers path [41].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related that Imam Ash-Shaafiee&#8217; had said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Anyone who does such an act then he had committed a Great Sin</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other scholars of the same school said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Anyone who sees it permissible to have sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman then a decree of his Kufr (rejection of Faith) should be made</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to break the intensity of sexual desire, it is permissible (and praise is due to Allah) to kiss, hug and fondle a menstruating woman in places other than her private parts. It is important, however, that the husband does not approach the area between the knees and the navel without laying a cover sheet as &#8216;Aisha ( رضي الله عنها) explained:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;He (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم) used to order me to put an Izar (dress worn below the waist) and used to fondle me (during her menses)&#8221;</strong> [42].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[40] Saheeh Muslim (English) V 1. P.175, Hadeeth # 592.<br />
[41] Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) warns saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{ ومن يُشاققِ الرَّسول من بَعدِ ما تبينَ لهُ الهُدى ويتَّبِعُ غيرَ سبيل المؤمنين نُوَلِّهِ ما تَولَّى ونصلِهِ جَهَنَّم وساءتْ مَصيراً }<br />
&#8211; Surah an-Nisa 115</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وآله وسلم)) after the Right Path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers&#8217; way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell;&#8211;what an evil destination.&#8221;</strong> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 115)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Chapter Six<br />
Nifass And Its Rulings</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Nifass</strong>: is the bleeding due to delivery by a pregnant woman. It may occur with delivery, after delivery (post-natal) or before delivery (by two or three days coupled to contractions).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shayekh Al-Islam Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;The blood seen when the woman starts her contractions is Nifass and it is not limited to two or three days. These contractions are followed by delivery or otherwise the released blood is not Nifass&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars differed as to whether there is a limit on its duration. Shayekul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;Nifass has no limit on the duration of its shorter or longer periods. Assuming that a woman sees a flowing of blood for more than forty, sixty, or seventy days and then the blood flow stops. This kind of bleeding is Nifass. Suppose, however, that the bleeding continues, then a limit of forty days is set as Nifass because this period is the common period encountered by most women&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This author said: &#8220;based upon the above, if the bleeding of a woman continues beyond forty days and if there are signs that indicate that it will come to a stop (based upon previous pregnancies or some other signs), then she should wait until the blood flow stops. If none of these signs are encountered by a woman, then she cleans herself (bath) upon the completion of forty days considering it the reference period for most women. On the other hand, if upon the completion of her forty days she gets her normal menses then she should wait until it ends. If the blood continues after her regular menses ends, then she is a Mustahadah and should apply the rules of Istihadah&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the Nifass bleeding stops before the forty day-reference period and she becomes clean, then she should take a bath, pray, fast and she may engage in sexual intercourse with her husband. The stopping of the flow of blood for less than a day does not qualify her to be clean (as mentioned in Al-Mughnee).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nifass is not confirmed unless the woman delivers a human being with clear features. If a small body is delivered but clearly does not show the developed features of a human being, then the associated bleeding is not Nifass and it is considered as Irq blood (blood from a blood vessel). The least period for which a human form can develop is eighty days starting from the day of conception and most often it is ninety days. Al-Mujid Ibn Taymeeyah [57] said: &#8220;If she sees blood coupled to contractions prior to the 80/90-days she should not give it any consideration (i.e., she continues to pray and fast) but if she sees blood after this period she should then refrain from praying and fasting. If, however, she delivers her load and the new born has developed human features, then her bleeding (prior the 80/90 days) should be considered as Nifass and she should correct for her missed prayers and fasting. If on the other hand the newborn does not show developed human features then her bleeding should still not to be considered as Nifass and does not have to make up for her prayers and fasting.&#8221;</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Laws of Nifass</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The laws of Nifass are the same as the laws governing menses, except in the following cases:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) <strong>The Idda is not related to Nifass, but rather to the rules of divorce</strong>. For example: if Talaq (divorce) was declared prior to delivery, then the Idda ends upon delivery and is not related to the Nifass period. If Talaq was declared after delivery, she waits for the return of her menses and accordingly calculates her Idda as explained earlier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) <strong>The period of Eelaa&#8217;</strong>. The Eelaa&#8217; is when the husband makes an oath to indefinitely (or for more than four months) not to have sexual intercourse with his wife. If his wife demands sexual intercourse, a period of four months starting from the day he took his oath, will be set. If this period is completed he will be ordered (by a Muslim Judge) either to perform sexual intercourse with his wife or request of separation by his wife will be fulfilled. Nifass will not be counted against the Eelaa&#8217; period. An increment equal to the period needed for the wife&#8217;s Tahara from Nifass will be added towards the Eelaa&#8217; period. This is in contrast with menses (Haid), whereby its period is counted against the Eelaa&#8217; period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) <strong>Puberty</strong>: It is clear that Nifass is related to pregnancy. A woman cannot get pregnant before she has her own sexual secretions. Haid (and not Nifass) indicates that puberty had been reached.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(4) <strong>What if the flow of Nifass blood stops before the forty days period and then resumes on the fortyth day?</strong> In contrast with Haid blood [58], the state of this resumption is considered to be &#8220;doubtful&#8221; according to famous sayings by the Hanabilah scholars. She, according to them, must fast and pray on time . All that which is forbidden on the Haa&#8217;id is forbidden on her, except obligatory acts. She must compensate all that which the Haa&#8217;id must compensate for. This author, however, is with the opinion that: &#8220;If the blood resumes within a period that may be a Nifass period, then her blood is Nifass blood. If not, then it is a Haid blood unless it continues to flow and it will then be an Istihadah blood. This opinion is close to that reported in Al-Mughnee (V.1, P. 349) in which it is mentioned that Imam Malik have said: &#8220;If she sees blood two or three days after its flow had stopped, then it is Nifass blood or otherwise it is a Haid blood.&#8221; This is also the choice of Shayekul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Realistically, there can be no &#8220;doubt&#8221; about blood. It is, however, a relative matter in which peoples&#8217; opinions may vary depending upon their knowledge and understanding. The Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) are sources of clarification for everything. Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) did not make it mandatory for someone to fast twice or make Tawaff twice except when there is something done wrong during the performance of these acts for the first time and that it cannot be corrected without actually making it up. However, in the case when someone performs a certain act to the best of his/her ability then he/she is relieved from any responsibility as Allah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { لا يُكَلِّفُ الله نفساً إلاَّ وُسعَها } (البقرة، 286<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah burdens not a person beyond his scope&#8221;</strong></span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 286)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { فاتَّقوا الله ما استَطَعتُم } (التغابن، 16<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;So keep your duty to Allah as much as you can&#8221;</strong> </span>(Qur&#8217;an 64: 16)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(5) <strong>What about sexual intercourse with a woman who becomes clean prior to the forty days-reference period of Nifass?</strong> In the case of the Haa&#8217;id, sexual intercourse is permissible if she becomes clean prior to her &#8220;normal&#8221; duration of her cycle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the case of Nifass and in accordance with the well known opinion of the Hanbali school of thought, sexual intercourse is disliked. The right opinion, however, is that it is not disliked and this is also the saying of the majority of Muslim Scholars, because to make something disliked requires a supporting evidence from Islamic Law. In this case there is no evidence except that which Imam Ahmad related: &#8220;the wife of Uthman the son of Abi Al-&#8216;Aass approached him before the end of the forty -day period and he told her: &#8216;do not!'&#8221;. This does not necessitate that he disliked what she did because it is possible that he was acting cautiously being afraid that she was not certain that she was Tahira (clean from Nifass) or that bleeding may be re-activated following intercourse with her or for some other reason- and Allah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is <strong>unlawful</strong> for a menstruating woman to perform all types of fasting: obligatory or optional.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is, however, obligatory to <strong>make up for the missed obligatory days</strong> of fasting as explained by &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنها):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;We passed through this (period of menstruation), and we were ordered to complete (i.e., compensate) the fasts but we were not ordered to complete the prayers&#8221;</strong> </span>(agreed upon Hadeeth) [34]<span style="color:#808080;"><a style="color:#808080;" href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-9F0" target="_blank">.</a></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the woman encounters menses while fasting then her fasting is negated even if her blood flow occurs a moment before sunset. If this day is one of the prescribed days of fasting then she must make up for this day once she becomes clean<span style="color:#808080;"><a style="color:#808080;" href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-9F0" target="_blank">.</a></span> If on her day of fasting she feels she is about to have her menses but no blood flow actually occurs till after sunset, then her fasting is complete and is not negated in accordance with the right opinion about this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because there is no ruling regarding blood inside the woman&#8217;s body and because the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) when asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Is it necessary for a woman to take a bath after she has a wet dream (nocturnal sexual discharge)?&#8221;<br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> he replied: &#8220;Yes, if she notices a discharge.&#8221;</strong></span> [35]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) conditioned the ruling upon the actual seeing of the discharge and not upon its transfer (from inside-out). Similarly in the case of Haid, the ruling applies once there is an actual seeing of discharge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: If a woman&#8217;s period continues till after dawn (Fajr), then no fasting will be acceptable from her on this day even if she becomes clean moments after dawn.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: If she becomes clean before Fajr and she fasted, then her fasting is correct even though she may have not taken her cleaning bath till after Fajr time. This is the same as in the case of the person who has Jannabah. If he (she) intends to fast and did not take his (her) bath until after Fajr, then his (her) fasting on this day is correct. This is in accordance with the Hadeeth of &#8216;Aisha (رضي الله عنها) who said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to get up in a state of Jannabah (after sexual relations with his wives) and fast during the month of Ramadan.&#8221;</strong></span> [36]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p>[33] Ibin Taymeeyah in Al-Fatawa (religious decrees) V. 26, P. 191.<br />
[34] The text is from Saheeh Muslim, V.1, P. 191.<br />
[35] Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English) V.1, P. 171-2, Hadeeth # 280.<br />
[36] Aisha (رضي الله عنها) said: &#8220;The dawn broke upon the Messenger of Allah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) during the Ramadan in a state of Jannabah not becuase of sexual dream</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 10:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Suppose a woman becomes clean from her menses before Salat Al-Fajr but she took her bath after the commencement of the Salat time, and fasted that day. Is her fasting correct?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a woman becomes clean during the month of Ramadan one minute before the commencement of the prescribed time of Salat Al-Fajr, then she must fast that day and her fasting is correct and it is not mandatory upon her to make up the fast because she fasted while she was clean even though she did not take her bath till after the rise of Fajr. This is similar to the case when a man has a wet dream or in a state of Jannabah. He can have his Suhor (meal before Fajr), fast and take his bath after Fajr.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I want to caution some women who may think that if they get their menses after breaking the fast and before Isha&#8217; then their fasting was incorrect. This understanding is wrong. Their fasting is correct and complete even if they get their respective periods one moment after sunset (Maghrib).</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 6:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">A woman has reached sixty five years of age. She did not give birth to any child during the last nineteen years. For the past three years she had continuous bleeding. What should she do for fasting and what should women like her do (regarding Salat and Fasting)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type of woman should refrain from fasting and Salat during the time of her regular cycle of menses. If for example she used to have her normal period of menses during the first six days of the month, then she should refrain from fasting and praying during the first six days of each month. Once that is done, she should take a bath and perform Salat and fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the how she offers her Salat, she should wash her private part real well and apply a pad to it and make ablution. She does this at the time of the obligatory prayers. She could also do the same for the optional prayers at times other than the times of the obligatory prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of the difficulty encountered by such woman, it is allowable for her to combine (but not shorten) the Thuhr with the &#8216;Asr prayer (and pray either at time of Thuhr or at time of &#8216;Asr) and the Maghrib with the Isha&#8217; (and pray either at time of Maghrib or at time of Isha&#8217;). This way she can do this type of preparation for her Salat three times (including one for Fajr prayer) instead of five times a day. She can perform optional prayers based upon her ablution for either of the combined prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 5:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What should a woman do when she does not make up for the days she did not fast in Ramadan due to her menses?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by Shaykh ibn Uthaymeen:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is regrettable for something like this to happen amongst the believing women. This is either due to ignorance or laziness and both reasons are wrong! because the cure for ignorance is to ask those who know and the cure for laziness is the fear of Allah and His punishment. So a woman who may have done this should sincerely repent to Allah and seek His forgiveness. She should also try her best to find out the number of days she missed and make up for it. I ask Allah to accept the repentance of such women.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 43:</strong> It was reported from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that he was bewitched. So we would like you to talk about the means by which he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was bewitched. Furthermore, is it contradictory to the status of Prophethood that bewitchment of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) took place?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> It has been confirmed in the Saheehayn (al- Bukhaaree and Muslim collections of Ahaadeeth) and in other traditions that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was enchanted. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His bewitchment, however, did not affect him from the aspect of Legislation or Revelation</strong></span>. The utmost thing in this respect is that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) reached a stage whereby he began to fancy that he was doing a thing which he was not actually doing. The magic material intended for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was the cast of a Jew known by the name Labeed ibn al-A’sam. Allaah, The One free of all imperfection and The Most High, protected the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) from it, until he was informed of what occurred to him by way of inspiration. He used to seek refuge in Allaah against evil by the recitation of al-Mu’awwithatayn, soorat al- Falaq and soorat An-Naas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And this kind of magic does not influence the state of Prophethood, since it did not affect the behavior of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) regarding the Revelation and acts of worship</strong></span>, as we have mentioned earlier. Some people have denied that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was bewitched under the pretext that such saying necessitates believing the unbelievers, and even the wrongdoers who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">You follow none but a witched man.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Israa’ (17): 47].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt, however, that such saying does not obligate approving those unbelievers and wrongdoers in what they have attributed to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Since they claim that the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is bewitched in what he utters from Revelation, and what he has brought is mere hallucination, like the hallucination of the bewitched. However, the bewitching that occurred to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not affect him in anything of the Revelation whatsoever, or in anything of the acts of worship. And it is forbidden that we deny his enchantment based upon our misunderstanding of the texts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FIRST</strong>: To Completely Prevent Pregnancy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is not permissible because:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(a) it will diminish the Islamic population and this is against the objective of Sharee&#8217;aa which aims at increasing the population of Muslims.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">(b) the woman is unable to guarantee against the death of her existing children and thus she may die without having any children.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SECOND</strong>: To Temporarily Prevent Pregnancy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This applies if the woman had many pregnancies and this is beginning to weaken her. If she wants to regulate her pregnancy so as to have it once every two years, then given the approval of her husband, it is permissible for her to use contraceptives as long as their use does not harm her. The Sahabah used to perform <strong>Coitus Interrupts</strong> [59] and they were not prevented (i.e., by the Prophet-صلى الله عليه و سلم). This method involves regular sexual intercourse with the wife except at the time of ejaculation, the husband pulls out and ejaculates outside the private part of the woman.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Use of Haid (Menses) Inhibitors is permissible under two conditions:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FIRST</strong>: There is no associated harm on the woman. Because Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;aala) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { ولا تُلقُوا بأيديكُم إلى التَّهلُكَة } (البقرة، 195<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And do not throw yourselves in destruction&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 2: 195).</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { ولا تَقتُلوا أنفُسَكُم إنَّ الله آانَ بكم رحيماً } (النِّساء، 29<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And do not kill yourselves surely Allah is Most Merciful to you&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 4: 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SECOND</strong>: If its use affects the husband in one way or another, then his permission should be first sought. For example, if a woman is going through her Idda and the husband is obligated to spend upon her, then she is not allowed to prolong her Idda (by using Haid inhibitors) in order that she can receive more of his spending. She should request his permission. Similarly it is not permissible to use such inhibitors without the husband&#8217;s approval if it is known that the inhibitors will prevent her becoming pregnant. It is better not to use these inhibitors except under the above conditions and when there is a real need for that, because leaving the matter as natural as possible is better for the balance of health and safety of the woman.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Use of Haid (Menses) Stimulants is permissible under two conditions:</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FIRST</strong>: There must be no abuse of its use. For example, to excuse herself from certain mandatory acts of worship like using stimulants right before the month of Ramadan so as to be excused from fasting or from prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>SECOND</strong>: The use of stimulants must be permitted by the husband because the presence of Haid prevents him from having full enjoyment with his wife. Also, if she was divorced, then this will quickly drop off the husband&#8217;s right of returning her because it will hasten the end of her Idda. This applies to the case when the declared divorce is of the type known as Revocable Divorce in which the husband has the right to return his wife before the end of her Idda.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">Questions &amp; Answers</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Haid Inhibitors</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q1: What is the ruling regarding on the use of Haid-inhibitory pills during the month of Ramadan?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As long as there is no harm in their use and as long as the husband permits this, then it is permissible to use these pills.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it came to my knowledge that these measures can harm the woman, especially when it is known that the release of blood by menses is a natural process. To prevent this natural way may cause certain harm to the woman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also the use of these pills can effect the regulation of the periodical cycle itself and that leaves her in doubt and confusion regarding the offering of her prayer and whether she is able to have sexual intercourse with her husband or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because of this and other associated reasons, I cannot say that the use of these pills is unlawful but I do not like it and do not encourage it. I say that the woman should accept what Allah had ordained for her and should consider the answer of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to his wife &#8216;Aisha when she had her menses after she made Ihram for Umra. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) asked &#8216;Aisha: &#8220;May be that you got your menses?&#8221;. &#8216;Aisha replied, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) then said,&#8221;This is the thing which Allah has ordained for all the daughters of Adam&#8221; [62]. The woman should then be patient and seek the reward from Allah. If she is unable to perform Salat and fasting because of her menses, the door is still opened for her to celebrate the praises of Allah, give charity and do good to people and such acts are great acts of worship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">[<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/a-look-at-anasheeds-dr-saleh-as-saleh.pdf" target="_blank"><strong>Download PDF Here</strong></a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful, I begin to write:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In pre-Islamic and early Islamic history, anasheeds involved wholesome poems (about battle victories, wisdoms, courage, etc) chanted in an un-orchestrated fashion without the accompaniment of musical instruments, except for the duff (similar to tambourine but without bells or cymbals) which was legally permitted for women on special occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the 2nd century after Hijrah, chanting of du&#8217;aa, remembrances, crept into the ummah by the innovations of the <strong>mystic Sufis</strong> who, in turn, took it from the Christians. It was then called <strong>at-Taghbeer</strong>. All of these forms were denounced by the early scholars of Islam, including Imaam ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, Ibn Taymmeyah, Ibnul Qayyim, Ibn Katheer, Ibn Rajab, and many others.[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sufis centered most of their methodology of worship on congregational <strong>Taraaneem</strong> (singing by way of trilling, or quavering and prolonging the voice with a musical sound), resembling the Christians in their churches. Then the Sufis began to introduce <strong>physical movements</strong> during remembrances and du’aa close to those practiced by the Jews. Rarely do you witness a Sufi &#8220;<strong>Hadrah</strong> [2]&#8221; without these innovated practices.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nowadays, the matter is not limited to the Sufi adepts. Many Muslim parties (groups) have innovated special bands for the emotional arousing of their followers and for the &#8220;ummah&#8221; at large! Much of what is being practiced with these anasheed does not escape, at least, one of the following observations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Involving more and more people, especially children, keeping them busy with what could be, least to say, of a lesser benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Anasheed are accompanied with musical toning and chanting (Eastern and Western beats) in the name of &#8220;culture&#8221; and &#8220;tradition.&#8221; This is becoming more and more apparent, with bands competing in their selection of words and beats.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Remembrances of Allah are introduced in these anasheed in ways clearly resembling the intoning and chanting of the Christians in their churches.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The congregational chanting and singing that takes place resembles to a great extent that which goes on in the circles of the mystic Sufis in their singing circles. Former &#8220;stars&#8221; are being more involved with the mystic Sufi ways through so-called &#8220;Islamic anasheed.&#8221; Some bands sing the infamous Shirk poem known as &#8220;Burdah,&#8221; which involves shirk levels of exaggeration in the status of the Prophet Muhammad (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Luring the children to sing, especially the young girls, imitating the base of the infamous Muslim and Non-Muslim singers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Replacing the Qur‘aan with the so-called anasheed in the Da’wah to the young, claiming that they don’t respond to the Qur‘anic texts, therefore, legitimizing their use. The same is done with the Sunnah, eventually turning people away from what constitutes the true life for the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. In many of these singing circles, musical instruments and intoning are gradually taking hold, something known to be forbidden in Islam, except for the duff for women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. The emergence of so-called professional singing groups performing at weddings, parties, schools and the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Development of so called more advanced ways of video singing as a modern way of contemplating and reflecting on the creation of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Allowing taking pictures of young girls during different presentations of songs in itself is a fitnah (affliction and trial) and an opposition to the Sahree’ah. Some make movies and records of these young girls singing on special occasions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Many things that are untrue are presented in these songs through acting, or through exaggeration in praise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. If you examine many of these songs, you will find a lot of them focusing on the Tawheed of Lordship only, something even the Mushriks confess to (i.e. matters pertaining to the signs of Allah in the creation, His running of the affairs, Him being in full authority and the like).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Transgression against the Sharee’ah in the form of acting roles. You see a child taking the role of Salah, saying, &#8220;I am the Salah, and these are my merits!&#8221; Another takes the role of Fasting and so on. Worst of all those who claim to represent the Qur’aan. Yet we know that the Qur‘aan is the uncreated Speech of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Assuming in some cases the movements and walks of some of the losers from the known male and female singers. Imagine when this is done while chanting the remembrances of Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. Calling these anasheed Islamic itself is a transgression, especially when they call it an &#8220;art&#8221; and a means of education and nourishment for the Da&#8217;wah! &#8220;This is an innovation in Deen, and this from the deen of the innovators of the Sufis.&#8221; [3] The companions chanted poetry of wisdom, courage, generosity and of maroo&#8217;ah (describing good character), and not in congregations. They chanted poetry sometimes while working or during night travel. None of them claimed this &#8220;Islamic.&#8221; Rather, everything takes its own particular ruling, whether it is innovated, allowable, recommended, obligated, disliked or forbidden. Therefore, that which may be allowable of it we don’t call &#8220;Islamic&#8221; because if it is called so, people would think it to be from the Deen. And to label any matter as Islamic, requires textual proofs.4 In fact, Sh. Al-Albani (rahimahullaah) referred to them as &#8220;<strong>Sufi singing</strong>&#8220;, and a similar conclusion was reached by Sh. &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz Aal Ash-Shaikh, the Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, as well as by Sh. Bakr Abu Zayeed and Sh. &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz Ar-Raajhi and other scholars (may Allah preserve them all). [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The following question was raised to our Skaykh Muhammed Ibn Saaleh al-‘Uthaimeen (Rahimuhullaah):</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“What is the ruling concerning the anasheeds? Is it permissible for the Caller to Allah to listen to &#8220;Islamic anasheed&#8221;?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Shaykh responded</strong>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In the past, I listened in the past to these Islamic anasheed and there was nothing therein which shuns away. After listening to them recently, I found them to be rhythmic with delectation and entertaining, like the songs accompanied with musical instruments. Accordingly, I don’t see that it is permissible for people to listen to them. However, if they come natural without musical accompaniment and without delectation or entertainment, then there is no harm in listening to them. Still, however, it is conditional that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) the person does not make this a habit listening to them all the time, and<br />
(ii) make not that which benefits and admonishes the heart restricted to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because if he makes of this a habit, he will abandon that which is more important. Moreover, in doing so he will relinquish the greatest admonition and it is that which came in the Book of Allah and in the Sunnah of Allah&#8217;s Messenger. But if he listens to them sometimes, or if takes them as a means of help on his journey while driving his care in the wilderness, then there is no harm in that.&#8221; [6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he was asked, <span style="color:#993300;">“Is it permissible for the man to chant the Islamic anasheed and is it permissible that the duff, which is the tambourine without any of these bells attached to it, is it permissible to use the duff with the chanting and is the chanting or the anasheed permissible in other than the Eed and other than the festivals?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The answer</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Bismillaahir Rahmaanir Raheem, In the Name of Allah The Most Beneficent, The Most Merciful”, then he returned the greeting to the person who asked the Question, and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Islamic anasheed is an innovated chanting innovated by the Sufis. Therefore, one should turn away from it and resort to the admonitions from the Qur‘aan and Sunnah, unless it is used in the battlefields to help as a motivation for Jihaad in the cause of Allah, the Most High, then this is good, however, if it accompanied with the duff, then it would be far away from the truth.” [7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, on several occasions, he (rahimahullaah) directed the people to give the best of attention to the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah, since they are the greatest admonitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A special warning concerning the infamous <strong>Burdah poem of Al-Busiri</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is plain shirk because it exaggerates the Prophet (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) giving him attributes of divinity, as if he knows the unseen and what is written in the preserved tablet. So much of this, unfortunately, is spread throughout the Muslim world and particularly in Southeast Asia, particularly in Indonesia. Think about it. Moreover, they have musical groups in these countries only specialized to sing these poems, especially the &#8220;Burdah&#8221;. In some recent forms, it is &#8220;recited by Khalid Belrhouzi featuring Yusuf Islam (yes!) This is an ad on the net carrying the title: Burdah (audio tape) Khalid Belrhouzi and Yusuf Islam (Arabic + English) [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is stated in this poem, among other things, that ‘And of your knowledge is the knowledge of the pen and the preserved tablet’! The &#8220;pen” refers to the pen which Allah ? commanded it saying: &#8220;Write! It said, &#8216;What should I write, my Rabb (Lord)? Allah said: Write the record of all preordained matter until the commencement of the Hour.&#8221; [9] According to this poet, the Prophet (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) knows what the pen already wrote and what is written in the preserved tablet.

[2] Hadrah: Presence. Used by the Sufis in its general meaning, “Being in the presence of Allah.” In the school of mystic Ibn ‘Arabi, however, there are “Five Divine Presences,” a metaphysical doctrine of the degrees of reality of which there are different versions. This concept is influenced by the Neo-Platonist chain of “Stages or Orders of Being.” [See Mu’jam Al-Mustalahaat As-Sufiyyah by Al-Hafnee, p. 237 and Shorter Encyclopedia of Islam, p. 125, edited by H.A.R. Gibb and J.H. Kramers, 4th impression, 1995. Published by E.J. Brill, Leiden, The Netherlands.] The Mureed is informed that the Hadrah is the start, then the Mukaashafah (Mystic spiritual revelation regarding the Truth [Allah] and the Ghayb (unseen). Through this stage, things will be manifested as if he sees them by his eyes). The next state is the Mushaahadah (Witnessing of the Truth). Sufi singing, clapping, and swaying accompanied by drum beats is part of the &#8220;ritual&#8221;! Some of the mystics also claim the actual attendance of the Prophet (?) in their circles!<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter Five &#8211; ISTIHADAH</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ISTIHADAH is the vaginal bleeding of a woman such that it may not stop or it may stop but for a short period of time (a day or two in each month).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) <strong>Bleeding that does not stop:</strong> &#8216;Aisha (radyAllaahu &#8216;anha) related that: &#8220;Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish said to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">I do not become clean (i.e., bleeding is not ending)</span> and in one narration &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">I got persistent bleeding (in between the periods) and I do not become clean</span>&#8221; [49].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) <strong>Bleeding that stops for a short period of time</strong>: Humnah bint Jahsh came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">My menstruation was great in quantity and severe</span>&#8220;[50].</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Several States of Istihadah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>ONE</strong>: The woman has a known period of normal cycles of menses prior to Istihadah. The woman in this case refers to her previously known period of menses and during this period she applies all the rules regarding Salat, Fasting etc. Bleeding in days other than this reference period is considered as Istihadah with all associated rules being applicable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: A woman used to get normal bleeding for six days at the beginning of each month. She then started to have prolonged bleeding. For this woman her <strong>Haid (Menses)</strong> period should be the &#8220;first six days of every month&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following extra vaginal bleeding is her Istihadah. This is in accordance with the Hadeeth of &#8216;Aisha (radyAllaahu &#8216;anha) who narrated that: &#8220;Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;I got persistent bleeding (in between the periods) and do not become clean. Shall I give up prayers? He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) replied: No, this is from a blood vessel. <span style="color:#008000;">Give up the prayers only for the days on which you usually get the menses and then take a bath and offer your prayers</span>&#8220;[51].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Saheeh Muslim, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Umm Habeebah bint Jahsh who had a prolonged flow of blood to &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">refrain (from prayer) during your menstrual period, then wash and pray</span>&#8221; [52]. Having done this she should pray and pay attention to any flowing blood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>TWO</strong>: The woman does not have a known period of normal cycles of menses prior to Istihadah. To be able to distinguish between her blood from normal menses and her Istihadah blood, she should watch for some characteristics of these two types of blood. <span style="color:#ff6600;">Haid blood may be characterized by thickness, darkness or certain distinct odor.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: a woman sees a continuous blood flow but she sees it dark for the first ten days and red for the rest of the month. Or it looks thick for the first ten days and soft for the rest of the month, or for the first ten days it has the characteristic odor of Haid blood and it becomes odorless for the rest of the month. So her Haid period is the dark blood flow for the first example, the thick blood for the second and the one with the distinct odor for the third. The bleeding that follows is considered Istihadah. It is related that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Fatimah bint Abi Jahsh: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">When the blood of menses comes, it is black and can be recognized; so when that comes, refrain from prayer, but when a different type of blood comes, perform ablution and pray, for it is (due only to) a vein</span>.&#8221; [53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THREE</strong>: The woman does not have a known period of Haid and lacks the distinctive characteristics mentioned above!. Blood flow is continuous carrying the same quality or flowing with abnormal qualities that make it hard to distinguish the Haid bleeding from that of the Istihadah bleeding. In this case, women encountering this prolonged and undetermined type of flow should consider their Haid period to be the period encountered by most women: 6-7 days of Haid flow per month, starting from the time she sees the flowing blood. Other than this period, the blood flowing should be considered as Istihadah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: A woman sees her blood for the first time on the fifth day of the month and it continues to flow while she is unable to distinguish any difference in color, odor or thickness of blood. Her Haid period should be six or seven days starting on the fifth day of each month. This is in lieu of the Hadeeth of Hamnah bint Jahsh (radyAllaahu &#8216;anha). She said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Messenger of Allah I am a woman who menstruates in great quantity and it is severe, so what do you think about it? It has prevented me from praying and fasting&#8221;</span>. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I recommend that you should use cotton, put it on your private part, for it absorbs the blood. She replied: &#8220;It is too copious for that&#8230;&#8221; In this Hadeeth, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;This is a stroke of the devil, so observe your menses for six or seven days, Allah alone knows which it should be; then wash and when you see that you are purified, and quite clean, pray during twenty three or twenty four days and nights and fast, for that will be enough for you.&#8221;</span> [54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) &#8220;for six or seven days&#8221; is not meant to give Hamnah bint Jahsh the choice but just for her to examine and find out who (amongst other women) is closer to her in age, body structure, number of children, etc. the woman that mostly resembles her condition has a Haid period of six days, then she should consider this period as her reference. The same is true if the Haid period was seven days.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The One Who Resembles The Mustahadah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that something (e.g. surgery) may cause the flow of blood through the vagina. There are two types of this case:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) It is not possible for her to have menses following surgery e.g. removal of the uterus or its blockage. Under this case, the ruling of Istihadah cannot be applicable. If the woman sees blood, then the laws governing the <strong>yellowish discharge</strong> (see above) apply. Hence she should not refrain from performing prayers or fasting. It is not prohibited for her husband to have sexual intercourse with her and it is not obligatory upon her to have a bath. She must, however, wash, clean, and make ablution at the commencing time of the obligatory prayers and when she intends to offer the optional prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) It is not certain that her menses will stop following surgery. It is possible that she may have menses. In this case the rulings applicable on a Mustahadah (woman going through Istihadah) are also applicable on this condition in lieu of the Hadeeth of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">It is from a blood vessel, so when the real menses begins give up your prayers and when it (the period) has finished wash the blood off your body (have a full shower) and offer your prayers.&#8221;</span>[55] The saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم): &#8220;when the real menses begins&#8221; indicates that the rules for the Mustahadah woman are applicable upon the woman who, potentially, may have menses (with a beginning and an end). The woman, however, without a potentially occurring menses, her blood is a vessel blood.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Rulings About The Mustahadah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Earlier it was explained when the blood is considered a menses (Haid) blood or Istihadah blood. The rulings applicable for menses and Istihadah depend upon the type of the flowing blood. Rulings about menses were discussed earlier. The rulings about Istihadah are the same as those applicable to a clean woman except for the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) It is obligatory upon the Mustahadah to perform Ablution for each prayer, because of the order of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to Fatimah bint Abi Hubaish: &#8220;Then make Ablution for every Salat&#8221; [56], meaning that she should make ablution only when the prescribed time of Salat begins and not before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) Prior to ablution she should wash the traces of blood and covers her private part with a pad of cotton to absorb the blood. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Humnah bint Jahsh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I recommend that you should use cotton, for it absorbs blood.&#8221; She said: &#8220;it is too copious for that&#8221;. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said; &#8220;then take a cloth.&#8221; She replied, &#8220;it is too copious for that.&#8221; He said: &#8220;then Talaj&#8217;jami&#8221; i.e., to prepare a holding around the waist that will maintain the cotton pad tightly attached to her private part. Nothing that comes out should then harm her because the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told Fatimah bint Hubaish: &#8220;Refrain from Salat during the days of your normal menses then wash and make ablution for every Salat and then pray &#8220;even if blood drops onto the mat!&#8221; (Related by Imam Ahmad and Ibn Majah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(3) Sexual Intercourse: Scholars disagreed about its permissibility. The correct opinion is that it is permissible because many women (ten or more) had their Istihadah at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Allah and His Messenger did not prevent spouses from engaging in sexual intercourse. In fact, the saying of Allah (subhana wa ta&#8217;ala) :</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">( { فاعتَزِلُوا النِّساء في المَحيض } الأية (البقرة، 222<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Keep away from women during menses&#8221;</span><br />
(Qur&#8217;an 2: 222),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">is an evidence that it is only obligatory to keep away from sexual intercourse with women only during menses. And since offering prayers is allowed while in Istihadah, then there should be no difficulty in having sexual intercourse. To prevent sexual intercourse based upon Qiyass (analogy) with the state of Haid is incorrect, because the two situations are not the same. Deduction of rulings by Qiyass is invalid whenever there are existing variations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: During Menses, it is not unlawful to celebrate Allah&#8217;s Praises (Saying Takbeer, Tasbeeh, and Tahmeed),[29] saying Bismillah before acting upon something (eating, drinking, etc..), reading Hadeeth, Islamic discussions, invocation upon Allah (Dua&#8217;), and listening to the recitation of Qur&#8217;an.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed by &#8216;Aisha (radhi Allaahu anha) that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;lean on my lap and recite Qur&#8217;an while I was in menses&#8221;</span> (Al-Bukhari and Muslim).[30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also Umm &#8216;Atiyya reported that she heard the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Unmarried young virgins and the mature girl who stay often screened or the young unmarried virgins who often stayscreened and the menstruating women should come out and participate in the good deeds as well as the religious gathering of the faithful believers but the menstruating women should keep away from the Musalla (praying place).&#8221;</span> [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Case</strong>: The reciting of the Qur&#8217;an by a menstruating woman either via direct looking or silently (in her heart) without the actual uttering by the tongue is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The majority of the scholars are with the opinion that it is not prohibited for her to utter the Qur&#8217;anic recitation. Imam Bukhari, Ibn Jareer At- Tabaree and Ibn Al-Munthir, Imam Malik, and Imam Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee (in one of his earlier sayings) are with the opinion that it is permissible for her to recite the Ayah (verse in the Qur&#8217;an).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shayekul Islam Ibn Taymeeyah said: &#8220;Basically, there is no Sunnah to prevent her from reciting Qur&#8217;an. The &#8220;hadeeth&#8221; that: &#8220;A menstruating woman and the one who is in state of Jannabah [32] should not recite anything of the Qur&#8217;an&#8221;, is a weak hadeeth as agreed upon by the knowledgeable scholars of Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact women at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) used to have their monthly cycles of menses.Had the recitation of Qur&#8217;an been prohibited for them (as it is the case with Salat) then the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would have made it clear to his Ummah (Islamic community) and his wives would have known about it and they would have dissipated this knowledge to the people. Because no one had related a prohibition by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about this issue, then it cannot be made unlawful especially when it is known that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not prohibit it at the time when menses was very much present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Accordingly, recitation by the tongue is not Haram (legally unlawful).[33] This author said: &#8220;having known the dispute between the scholars about this matter, then it is more proper for the menstruating woman not to recite Qur&#8217;an by the tongue except when it is necessary e.g. if she is a teacher or if she is preparing for an exam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] Takbeer: saying Allahu Akbar (Allah is The Greatest); Tasbeeh: saying Subhana Allah (Most Glorified is Allah); Tahmeed: saying Al Hamdulil&#8217;lah: All Praise is due to Allah.<br />
[30] Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic-English) V.1, P.179, Hadeeth # 296.<br />
[31] Agreed upon Hadeeth. In Saheeh Al-Bukhari (Arabic- English), V. 1, P. 192, Hadeeth # 321.<br />
[32] Jannabah: Is the state in which a man (or a woman) has sexual discharge during sexual intercourse or in a dream, etc. In this state a Muslim is not allowed to pray or do other kinds of worships unless and until he (she) performs Ghusl (have a full shower) or do Tayammum if he/she cannot use water for any reason.<br />
[33] Ibin Taymeeyah in Al-Fatawa (religious decrees) V. 26, P. 191.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">How to Respond to the Dahrees [37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 20:</strong> We know that the Dahrees, who are many nowadays and who are considered from the intellect because they think and infer, are agreed upon the belief in the non-existence of Allaah, The Mighty and Majestic. So, how to respond to people like this?</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[37] <strong>Dahrees</strong>: People who deny the existence of Allaah and claim that ad- Dahr (time) manages and disposes the affairs of the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, The Most High, says concerning them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And they say: “There is nothing but our life of this world, we die and we live and nothing destroys us except ad-Dahr (time). And they have no knowledge of it: they only conjecture.”</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Jaathiyah (45): 24].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Allaah Said, ‘The son of Adam annoys Me for he abuses Ad-Dahr though I am Ad- Dahr (Time); in My Hands are all things, and I cause the revolution of day and night’.”</span> [Agreed upon hadeeth. Saheeh al-Bukhaaree, vol. 6, no.351].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement “I am ad-Dahr,” means that Allaah is The One Who manages Time as explained in the hadeeth itself: <span style="color:#008000;">“In My Hands are all things [including Time].</span>” Allaah is The One who Created everything and who disposes the affairs of everything [including Time]. It is wrong, therefore, to attribute anything to Time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> First I would like to comment on your saying that they are intellectual. So, if you mean by the intellect that of contemplation, then yes! They are intellectuals who contemplate and understand; and if you mean by that the maturity of the intellect and its following of the right way in its affairs (Rushd), then they are not intellectuals. That is why Allaah described the Kuffaar as deaf, dumb, and blind, so they have no sense. They are, however, intellectuals–having the intellect of contemplation, through which evidence is established upon them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality when they say that Allaah does not exist they say this out of arrogance, otherwise they know it is impossible that an erected door makes itself exist nor does it make itself stand upright. They know that it is inevitable that such door needed a carpenter or a blacksmith to build. It is also certain that it needed a construction worker to install. Indeed they know the food they eat and the water they drink definitely is in need of someone to produce and that the food is in need of someone to sow its seeds. They also know that it is impossible for anyone from the people to create such seed-produce, nor to make its seed grow to become a standing crop having stems and bearing fruits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They know all of this, and they know that this is something which humans are incapable of doing. They, however, are being arrogant, and there is no benefit in debating with an arrogant. He will never accept [the truth], no matter what it may be. If you tell him, “This is the sun” and it is right before him, he will not accept. It is a waste of time to argue with people of this kind, and, as stated by some scholars, the way to invite them is to contend with them in fight not in debates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Advising the one who says &#8220;Taqwa is here&#8221; and he continues to Sin</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>A Doubt and its Rebuttle</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 15:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">What lead to this question is that nowadays there is a group of people when they are called to worship Allaah they say: “Allaah is the Rabb of the hearts.” We would like also that you comment on this response?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> We say that Allaah is indeed the Rabb of the hearts as well as the tongues. He is not the Rabb of the hearts only; and if the hearts become good then the limbs become good, because the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, there is a piece of flesh in the body, if it becomes good [reformed], the whole of the body becomes good but if it gets spoilt the whole body gets spoilt and that is the heart.</span> [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadeeth renders the futile and false the claim by some, who when you advise him in regard to certain things with which he disobeys Allaah, he says: “at-Taqwaa [30] is right here,” and he points towards his chest.[31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His is a word of truth intended to imply something futile. In fact a word may be true in its general sense, but the speaker intends to imply by it a futile meaning. Indeed think of the Saying of Allaah, The Most High, concerning the Mushriks:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Mushriks will say: “If Allaah had willed, we would have not committed Shirk, nor would our fathers, and we would not have forbidden anything [against His Will]!</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 148].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they said: “If Allaah had willed, we would have not committed Shirk,” and they were truthful in that which they said. Because if Allaah had willed, they would have not committed Shirk. They, however, did not intend the truth by using this word. Rather, they wanted to justify their staying on their Shirk and the lifting of punishment from upon them. This is why Allaah, The Most High, Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Likewise belied those who were before them, [they argued falsely with Allaah’s Messengers], till they tasted of Our Wrath.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 148].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, of no avail to them was the use of al-Qadar [32] [Allaah’s Pre-decree] as a plea when they intended it to be a justification for continuing on their Shirk, and an excuse for lifting the blame and punishment from upon themselves. [33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The actual fact, however, is exactly as they have put it: “If Allaah had not willed, they would not have committed Shirk,” as Allaah, The Most High, said to His Messenger:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Follow what has been inspired to you [O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم] from your Rabb, Laa Ilaaha Illaa Huwa [none has the right to be worshipped but He] and turn aside from the Mushriks. Had Allaah willed, they would have not committed Shirk.</span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 106-107].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is, however, a difference between the two cases. In the latter case, Allaah Said to His Prophet (what means): “Had Allaah willed, they would have not committed Shirk,” in order to clarify that their Shirk occurs by His Will, and that He, The One free of all imperfections, The Most High, has a Wisdom as to the committing of Shirk by them; and in order to comfort His Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that this action of theirs (Shirk) takes place by His, The Exalted and Most High’s, Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the important thing is that the person who says when you give him advice: “at-Taqwaa is here [i.e. in his heart],” has said a true word indeed. However, he intended by it something futile and false, because the one who said: “at- Taqwaa is here&#8230;” is the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم, the same one who also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, there is a piece of flesh in the body, if it becomes good [reformed], the whole of the body becomes good&#8230;”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If there is Taqwaa in the heart, then it is imperative that there is Taqwaa in the limbs, and the outward actions are a sign of the inward actions of the heart.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] An agreed upon hadeeth. See Saheeh al-Bukhaaree, vol.1, no. 49.<br />
[30] The true meaning of at-Taqwaa is fearing Allaah and hoping for His Mercy by executing His Commands and staying away from all that He has forbidden.<br />
[31] The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in the authentic hadeeth reported by Muslim said: <span style="color:#008000;">“A Muslim is the brother of a Muslim. He neither oppresses him nor humiliates him nor looks down upon him. The Taqwaa is here [and while saying so] he pointed towards his chest thrice.”</span> See Saheeh Muslim, vol. 4, no.6219.<br />
[32] Al-Qadar: Allaah’s Pre-ordainment of the creation in accordance with His Foreknowledge, and in accordance with His Wisdom.<br />
[33] In his book Sharh al-Usool ath-Thalaathah, Shaykh Muhammd Bin ‘Uthaymeen, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said:<span style="color:#008000;"> “If there had been any excuse for them in al-Qadar then Allaah would not have sent down His Punishment upon them.”</span> See Sharh al-Usool ath-Thalaathah [English Translation by brother Daawood Burbank], p.186, Daar al- Hidaayah Publishing, Birmingham, U.K.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 2:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">Is there a meaning for &#8216;Ibaadah (worship) such that it is possible for us to know of? Does it have a general and a specific meaning?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> Yes. Its general meaning is as I have indicated earlier, namely the submission to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with love and awe by doing that which He commands and avoiding that which He has forbidden, and in the manner set forth by His legislations. This is the general meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The specific meaning, i.e. its meaning in detail, then, as Shaykh-ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is a comprehensive name covering whatever Allaah loves and is pleased with, both sayings and actions, the apparent and the hidden, such as fearing (Khawf), having awe (Khashyah), having true trust and reliance (Tawakkul), Prayers (Salaat), Zakaat (obligatory charity), Fasting (Siyaam) and the like, from the ordinances of Islaam.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then if you mean that the general and specific meaning [of &#8216;Ibaadah] is what has been mentioned by some scholars, namely that &#8216;Ibaadah is either <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Kawniyyah</strong> </span>or <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shar&#8217;iyyah</span></strong>, meaning that man could be in a Kawniyyah and Shar&#8217;iyyah state of submission to Allaah, then the Kawniyyah worship is a general one, comprising the believer and unbeliever and the righteous as well as the wicked, due to the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes to Ar-Rahmaan as a slave.</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, soorat Maryam (19): 93].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore all that is in the heavens and the earth is, in the universal sense (Kawnee), submitting to Allaah, The One free from all imperfection. None can stand to oppose Allaah or work against Him in whatever He wants as to His Universal Will.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the specific worship, <strong>al-&#8216;Ibaadah ash-Shari&#8217;yyah</strong>, which is the submission to Allaah, the Most High&#8217;s, Shar'(legislation), then this is specific to the believers in Allaah, the One free of all imperfection, who carry out His Command. Then some of this is more specific and some is less. The more specific worship is like that of the Messengers &#8216;alyayhimussalaatu was salaam as signified in the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion (of right and wrong, i.e. this Qur&#8217;aan) to His slave (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم).</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, sooart al-Furqaan (25): 1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and Christians) are in doubt concerning that which We have sent down (i.e. Qur&#8217;aan) to Our slave (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم), then produce a Soorah of the like thereof and call your witnesses (supporters and helpers) besides Allaah, if you are truthful.</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, soorat al-Baqarah (2): 23],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And remember Our slaves, Ibraaheem, Ishaaq, and Ya&#8217;qoob, [all] owners of strength [in worshipping Us] and [also] of religious understanding,</span> [Qur&#8217;aan, soorat Saad (38): 45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the likes of these ayaat describe the Messengers, &#8216;alayhimus-salaat was-salaam, with al-&#8216;Uboodiyyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 3:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">Would those specifically choosing al-&#8216;Ibaadah al-Kawniyyah and excluding al-&#8216;Ibaadah ash-Shar&#8217;iyya, be rewarded?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer</strong>: Those will not be rewarded for it, because they are submitting to Allaah willingly or unwillingly. And so man may get sick, turn poor, and lose(s) his beloved ones having no desire whatsoever for this. In fact, he dislikes it. But this is submission to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, in the universal (Kawnee) sense.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Some Soofis like to link the name to <strong>Ahlus-Suffah</strong> (people of As-Suffah) who were at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They claim that there are great resemblances between the Soofee adept and Ahlu-Suffa. Those were poor people from the Muhaajireen who migrated from Makkah to al-Madeenah fleeing the persecution of the pagan Arabs. They were driven away from their homes and had neither money nor families, nor a place to stay. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and the companions (radhi Allaahu anhum) assisted them and he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) allowed them to stay in a courtyard by his Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fact, however, is that those poor Muslims resorted to the Mosque <strong>out of necessity</strong>. Their numbers increased at certain times and decreased at other times. Some of them stayed longer than others. So they were not a specific group united on something.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Soofism in its early stages stressed the concepts of <strong>detachment from the worldly life, poverty, isolation</strong>, etc. <span style="color:#993300;">The people of As-Suffah did not choose such concepts</span>. They were in need and the Muslims helped them. They did not isolate themselves. In fact, they <strong>engaged in Jihaad</strong> whenever it was announced. When Allaah, the Most High, bestowed from His bounties upon the Muslims, <strong>some of them became free of want and were among the richest of the Sahaabah</strong> and others became <strong>leaders in some Muslim lands</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Soofis would like to establish a linkage with the Prophet’s era and claim as well that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) approved the early seed of Soofism exemplified in Ahlus-Suffah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, and from a linguistic point of view, to derive Soofism from As-Suffah is wrong, because the correct term would be <strong>Suffism</strong> and not Soofism</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim believes that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah and the last Prophet. Allaah (Azza wa Jal) says: <span style="color:#008000;">Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allaah and the last of the Prophets</span>. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Ahzaab, 33:40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah entrusted Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) with the final and complete message of Islam, calling mankind to worship none but Allaah. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the best of the Messengers and the best of mankind. He, has no share at all of Ruboobiyyah (lordship) nor any share of Divinity. Contemplate the saying of Allaah regarding Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say, O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), it is not within my power to bring benefit nor to keep away harm except as Allaah wills; and if I knew what the future holds I could amass a great deal of wealth and harm would not befall me. But I am just a Messenger from Allaah sent by Him to warn those who disobey Him of His punishment, and to give glad tidings of His reward fro those who truly believe in Him and are obedient to Him.</span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-A’raaf, 7:188].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">I am just a human like yourselves, I forget just as you forget. So, if I forget, then remind me.</span>” [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The belief that Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the Messenger of Allaah necessitates that</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the true Messenger of Allaah; he did not lie nor was he belied.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-The Muslim should follow his teachings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3-The Muslim believes in all of the reports which he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) related regarding the past, present and future and that these reports were revealed to him by Allaah (Azza wa Jal) and was not something which he knew on his own.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4-We comply with his commands</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5-We stay away from what he forbade</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6-We defend the Sharee’ah with which he was entrusted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7-We comply with all that the he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) brought from the Sharee’ah as if it were from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In the sight of the mystic Soofis,</strong></span> the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is looked upon in ways that oppose the path which Allaah (Azza wa Jal) intended for the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This could be summarized in the following points:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-Many Soofis stress the concept of what they call <strong>Al- Haqeeqah Al-Muhammadiyyah</strong> or the <strong>“Perfect Man” (Al- Insaan Al-Kaamil)</strong>. In the world of Soofism, Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil is the “barrier” qualified with both the Essence of Allaah and the essence of creation. And he is the one who comprises all the worlds of the Divine and that of creation, the complete and the partial. He deserves the Names of the Thaat (Allaah’s Essence) and the Divine Qualities. The Soofee mystics refer to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as being the “Perfect Man” or the “Al- Haqeeqah Al-Muhammadiyyah”: The Thaat (Essence of Allaah) in its first designation; to him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) belongs all of the Most Beautiful Names [of Allaah] and that he is Al-Ism Al-A’tham (Allaah’s Greatest Name). From Muhammad, the entire creation, this world and the Hereafter, was brought to exist!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is most fully described by ‘Abdul al-Karim Al-Jeeli (d.820Hj/1417 C.E.), a Soofee of the school of Ibn ‘Arabi, in his book Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil. [29] In this book he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Know, may Allaah guard and protect you, that Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil (the Perfect Man) is the Qutub (the axis) around which the spheres of existence from beginning to end revolves. And he is one since the being of existence and forever and ever. Furthermore, he takes on various forms and appears in churches&#8230;his original name which belongs to him is Muhammad&#8230;I met him while he was in the image of my sheikh Sharaf-ud-Deen Ismaa’eel Al- Jhubratee&#8230;the secret behind this matter is him being able to take the form of every image&#8230;” [30]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is the same creed of Ibn ‘Arabi and the advocates of <strong>Wahdat Al-Wujud</strong>, those who claim that Allaah is the essence of all that exits. They consider the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as the first created being and from him originated rest of creation and that he himself is the God who is above the Throne. Such concept is similar to the philosophical concept of the “<strong>first cause</strong>” or the “<strong>first active intellect</strong>” from whom the creation emanated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-Some Soofis hold to the same concept as above but do not say that the essence of Muhammad is above the ‘Arsh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3-Many Soofis claim that <strong>the light of Muhammad</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the first being, and that he is the most honorable of creation, and for his sake Allaah has created the universe. They do not explicitly say that the creatures originated from him. [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Most Soofis, however, concur that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the <strong>essence of emanation of all knowledge</strong>. Some of them consider that this emanation is eternal, meaning that it is present even before the existence of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). That is why a large sector of the Soofis believe that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) <strong>knows the Ghayb</strong> and that nothing escapes his knowledge in the heavens and on the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They have also innovated many practices aimed at showing their so-called love of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) including <strong>celebrations of the Prophet’s birthday</strong> and his journey of <strong>Israa’ and Mi’raaj</strong>, his <strong>Hadrah</strong>, [32] and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They even <strong>call upon the Prophet</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم) seeking aid and help believing that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) responds and answers such Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such concepts, beliefs, and practices concerning the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) are corrupt and contradict the Message of the Qur’aan and Sunnah as well as the way of the true believers, the Sahaabah and those who followed them on the path of righteousness, may Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third Part-Concepts and Practices of Soofism</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>(A) In Reference to Tawheed of Allaah, the Most High.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief in the Oneness of Allaah (Tawheed) means to single out Allaah with creation, sovereignty and control of affairs, with all worship, and with whatever names and attributes He has affirmed for Himself or upon the tongue of His Messenger and as they befit His Magnificence. The proof of this is in many texts from the Qur’aan and authentic Sunnah. One of them is the saying of Allaah, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">[Allaah is] the Rabb of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, Ar-Rahmaan (the one whose Mercy encompasses everything), so worship him alone and be patient and firm on his worship, do you know of any who is similar to Him?</span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Maryam, 19:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Tawheed centers upon three types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-<strong>Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah (Tawheed of Lordship)</strong>: Singling out Allaah with creation, sovereignty and control of Affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-<strong>Tawheed al-Uloohiyyah (Tawheed of Worship)</strong>: Singling out Allaah with all worship such that no kind of worship could be offered to anyone or anything besides Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3-<strong>Tawheed al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat:</strong> Singling out Allaah with whatever names and attributes He has affirmed for Himself in His Book, or upon the tongue of His Messenger. So the believer affirms what Allaah has affirmed for Himself, and denying whatever He has denied from Himself, without Tahreef (changing and distorting their meanings), without Ta’teel (denying or divesting Allaah of His Attributes), without Takyeef (describing how they are), and without Tamtheel (likening them to those of His creation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">This true belief in Tawheed is not the “Tawheed” of the foremost Soofis. Their Tawheed reflects different creeds and is considered by many as “hidden knowledge” which may be only attained by the elite:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>01 &#8211; Al-Hulool:[13] In mystic Soofism it refers to the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Divine incarnation</span> in the so-called Soofee saints.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam ibn Taymeeyah classified the <strong>Hulool</strong> into two kinds. The first is the specific hulool like the claim of the Christians that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Eessa (alayhi assaalm) and like that of the extremist Shee’ah and Soofee mystics who claim that Allaah is incarnated in ‘Ali ibn Abee Taalib (radhi Allahu anhu) and in special Soofee saints, respectively. The second kind is the general Hulool and it is the saying that “Allaah, in His Essence, is everywhere.” [14] <span id="more-34648"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Amongst the most daring Soofis who held to the concept of incarnation was <strong>Al-Hallaaj</strong> [15] who was tried for his heresy and put to death by the ‘Abbaasid authorities. Ibn ‘Ajeebah (1224 AH/1809 C.E.), one of the leading Soofis who explained the Hikam of the mystic Ibn ‘Ataa (d. 709AH/1309 C.E.) related that Al-Hallaj said: “<em>I am You without doubt Subhaanak is Subhaanee. Your Tawheed is my Tawheed and disobeying You is disobeying me. Glorified be He whom his Naassoot (creation, human qualities) made manifest the secret of His shining and piercing Laahoot (the Divine)</em>.[16] He then appeared in His creation manifested in the image of the one who eats and drinks. Even His creation was able to see Him with their own eyes like the moment an eyebrow sees an eyebrow [emphasizing certitude].” [17] Ibn ‘Ajeebah added, “And because of the unraveling of such matters and other similar ones, Al-Hallaaj, may Allaah be pleased with him! -was killed.”[18] These matters according to Ibn ‘Ajeebah and other mystics should not be disclosed. They are the secrets of their Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>02 &#8211; Some see Allaah as the only existing being. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is stressed by <strong>Al-Ghazaalee</strong>, may Allaah forgive him, in his book <strong>Ihyaa ‘Ulum ad-Deen</strong>. He said: “<em>Anyone who does not see Allaah in everything, then he sees ‘other’ than Him,</em>” and that “<em>The pure Tawheed is to see in everything nothing but Allaah subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala.</em>” [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of such “Tawheed” is that there is one existing being and that is Allaah. The one who sees an existence other than that of Allaah is the Mushrik (who commits Shirk). Al-Ghazaalee explained the perfect understanding of la ilaaha illa Allaah as: “To see none except the One, the Truth,&#8221; and that this represents the “perfect state of Tawheed!” He referred to a state of “Tawheed,” “witnessed by the sincere ones and which the Soofis call Al-Fanaa’ (annihilation) in Tawheed” as the one in which, “Only One (i.e. Allaah) is seen in the entire existence.” Al- Ghazaalee stresses that the utmost objective of Tawheed is to see, “Al-Kull (everything) not as Katheer (many), but as one,” and that this “represents the objective of the (Soofee) knowledge known as Kashf,” and that, “The secrets of this knowledge should not be recorded in a book.” He defined the Mushrik as the one, “Who affirms the existence of ‘an existence’ besides that of Allaah” and that Allaah is, “The witness and the Witnessed, the one loving dearly and the Beloved, and He is the Shaakir (the one who is thankful) and the Mashkoor (The One Who deserves acknowledgment and recognition)…”[20] This is not true Tawheed in which the believer knows well that Allaah is distinct and separate from His creation, rather this is “Wahdah” (unity).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Doctrine of Wahdat Al-Wujud.</strong></span> This is neither <strong>Hulool</strong> (indwelling of Allaah in creation) nor <strong>Ittihaad</strong> (union between Allaah and the created), rather it means that every creature that the eye sees is Allaah in essence. This concept of the Unity of Existence is held by many of the so-called Soofee saints (Awliyaa’) like Ibn Al-Faarid (d. 632AH/1235 C.E.), Ibn ‘Arabi (d. 638AH/1240 C.E.), Ibn ‘Sab’een (d. 669 AH/1270 C.E.), Al-‘Afeef At-Tilmisaani (d. 690 AH/1291C.E.), Ibn Masheesh (d. 622 AH/1225 C.E.), An- Nabulusi (d. 1143 AH/1731 C.E.), and others. Under such concept, the presence of creation is an illusion or an imagination. Many Soofis consider Ibn ‘Arabi the Greatest sheikh and the symbol of the concept of Wahdat Al-Wujud. He considers the Soofee who knows of Allaah (‘Aarif billaah) as the one who “Sees Allaah in everything, rather he sees Him the essence of Everything,” [21] and that “He (Allaah) is the Essence of Existence” [22] Ibn ‘Arabi considered all kinds creeds to be true and he believed in them all. This is his “Unity of Worship”: Creatures have held [certain] tenets regarding the Ilaah And I have believed in all of what they have believed in.[23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: “Be careful not to restrict yourself to a particular (or distinct) creed and deny everything else otherwise you would miss a great deal of good. Rather you would miss knowing the matter as it is. So, be within yourself an HexhqKy (Hayouli: A substance) for all the forms of creeds, for Allaah is Greater than being limited by one creed and excluding another.” [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of Ibn ‘Arabi contain many statements in which he considers everything worshipped on earth is Allaah [25] and that his heart “turned to accept every image”; it became “a monastery for monks, a home for idols, the Ka’bah of the Taa’if (the one in Tawaaf), the Tablets of the Torah, and the book of the Qur’aan&#8230;” [26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is only a very brief presentation on the position of mystic Soofism regarding the belief in Allaah Who is High above what they attribute to Him. Imaam Ath-Thahabee rahimahullah said regarding the book of Fusoos Al-Hikam of Ibn ‘Arabi: “If there is no Kufr in it [Fusoos], then there is no Kufr in this world!” [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Hulool: lit. “settling,” “alighting,” “lodging,” “descent,” and by extension “incarnation”. The most common definition is that it refers to the doctrine of Divine incarnation in the human form.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Second Part: When Did It All Start? [9]<br />
<strong>The Beginning and Development of Soofism</strong><br />
<span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Innovations usually start small then grow big</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars traced the seeds of Soofism to the early stages of the <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>second Century of the Hijri calendar</strong></span>, while others pointed out that the early features of it began before the year 200 After Hijrah (AH).10 The early deviation was exemplified in <strong>exaggerations in worship</strong> and <strong>extremism in avoidance of the worldly life</strong>. In the beginning, some people became interested in leading a pious life of Zuhd (an abstemious way of life), patience, clemency, sincerity, truthfulness, although some of them exaggerated and (or) introduced innovated forms of worship and innovated concepts. Then those who attached themselves to such practices became lax in allowing <strong>singing and dancing</strong>, something which they refer to as <strong>Samaa’</strong> [singing aimed at stimulating a state of <strong>Wajd (ecstasy)</strong> and excessive worship.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As, with every Bid’ah, Iblees beautifies it in the eyes of its beholder and drives him to do more Bida’. The Soofism is just one case of Talbees Iblees (A devil’s deception), whereby he turned them away from knowledge and showed them that what matters is action. Though many of them may have started with good intentions, nevertheless they took off from the course of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>During of the third century</strong></span>, introduction of new concepts and practices became more evident. Some became interested in <strong>monasticism (living like monks)</strong>, while others spoke of <strong>poverty, hunger, sleeplessness, wonderment, seclusions, dancing, clamping, innovated forms of Thikr</strong>, etc. Many <strong>abandoned marriage and the seeking of means of sustenance</strong>. Others exaggerated in disassociating themselves from Hadeeth and its knowledge. In the course of this development, the masters would put certain regulations that made them see themselves as the “special” who have “special inward knowledge” that takes the person directly to Allaah. They referred to this state as <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-&#8216;Ilm Al-Baatin (special &#8220;inward&#8221; knowledge)</strong></span>. Such baseless classifications marked the beginning of the introduction of the so-called <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;knowledge of Al-Haqeeqah (lit. Reality)</span></strong>, in reference to the so-called &#8220;<strong>mystic knowledge</strong>&#8221; of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>By the end of this century</strong></span>, Soofism spread and Soofee orders began to sprout and some of its deviant creeds like <strong>Al- Hulool</strong> (indwelling of Allaah in incarnation), <strong>Ittihaad</strong> (union between Allaah and the created) were adopted by some of their extreme masters. New states of Soofism were defined and the masters spoke of specific terminology defining such states, like <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Fanaa</strong></span>’ (annihilation), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Thawq</strong> </span>(experience), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Kashf</strong> </span>(perception and witnessing all of the realities of existence as well as those of the unseen), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wajd</strong> </span>(ecstasy), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Samaa</strong></span>&#8216; (mystic singing and dancing as a means of inspiration), and other philosophical terms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>During the 4th century</strong></span>, Soofism was almost transformed into orders accommodating all sorts of Bida’ in ‘Aqeedah (creed) and Ittibaa&#8217; (way of following). It was a blend for every sect. Amongst them you find the Jahmiyyah, the Mu’atazilite, the Maatureedi, the Ash’aree, the Shee’iee, the philosopher, the Murj’i, the Jabri, and followers of all sorts of Ahwaa’(desires and innovations). For Ahlul Ahwaa&#8217; (followers of lowly desirers and innovations), Soofism became a universal ground which they penetrate in the name of spiritual guidance</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>During the sixth century</strong></span>, a group of mystic Soofis claimed to be descendents of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and each one of them established for himself a special Soofee order with special followers. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ar-Rifaa’i</strong></span> appeared in ‘Iraaq, <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Badawi</strong></span> and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ash-Shaathili</strong></span> in Egypt. These orders branched into other orders. In this century and in the next two, the Soofee Fitnah reached its climax with the ‘Aqeedah of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wahdat Al-Wujood</strong></span> (Unity of Existence), appearance of new Bida’ (building on graves and magnifying them, innovated celebrations, etc.), more Soofee orders and more superstitions. This was supported by the establishment in Egypt of the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Ubaydiiyyah State</strong></span> (known as the <strong>Fatimid State</strong>), which spread its influence over many Muslim lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, during the latter centuries, the ninth, tenth, and eleventh, the Soofee orders reached the thousands and the Soofee practices and affiliation spread over the entire Muslim world. Today, Soofism has establishments, preachers, funding, and almost unrestricted movement of its people across the borders of many Muslim and non-Muslim countries. As to its most important objectives, I leave it to a Soofee enthusiast well known in the circles of Soofism, Saayed Hossein Nasr, who stated that, “All that we can do is to stress that the Soofee teachings center upon two fundamental creeds: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wahdat Al-Wujood</strong></span>, and <strong>Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil (the Perfect Man)</strong>. [11] [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During all of this past of Soofism and nowadays, Soofism was not left without challenge. The Salaf gave their advice and warned against the early deviations and mistakes of some the early Soofis. They exposed the false concepts of beliefs and practices of Soofism in the past and in the present. This, by Allaah’s Grace, benefited and continues to benefit the Muslims worldwide. The truth propagated by the followers of the Salaf is finding its way everywhere despite the efforts by its opponents who try to disseminate among the people it causes rifts between the Muslims while they represent &#8220;the way of unity&#8221; through their so-called Mainstream Islam. The Path of the Salaf distinguishes between the truth and falsehood and calls to unite the Muslims on the true <strong>Tawheed</strong> and pure <strong>Ittibaa</strong>’ (following of the established Sharee&#8217;ah). This makes it binding that the followers of the Salaf should be a good example and use wisdom and kindness in their efforts to propagate the truth without compromising the principles of the Deen. Errors by some of the followers of the Salaf should not hinder the truth seeker from accepting the truth regarding matters of the Deen, and he should judge according to the principle not the mistakes of people.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] References: Ibn Al-Jawzee’s Talbees Iblees, pp. 156-165, Ibn Taymeeyah’s Majmoo’ Al-Fataawaa, vol. 10, pp: 366-367, Saadiq Saadiq’s Masaadir At-Talaqee, pp. 38-35; and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Ibn Taymeeyah holds the first while Ibnul Jawzee and Ibn Khaldoon are of the second opinion (See Talbees Ibleess, p. 201 and Al- Muqaddimah, p. 467, respectively).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil</strong></span>: In the world of Soofism, Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil is the “barrier” qualified with both the Essence of Allaah and the essence of creation (or man). And he is the one who comprises all the worlds of the Divine and that of creation, the complete and the partial. He deserves the Names of the Thaat (Allaah’s Essence) and the Divine Qualities. The Soofee mystics refer to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as being the “<strong>Perfect Man</strong>” or the “<strong>Al-Haqeeqah Al-Muhammadiyyah</strong>”: The Thaat (Essence of Allaah) in its first designation; to him (Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)) belongs all of the Most Beautiful Names [of Allaah] and that he is Al-Ism Al-A’tham (Allaah’s Greatest Name). From Muhammad, the entire creation, this world and the Hereafter, was brought to exist!! <em>This is most fully described by ‘Abdul al-Karim Al- Jeeli (d.820 AH/1417 C.E.), a Soofee of the school of Ibn ‘Arabi, in his book Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil. See V. 2, p. 73 (4th edition), 1395 AH/1975 C.E.. See also Mu’jam Al-Mustalahaat As-Soofeeyyah by ‘Abdul Mun’im Al-Hafnee, p. 27. Also refer to Mu’jam Al- Mustalahaat As-Soofeeyyah by Anwar Fouad Abee Al-Khazzaam, p. 49, published by Maktabat Lubnaan, Beirut, Lebanon, 1993. Al-Jeeli’s book Al-Insaan Al-Kaamil is filled with plain statements of Kufr. Just consider his belief regarding the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) (above). </em></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Source</strong>: <strong><a title="Permanent Link to Sufism : Origin and Development  – Dr. Saleh As-Saleh" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2015/04/12/sufism-origin-and-development-dr-saleh-as-saleh/" rel="bookmark">Sufism : Origin and Development </a>– Dr. Saleh As-Saleh</strong> (e-Book)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The call for Zuhd in Islam is to lead a pious life devoted to Allaah (Azza wa Jal) taking the least that is sufficient of the lawful things of life. It does not mean to abandon lawful means of earning, property, children, etc. nor exaggerating in performing acts of worship. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>O Children of Adam! Take your adornment [by wearing your clean clothes] while praying and going round [the Tawaaf of] the Ka’bah, and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He [Allaah] likes not the extravagants.</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say [O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم]: “Who has forbidden the adoration with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for his slaves, and At-Tayyibaat [all kinds of Halaal things] of food?” Say: “They are, in the life of this world, for those who believe, [and] exclusively for them [believers] on the Day of Resurrection [the disbelievers will not share them].” Thus We explain the Aayaat [Islamic laws] in detail for people who have knowledge. </em></span>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-’Araaf, 7:31-32].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Azza wa Jal) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>But seek with that [wealth] which Allaah has bestowed on you, the home of the Hereafter, and forget not your portion of legal enjoyment in this world, and do good as Allaah has been good to you, and seek not mischief in the land. Verily Allaah likes not the Mufsideen [those who commit great crimes and sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischiefmakers, corrupted people].</em></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Qasas 28:77].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Sa’d Bin Abee Waqqaas [33] asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) whether he can will all of his property in charity, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told him to give only one third of it and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“One third is too much. It is better for you to leave your inheritors wealthy than to leave them poor, begging from others.” [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) invoked Allaah (Azza wa Jal) to grant abundant wealth to Anas Bin Maalik :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas : My mother said, “O Allaah’s Messenger! Please invoke Allaah on behalf of your servant (i.e. Anas ).” He said: “O Allaah! Increase his wealth and children, and bestow your blessings on whatever you give him.”35 There are many other texts in the Qur’aan and (or) Sunnah which teach the medium course of this Deen in its acts of worship as well as in its codes for living this life in the way that pleases Allaah (Azza wa Jal).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In contrast, we find that the Soofee type of Zuhd opposes the essence of true Zuhd laid down in the Qur’aan, authentic Sunnah, and as understood by the Salaf, mainly that it is a renunciation of that which is of no benefit in the Hereafter. Consider, for example, some of the so-called Soofee Zuhd:(2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>(2) Poverty, hunger, abandonment of lawful things and of Hadeeth, and other strange things:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Soofee master said, “I like for the beginner not to make his heart busy with the matter of earning (i.e. a living), otherwise he would change.” [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another master said, “I have attained this state (of Soofee knowledge) by means of a hungry stomach and a naked body.”37(!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A call to abandon marriage and the seeking of hadeeth−knowledge is attributed to the “Soofee master” AlJunayd.[38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Ghazaalee also related the same saying of AlJunayd: “I like for the starting Mureed (Soofee disciple) not to occupy his heart in three things, otherwise his condition will change (he then named them as): (1)-Seeking to gain sustenance, (2)-Seeking knowledge of Al-Hadeeth, and (3)- Marriage.”[39]!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Within Soofee sources we find the following statement: “Hunger is the food of the Zaahideen!” [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdul Wahaaab Ash-Sha’raanee, an authority on Soofism in the eyes of the Soofis reported that Rabaah Bin ‘Amr AlQayeesee said: “A man would not attain the levels of the Siddeeqeen [41] until he leaves his wife as if she was a widow, his kids as if they were orphans, and takes refuge in dog houses!” [42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to Ash-Sha’raanee, Ibraaheem Bin ‘Usayeefeer was, “A man having a great deal of Kashf &#8230;He used to come to the town riding a wolf or a hyena, and to walk on water having no need for a boat; his urine was as white as milk&#8230;Most often he slept in a church, and he used to say: the Christians, unlike Muslims, do not steal shoes in the church.”[43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He invalidated the fasting of the Muslims who ate chicken and mutton meat. Only those who, like the Christians, do not eat mutton meat, their fast is correct as far as ‘Usayeefeer is concerned! [44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A story of another “Soofee”, Ibn Al-Kurainee, the teacher of Al-Junayd in which he says that he subdued himself into humiliation for twenty years until it became like that of a dog! [45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the Soofee sources, Abu Yazeed, an example for many Soofis, devoted himself to Allaah and he had the determination to restrain himself from drinking water and from sleeping for one year! [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Sha’raanee also reported that one of the celebrated Soofee so-called Awliyaa’ by the name of ‘Abdur Rahmaan Al-Majthoob, “Cut off his own private part in the beginning of his Jathbah (a mystic Soofee state of Jathb)”! [47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also reported that another Soofee mystic by the name of Yaaqut Al-‘Arshee (d.707 AH/1307 C.E.) married the daughter of his sheikh Abul ‘Abbaas Al-Mursee. She stayed with him for eighteen years but he never touched her being shy from her father. He left her while she was still a virgin! [48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are only few cases presented in order to expose this early deviation in Soofism.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[33] Sa’d Bin Abee Waqqaas, one of the early sahaabah who accepted Islam and one of the ten companions whom the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) brought good news that they would enter Al-Jannah. He shared in the battle of Badr and Uhud and was one of the six members of the Shoora counsel which ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab chose to appoint the new Khaleefah after ‘Umar was stabbed. He was the first to shoot an arrow at the Mushrikeen in Jihaad. He lead the Muslims in taking over ‘Iraaq from the Persians after defeating them in the battle of Al-Qaadisiyyah in the 15th year of Hijrah (634 C.E.) He died in 55th year of Hijrahh (675 C.E.).

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From the Introduction of the Book:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">KNOW, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon me and you, that the issue of Soofism may be confusing to some and may be clear to others. Many have come to know about Soofism as the highest form of “Spiritual Islamic practices.” A kind of rich tradition, that only the special and very pious can adhere to and practice. Consequently, if Soofism is criticized, they see that as an insult to Islam. Some, however, consider Soofism as a “Spiritual” path which Muslims and non-Muslims can associate with. The fact, however, is that the reality of Soofism is known only to the few amongst Muslims. This is due, in part, to the very deceptive nature of the propagation of the teachings of Soofism as done by its advocates who present it as a very special way of worship that is linked to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his noble companions (may Allah be pleased with them) and those who follow their path in righteousness. Is it, however, the case?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Attempting to answer this question about “Soofism,” I ask Allaah, the Most High, to assist me in relating the truth and to make this effort sincerely done for His Most Honorable Face.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>In conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sensible person must not be deceived therefore in the deceptive ways of mystic Soofism which tries to present itself as ‘spiritual Islam.” <strong>True spiritual matters in Islam do not oppose the Sharee’ah in any way</strong>. The address of Islam to the actions of the hearts is based upon sincerity and following the path of the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم. This is the way that truly draws the person to Allaah.</p>
<p>May Allaah guide all Muslims to the Path of Righteousness.<br />
He is All-Able to do all things. Aameen.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Beneficent the Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily! Allaah will not change the good (or bad condition) of a people as long as they don’t change their state of goodness (or sins and wrong doings etc) themselves.&#8221;</strong></span> [13:11].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ibnul Qayyim</strong>, rahimahullahs, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">&#8220;Ponder upon the Hikmah (Wisdom) of Allaah, the most High, where He has made people&#8217;s kings, leaders, and those of authority over them, of the same kind as their own deeds. It is as if the people&#8217;s deeds appeared in the forms of their kings and leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">If the people are upright, then their kings and rulers will be upright, and if they turn away (from uprightness), then their leaders will turn against them. And if they oppress and tyrannize, then their kings and rulers will tyrannize and oppress. And if deception and treachery becomes manifest amongst them, then the same will appear in their rulers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">If the people refrain from fulfilling the rights of Allaah upon them and become niggardly (regarding their execution), then their kings and rulers will refuse to give them their rights and will become niggardly (withhold their rights from them). And if they take away from those whom they oppress that which they deserve not to take, then the kings will take away from the people that which they deserve not to take and will levy taxes and impose tasks upon them. And whatever the people unjustly take from the oppressed, their kings take the same by force from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">So those in charge of the people appear in the forms of their (the ruled) deeds. And it befits not the Divine Wisdom that the evil and wicked be ruled except by those of the same kind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">And since the early [Muslims] were the best and most righteous of generations, their rulers were of the same standing. But when the people turned weak, their rulers turned to be of their own rank.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">So it befits not the Hikmah (Wisdom) of Allaah in these times (Ibnul Qayyim times [1] ) that rulers the like of Mu&#8217;aawiyah and &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Addil &#8216;Azeez, be in charge over us, and even less the like of Abee Bakr and &#8216;Umar. Rather, our rulers are in accordance with our own rank and standing, and the ones who ruled those before us were (also) in accordance with these people own rank and standing. And both matters (the status of the former rulers and those of this time) are as necessitated and entailed by [Allaah&#8217;s] Hikmah.&#8221; [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is very evident that from the legal perspective and by the consensus of the early Muslims, as well as by way of intellect and experience, that the true change of the status of the Ummah occurs when it turns to Allaah and follows the ways that made the early generations successful. Imaam Maalik, rahimahullah, summed it in words few in number, profound in meaning:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Nothing will benefit the Ummah to come except that which benefited the early Ummah.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who adopt the path of confrontation with the rulers, thinking that the change comes through this way, are trailing the path of misguidance and a path whose consequences proved it wrong by all perspectives. This is the same path taken by the early dissidents (khawaarij) who followed the mutashaabih (not entirely clear) texts instead of following the muhkam (clear) texts and referring whatever may be not entirely clear to that which is mukham. The following of the mutashaabih is a path of fitan (afflictions) that led to the rebellion against the leaders of the sahaabah, and in our times has caused bloodshed and suffering and retardation of da&#8217;wah. Allaahul Must&#8217;aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is a matter of Deen and not a matter of emotions. And since the textual proofs are replete commanding the believers that they must obey those in authority, even if they oppress and take ones wealth, etc As long as they do not command the believer to do sin, then we have no choice but to comply and obey. Otherwise, we will be inventing a new Deen. Allaah, the One Free of all imperfection, the most High says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Let those beware who withstand the Rasool&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) orders, unless some fitnah befalls them or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them&#8221;</strong></span> [24:63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Whatever was not Deen at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) cannot be considered to be a part of the Deen today.&#8221;</strong> </span>[Imaam Maalik].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if the person choses to contend the way of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), then let him remember the following aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If anyone contends with and opposes the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell- what an evil destination!</span></strong> [4:115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah, the most Merciful, guide us all to the truth and make us hold to it and may He, the most High and Majestic, save us all from fitan and guide us (ruled and rulers) to His Path. Aameen.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">If someone makes a statement of kufr or opposition to the Sunnah and he is a practicing Muslim, can we say he is a kafir?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If a person commits an action of kufr or says a statement of kufr, then this person in particular can only be called a kafir only after certain criteria are met. These criteria include:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The conditions must be fulfilled that the action and/or statement is kufr and entails kufr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is necessary to check if there exist certain impediments that prevent the imputing of kufr on this particular person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Actions and/or statements of kufr can be declared in general as such, however making them applicable on a specific person requires fulfilling the conditions and removing the impediments pertaining to takfeer. This is such because there may be causes which would prevent from imputing kufr on a particular person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is not left for anyone to indulge in takfeer as this is the right of Allaah, (subhannahu wa ta’ala), and is a very grave matter to the extent that if you impute kufr on a person incorrectly, then the kufr may return on you; this applies to imputing kufr on the common Muslim as well as the rulers. The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) commanded the Muslim in the authentic hadith: “Say that which is good or stay silent.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this is for general matters, then what about takfeer? Then, by all means, it is necessary to refrain from indulging in this matter and leave it to the grand and reliable scholars of Islaam. They are the ones who can deduce the correct rulings vis-à-vis the kufr of a specific person. Similarly, this is not a matter for even the senior students of knowledge to take part in openly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It seems nowadays that most people have nothing else to do but speak about the hukaam (the leaders) [1] and takfeer, day and night, in dreams and in awakness. If we claim to be on the path of the salaf (the righteous predecessors), then Muslims should not engage themselves in this matter. Regrettably, most common Muslims make analysis of the whole world political affairs and make judgments with ease and little fear of Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala). However, none of this is the business of the common Muslim. Their involvement in these matters can only aggravate situations and cause disunity. Some argue that, “Politics is from Islaam; Islaam and politics are the same.” They come through these doors. When you ask them about politics, you will find they read twelve newspapers, watch all the satellite news channels, and sit in countless circles, day and night, analyzing politics and so-called current affairs. This is what they consider as &#8220;politics&#8221;! At the very least, this is counterproductive and not beneficial for the person who will be responsible for every minute of his life, which he is required to fill with what is good and beneficial. The legislative policies in Islaam are the true &#8220;politics.&#8221; And this is not for the common Muslims to deal with, not to mention the &#8220;media&#8221; politics, filled with lies, counter-lies, endless analysis, deceptive statements, emotional speeches, etc. I ask Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala) to teach us all that which is beneficial and to save us from all that is evil. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may Allaah’s salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

[audio https://salafiaudio.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/contemporary-issues-demonstrations-and-other-corrupts-practices-saleh-as-saleh.mp3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Previously, we discussed the legal and illegal pledges, known as al-bay’ah, as well as partisanship (hizbiyyah). In continuity with that, it is appropriate to discuss certain practices that are taking place in the Muslim world in the form of so-called protests, namely demonstrations, sitins, and strikes. In our time, some people embrace everything that comes to us from the east or west. These practices are not an exception. This has reached the extent that some consider these practices as a means for da’wah (calling others to Allah). Given this, it is appropriate to determine whether this is the reality.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Types of Protests and Their Intentions</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are three specific types of protests that are used. They are demonstrations, sit-ins, and strikes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A <strong>demonstration</strong> is when a group of people will meet along a street or a main road carrying banners, shouting, yelling, and demanding certain things be done or to show strength. This is known in Arabic as mudhaharah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A <strong>sit-in</strong> is known as ‘itisam in Arabic. In our times, it involves sitting in one place (e.g., headquarters of a party, parliament, a factory, a campus, etc.) for a certain time, without leaving, in objection to some grievance, demanding that grievance be addressed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third type of protest is a <strong>strike</strong>. This is known as idrabat, with the origin of this word meaning refraining. As such, you refuse or hold back from doing a certain practice in order to request something. Examples of this include workers in a factory refusing to go to work, demanding higher wages or students not going to school, protesting a certain matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Given the definition of the different matters, the question arises how these things crept into the Islamic society. Mostly, they came from the West where they appeared originally; it was transferred to the Muslim world by primarily political and secular parties. These practices were later embraced by some Islamic groups who imitated such a methodology while trying to find some evidence in shariah to support these practices.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Evidences Cited to Justify Protests</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to note that those who cite evidences justifying these practices are not scholars. They are primarily thinkers and writers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First, they cite the narration that when Umar ibn al-Khattab (radi Allahu ‘anhu) accepted Islam, the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) came out resting on the shoulders of two companions, namely Umar and Hamza. This was done to show the strength of the Muslims to the pagan Arabs of Quraysh. This hadith was reported by Abu Nu’aim in his book, al-Hillayyah. al-Haafidh ibn Hajar also reported it in his book al-Issaba relating it to Muhammad ibn Uthman’s book of history and as well as in al-Fath where he related it to al-Bazaar. The narrations of this incident revolve around a person named Ishaaq ibn ‘Abdullah ibn Abi Farwa. However, his hadith is rejected. Therefore, this incident can not be cited as a proof.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second, these thinkers also take as proof the gathering of the Muslims on ‘Eid and Fridays. They twist the nature of these events to make them evidence for the permissibility of demonstrating, sit-ins, and showing strength. In response, it is necessary to note that there is no evidence in this. The gatherings on ‘Eid and Fridays are acts of worship and can not be linked to these protests. These gatherings are to make manifest the symbols of Allah in worship, in accordance with the way Allah chose and commanded. We can not stretch these acts of worship the way we want as this would entail abuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is no legally justifiable stance for these protests.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Effects of Protests</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The effects of these protests, demonstrations and strikes are numerous and very serious.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>, they bring forth chaotic behavior to the streets due to crowding and the like, negatively influencing the affairs of people. They can easily endanger the lives of many, while also providing an environment for theft and robbery. Many businesses could also be affected; for example, if a business does not close on the day of a demonstration, the protesters may vandalize or damage the building or even label the owners as traitors. And all of this occurred in many Islamic and Non-Islamic Capitals in the World.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, even when people try to go along with these protests to protect their benefits, they are forced to close their shops, negatively impacting their affairs as well as the economy in general. If they do not close their shops they are called &#8220;traitors&#8221;, &#8220;un-patriotic,&#8221; and so forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirdly</strong>, these protests provide a golden opportunity for those with hidden agendas or the people of fitnah to infiltrate the ranks of these demonstrations, to the degree where some of them may use firearms to create a fitnah or escalate the confrontation between the demonstrators and the security forces. This will lead the security forces to return fire on the crowd, potentially wounding many people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourthly</strong>, these acts instigate animosity and hatred between the members of society, specifically the citizens and the security forces. Since the security forces usually try to prevent these demonstrations, there will be bloodshed and injury, which may lead to revenge attacks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifthly</strong>, these practices lead to the halting of economic production in many sectors of the economy, especially during strikes. Most of the time when these groups intend to demonstrate, they ask the factory workers to join them, causing work to cease at times when the country is in dear need of collaboration between its ranks.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixthly</strong>, these protests disturb the overall security in the land due to the confrontations associated with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventhly</strong>, those who took these practices as a means of worship are worshiping Allah through a methodology that is not legislated and baseless. Therefore, they end up worshipping Allah through a way that is not acceptable to Him (: subhannahu wa ta’ala). For any act to be accepted, it must be done with the correct intentions and condoned by shariah. The actions of these people remind us of the statement of ibn Masoud (radi Allahu ‘anhu) when he said, “Many are those who intended good but could not achieve it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to attain the good, you must work according to the sunnah and the legal methods.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eightly</strong>, these demonstrations hasten confrontations between the groups that utilize them and the government, since these practices appear as threats to the survival and security of the government itself. Therefore, the plotting begins against these groups, often resulting in unpleasant consequences and continuous animosity and mistrust.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The claim that these protests are permissible has led to their acceptance by the rejectionist Shia’ (Raafidah), who made such demonstrations against what they classified as imperialism during Hajj. Many innocent people were killed because of this, as is well known.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Misconceptions</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are numerous misconceptions regarding the value and permissibility of these practices. For example, some note that other countries regulate demonstrations and permit them according to their laws. As such, they fail to recognize the harm in doing the same. The response to this is that even if the government was to allow such practices, then we should not resort to them because there is no legal evidence justifying them, and we have to follow shariah above all other matters. We do not follow the general motto that says, “Objectives justify the means.” In Islam, the objectives must be legal, and the means that attain these objectives must be legal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, others engage in these practices saying, “So-and-so considered these practices to be permissible.” However, it is necessary to note that these acts were not practised by the salaf, and had these demonstrations been something beneficial, they would have resorted to it, and we have no reports to indicate such. Moreover, when someone gives a fatwa, what really matters is the daleel (evidences) as any opinion without a proof can not be considered, even if it is made by the most knowledgeable of people as we are obligated to follow the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and his companions who informed us all that is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone asserts that these practices had some benefits during certain times or in some countries, bringing useful results, then the response is that such results is not a proof for their permissibility since the criteria is the affirmation of the daleel and the acting of the salaf. Furthermore, we assert that if these demonstrations were successful during certain times, then most often, they failed and only lead to casualties, hastening confrontations with these groups, leading to their disintegration.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Conclusion</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are some points concerning these contemporary matters, which are counter productive and have depleted the energy of Muslim groups and youths in many parts of the Muslim world. We ask Allah to save us and to save our societies from all forms of corrupt and deviant practices, and to show us the truth and make us follow it while showing us the falsehood and safeguarding us from that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Refuting the Misconception that Obedience is Valid Only to the Greater Imaam.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful, I begin (to write): The following Question was received from a brother in USA:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Assalaamu &#8216;alaykum wa rahmatullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As you know, there are a number of ahaadeeth concerning how Muslims are to deal with the Muslim rulers, including the sinful and oppressive rulers. How would you respond to the one who claims that these ahaadeeth are concerning the khaleefah of the Muslims, not the various leaders, kings, or prime ministers of today?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Baarakallaahu-feek.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Wa&#8217;alaykum as-Salaam wa Rahmatullaahi wa Barakaatuh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Shubuha (misconception) that the Ahaadeeth of obedience to the Rulers are restricted to the general Khaleefah (greater Imaam) is, al-hamdulillah, already answered by the scholars of Islaam. Here are some of their statements:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- <strong>Sh. Al-Islam Ibn Taymeyah</strong> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The sunnah is that the Muslims have one Imaam and the rest are his deputies. Suppose, however, the Ummah abandoned this due to a sin from some part of it and incapacity from the rest or for a reason other than that and which led to having number of Imaams, then it is binding upon each Imaam to establish the Hudood (prescribed punishments) and fulfill the rights (of people).&#8221; [Majmoo&#8217; al- Fataawaa, 35/175-176].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- <strong>Imaam Ash-Shawkaani</strong> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In Principle, all Muslims should have one Imaam. However, after the spread of Islam and the expansion of its territories and their remoteness, it is known that in each region there became a ruler or Imaam and so with the rest of the regions, none of them having authority to command and forbid in the other regions&#8230; So the presence of various (multiple) Imaams and Rulers is of no harm, and it is binding to obey each one of them after giving him the bay&#8217;ah (pledge of allegiance) in the region in which his commands and prohibitions are executed therein. And similarly in the case of the one in charge of another region. And it is not obligatory upon the people of the other regions to obey him, nor to be under his governorship due to the remoteness of the regions&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: &#8220;You should know this, since it is fitting to the Sharee&#8217;ah Foundations, and in full agreement to what is indicated by the evidences. And turn down what is being said in opposition to this, since the difference between the condition of the early Islamic wilaayah (administrative governship) and its state nowadays is clearer than the sun during the day.&#8221; [Imaam Ash-Shawkaani in As- Sayelul Jarraar, 4/512].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- <strong>Sh. Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil Wahaab</strong> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Imaams from each Madh-hab are unanimous that whoever overtakes a country or countries (seizes power) is entitled to assume the same rulership as the Imaam in ALL affairs. Were it not so, the affairs of this worldly life would not be upright. And for a long time, since before the time of Imaam Ahmad (rahimahullaah) and until our time, people were not in agreement upon one Imaam, and they have no account of a scholar stating that the validity of (the applicability) of any of the rulings (of sharee&#8217;ah) is conditional upon the presence of the Greater Imaam.&#8221; [In Ad-Durar As-Saniyyah, 7/239].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Al-&#8216;Allaamah (esteemed scholar) <strong>As-San&#8217;aani</strong> (rahimahullaah) said in his explanation of the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu), raised to the Prophet ( salllaallaahu &#8216;aleihi was-sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;One who defected from obedience (to the Amir) and separated from the main body of the Muslims &#8211; if he died in that state &#8211; would die the death of one belonging to the days of Jahiliyya (i. e. would not die as a Muslim).</span> [Saheeh Muslim, Book 20, # 4555, English Translation]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">that the &#8220;obedience&#8221; is the obedience to the Khaleefah upon whom there is agreement, and it seems that what is intended is the khaleefah on any region from the regions, since people were not on agreement on a single khaleefah over the entire Islamic lands since the Abbasid Rule. Rather each region became independent under a ruler running its affairs. And if we carry the hadeeth to apply only to one khaleefah upon whom the Muslims are unanimous then its (the hadeeth) benefit would be diminished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that the saying (in the hadeeth) &#8220;and separated from the main body of the Muslims,&#8221; means: separated from the Jamaa&#8217;ah who agreed upon an Imaam under whom their body and affairs are organized, their world is united, and their protection from their enemy is achieved.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it becomes clear that negating the validity of governership on separate Muslim states leads to evil in the sense that its sets the stage for rebellion against the rulers, and this is forbidden in Islaam even if the ruler is an oppressor as this constitutes the creed of ahl-us-Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Knows Best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah, the Most High, guide me, you, and all Muslims to abide by the way of the Salaf and make us from those who relate the unclear matters to the clear so that they reach that which is clear and pleasing to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><em>[<strong>Isbaal</strong> is to wear garments that extend below the ankles]</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First Shubuha (Doubt):</strong> Isbaal is permitted as long as it is not done out of Makheelah. Some refer to the following hadeeth as an evidence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Abdullah bin Umar رضي الله عنهم ا reported that: “I came to visit the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم and I was wearing an Izaar Yataqa’qa’ (clanking because of its trailing below the ankles) . He صلى الله عليه و سلم said: “Who is this?” I said: “Abdullah bin Umar”. He said: “If you are an Abd (i.e. a true slave) of Allaah, then pull up your Izaar”. I did. He then said: “more!”. (Ibn Umar) said: “I pulled it up until it reached the middle of shank; this was the (length) of his Izaar until he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) died”. He then looked towards Abee Bakr and said: “If anyone trails his garment arrogantly, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgment”. Then Abu Bakr said: “My Izaar sometimes hangs low (in another narration he said: “one of the sides of my lower garment hangs low if I do not take care of it”)[99]. The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلمsaid: “But you are not one of them (in another narration he said: You are not one of those who do so conceitedly)[100].] [101]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Discussion</strong>: The hadeeth supports the Tahreem of Isbaal rather than the opinion which permits the Isbaal as long as it is not done out of conceit. In fact the hadeeth clearly makes it obligatory on the Muslim not to let his Izaar hang lower than his ankles, and that he must tuck it up even though his intention was like that of Abu Bakr in the hadeeth i.e. not done out of conceit. In fact Abu Bakr said: “One side of my Izaar hangs low if I do not take care of it”. In our times, however, people let their Izaars hang low, unlike Abu Bakr, and then they claim: “Well we do not do it out of arrogance!”. Don’t they realize the commands of Allaah’s Messenger to tuck up the Izaar and that his Izaar was extending to the middle of his shanks? Don’t they know that He صلى الله عليه و سلم never thinks about Makheelah? Isn’t he our example?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also clear that Abu Bakr did not say that: “I made my Izaar trailing”. In fact he said in one narration: “Sometimes my Izaar hangs low”. So, its his Izaar that goes down when as he said: “I do not take care of it”. Its clear that when he takes care of it it stays above his ankles, but when it gets loose it hangs low. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer reported that Ibn Sa’dd reported a narration from the way of Talha bin Abdullaah bin Abdur-Rahmaan bin Abee Bakr, that ‘Aaaishah رضي الله عنها وعنهم said: “Abu Bakr was Ahnaa (had an inclination in his back), his Izaar could not hold on him, it used to get loose around his loins”. Al-Hafidh also reported a narration from the way of Qayess Ibn Abee Haazim who said: “I visited Abee Bakr and he was a thin person.” [102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who design garments, pants, etc. whose lower ends abide by the Sunnah, but when they wear them they get loose and sometimes trail below the ankles, resemble the case of Abu Bakr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم considered that Abu Bakr was not “one of those who hang their garments out of conceit”, because Abu Bakr did not intend to lower his Izaar below the ankles, and it only trailed when he did not take care of it. Those who intend to trail out of conceit are threatened with a grave punishment:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah will not look (on the Day of Resurrection)</strong>[103]<strong> at person who drags his Izaar (behind him) out of conceit</strong></span>.&#8221; [104]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah will not look at a person , on the Day of Judgemt, who drags his Izaar out of pride and arrogance</strong></span>.&#8221; [105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, on the Day of Judgment, Allaah will not talk to or sanctify the Musbil. This is confirmed in the authentic hadeeth in which Abu Dharr reported the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم as saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“There are three (kinds) of persons to whom Allaah will neither speak on the Day of Judgment, nor will He look at them nor purify them, and they will have a painful Punishment. He (Abu Darr) said: “Allaah’s Messenger repeated it three times. Abu Dharr remarked: “They failed and they lost; who are these persons, O Messenger of Allaah? He صلى الله عليه و سلم replied: “<span style="color:#993300;">The one who wears a trailing robe (the Musbil), the one who takes account of what he gives, and the seller of goods by false oaths</span>.”</span></strong> [106]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly Abu Bakr received a testimony from the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم that he did not lower his Izaar out of arrogance. Those who intentionally make Isbaal, when did they receive a purifying testimony?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another incident, Abdullah Ibn Umar passed by the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم and his Izaar was hanging low. He said describing this incident:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I happened to pass before Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم with my garment hanging low. He said: Abdullah, tug up your lower garment. I tugged it up, and he again said: “Tug it still further”. I tugged it still further and I went on tugging it afterward, whereupon some of the people said: “To what extent?” Thereupon he said: “To the middle of the shanks.” [107]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم did not keep silent when he saw Abdullah bin Umar hanging low his Izaar. This shows that the prophibition of Isbaal for men is not restricted only to the case if it is done out of Makheelah. Abdullah bin Umar is one of the great Sahabah. Imagine what would the position of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم be if he sees the clothes on many Du’aat (those who invite others to this Deen), or even “scholars” each trailing his Jubbah,[108] garment, or pants? <span style="color:#993300;">We know that Ibn Umar hastened to comply with the Prophet’s command. Now it takes hours, talks, lectures to convey the Prophet’s command and still you find people arguing that: “Well! As long as Isbaal is not done out of conceit then its OK!” Indeed it makes the clement person preplexed! To Allaah alone, is the complaint!</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">الإسبال Isbaal</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is Isbaal?</strong></span><br />
Isbaal is to wear garments that extend below the ankles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Is it Forbidden?</strong></span><br />
Yes, because the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The part of an <em>Izaar</em> (garment) which hangs below the ankles is in the Fire.&#8221; [73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Some hold the opinion that <em>Isbaal</em> is forbidden when it is done out of pride, conceit or arrogance. Is this argument true?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer is: No, because:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>First</strong></span>: The threat to punish in Hell those who drag their garments bellow the ankles is clear [74].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Second</span></strong>: Several texts indicate that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was commanding the people to pull up their garments. The majority of the Muslim Scholars (Al-Jumhoor) agree that when the text is in the imperative from, intended for <em>Tahreem</em> (forbidding something), unless there is another authentic evidence that indicates otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[73] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V.7, hadeeth # 678.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[74]The punishable part is that which violates the command of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) i.e below the ankles. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer is with the opinion that the obvious literal meaning of the hadeeth holds true i.e. the clothes together with the part below the ankles will be in Hell as it is the case in the saying of Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى):</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“Certainly! You (disbelievers) and that which you are worhipping now besides Allaah, are (but) fuel for Hell!” (Qur’aan 21:98).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">See Fathul Baaree V. 10, hadeeth # 5789 (same as # 678 above), PP. 268-269, Published by Daar Ar-Rayyaan, Cairo, Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one incident, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) sighted someone dragging his lower garment. He rushed to him and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Pull up your <em>Izaar</em> and fear Allaah”. The man said: “I am a an <em>Ahnaf</em> [75] person with trembling knees”. He (the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)) said: “Tuck up your <em>Izaar</em>! Certainly, all of Allaah’s creation of Allaah is good”. Since then the man was not seen except with his <em>Izaar</em> touching the middle of his shanks or up to the middle of his shanks [76].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is clear that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) did not question the man whether he was doing it out of pride or arrogance. In fact its clear that from the condition of the man that he did not even think about arrogance! Nevertheless the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) did not accept it his <em>Isbaal</em> and considered that <em>Isbaal</em> is incompatible with <em>At-Taqwa</em> (the fear of Allaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Third</strong></span>: The generalized prohibition of <em>Isbaal</em> is clear in the saying of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). On one occasion he said to Sufyaan bin Sahl:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Sufyaan bin Sahl! Do not lower your garment below your ankles because Allaah does not love the <em>Musbileen</em> (those who lower their lower garments below their ankles).”</strong> [77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jaabir bin Saleem said that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) told him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;&#8230;And beware of the <em>Isbaal</em> of the <em>Izaar</em> because it is from Al-Makheelah (conceit, arrogance, etc.) and Allaah does not love it.”</strong> [78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One can notice the text (underlined) in the imperative from indicating the forbidding of Isbaal whether it is done out of Makheelah or not. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer in his commentary about some of the Ahaadeeth mentioned above said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <em>Isbaal</em> mentioned in these <em>Ahadeeth</em> is a grave sin if it is done out of <em>Makheelah</em>, otherwise the apparent meaning of the <em>Ahadeeth</em> indicates that it is forbidden.” [79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Fourth</strong></span>: The manifestation of the ِAayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">And whatsoever the messenger gives you take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain from it.</span>” (Qur’aan 59:7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that the <em>Ath-Thawb</em> [80] of the most honorable of mankind, Muhammad (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was up to the middle of his shanks.” [81]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is confirmed in another hadeeth in which Uthmaan (رضي الله عنه) reported that the “<strong>The lower garment of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) extended to the middle of his shanks</strong>.” [82] Who else is more humble than him (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)? He knew that <em>Isbaal</em> necessitates <em>Al-Makheelah</em> even if the <em>Musbil</em> does not intend it. This is supported by the hadeeth of Jaabir bin Saleem in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) made it clear that <em>Isbaal</em> is a manifestation of arrogance:</p>

<span style="color:#999999;"> [82] Reported by At-Tirmithee in Ash-Shamaa’il Al-Muhammadiyyah and Al-Albaanee authenticated it # 98.</span></p>
<p>He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) commanded Jaabir bin Saleem saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And Tuck up your <em>Izaar</em> up to the middle of your shanks, and if you dislike it, then up to the ankles (i.e. up to a point above the ankles) and beware of <em>Isbaal</em> because it is arrogance.&#8221;</strong> [83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shouldn’t we, therefore, abide by the command of Allaah in the above ِAayah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Fifth</strong></span>: Isbaal by men is an immitation of women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) forbade that men dress like women and vice versa. He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah cursed the man dressed like a women and the women dressed like a man.” [84]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact Ibn Umar رضي االله عنهما said that: “the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The one who trails his <em>Thobe</em> out of conceit, Allaah will not look at him on the the Day of Judgment”.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ummu Salamah رضي االله عنها said: “What should the women, O Messenger of Allaah, do with the lower ends of their dresses?” He said: “They may let them hang down a span”. She said: “Still their feet will be uncovered”. He said: “Then let them hang the ends down a forearm’s length, not exceeding it.” [85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lowering the garments below the ankle is a the code of dress of women. Shaykh ul Islaam Ibn Taymmeyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“&#8230;The imitation (of others) in the outward appearances produces a proportional assumption of the deeds and manners. That is why we are ordered to oppose the Kuffar&#8230; and that is also why men and women are prohibited from imitating each other in accordance with the Ahadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8221; من تشبه بقومٍ فهو منهم &#8221;<br />
<b>“Whoever takes the similitude of certain people becomes one of them”</b> [86]</p>

<span style="color:#999999;"> [85] An authentic narration reported by Abee Dawood (# 3467 in Saheeh Abee Dawood), An-Nassaa’ee (#5336) and At-Tirmithee (Saheeh At-Tirmithee #1415), and Ibn Majah #3580 &amp; 3581.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [86] An authentic hadeeth collected by Abee Dawood, Ahmad, and others. See As-Silsilah As-Saheehah V.1, 676</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man who imitates women acquires from their manners according to the extent of his imitation, such that it he may end up in complete effeminacy&#8230;The woman who imitates men assumes part of their manners until she attains levels of <em>Tabarruj</em> [87], <em>Burooz</em> [88] and <em>Mushaarakah</em> with men [89] driving some of them to show their bodies as men do, demanding superiority over men, and doing whatever contradicts the bashfulness of the woman&#8230;” [90]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Ummar bin Al-Khattaab (رضي الله عنه) saw a man dragging his <em>Izaar</em>, he called upon him and said: “Are you having your menses?”. The man said: “O Ameer Al-Mu’mineen [91]! Does a man have menses?” Umar said: “What made you drag your <em>Izaar</em> over your feet?” He then ordered a blade, rapped (the lower ends of) the man’s <em>Izaar</em> and cut what trailed below the ankles&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we see that men are trailing their <em>Izaar</em> (<em>Thobe</em>, trousers, pants, etc.) like women while women wear clothes whose lower ends are way above the ankles! May Allaah guide our men and women to abide by the Commands of Allaah and His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Sixth</strong></span>: Isbaal is extravagancy:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has set a measure for everything, including the clothes for men. If a Muslim exceeds the limits set by Sharee’ah then he becomes an extravagant. Allaah, Most Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And eat and drink but waste not by extravagance, certainly He (Allaah) likes not the extravagants.”</span> (Qur’aan 7: 31).</p>

<span style="color:#999999;"> [89] <em>Mushaarakah</em>, joining men in all walks of life.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [90] Sheikh ul Islam Ibn Taymmeyah in his book Al-Fatawa (Arabic), V. 22, P. 254.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [91] Ameer Al-Mu’mineen, the Commander of the Faithful. It is a title given to the Islamic Caliph. This incident was narrated by Kharshah bin Al-Hurr. The report is found in Waleed An-nasr’s book Al-isbaal Lighayer Al-Khuyalaa, p. 18, where he attributed it to At-Tabaree. It is reported in a summarized version by Ibn Abee Shaybah in his Mussannaf (V.8, p. 393) with a <em>Saheeh</em> <em>Isnaad</em>, as An-Nasr said.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If the <em>Thobe</em> (as well as all other garments) exceeds the appropriate size [92] of the one who wears it, then it would be prohibited based upon extravagance and that leads to <em>Tahreem</em>.” [93]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Seventh</strong></span>: <em>Isbaal</em> and impurities:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ubaid bin Khalid said: “I was walking trailing my <em>Burd</em> [94]. A man talked to him saying: “Pull up your <em>Thobe</em> because that (will keep it) more clean and will last longer”. I looked (to see who was talking to me) and he was the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). I said: “It is only a black and white-striped <em>Burdah</em> (outer garment)”. He said: “Don’t you have an example in me?” I said: “I looked (at him) and his <em>Izaar</em> was (extending) to the middle of his shanks.” [95]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abdullah Ibn Mas’oud narrated that: “A young man paid a visit to Umar (رضي الله عنه) (after he was stabbed by Abu Lu’lu’ah Al-Majoosee) and he started praising Umar (رضي الله عنه). (The narrator) said: “Umar saw the man trailing his Izaar”. He said to him: “<strong>O son of my brother! Lift your clothes, for this will keep them clean, and save you from the Punishment of your Rabb</strong>.” [96]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The painful suffering from the fatal wounds in Umar’s body did not prevent him from talking about the issue of Isbaal because Umar realized the threat of punishment in Hell for those who hang down their lower garments. In this there is a great lesson for all Muslims and especially our young generations that they should take this matter seriously and abide by the commands of Allaah and His Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). On the other hand the incident shows that Umar while leading an Ummah did not say this is a “minor issue” as some Muslims respond when they are adviced about this issue or that of the beard. He considered all matters of Deen in light of the teachings of the Qur’aan and Sunnah. Certainly if a person is new to Islaam or if he is ignorant, then we gradually teach him the importance of Tawheed and that the Sunnah is an integral part Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[92] The appropriate size takes into consideration what is prohibited and what is permitted. For example, it is prohibited to wear pants that “just fit in” and display or “framelike” the shapes of the private parts of men. This would alos be considered an an immitation of the Kuffar.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [93] Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 263.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [94] Burd, a black decorated square outer garment.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [95] Shayekh Al-Albaanee said that the hadeeth is authentic as in Ash-Shamaa’il Al-Muhammadiyyah (Sumarized Version), # 97.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [96] Collected by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim. See Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree V. 5, hadeeth # 50. It is also reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah in his Musannaf , V. 8, P. 27.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When these matters are made clear to him, then it is very natural to call him to abide by them. Setting the priorities without compromising or indefinitely postponing the reminders is, <em>inshaaa</em>’ <em>Allaah</em>, the beneficial approach.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Note</strong></span>: Someone may ask the question: “If the Sunnah for women is to trail their dresses, then what about the impurities that may attach to the dresses?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A women asked Umm Salamah رضي االله عنها the following question: “I am a women having a long trail of my garment and I walk in a filthy place; (then what should I do?). Umm Salamah replied: “The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: ‘What comes after it cleanses it’. “ [97]</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[97] The hadeeth is reported by Imaam Malik, Ahmad, At-Tirmithee, Abee Dawoood, and Ad-Daarimee.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sharee’ah permitted the trailing by the women in order to cover her feet which are illegal to keep naked before others. That is the exception upon which the ruling for women regarding the trailing is different from that for men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Summary</strong></span>: <em>Isbaal</em> is forbidden due to the following reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-The threat of punishment in Hell for the <em>Musbil</em>,<br />
2-The clear command of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to pull the garments above the ankles,<br />
3-The absolutely generalized terms regarding its Tahreem,<br />
4-The demand to follow the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and abide by his orders,<br />
5-It is a Makheelah (pride, arrogance, conceit, etc.),<br />
6-It is an imitation of women,<br />
7-It is an extravagancy,<br />
8-The Musbil cannot protect against filth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shayekh Al-Albaanee said that the hadeeth is authentic since it is supported by another sound narration reported by Abee Dawood and in which a women of the Banu Abd Al-Ashhal reported: “I said O Allaah’s Messenger! Our road to the mosque has an unpleasent stench; what should we do when it is raining? He asked: “Is there not a cleaner part after the filthy part of the road?”. She replied: “indeed there is one”. He said: “It makes up for the other”. See Mushkatul Masaabeeh, V.1, hadeeth # 504 and 512.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Clearing Some Shubuhaat </span></strong>[98]<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> Regarding Isbaal</span></strong></p>
<p>[98] Shubuhaat, unclear matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>First Shubuha:</strong></span> Isbaal is permitted as long as it is not done out of Makheelah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some refer to the following hadeeth as an evidence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Abdullah bin Umar رضي االله عنهماreported that: “I came to visit the Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and I was wearing an Izaar Yataqa’qa’ (clanking because of its trailing below the ankles) . He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “Who is this?” I said: “Abdullah bin Umar”. He said: “If you are an Abd (i.e. a true slave) of Allaah, then pull up your Izaar”. I did. He then said: “more!”. (Ibn Umar) said: “I pulled it up until it reached the middle of shank; this was the (length) of his Izaar until he ((صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)) died”. He then looked towards Aboo Bakr and said: “If anyone trails his garment arrogantly, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgment”. Then Abu Bakr said: “My Izaar sometimes hangs low (in another narration he said: “one of the sides of my lower garment hangs low if I do not take care of it”)[99]. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)said: “But you are not one of them (in another narration he said: You are not one of those who do so conceitedly)[100][101]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Discussion</strong>: The hadeeth supports the <em>Tahreem</em> of <em>Isbaal</em> rather than the opinion which permits the <em>Isbaal</em> as long as it is not done out of conceit. In fact the hadeeth clearly makes it obligatory on the Muslim not to let his <em>Izaar</em> hang lower than his ankles, and that he must tuck it up even though his intention was like that of Abu Bakr in the hadeeth i.e. not done out of conceit. In fact Abu Bakr said: “One side of my Izaar hangs low if I do not take care of it”. In our times, however, people let their <em>Izaars</em> hang low, unlike Abu Bakr, and then they claim: “Well we do not do it out of arrogance!”. Don’t they realize the commands of Allaah’s Messenger to tuck up the <em>Izaar</em> and that his <em>Izaar</em> was extending to the middle of his shanks? Don’t they know that He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) never thinks about <em>Makheelah</em>? Isn’t he our example?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also clear that Abu Bakr did not say that: “I made my <em>Izaar</em> trailing”. In fact he said in one narration: “Sometimes my Izaar hangs low”. So, its his <em>Izaar</em> that goes down when as he said: “I do not take care of it”. Its clear that when he takes care of it it stays above his ankles, but when it gets loose it hangs low. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer reported that Ibn Sa’dd reported a narration from the way of Talha bin Abdullaah bin Abdur-Rahmaan bin Abee Bakr, that ‘Aaaishah رضي االله عنها وعنهم said: “Abu Bakr was Ahnaa (had an inclination in his back), his Izaar could not hold on him, it used to get loose around his loins”. Al-Hafidh also reported a narration from the way of Qayess Ibn Abee Haazim who said: “I visited Abee Bakr and he was a thin person.” [102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[99] From Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 7, hadeeth # 675.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [100]Ibid. Also reported by Abee Dawood.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [101] The hadeeth was reported by Imaam Ahmad, Abdul Razzaaq, At-Tabaraanee and others. Al-Albaanee said: The hadeeth’s Isnaad is according to the conditions laid down by Ash-Shayekhan (i.e. the two Shayeks: Al- Bukhaaree and Muslim), As-Silsilah As-Saheehah, V. 4, P. 95. The part of the hadeeth starting with the saying of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم): If anyone trails his Izaar” and ending with “you are not of those who do so conceitedly” is reported by Al-Bukhaaree, Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree V. 7, hadeeth # 675.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [102] Fathul Baaree V. 10, P. 255.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who design garments, pants, etc. whose lower ends abide by the Sunnah, but when they wear them they get loose and sometimes trail below the ankles, resemble the case of Abu Bakr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) considered that Abu Bakr was not “one of those who hang their garments out of conceit”, because Abu Bakr did not intend to lower his Izaar below the ankles, and it only trailed when he did not take care of it. Those who intend to trail out of conceit are threatened with a grave punishment:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Allaah will not look (on the Day of Resurrection) </strong>[103]<strong> at person who drags his Izaar (behind him) out of conceit.</strong>&#8221; [104]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Allaah will not look at a person , on the Day of Judgemt, who drags his Izaar out of pride and arrogance</strong>.&#8221; [105]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, on the Day of Judgment, Allaah will not talk to or sanctify the Musbil. This is confirmed in the authentic hadeeth in which Abu Dharr reported the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[103] See Appendix.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [104] Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, and Ahmad. See Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 7, hadeeth # 675., and Saheeh Muslim, V. 3, Ahadeeth # 5191-5195.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [105] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 7, hadeeth # 679 and Saheeh Muslim, hadeeth # 5201.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There are three (kinds) of persons to whom Allaah will neither speak on the Day of Judgment, nor will He look at them nor purify them, and they will have a painful Punishment. He (Abu Darr) said: “Allaah’s Messenger repeated itthree times. Abu Dharr remarked: “They failed and they lost; who are these persons, O Messenger of Allaah? He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) replied: “The one who wears a trailing robe (the Musbil), the one who takes account of what he gives, and the seller of goods by false oaths.” [106]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certainly Abu Bakr received a testimony from the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) that he did not lower his Izaar out of arrogance. Those who intentionally make Isbaal, when did they receive a purifying testimony?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another incident, Ubdullah Ibn Umar passed by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and his Izaar was hanging low. He said describing this incident:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I happened to pass before Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) with my garment hanging low. He said: Abdullah, Tuck up your lower garment. I tucked it up, and he again said: “Tug it still further”. I tucked it still further and I went on tugging it afterward, whereupon some of the people said: “To what extent?” Thereupon he said: “To the middle of the shanks.” [107]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) did not keep silent when he saw Abdullah bin Umar hanging low his Izaar. This shows that the prophibition of Isbaal for men is not restricted only to the case if it is done out of Makheelah. Abdullah bin Umar is one of the great Sahabah. Imagine what would the position of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) be if he sees the clothes on many Du’aat (those who invite others to this Deen), or even “scholars” each trailing his Jubbah,[108] garment, or pants? We know that Ibn Umar hastened to comply with the Prophet’s command. Now it takes hours, talks, lectures to convey the Prophet’s command and still you find people arguing that: “Well! As long as Isbaal is not done out of conceit then its OK!” Indeed it makes the clement person preplexed! To Allaah alone, is the complaint!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Bakra (رضي الله عنه): “We were with Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) when the sun eclipsed. Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stood up dragging his cloak till he entered the mosque&#8230;” [109]. In another narration, Abu Bakra said: “Allaah’s Messenger came out dragging his cloak till he reached the mosque.” [110] Still in another narration by Abu Bakra: “He got up dragging his garment hurriedly till he reached the mosque.” [111]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other case is when the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) made an early salutation after the third rak’ah of an afternoon prayer. “A man called Al-Khirbaaq who had long arms got up and said: “Has the prayers been shortened, O Messenger of Allaah? He came out angrily trailing his cloak and when he came to the people he said: Is he telling the truth? They said: “Yes”. He then said one rak’ah, then gave the salutation, then made two prostrations (of forgetfullness), then gave the salutation.” [112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third incident as reported by Abur Rahman bin Abee Sa’eed Al-Khudree who narrated it from his father. He (the father) said: I went to Qibaa’ with the Messenger of Allaah(صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) on Monday till we reached (the habitation) of Banu Saalim. The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) stood at the door of ‘Itbaan and called him loudly. So he came out dragging his lower garment. Upon this Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “We have made this man to make haste”. ‘Itbaan said: “Messenger of Allaah, if a man parts with his wife suddenly without seminal emission, what is he required to do (with regard to bath)?”. The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “It is with the seminal emission that bath becomes obligatory.” [113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[109] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 2, hadeeth # 150.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [110] ibid, hadeeth # 170.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [111] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V. 7, hadeeth # 676.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [112] See Saheeh Muslim, V. 1, hadeeeth # 1187.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [113] Saheeh Muslim, V. 1, hadeeth # 674.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the above Ahadeeth are supporting evidences for the opinion that if a person does not intend to lower his garment, but it happens that he draggs it due to to certain circumstances, like being in a hurry, angry, etc. then he is not a Musbil by intention. Therefore, he is to be reminded but not blamed. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) came in a hurry, so did ‘Itbaan. Another exception is due to necessity.114 For example if someone has a wound on his ankle, he may cover it by extending his lower garment if he does not have any other means to protect it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Third Shubuha:</strong></span> It was reported in the Musannaf of Ibn Abee Shayebah with an authentic chain of narrators that Abdullah bin Mas’oud (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) “used to dragg his lower garment; when he was asked about it he said: ‘I have thin shanks’. “ [115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer responded to this issue saying: “it indicates that he extended it lower than the recommended, which is the middle of the shanks. It is improper to suspect that he let it exceed the ankles as indicated by his response: ‘I have thin shanks’116. It is possible that he was not aware of the story of Umr bin Zarrarah,117 and Allaah knows best.” [118]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2-The narration about Ibn Mas’oud is of the Mawqoof [119] category opposed by many Marfoo’[120] narrations. Certainly the Marfoo’ takes precedence over the Mawqoof. The evidence is in what is established by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[114] See Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 257.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [115] Musannaf Ibn Abee Shayebah, V. 6, P. 26 # 11.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[116] In fact Abdullah bin Mas’oud reported that the “The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) disliked ten things”. He mentioned them and amongst them was “the dragging of the Izaar (i.e. below the ankles). This was reported by Imaam Ahmad in his Musnad, V. 6, PP. 103-104, hadeeth # 4179 . The checker, Ahmad Shaakir, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said: ”Its Isnaad is Saheeh”. This supports Al-Hafid’s position that the “Isbaal” in Abdullah bin Mas’oud’s garment was an extension lower than the middle of the shanks but not exceeding the ankles. Certainly Ibn Mas’oud would not opposee the Prophet’s position on Isbaal.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[117] Abu Umamah (رضي الله عنه) reported that: “While we were with the Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), Umr Bin Zararah AlAnsaaree followed us and he was dressed with a cloak and a trailing Izaar. The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) began to hold the side of his Thobe, humbling himself to Allaah and saying: ‘I am your slave, the son of your male-slave, the son of your female-slave”, until Umr heard it. Upon this he said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah!, I am a person with thin shanks’. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: ‘O Umr! Allaah has perfected everything He has created; O Umr! Allaah does not like the Musbil.’ “-Reported by At-Tabaraanee and others. Al-Hafidh said: “Its narrators are Thuqaat (trustworthy). See Fathul Baaree, V. 10, PP. 275-276.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[118] Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P.276.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [119] Mawqoof, “stopped”; a narration from a Sahabee (Companion) not traced to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [120] Marfoo’, “raised”; a narration attributed to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth Shubuha:</strong></span> Some people consider the matters of Isbaal , the growing of the beard, and the entire outward appearance of the Muslim as “minor” or “trivial” issues. They base this conclusion on their understanding that the Deen of Allaah is divided into a “crust or a shell” and a “core”. The outward appearance is from the “crust” part.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This classification of Islamic matters is an innovation.[121] It is aimed at diluting the Deen of Allaah leaving it for the taste of men and women to decide for themselves whether they have to abide by some of its rules and regulations. In fact we are ordered by Allaah to “fully, perfectly, and whole-heartedly” enter the Deen of Islaam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe! Enter perfectly in Islaam and follow not the footsteps of Satan.”</span> (Qur’aan 2:208)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer (exegesis) of this ِAayah: “<strong>Enter in Islaam and obey all of its rules and regulations</strong>”. Al-Alloosee, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, commented about the same ِAayah, saying: “Entirely enter in Islaam and do not let anything of your outward and inward natures except that Islaam contains them leaving no room for anything else.” [122]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ordered, forbade, warned and set the example regarding the Isbaal, the beard, the straightening of the lines in the prayers. So, the Muslim should not take these matters lightly because insisting one even one sin, no matter how small, may subject the Muslim to the threat of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is truth in the saying that: “had it not been for the shell, the core would spoil”! Islaam is an intact message. The deeds of the heart reflect on the outward behavior and appearance. This evident in the hadeeth in which the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “Truly there is a piece of flesh in the body; if it is sound, the the whole body is sound, and if it is corrupt the whole body is corrupt. Truly it is the heart”-Saheeh Muslim, V. 3, # 3882.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is also certain is that the outward appearance influences the inward condition. In the hadeeth reported by An-Nu’maan bin Basheer, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “Straighten your rows (in prayers) or Allaah would certainly put your faces in contrary directions (i.e. would create dissension amongst you).”- Saheeh Muslim, V. 1, hadeeth # 874 and 875. In another narration reported by Abee Daawood, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: “&#8230;or Allaah would make your hearts differ.”-See Saheeh Al-Jaami’, hadeeth # 1202.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[122] Rooh Al-Ma’aanee, V. 1. The Tafseer of ِAayah # 208 of Soorat Al-Baqara. Published in 1408/1987 by Daar Al-Fikr, Beirut, Lebanon.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">So when they turned away (from the Path of Allaah), Allaah turned away their hearts (from the right Path).</span>” (Qur’aan 61, 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl bin Sa’d narrated that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Beware of the small sins! The similitude of the small sins is like a group of people who came down to the depth of a valley; one (person amongst them) brought a stick (of wood), and another (person) brought another stick (etc.), until they collected what was enough to get their bread baked. It is certain that when the small sins take hold of their possessor they destroy him (her).” [123]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ubaadah bin Qurss said: “you do certain things that are “thinner than hair” in your sight (i.e. not blameworthy in your consideration), but at the time of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) they were considered from the grave offenses.” [124] When this saying of Ubaadah bin Qurss was mentioned to Muhammad Ibn Seereen,[125] he believed it and said: “I consider that trailing of the <em>Izaar</em> is one of the grave offenses because of the severe threat of Punishment that was related in the texts about it. People think of it as one of the minor sins because of their excessive ignorance and false pride.”[126]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[123] Reported by Imaam Ahmad and others. See As-Silsilah As-Saheehah, V. 1, hadeeth # 389.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [124] Reported by Ahmad and others. Waleed An-Nassr reported it as Saheeh in his book: “(The ruling on) Isbaal not done out of Conceit.” P. 29, second edition, 1411/1990. Publisher’s name not mentioned. 125 Abu Bakr, Muhammad Ibn Seereenn, died 110 Hj/729. He was one of the known Fuqahaa’ (Jurists) of the City of Bara-Iraq. He was famous for his in depth interpreatations of dreams.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[126] Reported in Al-Fath Ar-Rabbaanee Bitarteeb Musnad Al-Imaam Ahmad Ashayebaanee, by Ahmad Al-Bannaa As-Saa’aatee, V. 17, P. 291. Daar Ash-Shihaab, Egypt.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Approved Length of the Lower Garment:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Izaar (including pants) must be above the ankles and preferably to the middle of the shanks:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I happened to pass before Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) with my garment hanging low. He said: Abdullah, Tuck up your lower garment. I tucked it up, and he again said: “Tug it still further”. I tucked it still further and I went on tugging it afterward, whereupon some of the people said: “To what extent?” Thereupon he said: “To the middle of the shanks.” [127]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Huthaifah said: “Allaah’s Messenger took by shank (or by the muscle of my shank) and said: “This is the extent of the <em>Izaar</em>. If you dislike it, have it lower (i.e. above the lower end of the shank’s muscle). If you (still) dislike it, then (know that) it is not legitimate that the <em>Izaar</em> extend below the ankles.” [128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-’Alaa bin Abdur Rahmaan reported that his father (Abdur Rahmaan bin Ya’qoob) said: “Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree about wearing lower garment”. He said: “You have come to the man who knows it well. Allaah’s Messenger said: ‘The <em>Izaar</em> of the Muslim should be halfway down his legs-and he is guilty of no sin if it extends between that and the ankles, but what comes lower than the ankles is in Hell. (On the Day of Judgment), Allaah will not look at him who conceitedly trails his lower garment.’ “ [129]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[127] Reported by Muslim, Saheeh Muslim V. 3, hadeeth # 5200.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [128] Reported by Ahmad, At-Ttirmithee, An-Nassaa’ee, and others. At-Tirmithee said it is sound and acceptable hadeeth (At-Tirmithee, Book of Dress # 1783). See As-Saheehah, V. 4, # 1765.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [129] Saheeh Abee Dawood, hadeeth # 3449. Also reported by Ibn Maajah. Al-Albaanee said it is Saheeh as in As-Saheehah, and in Saheeh Al-Jaami’ As-Sagheer, # 921.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said: “It is concluded, therefore, that there are two two cases regarding the men’s Izaar: a highly recommended case where the length of the lower garment is halfway down the shanks, and a permissible length where its lower border is above the ankles.” [130]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Note</strong>: Shortening the lower garment above the middle of shanks is an exaggeration in Deen and it is prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What Clothes Are Covered Under The Laws Regarding Isbaal?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When it comes to the Issue of Isbaal for men, what matters is the length and not the kind of dress. Abdullah bin Umar reported that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<em>Isbaal</em> is lower garment, <em>Al-Qameess</em>,[131] and turban [132]. If anyone trails any of them conceitedly, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Resurrection.&#8221; [133]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Hazm said describing the <em>Musbil</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<em>Isbaal</em> generally covers trousers, lower garments, shirts, and everything people wear.” [134]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[130] Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 259.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[131] Al-Qamees, the Shirt that covers the body halfway to the middle of the legs. Included in this category is the Morocon بُرنُس hooded cloak, جلاَّبية <em>Jallaabiyyah</em> (a loose shirt like garment, the common dress of the male population of Egypt), العبائة Al-’Abaa’ah (a cloak-like, woolen wrap, occasionally striped), and the like Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 260.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[132] This shows that trailing and hanging down is not confined to the <em>Izaar</em> in all of its forms. One should not exceed the usual customs and practices that do not oppose the Islamic teachings. The turban as well as its ends should not be very long in order to safeguard against conceit and arrogance besides this would be considered as extravagance. Some of toady’s lengthy turbans may need a special instrument to roll them! Similarly there is trailing and hanging in the wide sleeves of some garments especially in some parts of Egypt and in Sudan. Imaam Ibn Qayyim, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said: “Lengthy and wide sleeves, which look like bags, were never worn by the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) or anyone of his companions, and (their style) is in opposition to his Sunnah. Their permissibility is doubtful because they they are related to false pride”. Imaam Ash-Shawkaanee, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, described the clothes of some of the scholars as having “wide sleeves such that each one would be sufficient to make of it an outer garment or a shirt for one of his children or to one of the orphans!&#8230;”-Nayel Al-Awtaar, V. 2, 108.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[133] Saheeh Abee Dawood, # 3450, Saheeh Ibn Maajah, # 3567, An-Nassaa’ee, and Ibn Abee Shayebah. Shayekh Al- Albaanee authenticated it in Saheeh Al-Jaami’ # 2770.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[134] Ibn Hazm’s Al-Muhalla, V. 4, P. 100, the Chapter on Salaat (Prayers).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajer quoted At-Tabaree saying: “In the lifetime of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) most people used to wear the <em>Izaar</em> and Al-’Ardiyah (loose outer garments, cloaks, robes, etc.). But When people started wearing shirts and other kinds of clothes (like cloaks etc.), the same ruling of prohibition applied to the trailing and hanging of the <em>Izaar</em> was applied to them. Ibn Battaal said: ‘This is a good analogical deduction. So, even if there is no text that includes the <em>Thobe</em> , the prohibition clearly involves all (i.e. all dresses that hang low)’.” [135]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Isbaal</em> And Prayers:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may have noticed some people tugging up their lower garments (especially pants) when they are about to start their prayers. They refer to a hadeeth reported by Abee Dawood in which it is said that: “Allaah does not accept the prayers from a man trailing his lower garment”. However, the hadeeth is weak. Shayek Nassir ud Deen Al-Albaanee said: “Its Isnaad is weak, because of Abu Ja’far, an un-known as Ibnul Qattan said&#8230;So, whoever authenticated the Isnaad of this is mistaken.” [136]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having said the above, one should be aware that intending to pray in a state of <em>Isbaal</em> out of conceit, subjects the <em>Musbil</em> to a grave punishment from Allaah. Abdullah bin Mas’oud said:“I heared Allaah’s Messenger saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘Anyone who conceitedly trails his Izaar during prayers, Allaah has nothing to do with pardoning him and protecting him (from Hell or from bad deeds).”</strong> [137]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another narration came as <em>Mawqoof</em> (i.e. a narration from a companion. In this case by Abdullah bin Mas’oud). It reads:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Musbil during prayer has nothing to do with pardoning him and protecting him (from Hell or from bad deeds).”</strong> [138]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[135] Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 260.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> [136] Al-Albaanee, Mushkat ul Massabeeh, V. 1, # 761.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[137] Reported by Abee Dawood V. 1, Book of Salat, hadeeth # 637 (Arabic or English Texts). The narration is in At-Tabaraanee in Al-Mu’jam Al-Kabeer , V. 9, P. 315. The checker said: it is authentic.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[138] Reported by Abee Dawood and At-Tayaalisee, V. 1, P. 352, Al-Baihaqee, V. 2, P. 432 (Book of Zuhd), Al-Haythamee in Majma’ Az-Zawaa’id, V. 5, P. 124 (he said: At-Tabaraanee reported it and its narrators are trustworthy), and Al-Albaanee authenticated it in Saheeh Al-Jaami’, hadeeth # 5888. Al-Hafidh Ibn Hajer said: “It was reported by At-Tabaraanee with a good Isnaad from Abdullah Ibn Mas’oud. An issue like this could not just be an opinion (i.e. of Abdullah Ibn Mas’oud)&#8230;”-Fathul Baaree, V. 10, P. 257.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Musbil</em>, therefore, should be aware that <em>Isbaal</em> is a great offense during prayers or after its completion. It should be also noted that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ordered that we should not make <em>Kaft</em> of our clothes or hair during prayers. <em>Kaft</em> is to draw, cluster, pile up, tuck up, or band clothes together right before or during prayers to prevent their spreading [139]. Like, for example, to bring together and assemble the sides of one’s <em>Thobe</em> between the legs when one is about to enter the prayers or during <em>Ruk’oo</em> or <em>Sujood</em>, to pile up the ends of the head-cover on the head or the shoulders, to tuck up the lower ends of the pants,[140] or the ends of the sleeves, etc. In the hadeeth narrated by Abdullah bin Abbaas ,رضي االله عنهما the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said::</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I have been ordered (and thus his Ummah) to prostrate on seven bones: on forehead (along with the tip of the nose), pointed towards his nose, both hands, both knees and the toes of both feet, and not to tuck up the clothes and the hair.” [141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[139]See Ibn Al-Atheer in An-Nihaayah fee Ghareeb Al-hadeeth, V. 4, P. 184.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[140]This is not to be confused with tucking up and then cutting off the trailing ends of the lower garments halfway to the middle of the legs or to an extent that keeps the lower ends of the Thobe, pants, trousers, etc. above the ankles. Even if the lower end is within the recommended limits, it should not be tucked up at its end because that constitutes Kaft.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[141]Saheeh Al-Bukharee, V. 1, hadeeth # 774.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Dress of Men</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The dress of men is governed by the following legislations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1-It is forbidden if it extends below the ankles. The Musbil is under the threat of punishment in Hell.<br />
2-Isbaal itself is Makheelah.<br />
3-If the Musbil intends conceit and arrogance, Allaah will not look at him on the Day of Judgment.<br />
4-Isbaal is not confined to the lower garments. It covers the cloak, robe, pants,trousers, turban, sleeves, etc.<br />
5-The person who does not intend Isbaal and his lower Izaar hangs low out of his control is not a Musbil.<br />
6-The recommended length of the lower garment is halfway to the middle of the shanks, and the permissible is to up to the ankles.<br />
7-The dress must not resemble that of the Kuffar.<br />
8-The dress must not be for fame.<br />
9-The dress must not resemble that of women.<br />
10-The dress must not contain forbidden pictures (human and animal life), or material the essence of which is in disagreement with Islamic Principles including the immitation of the Kuffar.<br />
11-Wearing golden rings, bracelets, necklace, etc. Is forbidden.<br />
12-It is forbidden to wear pure silk.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allaah, the One who gives might to whoever obeys and fears Him; the One Who humiliates whoever ignores His command and disobeys Him [3] (سبحانه و تعالى).  May the <em>Salah</em> [4] and <em>Salaam</em> (peace) of Allaah be upon His Messenger, the believers from his family, and all of his companions, all of whom had their desires in line with the Prophet’s guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This work is a an abbreviation of the original book entitled “<span style="color:#333399;"><strong>The Evidences That Beard Shaving is <em>Haraam</em> (Islamically Unlawful)</strong></span>”. I have restructured the book into a more appealing format that is suitable to all readers. I ask Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) to accept this work and make of it a universal benefit in this World as well as (a prevailing one) on the Day of Recompense when:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">..Neither wealth nor sons will avail, except him who brings to Allaah a clean heart (from Shirk </span>[5]<span style="color:#008000;"> and hypocrisy.</span>} (Qur&#8217;aan 42:88-89)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all Praise is due to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[3] سبحانه وتعالى :<em>Subhanahu Wata&#8217;aala</em>, Most Glorified and Most High is He.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[4] The <em>Salah</em> of Allah upon His Prophet, Muhammad, is His mentioning of the Prophet&#8217;s name and his praise before the angels who are close to (but below) Allaah, the most High. The angels as well as all believers are asked to make <em>Salah</em> on the Prophet. Allah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allah sends His <em>Salah</em> (Graces, Honors, Blessings, Mercy, etc.) on the Prophet (Muhammad) and also His angels too (ask Allah to bless and forgive him). O you who believe! Send your <em>Salah</em> on (ask Allah to bless) him (Muhammad), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islamic way of greeting (salutation i.e., <em>As-Salamu ‘Alaikum</em>).&#8221;</span>(Qur&#8217;an 33: 56).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">This invocation of Salah and Salaam and what it means is abbreviated : sallaa Allaahu ‘aleihi was sallam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[5] <em>Shirk</em>: to associate anything and/or anyone in the worship of Allaah.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE GROWING OF THE BEARD IS:</strong></span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">1-Obedience</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision.</span>} (Qur&#8217;aan 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">{<span style="color:#008000;">And let those who oppose the Messenger&#8217;s (Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) commandment (i.e. his <em>Sunnah</em>, legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) (among the sects) beware, lest some <em>Fitnah</em> </span>[6]<span style="color:#008000;"> befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them</span>.} (Qur&#8217;aan 24:63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the commands of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is the order to grow beards. Ibn &#8216;Umar [7] (رضي الله عنه), one of the companions of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), related that:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“<strong>The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) ordered </strong>[8]<strong> us to: </strong><br />
<strong>trim closely the mustache and to let the beard grow.&#8221;</strong> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[6] <em>Fitnah</em>: disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, being over-powered by a tyrant, etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[7] (رضي الله عنه): <em>Radiya Allahu Annhu</em> i.e. May Allaah be pleased with him.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[8] The wording of the command came as, “let grow, spare, let go, and bring to its full extent”. All are in the command form.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[9] Saheeh Muslim: The authentic book of <em>hadeeth</em> collected by Imam Muslim, V.1, <em>hadeeth</em> # 499 (English translation published by Dar Al-Arabia, Beirut, Lebanon).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) reported that the Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Trim closely the mustache, and grow the beards, and oppose the Magians (Persian fire worshippers).&#8221;</strong> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On one occasion, when the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) received two of Kissra’s [11] emissaries, he disliked to look at them when he saw that they were shaven and with grown mustaches. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Woe to you! Who ordered you to do this?</strong> They said: “Our Lord (meaning their Kissra)”. The Messenger of Allaah (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) then said: <strong>&#8220;But my Rabb (Allaah) ordered me to let my beard grow and to trim my mustache.&#8221;</strong> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The imperative wording in the Prophet’s statement indicates that it is obligatory to comply with the command, and as such, the one who complies will be rewarded and the one who does not is subject to punishment (i.e. as Allaah سبحانه و تعالى wishes).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">[10] Saheeh Muslim, V.1, hadeeth # 501.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">[11] Kissra: Khosru, a Persian King. Kissra is a designation of the Persian kings in general.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">[12] The author said that the hadeeth is hasan: “good”.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2-Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s Sunnah</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, Glorified in His Majesty and Might, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah (Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) you have a good example to follow</span>.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;aan 33:21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">We sent no Messenger but to be obeyed by Allaah&#8217;s leave</span>.&#8221; [13] (Qur&#8217;aan 4:64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>The best of guidance is that of Muhammad</strong> [14] صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed that in his natural constitution, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) had a thick and great beard. The companion Anas (رضي الله عنه) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The Prophet&#8217;s beard filled from here to here (i.e. on the Prophet&#8217;s face)”, while moving his hand across his cheeks.&#8221;</strong> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Sahaabah</em> (the companions رضي االله عنهم) were able to know that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) was reciting (i.e. Qur’aan) in &#8216;<em>Asr</em> (afternoon) and <em>Thuhr</em> (noon) prayers by “the movement of his beard” [16].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whenever the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) performed ablution, he took a handful of water, and, putting it under his chin, made it go through his beard [17], saying: This is how my <em>Rabb</em> (Allaah) commanded me.&#8221; [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[13] Mujaahid, one of the great scholars of <em>Tafseer</em> said that “No one will obey them (i.e. the Messengers) except through the success grantred by Allaah.”-reported in the Tafseer of The Noble Qur’aan by Ibn Katheer, Surat An-Nissaa’, ِAayah 64. “Allaah’s Leave” is also interpreted to mean: “Alaah’s Knoweledge”, reported in Imam Ash-Shawkanee’s Tafseer, the Summarized Version from <em>Fath ul Qadeer</em>, by Muhammad Suleiman Al-Ashqar.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[14] Saheeh Muslim, V.2, hadeeth # 1885.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[15] Reported by Ibn as-Saakir in his famous book of history known as &#8220;Tareekh Ibn as-Saakir&#8221;.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[16] Collected by Al-Bukhari in his collection of hadeeth known as Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V.1, hadeeth # 727 and 728 (English Translation, Dar Al-Arabia Publications, Beirut, Lebanon).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[17] This method is called تخليل <em>takhleel</em>, which means to comb the beard with wet fingers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[18] An authentic <em>hadeeth</em> collected in <em>Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217;</em> (Arabic) # 4696; Published by Al-<em>Maktab Al-Islaamee</em>, Beirut, Lebanon, 1988 Edition, Third Print.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In fact, there are many other collections of <em>Ahaadeeth</em> (sing. <em>Hadeeth</em>) confirming that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) had a great beard. How astonishing are those who claim to love the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) while actually they do not love his figure, but rather prefer the look of his enemies (i.e. by being shaven) [19], when Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) made it clear that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Say (O Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم to mankind): &#8216;If you (really) love Allaah then follow me (i.e. Qura&#8217;an and Sunnah), Allaah will love you&#8230;'&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 3: 31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The love that does not entail its holder to follow and imitate the beloved, is only a claim of love and not true love [20]. One of the <em>Sahaabah</em> رضي االله عنهم said: “While I was walking in Madeenah, a man behind was saying: &#8216;<strong>Lift up your Izaar </strong>[21]<strong>, for it is more pious and makes it (your <em>Izaar</em>) last longer</strong>.&#8217; [22] I turned (towards him), and he was the Messenger of Allaah. I said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah it is only a simple <em>Burda</em> [23] (i.e. one would not think of it as a source of pride and arrogance nor to consider piety and elegance when it comes to wearing it.).&#8217; The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) responded: &#8220;<strong>Don&#8217;t you have an example in me?</strong>&#8220;. I looked (at him) to find that his <em>Izaar</em> extended to the middle of his legs (only) [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[19] This does not reflect a true love of the honorable look of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), especially when it is known that he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) commanded the Muslims to grow their beards.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[20] The following of the Prophet’s way is the thing that is beloved to Allaah. This applies to every matter, even though it may not be obligatory, because the one who loves the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) does not differentiate between what is obligatory and what is not; He followes the beloved because of his love for him. So, how should we view it when the matter is known to be obligatory, as it is the case with the growing of the beard?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[21] A garment that covers the lower half of the body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[20] <em>Isbaal</em> is to wear garments that extend below the ankles. This is absolutely prohibited as confirmed in many authentic <em>Ahadeeth</em>. See Special Section on <em>Isbaal</em>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[23] A black square garment wrapped around the body.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[24] A good <em>hadeeth</em> supported by other narrations as mentioned by the author.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The question raised to the shaven: What would your response be if you start offering excuses to Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), when he is telling you: “Don’t you have an example in me?”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3-A Human Fitrah [25]</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;So set you (O Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) your face towards the religion of pure Islamic Monotheism (<em>Haneefan</em>): i.e. to worship none but Allaah Alone. This is the <em>Fitrah</em> with which He has created mankind. No change let there be in &#8220;<em>Khalqi-illah</em>:, i.e. the religion of Allaah and all that is related to it as explained by Qur&#8217;an and <em>Sunnah</em>.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;aan 30:30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It means, “set your face towards Islam and continue on this <em>Deen</em> which Allaah ordained for you as part of the <em>Haneefiyah</em> (The belief in the Oneness and Uniqueness of Allaah) way of Ibraheem (Abraham). In addition, you are holding to your sound <em>Fitrah</em> with which Allaah has created mankind; It is the natural inclination to know about Allaah and to worship Him alone, in addition to other natural associated characteristics.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Mother of the Believers, &#8216;Aisha ,رضي االله عنها said that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Ten are the acts of Fitrah: clipping the mustache, letting the beard grow, using as-Siwaak [26], snuffing up water in the nose, cutting the nails, washing the finger joints, plucking the hair under the armpits, shaving the pubes, and cleaning one&#8217;s private parts with water. The narrator said, &#8216;I have forgotten the tenth, but it may have been rinsing the mouth.'&#8221; [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[25] <em>Fitrah</em>: The natural state of submission to The Creator, Allaah. Man is born on this state of <em>Fitrah</em>.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">[26] <em>As-Siwaak</em>: A piece of a branch or a root of a tree called <em>al-Araak</em> used as a tooth-brush.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">[27] Collected by Muslim in his Saheeh, V.1, hadeeth # 502.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fitrah is the state upon which the creation of Allaah’s bondsmen has been initiated. He implanted within their nature, its execution, an inclination towards it, and a tendency to like it; He brought them to dislike what contradicts it. In fact, if a man abandons the qualities of Fitrah, his feature will no longer be like that of human being,-then how should one from amongst the common people of Islam, the Deen of Fitrah, be?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person on a straight Fitrah which is not spoiled by the influence of the surrounding environment, keeps inclined by his nature to dislike anything of his body that is not part of its natural beauty. He is also inclined to like the created characteristics of Fitrah, even in the absence of any revealed legislation concerning them. So, how about when they came within the Laws revealed to all of the Prophets from Allaah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suyuti, may Allah’s Mercy be upon him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The best that has been said about the explanation of Fitrah is that it is the old Sunnah (way) chosen by the Prophets which is in agreement with (all) the revealed Laws, thus, indicating that it is a matter upon which they have been created.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">4- A Characteristic Feature of the Prophets</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fitrah, as explained above, is the Sunnah of the Prophets. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And (remember) when the <em>Rabb</em> (Allaah) of Ibraheem (Abraham), tried him with (certain) <em>Kalimaat</em> (commands), which he fulfilled.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;aan 2:124)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbaas (may Allaah be please with him and his father) explained in an authentic report, that the <em>Kalimaat</em> which Allaah tried Ibraheem with, were the qualities of the <em>Fitrah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;aan clearly mentions that Prophet Haroon (Aaron: may Allaah’s peace be upon him) had a grown beard. Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) told about Haroon’s response to his brother, Prophet Moses:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">He (Haroon) said: &#8216;O son of my mother! Seize (me) not by my beard, nor by my head!</span>&#8216; &#8220;(Qur&#8217;aan 20:94).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Had he been shaven, Moses would have not tried to seize him by his beard!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Soorat al-An&#8217;aam after mentioning the names of several Messengers including Ibraheem and Haroon, Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Those (Prophets and Messengers) are they whom Allaah has guided. So follow their guidance.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;aan 6:90)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ordered our Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) to follow the path of the Messengers before him, and this is extended to us, because the command to the exemplar is a command to his followers. Allaah, Most Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah (Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) you have a good example to follow&#8230;&#8221;</span>(Qur&#8217;an 33: 21)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Naturally the beard is one example (as well as a command) for us to follow.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5- The Way of the Believers</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;You (true believers in Islamic Monotheism and real followers of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) and his Sunnah) are the best of the peoples ever raised up for mankind.&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;an 3: 110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (سبحانه و تعالى) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and obedience.&#8221;</span> [28] (Qur&#8217;aan 31:15)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The best people are the people of my generation, and then those who will follow (come after) them, and then those who come after the latter.&#8221;</strong> [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Keep to my Sunnah and that of al-Khulafaa&#8217; ar-Rashidun (rightly-guided Caliphs). Bite on it with your morals.

<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed that Al-Khulafaa&#8217;-ar-Raashidun [32] and others from the Sahabah and at-Taabi’een (those who followed the path of the Sahabah) had great beards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq (رضي الله عنه) had a “thick beard”; Omar (رضي الله عنه) had a “fully grown beard”, and Uthman (رضي الله عنه) had a “great beard”. Ali (رضي الله عنه) had a “wide beard that covered (the area) between his shoulders”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[28] This is Part of the recommendation of Luqmaan to his son. Luqmaan was a righteous man to whom Allaah gave Hikmah (Guidance towards proper understanding, approach, and judgment).</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[30] An authentic hadeeth related by Abu Daawood, Ahmad, Ibn Maajah, Al-Haakim, and at-Tirmidhee.Sheikh Nassir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee further confirmed its authenticity.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[31] From a hadeeth by Jaabir (رضي الله عنه) collected by Muslim, An-Nasaa’ee and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[32] Al-Khulafaa&#8217; -ar-Raashidun, the title given to the first four Caliphs in Islaam.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those were the most wise people of this Ummah according to the general consensus of its scholars. After them came righteous followers and truthful fighters in the cause of Allah who took over the treasures of Kissra [33] (of Persia) and Caesar (of the Romans), the earth’s Eastern and Western regions yielded to them and no one amongst them was shaven.[34]</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[33] Kissra: Khosru, a Persian King. Kissra is a designation of the Persian kings in general.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[34] One of the supplications of the believing slaves of The Most Beneficent is:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And make us leaders for the Muttaq&#8217;een (i.e. the pious and righteous persons who fear and love Allaah much). “</span> (Qur&#8217;aan 25:74)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">Some of the scholars commented on the above ِAayah, saying: “make us followers to those before us (from the Muttaq’een) so that we may fit to become good examples for those who come after us”. There is no related report about anyone from as-Salaf us Salih (righteous predecessors from as-Sahabah, atTaabi’een, and those who righteously follow their path) that he shaved his beared, a matter which they considered not permissible. Had it been a good thing to do, they would have gone to it first, before us! That is becuase they had not left any trait of good except that they had hastened to do. In his book, Maratibul Ijmaa’ (lit. The Levels of Consensus), Imam Ibn Hazm, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“They (i.e., as-Salaf us Salih), agreed that shaving off all of the beared is a Muthlah (alteration of Allaah’s creation) (and thus) it is not permissible”. Shayekhul IslaamIbn Taymeeyah said: “According to the authentic Ahadeeth, the shaving of the beard is forbidden, and no one (from the scholars) permitted it.”</span></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you search across the entire length and width of the pages of the Islamic history, you will not find anyone amongst the scholars of guidance and <em>Masabeeh-ud- Dujaa</em> (people who were like lamps that dissipated darkness), who used to shave his beard. This <em>Dalalah</em> (straying from the right path by shaving the beard), was leaked to us and was “relished” by some Muslims who came in touch with the <em>Kuffar</em> when the latter occupied our land, or, when they (some Muslims) moved to the countries of the <em>Kuffar</em> and their minds became “occupied” by them. Thus they turned away from the guidance of their righteous predecessors, and, instead, followed other than the believers’ path, <em>Hathwa Al-Quthati bil Quthati</em> [35]. They became afflicted by the ways of the Christians and Jews, “braiding them” (i.e. tracing and adopting their practices) inch by inch, and yard by yard!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[35] Al-Qutha, the feather of an arrow. Al-Quthati bil Quthati, the feathers are very similar and successive in their orientation on the arrow. This parable is to emphasize the following and the copying of the deeds of the non-believers. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) gave this parable as well as another parable, saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">&#8220;You will follow the practices of those who were before you, inch by inch and yard by yard; so much so that if they were to enter a hole of a Dhabb (a desert animal that looks like a lizard but bigger in size), you would also follow them&#8221;. We said: &#8216;O Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (do you mean) the Jews and Christians?&#8217; He replied: &#8220;If not them, who else?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">This hadeeth was collected by Al-Bukhaaree, Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V.9, hadeeth # 422. Similar narrations were collected by Muslim, Ahmad, Ibn Maajah and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6-Rujoolah (Manhood) </strong></span><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>and Fuhoolah (Potency and Excellence)</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has created human males and females and made the hair a shared characteristic amongst them, except in some places like the beard and the mustache, where He made the hair growth a distinction between a man and a woman. For a man to put on a woman’s clothes (in imitation), is less profound than imitating her by having his beard shaved, because the beard is the apparent difference and the clear distinctive feature between a man and a woman. [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[36] Medically it is known that the growth of the beard on the male&#8217;s face is one of the effects of the male hormone known as Testosterone. Diseases that may occur to some patients causing a decrease in ar-Rujoolah (demasculinization), is accompanied by a loss of the beard’s hair on the man&#8217;s face. If this hormone is injected in a female it would lead to a loss in femininity (Defeminization) and an appearance of the syptoms of Istirjaal (Virilization) or (Masculinization). Most apparent of these syptoms is ash-Sha&#8217;raaniyeeyah (Hirsuitism) ,الشعرانية where there is an abundant growth of hair in places where there is no normal hair growth, like that of beard and the mustache.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) have made it permissible for men and women to wear clothes that best fit their Fitrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islaam permitted gold and silver to be used by women for beautification purposes, while it prohibited them for men because they are not suitable for the perfection of manhood. As much as it is a beauty for a woman to have no mustache and a beard on her face, the beauty, respect, dignity, and reverence of a man lies in having a beard and a mustache.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">7-Beauty and Honor</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And indeed we have honored the children of Adam..</span>&#8221; (Qur&#8217;aan 17:70)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars said that: “part of His honor to the offspring of Adam, is creating them on the best and most beautiful forms. Other scholars considered that the beards for men and the lock for women are examples of His honoring. Indeed, Allaah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;[Our Sibghah (religion)] is the Sibghah (religion) of Allaah (i.e. Islaam) and which Sibghah (religion) can be better than Allaah&#8217;s&#8230;&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;aan 2:138).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This Sibghah is Islaam, and it is the Fitrah upon which mankind are created, as indicated by many of the Mufassireen (scholars of Tafseer). Part of this Fitrah is the form of man itself.” [37] Allaah, Most Glorified in Might and Majesty, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, We created man of the best stature (mould)&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;aan 95:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O man! what has made you careless concerning your Rabb (Allaah), the Most Generous? Who created you, fashioned you perfectly, and gave you due proportion, In whatever form He willed, He put you together.&#8221;</span> (Qura&#8217;an 82:6-8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The work of Allaah, Who perfected all things&#8230;&#8221;</span> (Qur&#8217;aan 27:88)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The stature and the fashion of our creation is a <em>Ni&#8217;ma</em> (blessing) and honor from Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى). There is no doubt, that the shaving of the beard is a denial of this Ni&#8217;ma and a retraction from the <em>Sunnah</em> of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) whose guidance is the best of guidance. It is also a degeneration to the level of the <em>Kuffar</em> whom the evils of their deeds seem pleasing to them, and thus came to anticipate that perfectness and civilization can be realized when the major apparent distinctions between men and women are eliminated![39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The degree of exaltation of the greatness of beard-growing by the scholars of Islaam reached to the extent that Imams like Abu Haneefah, Ahmad, and Ath-Thaw&#8217;ree said: &#8220;If the beard is &#8216;victimized&#8217; by completely shaving it, and it does not grow again, then the offender has to pay a full Diy&#8217;ah [40] as if he, himself, killed the beard-owner&#8221;. Ibn Al-<em>Muflih</em> (may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him) explained that: &#8220;This is so because he (the offender) had removed the intended purpose of beard-growth. This is the same as if he would remove the sight of the eye.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ansaar [41] spoke highly of a man by the name of Qayes bin Sa&#8217;d, saying: “How good is cheif Qayes, for he is a brave and an honorable man! But he had no beard. Verily! by Allaah if the beard could be bought by Daraahim [42] we would buy him one to complete his manhood!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A member of the clan of Banee Tameem, from the family of Al-’Ahnaf bin Qayes, said: “I wish that we buy Al-’Ahnaf a beard for twenty thousand (of the available currency)”! He did not mention anything about Al-Ahnaf’s Hanafah [43] and ‘Awarah,[44] instead he pointed that his displeasure was because Al-Ahnaf did not have a beard. In fact, wise men look at the man without a beard as someone “defficent, incomplete, of low rank, etc.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[39] On Monday october 29, 1993 a group representing the European Airline Industry issued a warning to the British Airways calling the British airliner to stop executing a policy in which women are assigned separate seats on its flights to and from Saudi Arabia. The airliner explained that its decision is for the comfort of its passengers. The European group considered this as a promotion of &#8220;uncivilized&#8221; practices and threatened that it will boycott the British Airways if it did not comply with their warning!</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that the Justice Shurayeeh said: &#8220;I wish I could find for myself a beard for ten thousand (10,000) Dirhams&#8221;. How strange it is that some people of our times wish to pay large amounts of money to have their beards completely removed so that they don&#8217;t have to shave again!</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaving The Beard Is:</strong></span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1-Disobedience</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in a plain error.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;aan 33:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, then verily, for him is the Fire of Hell, he shall dwell therein forever.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;aan 72:23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As pointed out before, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) commanded the growing of beards and that it is forbidden to disobey the Prophet&#8217;s commands. Allaah تعالى says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it)! and fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is severe in punishment.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;aan 59:7)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: &#8220;And whatsoever I forbade for you abstain (from it)!&#8221; [45]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet&#8217;s command to let the beards grow necessitates saving the beards from shaving or shortening to the degree that it looks close to being shaven. It is so because the command to comply with something is in itself a prohibition against what contradicts it. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do not pluck out the gray (or white) hair because it is the light of the Muslim.&#8221; [46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[45] Collected by Muslim in his Saheeh, V.4, hadeeth # 5818-5820, and by Al-Bukhaaree, Saheeh AlBukhaaree, V.9, hadeeth # 391.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">[46] The author said it is a good hadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no difference whether the hair is plucked out from the beard or the head. Anas (رضي الله عنه) said: &#8220;It is disliked for a man to pluck out the white hair from his beard or his head.&#8221; [47] Actually, the one who shaves his beard dislikes the black as well as the white hair which is the light of the Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related that Omar (رضي الله عنه) and the Justice of Al-Madeenah, Ibn Abee Ya&#8217;laa, turned down the testimony of the person who plucks out the beard&#8217;s hair. Al-Ghazalee &amp; An-Nawawee, may Allaah&#8217;s mercy be upon both of them said: &#8220;plucking out the beard&#8217;s hair when it is about to grow is a resemblance of the Murd [48] and is considered from the grave Munkaraat (wrong-deeds).&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2-Extremism and Deviation From The Guidance of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم), has indeed obeyed Allaah, but he who turns away, then We have not sent you (O Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) as a watcher over them.&#8221;(Qur&#8217;aan 4:80)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since the Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah (verbally, practically, and qualitatively) calls for the growing of the beard, then shaving it is turning away from his sublime way and his honorable Sunnah. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) warned that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever turns away from my Sunnah is not of me (i.e. not one of my followers).&#8221; [49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;He who does an act which our matter (i.e. our religion) is not in agreement with, will have it rejected.&#8221; [50]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[48] Murd (sing. Amrad), the boy with a sprouting hair on his mustache and who reached the age at which his beard would grow, but it is not visible.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever follows other than our Sunnah is not of us.&#8221; [51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Kissra sent two of his men to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) (as emissaries), they came in with their beards shaved and their mustaches grown, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) disliked to look at them, and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Woe to you! Who ordered you to do this (i.e. to shave the beards and grow the mustaches)?” They said: “Our rabb (i.e. Master)-meaning Kissra.”.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon this the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) responded: “But My Rabb (Allaah) Commanded me to let my beard grow, and to trim my mustache.” [52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, what about you, O shaved! What would your feeling be if the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) would get hurt from looking at your face? In fact what would your reply be if he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) turned away his honorable face from you, saying: “Woe to you! Who ordered you to do this?”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3-An Alteration of Allaah&#8217;s Creation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, Most High He is, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;No change let there be in the Khalq of Allaah&#8221; (Qur&#8217;aan 30: 30)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Tafseer (explanation) of this Ayah is that the word &#8220;khalq&#8221; refers to the Fitrah, the creation on the state of belief in Allaah. The ِAayah, therefore, demands not to alter the state of belief in the Tawheed of Allaah, as well as all other qualities associated with the Fitrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[51]The author said it is a good hadeeth. Also mentioned as a good hadeeth in Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217; under #5439.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[52] The author said that the hadeeth is Hasan: “fine”, authentic but does not reach the category of Saheeh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">The alteration of this Fitrah is an obedience to Shaytan (Iblees, the Devil), and a disobedience to Ar-Rahmaan, Exalted in His Majesty. Allaah spoke about the plot of Iblees against man:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">&#8220;And indeed I will order them to change the nature created by Allaah.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;aan 4:119)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">The above Ayah is a clear text that the shaving of beards is a disobedience to Allaah and a change of the qualities of Fitrah. Any change of the nature of creation which Allaah and (or) his Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) did not permit [53] is forbidden. Implicit in the saying of Allaah : تعالى</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">&#8220;And He created you and made good your shapes.&#8221; (Qur&#8217;aan 64:3)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">is the order that (Muslims) “must look nice and clean”. It is as if saying that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">“Allaah has created you in the best shape and most perfect from. So, do not alter His creation (through ways) that will make it ugly and distorted”. Or: “take good care of it by keeping it in a state that ensures the continuity of its beauty, and obey not the Shaytan’s command whereby he orders you to alter the creation of Allaah”.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) warned women that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">&#8220;Allaah curses those ladies who practice tattooing and those who get themselves tattooed, and those ladies who remove the hair from their faces and those who make artificial spaces between their teeth in order to look more beautiful whereby they change the features created by Allaah.&#8221; [54]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[53] Not every change is considered a “change in the creation of Allaah”. Clipping the nails, shaving the head during Hajj at the end of the state of Ihraam, removing the pubic and armpit hair, circumcision, etc. are just some examples of changes that are not only permissable but are meritous, and Allaah’s knows best.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[54] Collected by Al-Bukhaaree, Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V.7 hadeeth # 822 and Muslim, Saheeh Muslim, V.3, hadeeth # 5301 and Ahmad.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) mentioned the cause behind their curse: “changing the features created by Allaah”. Certainly, the curse is an evidence for the inviolability of changing Allaah’s creation. Therefore, the one who shaves off his beard for socalled “beautification purposes” changes the creation of Allaah, Glorified is He above every imperfection. Knowing that what is permitted for women regarding beautification is more than what is permitted for men, then with all the more reason the shaved falls under the threat of receiving Allaah’s curse. Shaving off the beard falls under the meaning of النَّمَصAn-Namass, which is removing the hair from the face or the eyebrows of women to look more “beautifil”. For men, it is even uglier!</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">4-A Resemblance of The Kuffar</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سبحانه و تعالى) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then we have put you (O Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) on a plain way of (Our) commandment (like the one which We commanded Our Messenger before you (i.e. legal ways and Laws of Tawheed). So follow you that (Islamic Monotheism &amp; its Laws), and follow not the desires of those who know not.&#8221; [55](Qur&#8217;aan 45:18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ayah clearly calls for the dissociation from following the desires of those who don&#8217;t follow the command of Allaah&#8217;s Messengers. Their desires include their outward appearance and whatever they like from what is necessitated by their false religion, as well as everything associated with it. Therefore, agreeing to their desires means following their paths (of falsehood). We are ordered to be different from them. Allaah, Most High, says:</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Has not the time come for the hearts of those who believe (in the Oneness of Allaah-Tawheed) to be affected by Allaah&#8217;s reminder of the Truth, lest they become as those who received the Scripture (The Torah and The Gospel) before (i.e. Jesus) and the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened? And many of them Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allaah).&#8221; (Qur&#8217;aan 5716)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above Ayah, the text: &#8220;lest they become as those who received the Scripture&#8221;, is an absolute prohibition against imitating them. Ibn Katheer (in his Tafseer) said: &#8220;That is why Allaah forbade the believers from imitating them in any basic or minor matter.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Part of the goals and objectives established by the Noble Qur&#8217;an and which were detailed and explained by Allaah’s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) is to abandon the resemblance of the Kuffar in their deeds, sayings and desires. Allaah’s Messenger manifested these objectives in many of the branches of the Sharee’ah like Salaat, funerals, fasting, diet, dressing, etiquette&#8217;s and manners, habits, etc. Emphasizing this distinction, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever acts according to a Sunnah (way) other than our Sunnah is not from us.&#8221; [56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jews in Madeenah realized these objectives and felt that the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) purposely intended to be different from them in all affairs even the most private ones. They commented: &#8220;This man (i.e. Muhammad صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) does not want to leave anything we do without opposing us in it&#8221; [57].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever takes the similitude (in manners) of a certain people becomes one of them.&#8221; [58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[56] A good hadeeth as refered to by the author. See F.N. # 42</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">[57] Collected by Muslim, Saheeh Muslim, hadeeth # 592.</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;">[58] An authentic hadeeth collected by Abu-Dawood, Ahmad, and others.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hassan (i.e. Al-Basri) said: &#8220;Rarely a man imitates a certain people except that he would follow them (i.e. in this life and in the Hereafter)&#8221;. Some of the respected people from the Ansaar asked the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, the people of the Book shave their beards and let their mustaches grow. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said: &#8220;Clip your mustaches and let your beards grow and oppose the people of the Book&#8221;. He (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Oppose the Mushrikeen (polytheists): trim closely the mustaches and let the beards grow.&#8221; [59], [60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another hadeeth, the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Juzzoo [61] the mustache, let the beards grow, and oppose the Magians.”-reported by Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[59] An agreed upon hadeeth collected by Muslim, Saheeh Muslim, V.1, hadeeth # 501, and by AlBukhaaree, Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V.7, hadeeth # 780.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[60] Its worth noting that the Mushrikeen at the time of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) had grown beards (see Saheeh Muslim, hadeeth # 1800-Arabic) because the Arabs did not change this beauty neither prior to or after the Revelation came down to the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم). In fact, Islaam acknowledged this quality of the Mushrikeen. The Arabs may have continued on this quality following the sunnah (way) of Prophet Ibraheem, may Allah&#8217;s peace be upon him. Westeners continued to grow their beards until Peter, the King of Russia, spread the act of beard-shaving in Europe in the beginning of the seventh centuary. Later, many Muslims were influenced by this bad western way. As far as how the Muslims opposed the Mushrikeen, who had grown at the time of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) , it was done by triming what extended on the upper lips from the mustache .Whenever the Mushrikeen would shorten their beards, the Muslims opposed them by letting their beards fully grow. The opposition here, therefore, is in the description of the action itself. If the Mushrikeen would shave their beards, we would be (naturally) opposing them in the basic action itself, i.e. letting the beards grow.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[61] Juzzoo: (attain the utmost) in triming your mustach. Shayekh Nassir-ud-Deen Al-Albani said that the “trimming covers only what extends above the lip, and it is not shaving the entire mustache, because this would be against the practical and confirmed Sunnah of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) . That is why when Imam Malik was asked about the one who shaves off his mustache, he replied: “I think he should take a painful beating”. He also said to someone who shaved his mustache: “This is a Bid’ah (innovation) that is emerging amongst the people”-[reported by Al-Baihaqee 1: 151, see also Fathul Baaree 10: 285-286].</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why Imam Malik had a grown mustache; when he was asked about it, he said: “ Zayed bin Aslam reported to me on the authority of ‘Aamir bin Abdullah bin Az-Zubayer, that Umar (i.e. Ibn Al-Khattaab) (رضي الله عنه) used to twine his mutache and blow (his breath out) when he got angry”-authentically narrated by AtTabaraanee in “Al-Mu’jam Al-Kabeer 1:4:1. At-Tabaraanee (1: 329:2), Abu Zar’ah in his “Taareekh 46:1”,and Al-Baihaqee reported that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“five of the Sahabah used to Yaqummoon (remove i.e. the hair of) their mustaches from the side of the lip”. Al-Albaanee commented on the level of the Sanad (chain of narrators) by saying, “it is good”, and that “Ibn as-Saakir reported a similar narration, 8:520:2”. The above comments of Shayekh Al-Albaanee can be referred to in his book “The Etiquettes of Marriage”, PP. 209-210, 2nd Edition, Published by AlMaktabah Al-Islaamiyyah, Amman, Jordan, 1414 Hj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Shaamah, May Allaah’s Mercy be upon him, said: “Some people started to shave their beards, and that is even worse than what has been related that the Magians were shortening their beards!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTE</strong>: Know, may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon you, that the argument that some of the Mushrikeen today are growing their beards does not invalidate the concept of opposing the Mushrikeen, because:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: It is the norm that most of them shave their beards. In fact this Bid’ah (of beard-shaving) did not pass to us except through them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Those amongst the Mushrikeen who kept their beards believing that it is an act of honorable manhood, or because they follow the way of their Prophets, their Fitrah (regarding this particular quality) is sound, since our Sharee’ah agreed to their Sharee’ah in relation to this issue. We still, however, oppose them by trimming the mustache and clipping what extends of it above the upper lip . The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever does not take (i.e. hair) from his mustache then he is not from us.&#8221; [62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Kuffar (like today&#8217;s Jews) grow their beards while others shave them. Either way, we are ordered to oppose those who shave and those who take off some of their beards, but not to oppose those who grow them (except as detailed above). Because, had the ruling been to absolutely oppose all of what the Kuffar do, it would have been incumbent upon us to stop the circumcision just because the Jews practice it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third: The fact that today most Muslims shave their beards does not rebuke the legitimate continuity of the principle of opposing the Mushrikeen because the Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah constitute an established evidence against the Mushrikeen prohibiting the alteration of Allaah&#8217;s creation as well as taking the similitude of women. In addition, the Sunnah established that beard-growing is one of the characteristics of Fitrah which does change with the change of time, nor it changes just because some people deviate from it. Therefore, it is not right that we reject the Laws of Allaah because of the practices of those who oppose us in Deen, or because of negligence by some who belong to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[62] An authentic hadeeth collected by Ahmad, at-Tirmithee, an-Nassaa&#8217;ee and ad-Diyaa&#8217; (See Saheeh alJaami&#8217;, hadeeth # 6533. Sheikh Al-Albaanee commented on this hadeeth saying that “The hadeeth indicates that the permissible thing to do is to take from the mustache some of it, and it is the hair that extends above the lip. However, taking it all as some of the Sufi (mystics) and others do, is , as Imam Malik said,مُثلة Muthlah (deformation)”.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5-Taking the Similitude of Women</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbaas رضي االله عنهما said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) cursed those men who are in the similitude (assume the manners) of women and those women who are in the similitude (assume the manners) of men.&#8221; [63]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Abdullaah bin Umar(رضي الله عنه) saw a woman wearing a bow and walking in a way assuming the manners of men, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Women who assume the manners of men are not from us and also those of men who assume the manners of women.&#8221; [64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that assumption of the manners of women by shaving the beard is more clear and vivid than the wearing of a bow by a woman assuming the manners of men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if a woman puts on a faked beard on her face, she would be assuming the resemblance of men. By the the same talking, the man who takes off his beard, which Allaah beautified him with, would be immitating women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[63] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V.7, hadeeth # 773.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[64] Reported by Imam Ahmad and Abu-Na&#8217;eem. It is an authentic hadeeth as the author said. Also Shayekh Al-Albaanee authenticated it in his book Al-Hijab ,PP. 66-67.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you ask a common Muslim from Ahlu Sunnah [65]: “whom does the face of a shaven man resemble?” He would say: “That of a woman, a boy, a Jew or a Christian”. The scholars called this similitude at-Takhan&#8217;nuth (effeminateness). The renowned scholar of Islaam, Ibn Abdul Barr, may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, said: &#8220;It is Haraam (unlawful) to shave the beard and that only those Mukhan&#8217;nathoon (effeminate) of men who do that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>NOTE</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1) If a man dyes his limbs with Henna [66], he assumes the similitude of women although he may have a beard, a mustache and a turban. The same holds true for the one who shaves his beard, although he may have a mustache, a shirt, and a turban!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(2) Assuming the manners, appearances, etc. of others is a matter that cannot be judged based upon intention, like the cases of murder, beating, or destructive acts. The person who acts to adopt the manners of others will attach to himself the quality of &#8220;similitude&#8221; though he may have not intended it. The corruption resulting from immitation is real, though he may have no objective behind it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) forbade certain deeds behind which there were no intentions or even thoughts for immitation. For example, he (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) forbade praying at sunrise, at one time during the noonperiod, [67] and sunset, lest we immitate the Kuffar who prostrate to the sun at these times, knowing well that the (true) Muslim does not prostrate to anyone except Allaah alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[65] Ahlu Sunnah, Muslims who follow the teaching of Islaam based on the Qur’aan, Sunnah, and the understanding and practice of the Sahaabah and their followers from the righteous predecessors. They stay away from innovations introduced by scholastic theology, Sufism (mysticism), blind immitation to Madaahib, figuiritive interpretations of the Names and Attributes of Allaah, etc.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[66] Henna, a reddish-orange cosmetic gained from leaves and stalks of the Henna plant.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[67] The time when the shade of an arrow rises up all the way on itself and nothing of its shade remains on earth.</span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">6-Humiliation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">None of the early Muslim scholars shaved their beards even once! Some Muslim rulers, who were not scholars themselves, used to punish some wrong-doers by shaving their beards then mounting them on riding animals and walking them in towns in dishonor. That is why some scholars said: &#8220;it is permissible to discipline someone by shaving his head but not his beard&#8221;, because it is originally Haraam to shave the beard. Do not you notice that when the pilgrim ends the state of Ihraam [68] it is a Sunnah (in accordance with the Prophet&#8217;s way) for him to shave (or clip) the head but not the beard? The respect of as-Salaf as-Salih for the beard was apparent in their stiff decisions to reject the testimony of those who shave their beards&#8230; In fact, the scholar Ad-Dusooqee said: &#8220;It is forbidden for a man to shave his beard or mustache and the one who does that must be disciplined”.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>7-Deformation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullaah bin Yazeed Al-Ansaaree that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) forbade An-Nuhba [69] and Al-Muthla (deformation).&#8221; [70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Sumrah and Omraan bin Hussein رضي االله عنهما that: &#8220;Every time the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) gave us a speech except that he ordered us to give charity and forbade us from Al-Muthla (deformation).&#8221; [71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn as-Saakir that Omar bin Abdul Aziz ( may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him) said: &#8220;The shaving of the beard is a Muthla and the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) forbade the Al-Muthla.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ibin Hazzm, may Allaah&#8217;s Mercy be upon him, said in his book Maratib AlIjmaa’ (the Levels of Consensus): &#8220;They (the Muslim scholars) agreed that the<br />
shaving of the beard is a Muthla which is not permissible.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[68] Ihraam, literally it means &#8220;entering into a state of sanctity&#8221;. In accordance with the Sunnah of the Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) it involves the putting on of a particular type of dress and abstention from certain actions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[69] An-Nuhba, means robbing and taking the property of someone else publicly and by force.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[70] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, V.7, hadeeth # 425.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[71] The author said it is a good hadeeth.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some scholars considered the clipping of the beard a Muthla while others considered the shaving of the mustache a Muthla. Imagine what would the position of the scholars be regarding the complete removal of the beard? The face is an honored part of the body because it is the center of beauty and of the senses. Its right, thereofre, is to dignity protection, not Al-Muthla and dishonor. The Prophet (صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّم) taught usin his saying that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When any one of you fights his brother, he should avoid the face&#8221; and in one narration:&#8221;he should not slap at the face.&#8221; [72]</p>
<p>When Suwayed bin Miqrin (رضي الله عنه) saw a man striking his boy (on the face), he said: &#8221; Did you not know that the Soorah (face) is respected.&#8221;- reported by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How strange it is to hear the people of our times congratulating those who deform their natural creation by shaving their beards, saying: Na&#8217;eeman (With Grace!!!!!).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Allaah had allowed me to summarize about this subject. I ask Allaah (the Most Mighty and the Most Exalted) to show me the truth as well as the rest of the Muslims and to guide us to follow it; To make falsehood clear to us and to guide us away from it, and to save us from following desire which leads to misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Glory and Praise is due to You (Allaah). I bear witness that there is no true god worthy of being worshipped except You Alone. I ask Your Forgiveness and I repent to You (Alone). All Praise is due to the Rabb of Al-&#8216;Aalameen (Mankind, Jinns and all that exists).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The completion of the first edition of the book was on Monday 17/5/1414 Nov.1, 1993. Revised on the 4th of Rajab 1425; 20/8/2004</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[72] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree (V.3, hadeeth # 734) and Saheeh Muslim (V.4, hadeeth # 6321 and 6324). The text is that of Muslim.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah, by His Names and Attributes to accept this work by the author and by myself and to make it a reserved reward for the Day of Judgment. I ask Him (سبحانه و تعالى) to forgive me if I had done any mistake and I ask the readers to write their findings and (or) their comments and send them to me: saleh3214@yahoo.com.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">Man always looks for what benefits him and what protects him from harm. However, to accomplish this, man must be able to realize what is harmful. He must then know whom he should need, trust, and love so that he can attain what is beneficial as well as to feel good about his choice. He also must know the proper and good approach that would make him achieve this goal. This latter condition requires that man:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">1.Know about harm<br />
2.What ways can be used to drive harm away</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">Certainly, man can have no better guidance than that which comes from the One Who had perfected everything, and the One who Has no deficiency in Himself and in His Attributes. The One Who is Ever-Living and Who does not die. There can be no One better than the One Who Has no need for anything; the One Who is rich; the Giver; the One who, after all, controls man&#8217;s soul. Man is so poor to Him. He is Allaah, the True and only God. Man can bring harm to himself if he seeks other than Allaah for help. Allaah is the One Who can help man drive away any harm for it cannot occur without His Will and His Power.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) sent down His Books and chose His Messengers to guide man to:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1.Know His Lord as He (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) had explained about Himself, and<br />
2.Seek Him Alone while living in accordance with His plan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowing Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes liberates man from worshiping any form of creation because creation is weak and is in need of The Creator, Allaah. The knowledge about Allaah leads man to know that he is created to live according to Allaah&#8217;s way as revealed to the last Messenger Muhammad . This Revelation contains a complete code of life. Everything that is beneficial or harmful is established so that man can center his life around this Revelation. If man commits wrong and knows that Allaah is Oft-Forgiving he would turn to Him and to Him alone seeking His forgiveness:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Know, therefore, that there is no God Who deserves to be worshiped except  Allaah; and ask forgiveness for your sins.&#8221;</strong>      (Qur&#8217;an, 47:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">It is wrong to think or believe that Allaah created other &#8216;gods&#8217; besides Him so that man turns to them for help; loves them or fear them, etc. He is the same God of all nations. He does not order that people should make of stars, sun, fire, Jesus, Moses, etc. gods besides Him. He (Most Exalted) cannot be &#8216;contradictory&#8217;. He has one way (religion) that calls man to surrender his will only to Him. He warned that if man (even Muhammad  would take partners with Him, then his work will fail and will be among losers:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And verily, it had been revealed to you (O Muhammad ) as  has been revealed to those before you. If you join others in worship with Allaah (then) surely (all) your deeds will be in vain and you will certainly be among the losers. Nay!  But worship Allaah and be among grateful.&#8221;</strong>(Qur&#8217;an, 39:65-66)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">Let us know what Muhammad , the man-Prophet, who knew Allaah best, used to say:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;O Allaah, I seek refuge in You for Your Pleasure and against Your Wrath,and in Your Forgiveness and against Your Punishment and in You from You, I cannot Praise You as You can Praise Yourself.&#8221;</em> (Muslim, Abu Dawoud, at-Tirmidhi, ibn Majah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;I have surrendered myself to You, I have directed my face to You, I have entrusted my affairs to You, I have compelled my back to refuge in You, in want and in fright of You, there is no resort nor survival from You except (in turning) to You. I have faith in Your book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) which You brought down and in the Prophet (Muhammad ) you have sent.&#8221;</em> (Al-Bukhari, Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">When we read in the Qur&#8217;an that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;Whatever of Mercy (i.e. of good), Allaah may grant to mankind,  none can withhold it, and whatever He may withhold, none can  grant it thereafter. And He is the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&#8221;</strong>   (Qur&#8217;an, 35:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">And when we read that:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;If Allaah touches you with hurt, there is none can remove it but He; and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His favor which He causes it to reach homsoever of His slaves He will, and He is the Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.&#8221;</strong> (Qur&#8217;an, 10:117)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">We should be motivated to return to Him Alone at times of ease and at times of hardship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when we read that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;If Allaah helps you none can overcome you, and if He forsakes you, who is there, after Him, that can help you. And in Allaah (alone) let believers put their trust.&#8221; </strong>(Qur&#8217;an, 3:160)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">The Qur&#8217;an, therefore, leads man to a true liberation from any false attachment. It brings peace to the heart. It helps the believer against hypocrisy and all forms of dishonesty. Imagine, for example, a believer facing a problem at work. He sees wrong and faces unlawful practices. He does not fear rejecting what is wrong. He knows that the job is only a means to gain his sustenance. While he may be unable to correct what is wrong, he knows well that Allaah is the One Who provides. If he leaves his job for the sake of Allaah, Allaah will give him a better one. Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And whosoever fears Allaah and keeps his duty to Him. He will make a way for him to get out (from) every (difficulty), and He will provide him from (sources) he could never imagine.&#8221;</strong>(Qur&#8217;an, 65:2-3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">The above texts, necessitates that man must depend upon Allaah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) asking Him Alone for assistance. It also requires that man must love Allaah and worship Him Alone to gain His pleasure and His help. Is it not true that the people who consider this life as the &#8220;Final Goal&#8221; end up worshiping many things in it? You see them so careful about &#8220;having it all&#8221;. They torture themselves: pain, difficulty, constant worry, keeping their hands in the banks for loan after loan to keep up with the &#8220;demands of development&#8221;. They are under the constant threat of fore-closure. They constantly see poverty in front of their eyes. The Prophet  said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>&#8220;Allaah says: &#8216;Son of Adam: Fill your time with My worship and I will fill your heart with richness, and end off your poverty. But if you donot, I would make your hands fully busy (i.e. in worldly affairs) and I would not end off your poverty.'&#8221;</em> (At-Tirmidhi said that it is a good hadeeth)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="art">Our purpose of existence on earth is more meaningful than being slaves to worldly gains. There can be no meaningful life better than that prescribed by our Creator Allaah. Every act done according to Allaah&#8217;s way is an act of worship. Man is the beneficiary and Allaah is in no need:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allaah, but Allaah is Rich (Free of all wants and needs), Worthy of All Praise.&#8221;</strong> (Qur&#8217;an, 35:15)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The submission and obedience of man to His Creator is the essence of Islam. The Name “Islam” is chosen by God (Allaah) and not by man. It is the same message revealed to all the prophets and Messengers by Allaah and which they spread amongst their respective nations. In its final and universal form it was revealed to Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم: may Allaah exalt his mention and save him and his message from all kinds of evil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah is the identifying name or title of the Majestic, sole and True God. This noun which is the name of Allaah applies to none other than Him. He, Most Majestic and Most High, has other names all of which follow on from His name Allaah. The meaning of the name Allaah is the ma’looh (that which is worshipped out of love, magnification, deification, and longing). He is the Creator: to Him belongs the Commandment. No worship is worthy of being given to a stone, statue, a cross, a triangle, Khomeini, Farakhan, Elijas, Malcom’s X or Y, Ghandi, Krishna, Gurus, Buddha, Mahatma, Emperor, Joseph Smith, Sun, Moon (not to that from Korea too), Diana, light fire, rivers, cows, Rama, Temples, Prophets, Messengers (Yes! Muslims do not worship Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), Saints, Priests, Monks, Haile Selassie, Movie Stars, Sheiks, etc.!! All are created beings or things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The name Allaah is not chosen by man and it is not named after a prophet, saint or any famous man. The name “Allaah” was referred to by all prophets including Adam, Jesus, Moses, and by the last and final Prophet, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), as the One true God who deserves to be worshipped alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The innate nature in man (fitrah) recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false. It recognizes that the Attributes of Allaah must be True, Unique, and All-Perfect. It does not feel comfortable towards any kind of degradation of His Attributes nor does it relax towards associating human qualities to the Creator. Many who became “discontent with God” did so because of the practices of the Church in medieval Europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in a son”, and that “everyone is born with an original sin”. They “escaped” into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the “material world”. With the advancement of materialistic technology others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about God” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!” not realizing that they have chosen the worship of the “origin god” of Rome: The god of desire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Today we can see that all of this materialistic progress produced a spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and psychological problems. Many of those who “fled” their “religions” are in search again. Some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily lives via various means. Those who had the chance to examine the Qur’an and Islam, proceed with a complete code for life which requires man to fulfill the purpose for his presence on earth. Allaah does not want for man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust, money, other men, desire, or sex. He provides the proofs that he is the One who can deliver man from the slavery to any form of creation and to turn to his Creator alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Creator has Perfect Attributes. He is the First, nothing is before Him. He is the Last, everything ends except Him; the Most High, nothing is above Him; the Most Near, nothing is beyond His reach and his compassing, and He is the Most High in His nearness. He is the Ever-Living, to Him we shall all return, where everyone will be dealt with in the Most Perfect and Just way. He does not beget nor is He begotten. Those who attribute Divinity to Jesus forget or ignore the fact that Jesus was in a mother’s womb. He needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. He was trusted with the Gospel (Injeel) as a message to the Children of Israel. A man-messenger calling his nation not to worship him. A man who needs to eat, walk, sleep, rest, etc. cannot have Divine Attributes because he is in need, but Allaah, the God of Jesus, is far above any imperfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With respect to Buddhism, Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Rastafarianism, etc., all are forms of worship to created beings/things in one form or another. Jews had attributed a nationalistic belonging to Allaah: “The Tribal God” of Israel. Men and women following these religions were born with the natural inclination of worshipping their Creator, Allaah. It is their parents who had driven them into their respective traditions. Once they are exposed to the Signs of Allaah around them, or in the Qur’an, or to someone who triggers their Fitrah (natural inclination to worship Allaah alone), the reverting process begins, and that is why we see a universal spreading of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many distortions of Islam in the media, worldwide. However, Despite the wrong practices of some Muslims (rulers and ruled) in some countries, those who seek the truth are judging Islam according to its doctrines. That is why we continue to witness a global growth in the number of people accepting this true religion of Allaah. The opposition to Islam will intensify with the spread of this truth in the world. This is not a conflict of “civilizations”, but rather the real struggle between the truths presented in the creed and principles of Islam and false doctrines and ways of worship. This is a real challenge for those who seek the Truth. Man is created for a purpose: to live a life in accordance with Allaah’s way. Why Not? Do we posses the air we breathe? Did we create ourselves or others? Or were we ourselves the Creators? So is it our right to ignore our Creator when we are all need of Him? Allaah is All-Just and All-Wise. He does not intend confusion for His Creation. The religion accepted to Him is the one chosen by Him. Its essence must be One, because He is One and only one True God. It is the religion of submission to the Will and Commandment of the One Who brought us to life, the Ever Living who will never die. It is the complete way of life for all mankind. All these qualities are chosen by Allaah in His only religion: Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that you will come with an open heart to read the Noble Qur&#8217;aan, because none can expose the truth better than the Word of Allaah. The Qur&#8217;an was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in Arabic and it is not authored by him for he was unlettered. The translations of its meanings into many languages are available in bookstores or in an Islamic Center close to you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You may want to know how does one become a Muslim. In order to become a Muslim one must openly recite ash-shahaadah (the profession of faith): La ilaaha illallaah, Muhammad Rasoolullaah which means that there is no true god except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. This means that there is no god worthy of being worshipped but Allaah, and that He must be worshipped only according to the teaching of His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Those teachings are best understood by the Prophet’s companions, and those who rightfully follow their path until the Day of Resurrection. They are called as-salaf as-saalih (the Righteous Predecessors). May Allaah, the Most High, guide us all to this path.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The Relation of the Shahaadah with the Types of Tawheed Question 5: But does the Shahaadah Comprise the Types of Tawheed?

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Relation of the Shahaadah with the Types of Tawheed</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 5:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">But does the Shahaadah Comprise the Types of Tawheed?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> Indeed it does encompass the types of Tawheed altogether, either by way of inclusion or implication. This is because a persons statement, “I testify that La ilaaha illallaah,” is immediately understood such that the intended meaning is Tawheed al-’Ibaadah (i.e. to single Allaah out with all worship). This type of Tawheed, also called Tawheed al- Uloohiyyah, is inclusive of Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah (i.e. to single Allaah out with Creation, Sovereignty and Control of affairs), because everyone who worships Allaah alone, would not worship Him until he firmly attests that ar-Ruboobiyyh is exclusively His.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also comprises the Tawheed of al-Asmaa’was-Sifaat,[15] because man does not worship except what he knows to be worthy of worship due to the Names and Attributes He has. This is why Ibraaheem said to his father:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>O my father! Why do you worship that which hears not, sees not and cannot avail you in anything?</em> </span>[Qur’aan, soorat Maryam (19): 42].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Tawheed of al-’Ibaadah, which is Tawheed al- Uloohiyyah, comprises both Tawheed ar-Ruboobiyyah and that of al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] Tawheed al-Asmaa’ was-Sifaat is to single Allaah out with all of the most beautiful Names and superlative Attributes which He has affirmed for Himself or which His Messenger, Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم has affirmed for Him, without Tahreef (changing or distorting the meaning of the Names and Attributes), without Ta’teel (denying or suspending their meanings), without Takyeef (specifying how they are), and without Tamtheel (exemplification). It also involves denying all that which Allaah has denied from Himself.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Meaning of The Shahaadah: Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 13:</strong> You explained the meaning of the Shahaadah: La Ilaaha Illallaah. So, what is the meaning of the Shahaadha: Muhammad Rasoolullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> As for the meaning of the testification that Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the Messenger of Allaah [Muhammad Rasoolullaah] then it is the attestation with the <strong>tongue</strong> and the belief with the <strong>heart</strong> that Muhammad bin ‘Abdullaah al- Qurashee al-Haashimee is the Messenger of Allaah to all of the creation, to the Jinn and mankind, as stated by Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Verily! I am Allaah’s Messenger to you all. He is the One to whom the Dominion of the heavens and the earth belongs, none has the right to be worshipped but Him; It is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger, the Prophet who can neither read nor write, who believes in Allaah and in His Words [this Qur’aan] and follow him so that you may be guided.</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-A’raaf (7): 158].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, The Most High, also Said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>(Exalted is) Blessed be He Who sent down the Criterion [of right and wrong, i.e. the Qur’aan] to His slave [Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم] that he may be a warner to the ‘Aalameen (mankind and Jinn).</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Furqaan (25): 1].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Shahaadah necessitates that</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you <strong>believe</strong> whatever Allaah’s Messenger informed you of;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you <strong>comply</strong> with whatever he commands;</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you <strong>avoid</strong> whatever he forbade and prohibited, and that</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you do not worship Allaah except with that which he <strong>prescribed</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also necessitates that</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">you do not believe that Allaah’s Messenger has any share nor any right in Ar-Ruboobiyyah or in controlling the affairs of the creation, nor any right to be worshipped at all.<span style="line-height:1.5;">Rather, he صلى الله عليه و سلم is a slave worshipper, not one to be worshipped; and that he is a Messenger who is not to be belied. </span></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">It is not in his power to bring harm or benefit, neither for himself nor for others, except as Allaah Wills.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is evident in the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say [O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم]: “I do not tell you that with me are the treasures of Allaah, nor that I know of al-Ghayeb (the hidden and unseen); nor I tell you that I am an angel. I but follow what is revealed to me (by inspiration).”</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 50].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is a slave of Allaah who acts as he is commanded and follows the orders he is given. And Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">[Say O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم]: “It is not in my power to cause (bring) you harm or bring (guide) you to the Right Path.” Say: “None can protect me from Allaah’s Punishment [if I were to disobey Him], nor should I find refuge except in Him.”</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Jinn (72): 21-22].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, The Most High, also Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم): “I possess no power of benefit or hurt to myself except as Allaah Will. And if I had the knowledge of the Ghayeb, I shoud have secured for myself an abundance of wealth, and no evil should have touched me. I am but a warner, and a bringer of glad tidings unto people who believe.”</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-A’raaf (7): 188].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this is the meaning of the testimony of Laa Ilaaha Illalaah, Muhammad Rasoolullaah. From this meaning the person knows that nothing from the creation deserves the right to be worshipped, not the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم nor anyone from the creation who is below him in rank; and that worship an only be for Allaah, alone; and that the right of Allaah’s Messenger upon us is to give him the rank and standing which Allaah, The Most High, gave to him: The slave of Allaah and His Messenger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Some haters of Islam often say that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) married a &#8220;six-years old child,&#8221; referring to &#8216;Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her. What is the response?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s covenant of marriage was conducted when she was six years old, but the actual commencement of the marriage took place when she was nine-years of age. She was the only virgin he married. Marrying at such young age was not the exception in Arabia at that time. In fact many were married in the young age period of 9-12 when they were physically mature. Furthermore, had this been something degrading and immoral, the enemies of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) from the Pagans would have loved to use this against the character of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s father (Abu Bakr, may Allah be please with him), the first one to believe the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and support his propagation of Islam. Not to mention this would have been a major block against the spread of Islam amongst the Arabs if the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would appear as a man of &#8220;uncontrolled sexual drive.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This would have been obvious to resort to, especially when it is known that they accused the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) of many other things like being a magician, a poet, etc. The fact that they did not attempt even to consider this marriage as a tool against the integrity of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) stands as a strong irrefutable evidence that such marriages were of the norm, not the exception. In so many societies, it was even considered that the girl who does not get married before she reaches fifteen years of age as someone being &#8220;late&#8221; on the scale of marriage timing! In fact such marriages were common in Asia, East Europe, Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, it was known that one of the Pagans (Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im bin &#8216;Adiye) was interested to marry &#8216;Aaisha before her engagement to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), but her mother (Umm Romaan, may Allah be please with her), rejected him. This proves that she was physically mature for marriage. Her family sought the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) because of his noble character as her mother asserted when she told her husband (Abu Bakr صلى الله عليه و سلم) of her intent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a great wisdom in her marriage whereby &#8216;Aaisha witnessed the revelation and the rulings of Islam pertaining to the most particular and private matters of women, transmitting that to the men and women of the world. She reported about 2100 narrations from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) covering rulings, worships, and transactions . She was the greatest woman scholar in Islam and she had many students of knowledge from the companions of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>

</em><em><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/points-of-benefit-regarding-visiting-the-graves-dr-saleh-as-saleh.pdf" target="_blank">Points of Benefit Regarding Visiting the Graves </a>&#8211; Dr Saleh as Saleh [PDF]</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Ruling on Visiting Graves and Its Benefits</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Visiting the graves is legalized for men, and the preponderating opinion is that it is forbidden for women. In visiting graves, there are two benefits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) A lesson for the visitor – It will help remind the believer of the Hereafter.<br />
2) Seeking Allaah’s (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى: subhaanallaahu wa ta’aalaa) forgiveness for the deceased</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Scenarios of Visiting Graves</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Visiting graves falls into the following categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Visiting the graves in order to call upon their occupants – This is major shirk and takes the person out of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Example: The visitor says, “O so and so, I ask you to relieve me.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2) Visiting the graves in order to invoke Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) by the gravesite – This is in principle an innovation; in addition, it can turn into a fitnah (affliction) for the visitor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For instance, if Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) answers his request, he may think it was due to the blessing of the grave’s occupant; however, we know the occupant possesses nothing of this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3) Visiting the grave to invoke Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) by the occupant – This involves putting the grave’s occupant as an intermediary between him and Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى); this is unlawful and could become major shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Example: “O Allaah, I ask you by the right of this occupant and the right of Muhammad (: sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) upon you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4) Visiting the grave in order to agitate grief – Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) said anything that agitates the affliction is from lamentation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Example: Whenever a person remembers his beloved ones (e.g. father, mother, relatives, etc.) that have died, he visits their graves and this may fall under lamentation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5) Visiting the graves to invoke Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) for its inhabitants – <strong>This is permissible</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6) Visiting the graves for remembrance of the Hereafter and contemplation – <strong>This is permissible.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, only the last two scenarios fulfill the legal justifications for visiting the graves, and both are recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Visiting the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه وسلمصلى الله عليه وسلم) Grave</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Establishing a journey specifically for visiting the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) grave is forbidden; however, establishing a journey to visit his masjid is permissible. If a person is visiting his masjid and passes by his grave at which point he makes salaam, there is no harm in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is imperative to remember that there is a difference in legality between visiting the grave of the Prophet and the legal visits to the rest of the graves. Other graves are apparent while his grave is screened by three walls. It is because Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) answered the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) invocation when he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O Allaah, do not make my grave an idol that is worshipped.”</strong> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى) answered his call as it is being sealed and screened by these walls. The people of knowledge, including Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) noted, this barrier is the reason why it is permissible for women to &#8220;visit&#8221; the grave of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم), since it is shielded while others are apparent. Similarly, in normal visits to graves, the person stands by the head of the deceased; however, this is not the situation at the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) gravesite.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Etiquettes at the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) Grave</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a person stands by the grave of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم), one may say :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Salaam be upon you O Messenger of Allaah. I bear witness that you have delivered the message, fulfilled the trust, and advised the Ummah.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for anyone to raise his hands by the grave, and worse than that is to do so with his face towards it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the person finishes his salaam to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم), he should give salaam to the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه وسلم) companions, Abu Bakr (radiyallaahu ‘anhu) and ‘Umar (radiyallaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Women also may do the greeting since (i) this is a &#8220;following&#8221; of the preceding &#8220;visit&#8221; and not an &#8220;independent one,&#8221; and (ii) they would be like the situation of passing by a cemetery where, according, to some opinions, they are allowed to great the grave occupants. And Allaah Knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">[1]Shaykh al-Albaani, rahimahullah, authenticated it in Tahdheer al-Saajid min Ittikhaadhil Quboor Masaajid (pg. 24-26).</span></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As to the often-raised question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why did Allah permit the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) more than four wives while limiting the number to four for the rest of the Muslim men (Qur&#8217;aan 4: 3)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is from the particularities that Allah gave him. In contrast, there are certain rulings that are allowed for the general Muslims but not permitted for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), like taking charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, many things pertaining to rulings and/or miracles were made particular to Prophets and Messengers before. Of all the Prophets and Messengers, five were distinguished the most (Noah, Abraham. Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, peace be upon them all), and Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was further distinguished as the leader of all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that there are great and noble wisdoms for such particularizations. We are not commanded, however, to search and find them, especially if such search arises from objection to the decree of Allah or due to certain doubts concerning it. This often comes from deviants and/or enemies of Islam. Nothing of this of course occurs from the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The position of the Muslims regarding the wisdoms behind matters of Islam should be as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If they see any clear wisdom(s) relevant to these matters, then they take by it and thank Allah for that, and if not</span></strong></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">then they ask the people of knowledge, and</span></strong></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">in case there is no apparent wisdom reached at by the people of knowledge, then they say: &#8220;Allah Knows Best,&#8221; and they should not resort to any speculation lest they end up forging lies against Allah.</span></strong></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What about the Prophet&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Marriage to Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her) after her Divorce from Zayed bin Haarithah (may Allah be pleased with him)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zayed bin Haarithah (radhi Allaahu anhu) was a slave of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) before he freed and adopted him. His name was Zayed bin Muhammad until Allah revealed the command:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allah.</em></span> [Qur&#8217;aan 33: 5].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards people called him Zayed bin Haarithah. As to Zaynab, she was Zaynab bint Jahsh bin Rabaab Al-Asdiyyah. Her mother was Umaymah bint &#8216;Abdul Mutalib, the aunt of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). It was the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) who worked for her to get married to Zayed when he was his adopted son. She initially refused and said she was better than him in lineage. It is reported that Allah صلى الله عليه و سلم revealed the following verse concerning this matter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in a plain error.</span></em> [Qur&#8217;an 33: 36].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So she accepted and submitted in obedience to the command of Allah and as a fulfillment of the wish of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). She stayed one year in marriage with Zayed. They encountered some marital problems. So Zayed complained to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), and he, Zayed, hinted that he may divorce her. So the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told him to hold on to the marriage and be patient despite the fact that he knew by inspiration from Allah that Zayed will divorce her and that she will be his (the Prophet&#8217;s wife). He, however, feared that people might insult him as someone who marries his adopted son&#8217;s wife, something forbidden in the pre-Islamic traditions. Allah (Azza wa Jal) blamed the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And (remember) when you said to him (Zayed bin Haarithah; the freed slave of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on whom Allah has bestowed Grace (by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم too) have done favour (by manumitting him) &#8220;Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allah.&#8221; But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allah has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e., Muhammad married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him</span></em>. [Qur&#8217;an 33: 37].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you hid in yourself what Allah informed you already of that which will actually take place (divorce of Zaynab from Zayed) and your marriage of her in accordance with Allah&#8217;s plan and as manifestation of His Wisdom. Moreover, that you feared people&#8217;s sayings and their insults while Allah deserves to be feared most. Thus, you should have declared what was inspired to you from the details related to you, Zayed and Zaynab, without any consideration of people&#8217;s attitudes.<br />
As to the Prophet&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) marriage from Zaynab, he conducted the marriage contract on her after she finished her waiting period following her divorce from Zayed. Allah gave her in marriage to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) without a guardian on her behalf or witnesses, for he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the guardian of all believers. Rather he is closer to them than their ownselves, as Allah described him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم is closer to the believers than their ownselves, and his wives are their (believers&#8217;) mothers (as regards respect and marriage).</span></em> [Qur&#8217;aan 33:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Though this marriage, Allah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) nullified adoption as practiced in the pre-Islamic era, and made it lawful for Muslims to marry the wives of adopted sons after divorce or death of the husbands. This is from Allah&#8217;s Mercy and a removal of any unease regarding such relations. Allah clearly stated in the following decree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">So when Zayed had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them). And Allah&#8217;s Command must be fulfilled.</span> </em>[Qur&#8217;aan 33: 37-40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the story claiming that the Prophet&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) heart became attached to Zaynab after he saw her from behind a veil, and he fell in love and desired her, and that when Zayed knew of this he disliked her and decided to divorce her, then this has not been verified in any authentic way. The Prophets are far removed from such base manners and are in high and noble rank in their characters and behaviors. Not to forget that it was the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) himself who wanted her to get married to Zayed in the first place. Had he been attached to her, and in love with her, he would have preferred her for himself, especially when she refused to marry Zayed in the beginning. The reality, therefore, is that it is the pre-decreed plan of Allah and His judgment in order to nullify the habits and traditions of the pre-Islamic days of ignorance, and to have Mercy and Clemency on mankind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Beneficent, the Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8230;I begin to write:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah. We praise Him, and seek His help and forgiveness. We seek refuge in Allaah, Most High, from the evils of our own selves and from our wicked deeds. Whomever Allaah guides cannot be misguided, and whomever He leads astray cannot be guided. I testify that there is no true God worthy of being worshipped except Allaah, alone, without partner or associate. I further testify that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).1 May Allaah’s salaah and salaam also be granted to the Prophet’s pure family and to all of his noble companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O you who believe! Fear Allaah [by doing all that He ordered and abstaining from all that He forbade] as He should be feared [obey Him, be thankful to Him, and remember Him always] and die not except in a state of Islaam&#8221;</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:102)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind! Be dutiful to your Rabb [2] [Allaah], Who created you from a single person [Adam] and from him [Adam] He created his wife [Eve], and from them both He created many men and women. And fear Allaah through Whom you demand your mutual [rights] and [do not cut the relations of] the wombs [kinship]. Surely, Allaah is ever an All-Watcher over you.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat An-Nisaa’ (4:1)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Keep your duty to Allaah and fear Him, and speak [always] the truth. He will direct you to do righteous good deeds and will forgive you your sins. And whosoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger has indeed achieved a great success.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Ahzaab (33:70-71)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most truthful speech is that of Allaah&#8217;s Book [the Qur’aan] and that the best of guidance is that of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). The worst of evils are the muhdathaat (newly-invented matters [in the deen] [3], and every innovated matter (in the deen) is a bid’ah; every bid’ah is a dalaalah (misguidance), and every dalaalah is in the Fire of Hell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We hear nowadays a strange call by organized groups involving some Christians, Jews, and “Muslim” intellectuals calling for <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>wahdatul adyaan</strong></span>. They claim that these three religions stand for the same belief that there is One God and should unite in their call for the implementation of great moral values. Some of those involved call for the establishment of centers containing churches, synagogues, and massaajid side by side, printing the Qur’aan, the Bible, and the Torah in one binding, etc. In the name of defending Islaam against political and media distortions in the West, some organizations are compromising the basics of the Isamic creed through what is called “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Bridging the Faiths</strong></span>.”[4] This is a very dangerous call because it mixes the truth with falsehood and thus practically implies the elimination of the truth perfected in the deen of Islaam. The Christians and Jews want the Muslims to be like them. That is why they support this deceptive call for “unity”. Allaah (Azza wa Jal) spoke of their attempts and called the Muslims to be aware of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">They wish that you reject Faith, as they have rejected (Faith), and thus that you all become equal (like one another).</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat An-Nisaa’ (4:89)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the fundamental beliefs in Islaam is the kufr (unbelief) of the Christians and Jews because they reject the Qur’aan and the message of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to them. They have also altered their books in such a way that it permits or even enjoins worship of other than Allaah and (or) the association of partners with Him in worship. <strong><span style="color:#333300;">Any Muslim who doubts their kufr is a kaafir himself.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some Mulsims who do not understand certain texts from the Qur’aan and (or) authentic sunnah and may be easily deceived by the call for “unity of religions”. It is important to know that if certain texts are not clear to some they are clear to others from those who are firm in the knowledge of the deen.[5] Consequently, nothing stays unclear for those who are seeking the truth and not just following vain desires. For example, some may understand that the following text is evidence that the Jews and Christians are not kufaar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Verily! Those who believe and those Jews and Christians, and Sabians,[6] whoever believes in Allaah and the Last Day, and work righteousness shall have their reward with their Rabb [Allaah], on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</em></span> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:62)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islaam bin Taymeeyah said: “The aayah (above) tells about the followers of these four unaltered milal (Paths) before abrogation [by the advent of Prophet Muhammad’s complete message.].” [7] It, therefore, addresses those who believed in tawheed and followed the Path of Allaah as was known to them. Those who continued on this belief and did not alter the Scriptures must follow the Qur’aan and the Message of Islaam as explained by Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Furthermore, the order of the explained, رضي الله عنهما above aayah, as ibn ‘Abbaas was canceled by aayah 3:85, which states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.</span></em> [Qur&#8217;aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3: 85)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the alterations in their religion, most of the People of the Book turned kufaar and few remained on the original teachings of the Torah and the Gospel. This is clear in the Qur’anic texts where Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And had the People of the Scriptures believed,[8] it would have been better for them; among them are some who have faith,[9] but most of them are al-Faasiqoon [Disobedient to Allaah and His Messenger, and rebellious against Allaah&#8217;s Command].</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:110)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the above description, Allaah (Azza wa Jal) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Not all of them are alike; a party of the People of the Scripture stand for the right, they recite the aayaat of Allaah during the hours of the night, prostrating themselves in prayer. They believe in Allaah and the Last Day; they enjoin what is right and forbid what is wrong, and they hasten in good works; and they are among the righteous</span></em>. [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:112-114)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This party includes those who held to the original Scriptures before they were abrogated by Qur’aan and sunnah. They were on the right religion enjoining tawheed and forbidding shirk, just as Allaah described the believing followers of Mûsa (alaihis salam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And of the people of Mûsa there is a community who lead [the men] with truth and establish justice [i.e. judge men with truth and justice].</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-A’raaf (7:159)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever held to these qualities amongst them (i.e. to the true revelations), prior to the advent of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), was a believer. The believers from the People of the Book who accepted the Prophet&#8217;s Message of Islaam will receive a double reward:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And who believe in that which has been sent down [revealed] to you [Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم]10 and in that which was sent down before you [the Torah and the Gospel, etc.] and they believe with certainty in the Hereafter.</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:4)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And there are, certainly, among the People of the Scripture, those who believe in Allaah and in that which has been revealed to you, and that which has been revealed to them, humbling themselves before Allaah. They do not sell the aayaat of Allaah for a little price, for them is a reward with their Rabb [Allaah]. Surely, Allaah is Swift in account.</span></em>[11] [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:199)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Those to whom We gave the Scripture [i.e. the Torah and the Injeel etc.] before it,—they believe in it [the Qur&#8217;aan]. And when it is recited to them, they say: “We believe in it. Verily, it is the truth from our Rabb. Indeed even before it we have been from those who submit themselves to Allaah in Islaam as Muslims [like ‘Abdullaah bin Saalam and Salmaan Al-Faarisee, etc.].”These will be given their reward twice over, because they are patient, and repel evil with good, and spend [in charity] out of what we have provided for them.</span> </em>[Qur’aan¸ Soorat Al-Qasas (28:52-54)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been confirmed that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Three persons will get their reward twice [i.e. a double reward]. [One is] a person who has a slave girl and he educates her properly and teaches her good manners properly [without violence] and then manumits and marries her. Such a person will get a double reward. [Another is] a believer from the People of the Scriptures who has been a true believer [in his Prophet],* and then he believes in the Prophet [Muhammad-صلى الله عليه و سلم]. Such a person will receive a double reward. [The third is] a slave man who observes Allaah&#8217;s rights and is sincere to his master [and observes the rights of his master]*.”</em></span> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur’aan also mentions the case of believing monks and priests who followed the true teachings of ‘Eessa (alaihis salam) and who believe in the revelation to Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and would love to be from the ummah of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity to the believers [Muslims] the Jews and pagans; and you will find the nearest amongst them in love to the believers those who say: “We are Nassara (Christians).” [13] That is because amongst them there are priests and monks, and they are not proud. And when they [who call themselves Christians] listen to what has been sent down to the Messenger [(صلى الله عليه و سلم)], you see their eyes overflowing with tears because of the truth they have recognized. They say: “Our Rabb! We believe, so write us down among the witnesses [Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his nation]. And why should we not believe in Allaah and in that which has come to us of the Truth [tawheed]? And we wish that our Rabb will admit us [in al-Jannah on the Day of Resurrection] along with the righteous people [Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his So, Allaah rewarded them .[رضي الله عنهم companions with Gardens under which rivers flow [in al-Jannah], they will abide therein forever, because of what they said. Such is the reward of good-doers.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Maa’idah (5: 82)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aayaat cited above are some of the qualities of the believing Christians, who believed in the true Message of Jesus (a’leihis-salaam). In our times, any “Christian” who holds to similar beliefs and hears of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) must accept him and accept that which he is entrusted with (i.e. Islaam). Then he is a believer. If they know about Islaam, they must declare their acceptance of it unless it will result in their death. They are called then to migrate to daarul-Islaam if they are able to.Otherwise they are called to exert that which they are able to, and Allaah knows best. [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in case he never heard of the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), then his case rests with Allaah15 in light of Allaah’s saying: <em><span style="color:#008000;">“And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger.”</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Israa’, 17: 15].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Some Muslims say: “But Allaah (Azza wa Jal) had mentioned in the Qur’aan that there are churches, synagogues, and monasteries where the Name of Allaah is mentioned. So, how can we understand this in light of the above explanations about the People of the Book?”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allaah. The aayah in the Qur’aan where the above places are mentioned is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Had it not been that Allaah checks one set of people by means of another, monasteries, churches, synagogues, and masaajid, wherein the Name of Allaah is mentioned much would assuredly have been pulled down.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Hajj (22:40)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The masaajid are the places where the Name of Allaah was and still being mentioned. When they were on their original faith, the People of the Book mentioned the Name of Allaah in their places of worship. However, because of the alterations in their religions, shirk in worship was introduced, even though some of them may mention the Name of Allaah. Hence, their places of worship cannot be considered as boyoutullaah (Houses of Allaah), because they committed kufr and their places contain a wide range of blasphemous symbols (pictures, crosses, etc.).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam ibnul Qayyim</strong> said: [16] “Had it not been for Allaah&#8217;s checking of one set of people by means of another, these places (mentioned in the aayah) which were beloved to Allaah before Islaam (i.e. in its final and comprehensive form), would have been pulled down. After Islaam, these places are known to Allaah, but hated. Allaah, for example commanded special treatment to the People of the Book under the Islamic Rule, including their protection, yet He (Azza wa Jal) hates them. He commanded the defending of their places of worship, yet He hates them because other than He is being worshipped in such places&#8230;” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Atiyyah said: “He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) checked them when they were on the Truth before the alterations and abrogation [i.e. of their religions].” [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Light of the Above, all the present nations of Jews, Christians, Sabians (if any are left), and those who worshipped Allaah based upon their fitrah,[19] must come to the Final Message from Allaah, and submit to Him alone in Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The People of the Book as they exist now accepted other than Allaah as deities. No doubt that they are kufaar as Allaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) refers to them. When they according to ,عليهما السلام followed Mûsa and ‘Eessa the unaltered Torah and the original Gospel, respectively, they were Muslims then. Does a knowledgeable Muslim believe that those who think of ‘Eessa as Savior, a son of God, Three in One, etc. are believers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, in disbelief are they who say that Allaah is the Messiah, son of Mary!</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Maa’idah (5:17)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Are those who believe in Trinity believers in tawheed? Allaah says about them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, disbelievers are those who said: “Allaah is the third of the three [in a Trinity].” But there is no True God but One God [Allaah].</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Maa’idah (5:73)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They remain as people of the Book since a Book was revealed to their respective Prophets. Whoever says he is a believer in their Books, even in their altered forms, is from the People of the Book. Any Christian or Jew, who dissociates himself from his respective Book and denies it, cannot be considered as being from the People of the Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, Allaah, the All-Wise and All-Just, legislated certain guidelines that define certain relationships between the Muslims and the People of the Book. Amongst such relations, is marriage to the ‘afeefah (chaste) women of them,[20] eating their lawfully slaughtered meat, etc. Such distinctions do not make them true believers in Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah commented on the following aayaat:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Those who disbelieve from among the People of the Scripture [Jews and Christians] and al-Mushrikeen,[21] were not to leave [their disbelief] until there came to them clear evidence.</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Bayyinah (98:1)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And say to those who were given the Scriptures [Jews and Christians] and to those who are illiterates [Arab pagans]: “Do you [also] submit yourselves [to Allaah in Islaam]?” If they do, they are rightly guided,</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:20)],</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: “And other aayaat like those above address those who exist [i.e. from the Jews, Christians, and mushrikeen]. The Scripture that is referred to is the Book in their hands in which alterations and abrogation were carried out, and does not refer to those who held to the Scriptures before they were altered and abrogated, because they were not kufaar then. Also, they were not [the ones being addressed] by the Qur’aan as “you People of the Book,” because they died before the Qur’aan was revealed. So, all those who believe in the existing Books [altered and abrogated], are from the “People of the Book,” and they are kufaar because they hold to altered and abrogated Books, and they are, like all other kufaar, in Hell forever,[22] although Allaah, the Exalted, commanded that they pay jizyah [23] and made it permissible to eat their food and marry their women.” [24]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">In Conclusion:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The only deen accepted to Allaah is Islaam.<br />
2. Islaam is the last and final message to all mankind (Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, etc.)<br />
3. Islaam abrogated all religions.<br />
4. The Qur’aan is the true Word of Allaah and it abrogated all of the previously-revealed Scriptures.<br />
5. The Torah and al-Injeel as they exist in the hands of the “People of the Book” are altered. Even if their original forms are to be found at any time, then they are still abrogated by the Qur’aan.<br />
6. Had their Prophets been alive they would all follow and abide by the teachings of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). This is the Covenant which Allaah took upon all the Prophets. [25]<br />
7. Every believer should firmly believe that the Jews and Christians are kufaar and enemies of Allaah, His deen, the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), and the Believers.<br />
8. The kufaar who die on kufr will dwell forever in the Hell of Fire. However we don’t judge that a particular kaafir is in Hell except when their is a specification from the Qur’aan and (or) authentic sunnah.[26]<br />
9. The call for “Unity of Religions,” sometimes misleadingly called a “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Comity of Religions</strong></span>,” aims at eliminating everything which distinguishes Islaam from kufr.<br />
10. Calling and supporting the concepts of the “Unity of Religion” is considered riddah (apostasy).[27]<br />
11. The above does not mean that the Muslim abandons calling the kufaar to Islaam.<br />
We are ordered to call them to the way of Allaah, and this is in the best of their interest and thus da’wah to Allaah is the best advice given to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the great ways of da’wah is to deal with them justly and to call them to Allaah in the best way which is based upon good knowledge.[28] This does not mean that the Muslim compromise the basics of his deen. It also does not mean that Muslims should indulge with the kufaar in an aimless dialogue such as: “Tell us how you pray and we will tell you how we pray,” as done by some people who engage in such dialogue. The most important thing is: Who deserves to be worshipped alone? [29] They worship idols, images, men, etc. We worship the true God of all creation. So we call them with the right knowledge to abandon shirk and to submit to Allaah in tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best methodology (manhaj) of da’wah is that exemplified by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) when he sent Mu’aath ibn Jabal (radhi Allaahu anhu) to the “People of the Book” in Yemen. The first thing he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) commanded him to do is to call them to tawheed and belief in Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as His Messenger.[30] Then he told him: “If they obey you to do so, then inform them that Allaah has enjoined upon them five salawaat [prayers] in every day and night [in twenty-four hours], and if they obey you and do so, then inform them that Allaah has made it obligatory for them to pay sadaqa [zakaat] from their properties and it is to be taken from the wealthy among them and given to poor among them.” [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I wrote about this matter several years ago when some Muslim brothers started to engage in “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>dialogue</strong></span>” with the People of the Book. I cautioned our brothers to establish that the “dialogue” should transform into a way for da’wah and not “negotiations” because we cannot negotiate on shirk. Now with the call for “Unity of Religion,” I urge all the Muslims to advise each other about the dangers of this concept and to direct their respective communities to disassociate from this Path of kufr. May Allaah Who is the Most High, above everything, guide the misguided and preserve and protect our ummah from all afflictions and innovations in deen. Aameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. The Muslim disassociates himself from all forms of kufr and shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. The believer distinguishes between the natural love he has for his father, mother, wife, husband, son, daughter, etc. from the unbelievers and enmity towards them because of their kufr. The natural love is something recognized by Islaam, otherwise Allaah would not have permitted marriage from chaste women of the People of the Book. This natural love of the kinsfolk and the just and good treatment of the thimmi,[32] non-harbi,[33] mu’aahad,[34] and the musta’min,[35] does not necessitate that we love them the love which obliges friendship and alliance. This kind of love is forbidden by Allaah because they oppose Allaah and His deen. The believer stands in a state of walaa’ (alliance and loyalty) and baraa’ (disassociation): alliance with the Believers who are obedient to Allaah and His Messenger, and enmity and disassociation from the unbelievers and those opposing Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم). Allaah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">You will not find a people who believe in Allaah and the Last Day, loving [by having friendship and alliance] with those who oppose Allaah and His Messenger [Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم], even though they were their fathers, or their sons, or their brothers, or their kinsfolk. For such He has decreed true Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Rooh [proofs, light and true guidance] from Himself. And We will admit them into the gardens of [al-jannah] beneath whose trees rivers flow and they will dwell therein forever. Allaah is pleased with them and they with him. They are the party of Allaah. Indeed the party of Allaah are the successful.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Mujaadalah (58:22)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This strengthening mentioned in the aayah applies to everyone who does not love the enemies of the Messengers, even though they may be one’s close relatives. This love is not the same as the natural (jibilli) love, but it is the love of nusrah which entails giving allegiance to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dealing justly with the non-combatant from the unbelievers is commanded by Allaah. Hence:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) The natural love is created by Allaah. He permitted it to occur.<br />
(b) The enmity towards the unbelievers because of their disbelief and rejection of Allaah is legislated by Allaah.<br />
(c) Dealing justly with the non-combatants from the unbelievers is commanded by Allaah. It is forbidden to harm them, especially if they are under the protection of a Muslims or in a Muslim land permitted by the Muslim ruler as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Whoever killed a mu’aahad shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of fourty years (of traveling).</span></em> [Al-Bukhaari, v. 9, no. 49].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this matter is not a “political” affair, rather it is from the Deen of Allaah. And the “evil of these actions, is that it causes the distortion of Islaam, since the enemies of Islam will capitalize on such occurrence in order to distort the reputation of Islam and to turn people away from it, although Islaam is innocent of such acts&#8230;” [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why all believers in Allaah who love Islaam should disassociate themselves from these deviant paths even if they raise “attractive” banners, remembering that the early dissidents (al-Khawaarij) were foremost in worship of Allaah, yet they deviated from the true Path. Since the three matters are all from Allaah and since He (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Allaah burdens not a person beyond his scope,</em></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:286)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the three matters outlined above are within the scope of the believer and they are just and not contradictory:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Had it been from other than Allaah, they would surely have found therein much contradiction.</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat An-Nisaa’ (4:82)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Path of the prophets. Contemplate about Prophet Nooh (alaihis salam) and His son when the just decree of Allaah (the Deluge) [37] came upon the kufaar from the people of Nooh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And Nooh [Noah] called out to his son, who had separated himself [apart], ‘O my son! Embark with us and be not with the unbelievers.’</em></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Hood (11:42)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His son chose the way of the unbelievers and thought that he will be saved from the water if he takes himself to a mountain. Nooh (alaihis salam) invoked Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">And Nooh [Noah] called upon his Rabb [Allaah] and said, ‘O my Rabb! Verily my son is of my family! And certainly, Your Promise is true, and You are the Most Just of judges.’</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Hood (11:45)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily my son is of my family!” This is the natural relationship, the jibilli one. Allaah, Most High, reminded Nooh (alaihis salam) of His command of Legal disassociation (al-baraa’ ash-shar’i) from the kufaar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>“O Nooh! Surely, he is not of your family [not from the believers of your family]; verily, his work is unrighteous, so ask not of Me that of which you have no knowledge! I admonish you, lest you be one of the ignorant.”</em></span> [Qur’aan, Soorat Hood (11:46)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The immediate submission of Nooh was clear in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nooh said: <em><span style="color:#008000;">“O my Rabb! I seek refuge with You from asking You that which I have no knowledge. And unless You forgive me and have Mercy on me, I would indeed be one of the losers.”</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Hood (11:47)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a clear distinction between the jibilli and shar’i perspectives in the relationship between Nooh and his son. Contemplate also the relationship with parents:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>And We have enjoined on man [to be dutiful and good] to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years—give thanks to Me and to your parents—unto Me is the final destination. But if they [both] strive with you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not, yet deal with them justly and kindly in this life.</em></span> [Qur’aan, Sooart Luqmaan (31:14 &amp; 15)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Friendship and alliance and pleasing those who oppose Allaah are an indication of either lack of faith or its weakness in the heart of the believer. It is against reason that a person can have walaa’ for someone who is an enemy of the one he truly loves. You find those who have walaa’ for the unbelievers doing things which will earn the love and friendship of the unbelievers by any means. Those who know the truth regarding this matter must remind them of the command of Allaah that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe do not take as friends and protectors your fathers and your brothers if they choose unbelief to belief and whoever of you takes them as friends and protectors is one of the transgressors.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Sooart At-Tawbah (9:23)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Mighty and Majestic, set for us the example of Prophet Ibraaheem (alaihis salam) by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">There has been for you an example for you to follow in Ibraaheem and those with him, when they said to their unbelieving people: ‘We are free of you and whatever idols you worship besides Allaah, and we deny what you are upon and we reject you; and because of your disbelief in Allaah and your worship of others besides Him, enmity and hatred has arisen between us for ever, unless you believe truly in Allaah, and single Him out, and worship Him alone.’</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Mumtahinah (60:4)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The efforts to gain the friendship of the Jews and Christians are useless, as they will never be pleased with the Muslims until the Muslims follow their religion. Addressing Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم), the Imaam of the Muslims, Allaah, the Exalted, warned him that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you [O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)] till you follow their religion.</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Baqarah (2:120)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, the command to abstain from following the paths of the Jews and Christians applies to the entire Ummah of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Verily, therein is indeed a reminder for him who has a heart or gives ear while he is heedful.</em> </span>[Qur’aan, Sooart Qaaf (50:37)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam of Allaah be upon Muhammad, his family, his companions, and those who follow on their path in righteousness until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] (Sallallaahu ‘Alayhi wa Sallam): The salaah and sa-laam of Allaah be upon His Prophet Muhammad. The salaah of Allaah upon Prophet Muhammad is His Praise of the Prophet before the angels who are close to (but below) Allaah, the Most High, who istawaa (ascended) His ‘arsh (Throne), which is above the seven heavens, in a manner that suits His Majesty. The angels also praise the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). The salaam is Allaah’s safeguarding of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) from deficiencies and any kind of evil, and the protection of the Message with which he was entrusted. When the Muslim says صلى الله عليه و سلم (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), he invokes Allaah to grant His Praise and Security to Prophet Muhammad and the protection of the Message of Islaam which was revealed to him (صلى الله عليه و سلم). [See Ibnul Qayyim’s Jalaa’ul Afhaam fee Fadlis-Salaati-wa-Salaam ‘alaa Muhammadin Khairil Anaam, [Damascus, Syria: Daar ibn Katheer, and Al-Madeenah, KSA: Daarut-Turaath, 1408/1988], p.128.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Rabb: Allaah is Ar-Rabb. He is the One Who gave all things the power to grow, to move and to change, to Whom belongs the Creation and Commandment; the Master Who has no equal in His Sovereignty, Predominance, and Highness, The One Who Provides for and Sustains all that exists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Deen: The practical and doctrinal aspects of deen are more comprehensive than the Western concept of religion. The deen of Islaam is the way of life prescribed by Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] So often one hear the following: “We are cousins of Jews and Christians. We worship the same God, follow the teachings of the same Prophets, and believe in the same books. We are all followers of Abraham.” This concept is in direct opposition to the teachings of the Qur’aan and authentic Sunnah. Those who associate partners with Allaah in worship and (or) worship Prophets are not believers in Allaah. The books of the Jews and Christians contain alterations and are completely abrogated by the Qur’aan. The Jews and Christians are not followers of the faith of tawheed of Ibraaheem (Abraham) for Ibraaheem was neither a Christian nor a Jew, he was a pure Muslim, as Allaah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Ibraaheem was neither a Jew nor a Christian, but he was a true Muslim Haneefan (who worshipped none but Allaah Alone) and he was not of Al-Mushrikeen.</span> </em>[Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:67)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Had they been true followers of their Prophets, the Jews and Christians would believe in the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his message of Islaam. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“By Him (Allaah) in Whose Hand Muhammad’s soul is, there is none from amongst the Jews and the Christians (of these present nations) who hears about me and then dies without believing in the Message with which I have been sent (i.e. tawheed), but he will be from the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire.”</span></em> [Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh (English Translation), vol. 1, no. 284].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The belief in the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the attestation with full acceptance and submission, not just mere attestation, that what he brought forth is the truth. That is why Abu Taalib (the uncle of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not become a believer in the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), despite his attestation to what the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) brought forth and his witness that it is the best of religions.The brother who uttered the aforementioned statement should repent to correct it, and declare the truth in the best ,تعالى Allaah possible way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Allaah (Azza wa Jal) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">If only they had referred it to the Messenger or to ulil-amr [learned scholars and those charged with authority] among them, the proper investigators would have understood it from them [directly].</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat An-Nisaa’ (4:83)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was the norm for the sahaabah to ask the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in his life of what they did not know. Then after his death they asked the learned amongst them, and so did those who followed their path in righteousness. Asking the learned scholars, therefore, was the way of the salaf especially if something doubtful arose.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] A past nation who used to live in al-Mawsil (‘Iraq) and said, “La Ilaaha Illal-laah.” They were neither Jews nor Christians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Ibn Taymeeyah in Al-Jawaabus-Saheeh Liman Baddala Deenal-Maseeh (The Correct Response for those who Altered the Religion of ‘Eessa) [Riyaadh, KSA: Daarul ‘Aasimah, 1414/1993] vol. 2, pp. 212-213. As to whether Jews and Christians of our times are from the People of the Book or not, one first should understand what the term “People of the Book” means. It means that original Books were revealed to their prophets, Mûsa and ‘Eessa, respectively. When they held to the beliefs of ‘Eessa and Mûsa, they were not kufaar. However, when they continued to believe in the altered and abrogated forms of these Books and commit shirk, they became kufaar, even though they are still referred to as “People of the Book.” Allaah knew they would alter the Books and warned them against that. He (Azza wa Jal) still refers to them in the Qur’aan as “People of The Book,” and clearly states that they have committed kufr and deviated from the path of tawheed which their prophets called them to adhere to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Like the belief of Muslims who accepted the Message of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Includes those amongst them who had faith before Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was sent to mankind. The believers whom Allaah described:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him [‘Eessa] compassion and Mercy&#8230;So, We gave those among them who believed their [due] reward, but many of them are Fassiqoon [rebellious, disobedient to Allaah]. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Hadeed (57:27)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10]The revelation includes the Qur’aan and the authentic sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] Ibn Taymeeyah explained that some of the sahaabah (e.g. Jaabir ibn ‘Abdullaah, ibn ‘Abbaas, and Anas ibn Maalik as well as most of the scholars mentioned that رضي الله عنهم the aayah (Qur’aan 3:199), was revealed concerning the faith of an-Najaashi, the king of Abasseenyah known as “as-hamah” (‘Atiyyah, in Arabic), who knew that the Message of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was the truth confirming that of ‘Eessa before him. He accepted Islaam but was unable to migrate to daarul-Islaam (where Islaam is the apparent and practiced deen), nor he was able to declare it amongst his Christian nation. After the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) knew of his death, he called upon the sahaabah and performed the funeral prayers in absentia on an-Najaashi, thus confirming his belief in Islaam. The aayah, therefore, may apply to anyone from the People of the Book or the mushrikeen who lives in daarul-harb (a land in which the kufaar are prevailing, or land of the kufaar between whom and the Muslims there is no peace) and who believes in Allaah and in Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as Allaah&#8217;s Final Messenger, yet unable to declare his faith openly or unable to migrate to any Muslim country. He does what he is able to do from the acts of worship and as he knows them. [See ibn Taymeeyah’s Al-Jawaabus-Saheeh], pp. 202-210.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Those who claim to be followers of ‘Eessa (alaihis salam) and the true Injeel (Gospel) should have a general love for Islaam and its people, because the teachings of ‘Eessa (alaihis salam) were based upon mercy and kindness:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And We ordained in the hearts of those who followed him compassion and Mercy. [Qur’aan, Soorat Al-Hadeed (57:27)]. In fact they must submit to Allaah and His deen because the in ,عليهما الصلاة والسلام messages of ‘Eessa and Muhammad calling the people to the tawheed, are the same.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] This is correction of the original statement “in shaa’ Allaah, believers,” and which came in the first print as well as in the first print of “The Message and the Messengers.” And Allaah’s forgiveness is sought in case of any error.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Allaah willed them to exist, yet He hates the shirk practiced by them. He willed and created Iblees (the Devil) and He hates him. This is His Universal Will: al-iraadah al-kawniyyah. Allaah’s Judicial Will: al-iraadah ash-shar’iyyah is to protect their places of worship as long as they do not openly carry out their worship outside such places, and they conform to all of the rules regarding their interactions with Isamic Law.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] Fitrah: natural inclination to worship Allaah alone. Every human is born on this state. That is why if someone reverts to Islam, then he/she returns to his initial state of submission to the only true God, Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] Certainly it is advised to marry the Muslim woman even if a chaste woman of the people of the Book offers herself for marriage to a Muslim. There are so many problems associated with marriage to women from the People of the Book in our times. The Muslim must be very careful about such a decision if it deems necessary.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21]Mushrikeen: Those who commit shirk including pagans, polytheists, idolaters, and unbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah and in His Messenger Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] Head-tax imposed by Islaam on the People of the Book and other people who have a revealed book when they live under Muslim rule, wherein they and their properties and wealth are protected.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24] Quoted in Majmoo’ Al-Fataawaa, vol. 35, pp. 227-228.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25] Allaah says (what means): And [remember] when Allaah took the Covenant of the Prophets, saying: ‘Take whatever I gave you from the Book and Hikmah [understanding of the Laws of Allaah], and afterwards there will come to you a Messenger [Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم] confirming what is with you; you must, then, believe in him and help him.’ Allaah said: ‘Do you agree [to it] and will you make up My Covenant [which I conclude with you]?’ They said: ‘We agree.’ He said: ‘Then bear witness, and I am with you among the witnesses [for this].’ [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-’Imraan (3:81)]. Furthermore, in the hadeeth reported by Imaam Ahmad and others, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said (what means), “If Mûsa were alive and present among you, it would not be permissible for him to do anything but to follow me.” [Ash-Shaykh Al-Albaani stated that it is reported by Ahmad, Al-Bayhaqi, and Ad-Daarimee, Al-Laalkaa’ee, Al-Harawee and others, and that its degree of authenticity is hasan. See Mishkaatul-Masaabeeh, vol. 1, no. 177].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[26] Example Abu Taalib is in Hell, and Fir’awn is in Hell, as well as others specified in authentic texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[27] This ruling has been published as a religious verdict (fatwa) by the Permanent Committee for Islamic and Educational Research in Saudi Arabia on the 25th of Muharram, 1418 (corresponding to 31-5-1997), no. 19402.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[28] The aayah in Soorat Al-’Ankaboot (29:46):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(which means), <em><span style="color:#008000;">“And do not argue with the People of the Scriptures (Jews and Christians), unless it be in [a way] that is better, except with such of them as do wrong, and say [to them]: “We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you; our Ilaah [God] and your Ilaah [God] is One [i.e. Allaah], and it is to Him we submit [in Islaam],”</span></em> calls the believers to argue with the People of the Book in a way that is better, i.e.inviting them to Allaah with His aayaat (verses, proofs, evidences, etc.) using the clearest indicative words which proves the objective and to avoid being harsh save with such of them as do wrong. [See Tafseer ibn Jareer At-Tabaree for this aayah as well ibnul Qayyim’s Madaarijus-Saalikeen (Beirut, Lebanon: Daarul-Fikr, checked by Muhammad Haamid Al-Fiqee, n.d.], vol. 1, pp. 445-446. It is not a call for interfaith dialogue. It is a call for a common word between them and us. This word has been defined by Allaah, Most High, in the following Aayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[which means]: <em><span style="color:#008000;">O People of the Scripture [Jews and Christians]: Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allah, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allah. Then if they turn away, say: “Bear witness that we are Muslims.”</span></em> [Qur’aan, Soorat Aal-‘Imraan (3:64)]. Certainly it is not a call for “comity” or “unity of religions.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] In the year 1415 (1995), I wrote a book as well as a short article entitled, “<strong>Who Deserves to be Worshipped Alone?</strong>” In shaa’ Allaah (Allaah Willing) it is helpful to address people from all religions. The article is available on the site: understand-islam.net.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><em>[You may want to read <a title="Most Distinguished Qualities of the Saved Group – Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2015/01/09/most-distinguished-qualities-of-the-saved-group-shaykh-ibn-uthaymeen/"><strong>Most Distinguished Qualities of the Saved Group – Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen</strong></a> before reading the below]</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 55</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Is there something you want to add concerning the qualities of the saved sect?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> The truth of the matter is that there isn’t anything to add, since the four fundamental matters that we have mentioned are clear and sufficient. However, it might need some details with respect to the matter of manners. So, the most important aspect of manners is unity and agreement on the truth, the thing that Allaah (Azza wa Jal) has enjoined on us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Your Rabb (Allaah) prescribed for Noah, and that which We revealed to you –[O Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)], and that which He prescribed for Ibraaheem, Moosaa, ‘Eesaa–that you should establish the Religion, acting upon what is prescribed, and not split into sects regarding it.</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat ash-Shooraa (42): 13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (Allaah Azza wa Jal) informed us that those who split their Religion into sects, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is clear of them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">Verily, those who divided their religion and break up into sects, you Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) have no concern of them in the least.</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat al-An’aam (6): 159].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So agreement and unity of the hearts are from the most distinguished qualities of the saved group, ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah. In case disagreement amongst them occurs due to Ijtihaad,[74] in matters where Ijtihaad is applicable, then they do not hold enmity, hatred or hostility against each other. Rather, they believe that they are brothers even if this kind of disagreement takes place amongst them. This is true to the extent that each of them would pray behind the Imaam believing that the latter is not in a state of Wudoo´ whilst the Imaam believes he does have his Wudoo’. An example for this is that each of them would pray behind someone who ate camel meat believing that it nullifies the prayer whilst this Imaam believes that it does not. Thus each of them consider that the prayer behind this Imaam is correct, even though if he would have prayed the same prayer [after eating camel meat] by himself, he would have consider it incorrect. All of this is because they consider that the difference in opinion arising from Ijtihaad, in cases where Ijtihaad is permissible, is, in reality, not a disagreement. Since each one of the disputants follows what is incumbent upon both for them to follow from the evidence that is impermissible for either one to relinquish. They see that if their brother disagrees with them regarding a certain action and does this in compliance with the evidence, then in reality he is in agreement with them. This is because they themselves call for the following of the proof wherever it may be. So if he disagrees with them based upon his conformance with what he regards as valid proof, then in reality he is in agreement with them, since he is in conformity with that which they call for and aim to, from judging by the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is well known to many scholars what took place between the companions with regard to similar matters of disagreement, even during the time of their Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not harshly denounce anyone of them. When he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) returned from the battle of al-Ahzaab, Jibreel came to him and directed him to set out for Banee Quraydhah who broke the covenant with the Muslims. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) then ordered his companions and said: “None of you should pray ‘Asr except at Banee Quraydhah.” [75] So, they left Madeenah for Banee Qurayadhah, and when the time for ‘Asr prayer arrived some of them delayed their prayer until they reached Banee Qurayadhah and therefore prayed it outside of its time. They did not pray until after sun set, since the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “None of you should pray ‘Asr except at Banee Quraydhah.” Others prayed on time and said that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) intention was for them to make haste in setting off. [76]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those were the ones who were correct in their understanding. In spite of this, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not blame anyone of them, and none of them held any enmity or hatred against each other because of their disagreement in understanding this text. That is why I believe that it is a binding duty upon the Muslims who belong to the Sunnah that they should be one nation, and that factionalism should not occur amongst them–a person belongs to this group and another belongs to another group, and the third belongs to a third group and so on. In such a manner, they fight amongst each other with the spears of their tongues. They hate each other and take enemies out of each other because of a disagreement whose ruling is permissible to deduce by way of Ijtihaad. There is no need for me to specifically mention each group. But the sensible person would understand and the matter would be clear to him. So, I believe that it is incumbent upon ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa’ah to unite even though they may dispute in that wherein they have been differing as a result of their understanding of what is necessitated by the texts. All praise is due to Allaah, for this is a matter in which there is ample scope for accommodation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is important is agreement and unity of the hearts. And there is no doubt that the enemies of Islaam love that the Muslims are divided, regardless whether they are enemies who openly express their hostility, or enemies who pretend to be friends of Muslims or Islaam, while in reality they are not. So, the obligatory thing is that we should be distinguished with this distinctive mark and that is we are from the saved sect that agrees to unity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Point of Benefit : Is it permissible to pay someone to teach the Qur’aan?</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> Researched By Dr. Saleh As-Saleh 1427/2006</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hamdulillaahi Rabbil ‘Aalameen was-Salaatu was-Salaamu ‘Alaa Muhammadin wa ‘Alaa Aalihi wa-Sahbihi Ajma’een.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Payment in exchange for teaching of the Qur’aan is not without the following matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(a) It is a portion of Razq: subsistence-food, allowance, or the like provided by the state’s treasury (Baytul-maal). In this case it is permissible to take.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(b) It is an unconditional payment: the teacher does not set payment as a precondition. So, in this case, it is permissible to pay him for his teaching.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(c) It is a form of Ji’aalah: Setting up a reward, allowance, or the like for carrying on a permissible task within a specified or unspecified period. For example, to state that whoever teaches my son the Qur’aan or half of it, I will give him such and such. This is permissible. Even the majority of the scholars who see that it is forbidden to receive wages on teaching the Qur’aan, said that it is permissible to take the Ji’aalah and the Razq from Baytul-maal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(d) It is a conditional payment: The teacher will only teach in exchange for specified wages. There are two main views for the ‘Ulamaa’ as to the permissibility of this case: (1) Impermissible, and (2) Permissible.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The First View: It is impermissible</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the famous view of the math-hab of Imaam Ahmad (rahimahhullaah), and the saying of Imaam Abu Haneefah (rahimahhullaah), ‘Ataa’, Ad-Dahaak bin Qays, and Az-Zuhree (rahimahhullaah), and some contemporary scholars. They based their view on certain evidences, amongst which:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The hadeeth of ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ibn Shibil (radhi Allaahu anhu) who said: “I heard Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: ‘Recite the Qur’aan and exceed not the limits therein and turn not away from it, and eat not with it and amass not wealth therewith…” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The textual aspect for the impermissibility lies in the Prophet’s saying: “And eat not with it [don’t make a means of sustenance] and amass not wealth therewith.” Taking wages for the teaching of the Qur’aan is considered of “eating with the Qur’aan and amassing wealth therewith.”2</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) The hadeeth related by ‘Ubaadah ibn As-Saamit (radhi Allaahu anhu) in which he told of his teaching of the Qur’aan to some people of Ahlu-Suffah3 and that one of them gave him a bow as a gift. ‘Ubaadah said: “It is only a bow and not money.” He then asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) about it and he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “If you are pleased that you would be encircled by it a ring of fire around your neck [on the Day of Resurrection], then accept it!” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) The hadeeth narrated by Ubay ibn Ka’b (radhi Allaahu anhu) who said: “I taught someone the Qur’aan and he gave a bow as a gift. I mentioned this to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) who said: “If you take it then you would be taking a bow of fire.” So, I returned it. [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof of prohibiting the wages is deduced from the threatening torment on the Day of Resurrection for the one who takes a gift for teaching the Qur’aan. If it is prohibited to accept a gift for teaching the Qur’aan, then by all means the prohibition on taking wages is even greater.[6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iv) The hadeeth of Jaabir (radhi Allaahu anhu) in which it is narrated that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) entered the Mosque while some people were reciting the Qur’aan. Thereupon, he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “Recite, all is well. In the future there will appear people who will straighten it (the Qur’aan) as an arrow is straightened.[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will recite it quickly and not slowly (or it means that they will get the reward in this world and not in the hear after).”8 In another narration: “Recite it before there appear people who will recite it and straighten it as an arrow is strained, They will get their reward for it in this world and will not get it in the hereafter.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(v) The hadeeth of ‘Imraan bin Husain (radhi Allaahu anhu) who said: “I heard Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: ‘Recite the Qur’aan and seek with it Allaah, the Blessed and the Most High’s, reward for there will be those after you who will recite the Qur’aan seeking people’s reward therewith.”10 The aspect of prohibition lies in the clarification by the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that the recitation of the Qur’aan is such that one seeks with it the reward from Allaah, not a reward from the people in the form of payment of wages. [11]</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">The Second View: It is Permissible</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This view is held by Imaam Maalik, Imaam Ash-Shaafi’ee, Imaam Ahmad (in a second narration), some Hanafiyyah, Abu Qalaabah, Abu Thawr, Ibnul Munthir, and many contemporary scholars. The evidences upon which they relied included the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) The hadeeth of ibn ‘Abbaas ( radhi Allaahu anhu) in saheeh al-Bukhaaree in which he narrated that some of the companions of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) passed by some people, and one of those people had been stung by a scorpion. One of the companions recited soorat al-Faatiha on the stung person for a sheep as his fees. The patient got cured and the man brought the sheep to his companions who disliked that and said, “You have taken wages for reciting Allaah’s Book.” They referred the matter to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You are perfectly entitled to take wages for Allaah’s Book.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Bukhaaree added: As-Sha’bee13said, “The teacher should not fix the tuition, but if he is given something, he should accept it.” Al-Hakam [14] said: “I have never heard anybody saying that it is disliked for the teacher to take tuition.” [15]…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) The hadeeth of Abee Sa’eed al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) in as-saheehayn reporting the story of some of the Prophet’s companions who came across an Arabian tribe who did not entertain them. The chief of the tribe was bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion). The tribe asked the companions to treat the chief with ruqya (Qur’anic recitation as a treatment). The companions conditioned that they pay them in exchange for the ruqya. The tribe accepted and the chief was cured after the recitation of soorat al- Faatiha on him. The tribe presented a flock of sheep to the companions according to the agreement. The companions consulted with the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) before taking the sheep. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “Take it and assign a share for me.” [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These evidences were considered by the advocates of the first view as proof for the permissibility to take wages in exchange for ruqya not for teaching the Qur’aan. The response was that there is no difference between the two; if it is permissible to be paid in exchange for ruqya, which is part of the Qur’aan, then it is also permissible to take fees for teaching the Qur’aan, because ruqya is of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) The hadeeth of Sahl bin Sa’d (radhi Allaahu anhu) in as-Saheehayn in which a woman presented herself to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) for marriage, and a destitute man asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to marry her to him. He did not have anything to pay for her dower. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) asked him: “How much of the Qur’aan do you know (by heart)?” The man said: “I know such soorah and such soorah,” and he named them. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “I have married her to you for what you know of the Qur’aan.” [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is considered a proof permitting the teaching of the Qur’aan in exchange for dowry, and if this is allowed in marriage, then by all means it is permissible in cases where teachers are to be hired out to teach the Qur’aan.[18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Discussion: The evidences of the second view are stronger and more authentic in regard to their confirmation than those of the first view. The closest position is that the prohibition is directed more towards taking gifts, wages and the like for the recitation of the Qur’aan when, in the beginning of Islaam, there was a need to spread the Qur’aan in the hearts of the believers. Still, however, the evidences of the first view, cautions that it is better not to take wages for teaching the Qur’aan and thus limits the view of permissibility to befit the need and circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Given, the weak situation of Muslims nowadays, and the attachment of many of them to this worldly life, and knowing that in certain communities situations may arise such that there is a genuine need to teach the Qur’aan, then:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(i) If the teachers are available and there are those who teach without taking payment in return, then they should be preferred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(ii) If the only teachers available are those who ask for tuition for their teaching, or that the teachers who do not request tuitions are few in number, then hiring teachers from the former category to fulfill the needs of the community is permissible due to necessity. In this case it is better to chose from those teachers who are in need, not the rich ones. Shaykul-Islaam Ibn Taymmeyah (rahimahhullaah) stated that it is permissible to hire needy teachers to teach the Qur’aan. In this way the teacher intends to teach it purely for Allaah’s sake and takes the wages to spend on himself and his family, assisting him on his worship of Allaah. [19] It is noted that even some of the scholars who held the first view approved giving wages for teachers on the condition that they are full-time teachers and that the scope of hiring should not exceed the needs of the communities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(iii) If the available teachers do not set up conditions for their teaching, and the students, their parents or the community at large, pays them for their services, then I hope, inshaa’Allaah, that this would be permissible. AND ALLAAH KNOWS BEST.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>References :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Reported by Ahmad, Abu Ya’la, Al-Bayhaqee, and At-Tabaraanee in Al-Kabeer and Al-Awsat. Al- Haafith ibn Hajar said: “Its isnaad is strong.” [Fath, vol. 9, p. 82], and Al-Albaanee stated that its isnaad is saheeh [As-Saheehah, vol. 1, p. 466].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] According to advocates of the second view, this text does not necessitate prohibiting what the student may pay willingly to the teacher. In addition they directed the prohibition as being specific to recitation only. They also pointed out that some scholars criticized the narration of this hadeeth considering it weak, and thus it cannot stand to oppose the authenticity of the ahaadeeth in the saheehayn and which they consider more explicit in allowing wages on teaching the Qur’aan. Those in support of the first view consider that the ahaadeeth pertaining to the prohibition strengthen one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Ahlu-Suffah: Those were poor people from the Muhaajireen who were driven away from their homes and had no money, or families, nor a place to stay. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and the companions (radhi Allaahu anhum) assisted them, and he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) allowed them to stay in a courtyard by his Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Reported by ibn Maajah in his Sunan (no. 2157). It is considered weak by many scholars like ibn Al- Madeenee and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 2158). Imaam Ath-Thahabee said: “Its isnaad is mudtarib (confounding). Al- Albaanee stated that its isnaad is weak as in al-Irwaa’ (no. 1493). He, however, considered the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah ibn As-Saamit (see above), and another weak hadeeth narrated by Abud-dardaa’ (radhi Allaahu anhu): “Whoever takes a bow in exchange for teaching the Qur’aan, Allaah will hang upon him a bow of fire on the Day of Resurrection,” as supporting evidence that elevates the hadeeth of Ubay to the degree of saheeh. Note: A hadeeth is considered mudtarib if it is reported through various conflicting narrations with no possibility of preponderating. This may affect the isnaad as well as the text, and it necessitates the weakness of the hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] The second view: The hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah and that of Ubay are weak, and that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) knew that they taught the Qur’aan purely for Allaah’s sake, so he disliked for them to take anything in return. There is no harm, however, that the teacher who teaches the Qur’aan for Allaah’s sake, and does not ask for tuition, accepts from the student what the latter gives him willingly. In addition, the second view holds that the ahaadeeth of prohibition is more directed to cases of taking money in exchange for recitation of the Qur’aan, not for ta’leem (teaching the Qur’aan), and that ta’leem and recitation are two different matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] Apparently in reference to those who exceed the limits in the way of pronunciation of the words of the Qur’aan while in recitation. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] Collected by Abu Daawood in his Sunan (Engl. Transl. vol. 1, no. 829). Al-Albaanee stated that its isnaad is saheeh (as-Saheehah, vol. 1, no. 259).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Ibid, hadeeth no. 830.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Reported by Imaam Ahmad and At-Tirmithee who said: “This hadeeth is hasan, though its isnaad is is not that strong.” Al-Albaanee said, “At-Tirmithee declared it hasan though its isnaad is weak, because of the many supporting narrations, and that this terminology by At-Tirmithee is clarified in his book as-Sunan (4:400).” [as-Saheehah, vol. 1, no. 257; the Shaykh (rahimahhullaah) mentioned some of the supporting narrations, two of which are sighted above (i. and iv)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] In response to this, the second view states that the evidence from this hadeeth is only regarding the prohibition of seeking reward, and this is not the same as taking payment in exchange for teaching.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Reported by al-Bukhaaree in his saheeh (vol. 7, no. 633) and in vol. 3, p. 263. People of the first view hold that what is intended here is the reward in the Hereafter. According to the second view, the context of the hadaath totally disapproves this opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] As-Sha’bee, ‘Aamir bin Sharaaheel bin ‘abd Al-Hamadaani (d. 103Hj or later). He encountered five hundred of the sahaabah. [See Siyar A’alaam an-Nubalaa’, vol. 4, p.249].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] Al-Hakam bin ‘Utaybah al-Kindee, Abu ‘Abdillaah, the scholar of al-Koofah (d. 113Hj) [ibid, vol. 5, 208].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] Although these sayings pertain to knowledge in general, supporters of the second view see no difference because, according to them, the salaf did not differentiate between learning the Qur’aan or other disciplines of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] Reported in saheeh al-Bukhaaree (vol. 7, no. 632) and in saheeh Muslim (vol. 3, no. 5458).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Reported by Bukhaaree (saheeh al-Bukhaaree, vol. 7, No. 54), and Muslim (saheeh Muslim, vol. 2, No. 3316).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] According to supporters of the first view the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) gave this woman in marriage to this destitute man without a dowry honouring him for what he knew of the Qur’aan, and that he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not set up the teaching of the Qur’aan as sadaaq (dowry). However, according to the second view, this opinion is refuted by the narration in Muslim: “I have given her to you in marriage for the part of the Qur’aan which you know.” Also, the first view points out that this permission is peculiar to this case only, based upon a hadeeth reported in Sa’eed bin Mansour’s Sunan. In it the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) gave a woman in marriage to a destitute man and said: “Give her the soorah (which he knew) as her sadaaq and it should not be a dowry for anyone after you.” In response, advocates of the second view see that (a) this constitutes no evidence that this story is the same as the one reported in as-Saheehayn, and (b) there is dispute regarding this additional statement in the sense that it is limited to this report, but not in as-saheehayn and as-sunan.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Clarifying the Narrations Pertaining to the Prostration Places in the Qur&#8217;aan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Terminology:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>marfoo&#8217;</em>: &#8220;raised,&#8221; a narration attributed to the Prophet</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"><em>mawqoof</em>: &#8220;stopped,&#8221; a narration from a companion.</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"><em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhu</em> (t): may Allaah be pleased with him.</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"><em>soorat</em>: a chapter of the Qur&#8217;aan.</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"><em>mufassal: </em> means the<strong> “</strong>last seventh of the Qur’aan,” and it starts from <em>soorat</em> Qaaf (#50) to the last <em>soorat </em>of <em>An-Naass</em> (#114)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1-al A&#8217;raf 7:206</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Surely, those who are with your Lord (angels) are never too proud to perform acts of worship to Him, but they glorify His Praise and prostrate before Him&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Narration is <em>marfoo&#8217; </em>to Abud Dardaa&#8217; (t) and it is weak, but authentically <em>mawqoof </em>to Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>) as reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq (i.e. in his <em>musannaf</em>). The scholars unanimously agreed to prostrate in this place as reported by Ibn Katheer in his <em>Tafseer</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2-ar Ra&#8217;d 13:15</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And unto Allaah (Alone) falls in prostration whoever is in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly, and so do their shadows in the mornings and in the afternoons&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq (i.e. in his <em>musannaf</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3-an Nahl 16:49</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And to Allaah prostate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, of the live moving creatures and the angels, and they are not proud [i.e. they worship their Lord with humility]&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from &#8216;Umar Ibn al-Khattaab (t) in al-Bukhaari.  &#8216;Umar (t) recited <em>soorat</em> an-Nahl on a Friday on the pulpit and when reached the verse of the <em>sajdah</em> he got down from the pulpit and prostrated and the people also prostrated. The next Friday &#8216;Umar did recite the same <em>soorat</em> and when he reached the verse of <em>sajdah </em>he said: O people! When we recite the verses of <em>sajdah</em> whoever prostrates does the right thing, yet it is no sin for the one who does not prostrate. Also it is an authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report in &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq&#8217;s (<em>musannaf</em>) from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4- al Israa 17:109</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And they fall down on their faces weeping and it adds to their humility&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5- Maryam 19:58</strong><br />
&#8220;&#8230; When the Verses of the Most Beneficent were recited unto them, they fell down prostrating and weeping.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq. Ibn Katheer reported the unanimous agreement to prostrate in this place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6- 7-al Hajj 22:18</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;See you not that to Allaah prostrates whoever is in the heavens and whoever is on the earth, and the sun, and the moon, and the stars, and the mountains, and the trees, and Ad-Dawab (moving living creatures, beasts, etc.), and many of mankind?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al Hajj 22:77</strong><br />
&#8220;O you who believe! Bow down, and prostrate yourselves, and worship your Lord and do good that you may be successful&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth on the first prostration is an authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq. And the narration on both prostrations is a <em>mawqoof </em>report from &#8216;Amr Ibn al-&#8216;Aaas but there is weakness therein. However, there is a supporting report to it from &#8216;Uqbah bin &#8216;Aamir and Khaalid bin Ma&#8217;daan. It is authentically <em>mawqoof</em> from &#8216;Umar and his son &#8216;Abdullaah, Abud Dardaa&#8217;, and Abu Musa al-Ash&#8217;aree (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Ishaaq said: For seventy years I have seen people prostrating the two prostrations in <em>soorat</em> al-Hajj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8- al Furqan 25:60</strong><br />
&#8220;And when it is said to them: &#8220;Prostrate to the Most Beneficent (Allaah)! They say: &#8220;And what is the Most Beneficent? Shall we fall down in prostration to that which you command us?&#8221; And it increases in them only aversion&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its is an authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq (i.e. in his <em>musannaf</em>).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Its narration is an authentic <em>mawqoof </em>report from Ibn &#8216;Umar and Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (<em>radiyallaahu &#8216;anhum</em>). Reported by &#8216;Abdur Razzaaq (i.e. in his <em>musannaf</em>). And from Abu Hurairah (t) that the Prophet (r) used to recite <em>soorat</em> Alif Laam Meem as-Sajdah (chapter 32) in the Fajr prayer (authentic, in al-Bukhaari). Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar said in al-Fath (i.e. <em>Fathul Baari</em>). I did not see in the transmissions an explicit statement that he (r) prostrated except in the Book of Sharee&#8217;ah, then he (al-Haafidh) mentioned the narration and said: And in its <em>isnaad </em>(transmission) there is some whose condition (of reliability) require (careful) study. Then he said: And At-Tabaraani has, in his <em>sagheer</em>,  a narration that is <em>marfoo&#8217; </em>to &#8216;Ali (t). There is, however, weakness in its chain of transmission (<em>isnaad</em>). [End of al-Haafidh&#8217;s statements].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>11- Saad 38:24</strong><br />
&#8220;&#8230; And Dawud guessed that We have tried him and he sought Forgiveness of his Lord, and he fell down prostrate and turned (to Allaah) in repentance&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its hadeeth is authentically <em>marfoo&#8217; </em>in al-Bukhaari.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>12- Fussilat 41:38</strong><br />
&#8220;But if they are too proud (to do so), then there are those who are with your Lord (angels) glorify Him night and day, and never are they tired.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;And when the Qur&#8217;an is recited to them, they fall not prostrate,&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its hadeeth is authentically <em>marfoo&#8217; </em>in Muslim</p>

&#8221; &#8230; Fall prostrate and draw near to Allaah!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Its hadeeth is authentically <em>marfoo&#8217; </em>in al-Bukhaari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Point of Benefit:</strong> Al-Muwafaq (Ibn Qudaamah Al-Maqdisee) in <em>al-Kaafi</em> (v.1, p. 206) said that, &#8220;the places of the verses of prostrations are unanimously affirmed except those of the <em>mufassal</em> and the second <em>sajdah </em>in soorat al-Hajj.&#8221; The evidences for those prostrations, however, are as mentioned (above).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 56:</strong> What is the correct and false Tawassul ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> At-Tawassul is the infinitive of <em>Tawassala</em>, <em>Yatawassal</em>–meaning to take a means that will make the person reach his intended goal. So, its original meaning is: Seeking to attain the intended objective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Correct: And this is the Tawassul through the correct means leading to the intended goal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Incorrect: And this is the Tawassul by a way that does not lead to the intended objective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the first type, and which is the Tawassul by the means that lead to the intended objective, then it is of several types, including:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1-Tawassul (seeking a means of nearness to Allaah) by means of His Attributes</strong></span>, regardless whether it is done in the general or specific sense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example on the <strong>general way</strong> is the statements mentioned in the hadeeth reported by ‘Abdullaah bin Mas’oud (radhi Allaahu anhu) concerning the invocation said to relief from distress and grief:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Allaah! I am Your slave, son of Your male slave and female slave. My forelock is in Your Hand. Your judgment concerning me is continuously executed. Your Decree over me is Just. I ask You by every Name which is Yours, with which You Named Yourself, Taught to anyone from Your Creation, or sent down in Your Book, or which You kept to Your Self in the Knowledge of the Hidden with You, that You make the Qur’aan the nurturer (the life of) of my heart, the light of my chest, the removal of my sadness and of my anxiety.&#8221; </span></em>[77]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This case is a Tawassul by means of Allaah’s Names in the general sense, as in his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: <em>&#8220;I ask You by every Name which is Yours, with which You Named Yourself.&#8221;</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the specific aspect, then it is <strong>to make Tawassul by means of one particular Name for a specific request befitting this Name</strong>, like what was reported in the hadeeth of Abu Bakr (radhi Allaahu anhu) when he asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to inform him of a supplication that he may use in his prayer. So the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Say: O Allaah, I have done great injustice to myself, and none can forgive sin except You, so forgive me a forgiveness from You, and be merciful to me, as You are The Most Forgiving, The Most Merciful&#8221; </em></span>[78]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he sought Forgiveness and Mercy and made Tawasssul to Allaah, The Most High, by means of two of His Names befitting what is being requested. So he said: &#8220;You are The Most-Forgiving, The Most-Merciful.&#8221; This type of Tawassul falls under the Saying of The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allaah, so call on Him by them&#8221;.</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-A’raaf (7): 180].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Supplication here comprises two types: Supplication when a request is made (du’aaul mas’alah), and invocation through worship (du’aaul ‘Ibaadah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regards to the Tawassul to Allaah by means of His Attributes, then it is like the Tawssul by means of His Names in the sense that it could be general and specific. As to the general way, then it is like your saying: &#8220;O Allaah, I ask you by Your Beautiful Names and Most Supreme Attributes,&#8221; then you mention your request. And with respect to the specific way, then it is to perform Tawassul to Allaah, The Most High, by means of a particular Attribute that is specifically related to a particular request, like that which was mentioned in the hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;O Allaah by Your Knowledge of the Hidden and Unseen, and Your Power over the Creation, grant me life for as long as You Know that life is good for me, and grant me death when death is good for me.&#8221;</span></em> [79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here Tawassul to Allaah, The Most High, is by means of the Attributes of ‘Ilm (Knowledge), and Qudrah (Power): &#8220;By Your Knowledge of the Hidden and Unseen, and Your Power over the Creation.&#8221; …This comprises the one type of Tawassul.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Second Type:</strong></span> A person seeks means of Nearness to Allaah <strong>by means of His belief in Him and in His Messenger</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he says: &#8220;O Allaah I have believed in You and in Your Messenger, so forgive me, or grant me success and rectitude.&#8221; Or that he says: &#8220;O Allaah by my faith in You and in Your Messenger I ask you such and such.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from this is the Saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Verily! In the Creation of the heavens and the earth, and in the alteration of night and day, there are indeed signs for men of understanding. Those who remember Allaah [always, and in prayers] standing, sitting, and lying down&#8221;…to His saying: &#8220;Our Rabb! Verily, we have heard the call of one (Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) calling to Faith saying: ‘Believe in your Rabb,’ and we have believed. Our Rabb! Forgive us our sins and expiate from us our evil deeds, and make us die [in the state of righteousness] along with the Abraar&#8221; [the pious and righteous believers].&#8221;</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat aal- ‘Imraan (3): 190-191].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they sought nearness to Allaah by their Eemaan in Him that He Forgive them their sins, expiate from them their evil deeds, and make them die along with the Abraar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Third Type is to make Tawassul to Allaah by means of righteous deeds.</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from this is the story of the three people who entered into a cave to sleep in it. They were trapped in the cave when a boulder [rolled down from the mountain] and blocked the entrance of the cave and they could not remove it away. So each one of them sought a means of nearness (Tawassul) to Allaah by means of a righteous deed that he had done. So the first one of them used his kindness to his parents as Tawassul, and the second used as Tawassul his perfect abstention from fornicating [with his uncle’s daughter]. As to the third one, he used as Tawassul his preserving the right of his employee. Each one of them said: &#8220;O Allaah if I did that seeking Your Face, then release us from our situation.&#8221; So the rock moved. This is Tawassul to Allaah (Azza wa Jal) by means of a righteous deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Fourth Type is to use as Tawassul the conditions of a person</strong></span>, meaning that the supplicant seeks a means of nearness to Allaah by mentioning his circumstances and his state of need. And From this is the saying of Moosaa (alaihis salam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;O My Rabb! I am in need of whatever good that You bestow on me.&#8221;</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Qasas (28): 24].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In doing so, he is using Tawassul to Allaah by mentioning his condition, asking Allaah to bestow whatever good on him. A related case is in the saying of Zakhariyyaah (alaihis salam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;My Rabb! My bones have grown feeble, and grey hair has spread on my head.&#8221;</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat Maryam (19): 4].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these are some of the types of Tawassul, and all of them are allowed since they are good means to use as Tawassul to attain what is being intended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A Fifth Kind of Tawassul</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 57:</strong> Are there any other types of Tawassul in addition to the four that you have mentioned?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Answer: Yes, there is an additional type of Tawassul and it is the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>seeking of nearness to Allaah by means of the supplication of a righteous man</strong></span> and whom it is hoped that his invocation will be answered, because the companions (radhi Allaahu anhum) used to ask the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to invoke Allaah for them, generally and specifically.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is reported in the saheehayen (al-Bukhaaree and Muslim collections of hadeeth) from the transmission of Anas bin Maalik ((radhi Allaahu anhu)) that a man entered the Mosque on the day of Jumu’ah and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was giving the Khutbah and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, the livestock are dying and the roads are cut off so supplicate to Allaah for us that He should give us rain.&#8221; So the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) raised up his hands and supplicated and said: ‘O Allaah bless us with rain,’-three times…and he did not descend from the minbar (pulpit) until the rain was dripping from his beard. The rain continued for a whole week. And on the next day of Juma’ah the same man or someone else came while the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was standing giving Khutbah…and said: ‘Buildings are being destroyed and livestock are being drowned, so supplicate to Allaah to withhold it for us.’ So the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) raised his hands and said: ‘O Allaah, around us and not upon us…’ so he did not point with his hands in any direction except that the clouds cleared away…and we went out walking in sunshine.&#8221; [80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are several incidences on which the companions asked the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) to supplicate to Allaah specifically for them. And from this is the case when the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) mentioned that seventy thousand of his Ummah shall enter Paradise without reckoning nor punishment, and that they are those who do not treat themselves with Ruqya,[81] nor do they believe in good or bad omen nor do they get themselves branded (cauterized), but the put their trust in Allaah; thereupon ‘Ukaashah bin Muhsin stood up and said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, supplicate to Allaah to make me from amongst them.&#8221; So he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: &#8220;You are one of them.&#8221; [82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also from the kind of permissible Tawassul: that a person asks someone to supplicate to Allaah, The Most High, for him, if it is hoped for that this person’s supplication will be answered. However, it should be that the person requesting someone to supplicate Allaah for him intends to benefit himself and his brother, the one from whom he asked the supplication, so that the request is not solely for his own interest. Since if you want to benefit your friend as well as yourself, then this will end up as something good for him. This is because when a man supplicates to Allaah for his brother in his absence, the angel says: &#8220;Aameen, and for you the same.&#8221; Similarly when someone supplicates Allaah for his brother, then he is from those who do good by virtue of this supplication, and Allaah loves those who do good.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 60:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is the creed of the Righteous Predecessors regarding the Noble Qur’aan?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The creed of the as-Salaf pertaining to the Noble Qur’aan <strong>is like their creed with regard to the rest of the Attributes and Names of Allaah</strong>, and it is based upon what is proven by the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم). And we all know that Allaah, The One free of all imperfection, The Most High, described the Qur’aan as being His Words, and that it is sent down from Him. So, He, Most Magnificent and Most High, Says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنْ أَحَدٌ مِّنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ اسْتَجَارَكَ فَأَجِرْهُ حَتَّىٰ يَسْمَعَ كَلَامَ اللَّهِ ثُمَّ أَبْلِغْهُ مَأْمَنَهُ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And if anyone of the Mushriks seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that they may hear the Word of Allaah [the Qur’aan], and then escort him to where he can be secure&#8221;</span> [Qur’aan, soorat at-Tawbah (9): 6].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the intended by the “<strong>Word of Allaah</strong>” here, without any doubt, is the Noble Qur’aan. And furthermore, He, the Most High, Says:</p>
<h2><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّ هَٰذَا الْقُرْآنَ يَقُصُّ عَلَىٰ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ أَكْثَرَ الَّذِي هُمْ فِيهِ يَخْتَلِفُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, this Qur’aan narrates to the Children of Israel most of that in which they differ&#8221;</span> [Qur’aan, soorat an-Naml (27): 76].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the Qur’aan is the Word of Allaah, The Most High, letter and meaning. He really Spoke it and bestowed it upon Jibreel, the trustworthy, who then brought it down upon the heart of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) so that he may be one of those who warn, in the plain Arabic language.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Salaf also believe that the Qur’aan is a Revelation</strong>, brought down by Allaah (عزّ وجلّ) upon Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in parts over a period of twenty three years as necessitated by Allaah’s Wisdom. In addition, its revelation is either original or occasional, meaning that some of it is brought down in response to a certain occasion that necessitated its revelation, and some of it is revealed without being due to a certain reason. Also some of it is revealed as a narration of a past condition that occurred to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and his companions, whilst some of it comes down as original legislations, revealed for the first time. This is according to what has been mentioned by the people of knowledge pertaining to this matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Salaf say: <span style="color:#808000;">“<strong>The Qur’aan is in the beginning from Allaah (عزّ وجلّ), and to Him it shall return at the end of tim</strong>e.”</span> This constitutes the saying of the Salaf regarding the Noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is something well known to us all that Allaah, The Most High, described the Qur’aan with great qualities. He described it as <strong>hakeem</strong> (wise), <strong>kareem</strong> (an honourable reciter: Noble), ‘<strong>atheem</strong> (great), and <strong>majeed</strong> (glorious). And these qualities with which Allaah has described His Words <em>applies to the one who holds to this Book and works according to it openly and inwardly</em>. So Allaah, The Most High, grants him from the glory, greatness, wisdom, might, and authority, something that it would not be given to the one who does not cling to the Book of Allaah (عزّ وجلّ). That is why I call upon, from this pulpit, all of the Muslims, rulers and ruled, scholars and common people, to cling hold to the Book of Allaah (عزّ وجلّ), openly and inwardly, so that they attain the might, happiness, glory, and prevalence in the East and West.</p>

<p><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Read the Article Below:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Times When it is Forbidden to Pray</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are five times when it is forbidden to pray; three of them are severe, and two are less severe. The five times are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) From after the fajr prayer until the sun has risen<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;">2) From sunrise until the sun has risen to the height of a spear (approximately one meter) above the horizon</span><br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;"> 3) From when the sun is at midday, until it passes the meridian</span><br />
4) From after salaat al-asr until the sun reaches the height of a spear above the horizon<br />
<span style="color:#ff0000;">5) From the time the sun has reached the height of a spear from its setting till sunset.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>severe times</strong> when it is forbidden to pray are those which are short (namely the second, third, and fifth cases mentioned above). <span style="line-height:1.5;">Also, it is </span><strong style="line-height:1.5;">forbidden to bury the dead during these times</strong><span style="line-height:1.5;"> as in the hadith of Uqbah ibn ‘Aamir (radhi Allaahu anhu) in Saheeh Muslim where the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) mentioned it was not permissible to bury the dead during these three times. If we take our deceased to the cemetery and the sun has just risen, then it is not allowed to bury that person until the sun has risen the height of a spear. After that, we can bury the dead, and similarly with respect to the other times.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Exception to the Prohibition for a Fard Salaah</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In general, the salaah is forbidden during these times; however, there are exceptions. The first exception is the missed prayers. For instance, if a man has missed a fard prayer, he can pray it during a forbidden time, even if that time is severe in terms of forbiddance. This is in accordance with the hadith of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever forgets a prayer or sleeps and misses it, let him pray it when he remembers it, for there is no other expiation for it than that.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by al-Bukhari (hadith no. 572) and Muslim (hadith no. 1564)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) <strong>“let him pray it when he remembers it”</strong> is general and has no exception. Since this is an asserted fareedah(obligation), the prayer in this case should not be delayed after the person remembers it or awakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Exception to the Prohibition for a Salaah with a Cause</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second type of salaah that is excluded from this prohibition, according to the preponderating opinion, is those that have a cause for it; these can be prayed in the forbidden times. This is a narration from Imam Ahmad (rahimahullaah) and the choice of Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah). An example of this is repeating the jama’ah; for instance, if a person prays fajr in congregation and goes to another mosque finding the people in prayer there, then in this case, it is permissible for him to pray with them, without sin. The evidence for this is that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) when he was in Mina prayed fajr; after salaah, he saw two men who did not pray with him so he inquired as to why they did that. The men responded that they had already prayed in their residence. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“If you do so and you come to a mosque where there is congregation prayer, then pray with them, and it will be naafil for you.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example is when a person makes tawaaf, it is Sunnah to pray two rakat behind the station of Ibrahim (‘alayhis sallam). As such, if a person makes tawaaf after fajr, it is permissible for him to make these two rakat. The evidence is in the saying of the Prophet to Bani &#8216;Abd Manaf,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“O Bani &#8216;Abd Manaf, do not prevent anyone who makes tawaaf around this house or prays therein (i.e. in the masjid) any hour he wishes from the day or the night.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the ‘ulama considered this hadith as evidence to perform the two rakat following the tawaaf, even if it was during one of the forbidden times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from this exception is on the<strong> day of juma’ah</strong>, if the imam is giving the khutbah (sermon), then the person may offer the tahiyyat al-masjid even at the time when the sun is at its meridian. This is because once when the Prophet was delivering the khutbah, a man came into the masjid and sat down. The Prophet asked him if he had prayed, and the man replied in the negative. To this, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said, “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Stand up and offer two rakat and make them light</strong></span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth instance from the second type of exception is the <strong>entrance to the masjid</strong>. For example, if a person enters the masjid after the fajr prayer or salaat al-asr, then he should not sit until he offers two rakat. This is because this salaat has a cause, namely the entrance to the masjid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fifth, upon the <strong>eclipse of the sun</strong>, it is permissible to pray the associated prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sixth type of salaah that is permitted during a forbidden time is the <strong>two rakat after the wudhu</strong>. This is because this salaat has a legal cause, namely the wudhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Seventh, it is permissible to make <strong>salaat al-istikharaah</strong> during the forbidden times. Salaat al-istikharaah is when a person makes two rakat and then asks Allah to guide him when he is uncertain about a certain matter. Suppose there arises a situation where someone needs to make this salaat, but this occurred during a time when it is forbidden to pray. In this case, it is permissible for him to pray these two rakat because of the associated cause.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the hadith that there is no salaat after fajr or asr is general, particularized in cases where the person offers a salaat that has a cause; in such a situation, it is not forbidden. This is one narration from Imam Ahmad and the choice of Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah. It is also the madhab of Imam ash-Shafa’i (rahimahullaah), and it is the correct opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Most High, Knows Best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Points of Benefit Regarding Movements in Salaah</strong><br />
<strong>Rulings on Movements in Prayers</strong><br />
Prepared by Saleh As-Saleh</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808080;">Based upon several talks &amp; Fatawaas by our Sh. Muhammad bin Salih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">Transcribed by sis Umm &#8216;Ali, Haleima el Amazighia, from live duroos in Paltalk&#8217;s &#8220;Understanding Islam 1&#8221; room Text Edition by sis Umm Ahmad, al-Kanadiyyah</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. I testify that there is no true god worthy of worship except Allaah and that Muhammad is Allaah&#8217;s true slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Hadeeth of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) concerning the redirecting the direction in the prayers towards Makkah, we know that the companions moved while in Salaah when the command came to redirect towards the Qiblah, a move for the benefit of the Salaah. And thus their move was an obligatory one, since it is inevitable that they must face the Qiblah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Prophet prayed facing Bait-ul-Maqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) for sixteen or seventeen months but he wished that his Qibla would be the Ka&#8217;ba (at Mecca). (So Allah Revealed (2.144) and he offered &#8216;Asr prayers (in his Mosque facing Ka&#8217;ba at Makkah) and some people prayed with him. A man from among those who had prayed with him went out and passed by some people offering prayer in another mosque, and they were in the state of bowing. He said, &#8220;I, (swearing by Allah,) testify that I have prayed with the Prophet facing Makkah.&#8221; Hearing that, they turned their faces to the Ka&#8217;ba while they were still bowing. Some men had died before the Qibla was changed towards the Ka&#8217;ba. They had been killed and we did not know what to say about them (i.e. whether their prayers towards Jerusalem were accepted or not). So Allah revealed: &#8212; &#8220;And Allah would never make your faith (i.e. prayer) to be lost (i.e. your prayers offered (towards Jerusalem). Truly Allah is Full of Pity, Most Merciful towards mankind.&#8221; (2.143) [see Bukhari, vol. 6, no. 13].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The movements in Salaah can be classified into five categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Waajibah (obligatory)<br />
2. Mustahabah (recommended or praiseworthy)<br />
3. Muharamah (forbidden)<br />
4. Makroohah (disliked)<br />
5. Mubaahah (allowable)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1. The movement which is obligatory is the one upon which an obligation or an abstention from something unlawful depends.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if a person is told that the Qiblah is to his right, while in the prayer, it is obligatory upon him, to move so as to face the Qiblah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similar to this is if a person is praying alone behind the row, then it becomes clear to him that there is a gap in the row in front of him, then the movement to close this gap and for him to enter the row, becomes in this case obligatory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, if the avoidance of something haraam depends upon this movement, then the movement becomes obligatory. For example, a man is praying and sees on his headcover, or turban or hat, some impurity, some filth. In this case he must move to take off this head-cover. And from this is the incident which took place with the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) when Jibreel (&#8216;alayhi salaam) came to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) while he was leading the people in Salaah and he told him that there was some Najaasah (impurity) on his shoes. So he took them off since this is an obligation:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa&#8217;eed reported that the Prophet removed his shoes and the people behind him did likewise. When he finished the prayer, he asked, &#8220;Why did you remove your shoes?&#8221; They said, &#8220;We saw you remove yours.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Gabriel came to me and informed me that there was some filth on them. Therefore, when one of you comes to the mosque, he should turn his shoes over and examine them. If one finds any dirt on them, he should rub them against the ground and pray with them on.&#8221; [The hadeeth is related by Ahmad, Abu Dawood (650, English), al-Hakim, Ibn Hibban and Ibn Khuzaimah. The latter graded it as saheeh. This narration from Abu Sa&#8217;eed is declared saheeh also by An-Nawawi, Ibn Katheer, Ibn Hajar and al-Albaani]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">2. When the movement is praiseworthy or recommendable. This is when a recommended action depends upon it.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take for example a group of three persons who established the congregational prayer. One stood to the right of the Imaam and the other stood to his left. In this case the Imaam would gently push them to his back, behind him. This pushing is recommended.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also this is recommended if done to prevent something disliked. For example, if in front of you there is something distracting your calmness in Salaat, like decoration-type, then it is recommended for you to take it away, because they take away from your khushoo&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from that, if a person feels the need to scratch on some part of his body, like some itching on his head or on his hand, and it is distracting him, he needs to scratch it. In this case it is recommended for him to scratch it, and this happens a lot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">3. The movement in Salaah is forbidden if it is frequent and successive without necessity.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the scholars (rahimahumullaah) mentioned that the frequency is determined by three movements. So, if the person makes three consecutive moves without need then this nullifies the prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Other scholars (rahimahumullaah) state that, there is no justification to limit this to a number, because this requires a daleel (evidence). The criteria of what constitutes many moves is what is commonly conventional to be many, such that if the person is seen doing that, it would appear that as if he is not praying. And these moves are to be consecutive &#8211; one after the other and without a need to do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, for example we see some people making many consecutive and unnecessary moves, checking his garment, hat, checking the time, moving a pen from one pocket to another, and so forth. But if, on the other hand, while in prayer, he hears some sounds behind him and all of the sudden there is a beast or a lion or something dangerous coming towards him, so he runs away. Although in this case he is making many moves, this is for a necessity and therefore this does not nullify his prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">4. The fourth movement in Salaah is that which is disliked. These are few while there is no need for them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">People do this a lot nowadays. Sometimes you see them looking at their watch during Salaah. And it is the Shaytaan who incites these people to make such moves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>5. The final category is the movement that is allowable. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are slight moves because they may be needed, or many moves because of necessity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>6-There remains one kind of category, which is the core of the Salaah and that is the heart-movement.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the heart is directed to Allaah &#8216;Azza waj Jaal (Most Might and Magnificent) and the believer feels that he is standing before Allaah (سُبْحَانَهُ وَ تَعَالَى), between His Hands, and he has a sincere longing to draw near to Him in his Salaah and he fears Him, then in this case his heart is present and in submissiveness and humility. And this is the most perfect situation. If otherwise, then his heart will go in all directions. As in the Hadeeth of &#8216;Ammaar bin Yaasir (radiya allaahu &#8216;anhu):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I heard Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) say: &#8220;A man returns after saying his prayer while a tenth part of his prayer, or a ninth part, or an eighth part, or a seventh part, or a sixth part, or a fifth part, or a third part, or half of it, is recorded for him.&#8221; [Abu Dawood, no. 789; declared hasan by al-Hafidh al-&#8216;Iraqi, and al-Albani].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the self-talk which may occur in the Salaah, it takes out of its perfection, but it does not nullify it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may Allaah&#8217;s Salaah and Salaam be upon our Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم), his pure household, the noble companions, and those who follow on their Path. Aameen.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the Allaah&#8217;s salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, and the noble companions and those who follow their path until the Day of Resurrection. The title <em>fitnah of Takfeer</em>: The Trials and Tribulations associated with imputing kufr (disbelief) on Muslims (rulers or ruled), is one of the most dangerous fitan in our times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This misleading thought has spread amongst many of the youth in the Muslim world, east and west, north and south. Many of these youths are greatly motivated by their emotions and their vigilant care concerning the deen. As such, they took many of that which they received from the followers of desires. These followers of desires have renewed the principles and thoughts of the early <strong>Khawaarij (dissidents)</strong> and have become an extension of them. This has led to declare takfeer on the Islamic societies at large and on all Muslim leaders, without exception. The consequences of this have been very terrible. Blood is being shed.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Definition of Kufr:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To better understand takfeer, it is necessary to first define kufr. Linguistically, the term kufr means, “<strong>covering and shielding</strong>.” If an object covers something, then that object kafarahu (covered and shielded it). Similarly, it is said that the farmer when he puts the seed in the ground and covers it with soil is a kafir from the linguistic aspect, since he covered the seed with dirt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Islamic meaning, sometimes the word kufr means the major kufr, which takes a person out of the fold of Islaam. Kufr could also refer to the lesser type, which does not take a person from the fold of Islaam, known as al-kufr al-asghar. <span style="color:#993300;">Islamically, the kafir is called a kafir because he covered and shielded the favor of Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala).</span> Therefore, the kafir did not recognize the favor of Allaah upon him and did not give thanks to Allaah. Rather, he denied the favor of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahlus-Sunnah (adherents to the Sunnah) is on the medium course, with respect to all fundamental matters in Islaam. They are between the two extremes, the excessive ones who exceeded the limits and the negligent ones. Allaah described this in Noble Qur’an (in the translation of the meaning):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;">Thus, we have made you a just nation</span>» Surah al-Baqarah (2:143)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, regarding the matter of takfeer, Ahlus-Sunnah is on a medium course between extremism and negligence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The kafir is of two types. The first type is <strong>al-kafir al-aslee</strong> (the orginal kafir). This includes all of those who are not Muslims including the Christians and the Jews. <span style="color:#ff0000;">Anyone who doubts the kufr of al-kafir al-aslee is himself a kafir</span>. The second type is the <strong>apostate</strong> who was born to two Muslim parents, who in the stage of adulthood rejected Islaam, either by speech or by action.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Views of Ahlus-Sunnah and the Different Sects Regarding Takfeer:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people are divided into three categories regarding takfeer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first category is <strong>al- Khawaarij</strong>. They impute kufr on the Muslim due to major sins; with some have gone to the extent to impute kufr on the Muslim due to minor sins. Similarly, they impute kufr on any Muslim who does not believe the same as them. As such, they have made the blood and wealth of most Muslims permissible. This group has an extension in our time and exists in many parts of the Muslim world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second group is <strong>al-Murji’ah</strong>. They claim that eeman (faith) is not affected by any sinful act, even if the Muslim commits a major sin. They say all Muslims are believers, and nothing affects faith. Although the beliefs of al-Murji’ah comprise different positions, this is an overall summary of their views.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ahlus-Sunnah</strong> are on a medium course between the two extremes. They don’t rush to impute kufr on the Muslim while not refraining from imputing kufr on him if the person commits that which Allaah and/or His Messenger declared to be kufr. However, they note, “<span style="color:#993300;"><em>The Muslim who may say or do that which is considered kufr should not have kufr imputed on him specifically until the evidence is established on him, with all the conditions of imputing kufr fulfilled and all the impediments removed.”</em></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Important Matters Regarding Takfeer</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>, before takfeer can be established, <span style="color:#993300;">all conditions must be fulfilled and all impediments removed.</span> From the conditions of making takfeer are: knowledge, choice, intent, deliberate action or saying of kufr, and its acceptance. This implies determining whether the person knows his action is kufr, and he has chosen it, without being compelled. Moreover, it must be shown that the person was deliberate in his action and is content with it. From the impediments of takfeer are: affirmation of an error, ignorance, compulsion, and misinterpretation. Ahlus-Sunnah checks into both the impediments and conditions before imputing kufr on a specific person.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>second</strong> important matter is that imputing kufr on someone is an extremely dangerous matter. <span style="color:#993300;">No one should indulge in takfeer, except those who are firmly established in knowledge and fulfill certain criterion</span>. This arises from the fact that takfeer is the right of Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم:sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). Therefore, it can only be established by those who are the inheritors of the Prophets, the ulama (scholars) who make clear the ruling of Allaah and His Messenger; they are the only ones qualified. Anyone else who involves himself in takfeer is on a dark path of transgression and claims for himself a special right with Allaah. Hence, it is not permissible to make takfeer on anyone expect the one whom Allaah and His Messenger declared to be as such. Due to the seriousness of takfeer and its limits as established by Allaah and His Messenger, Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, rahimahullah, stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;That is why the people of knowledge and Sunnah did not resort to making takfeer on those who opposed them, even if the opponent makes takfeer on them. This is because the matter of kufr is a legal right established by shariah, and therefore, the person can not punish by the like, just like if someone who belies you and makes lies against you, you can not spread lies about him, or if someone fornicates with members of your family, you can not fornicate with members of his family. This is because fornication and lying are haraam (unlawful) being <strong>Allaah&#8217;s right</strong>. Similarly, takfeer is a right that belongs to Allaah. Hence we do not impute kufr except on whom Allaah and His Messenger declared as such.&#8221;</span> [Ar-Rad &#8216;Alal Bakari, v. 3, p. 381].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The danger involved with takfeer is not limited to the transgression against the right of Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’ala). The person who imputes kufr on the others also risks falling into that which he accused his brother with. This is in line with the hadith of the Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallaam),</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Any person who calls his brother, ‘Ya Kafir (Oh Unbeliever), has in fact done an act through which this unbelief would return to one of them. If it were so as he asserted, then the kufr of the man was confirmed, but if it was untrue, it returns to him (the one who labeled it on his Muslim brother).&#8221;</span> [Reported by Muslim and At- Tirmithi.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, in another narration, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;If somebody accuses another of Fusuq (by calling him &#8216;Fasiq&#8217; i.e. a wicked person) or accuses him of Kufr, such an accusation will revert to him (i.e. the accuser) if his companion (the accused) is innocent.&#8221;</span> [Bukhari].</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>third</strong> important matter is that <span style="color:#993300;">takfeer causes hate amongst people</span>, especially amongst those who are referred to as kafir since no one likes to be labeled as a kafir. In fact, this can lead to fights and bloodshed, which will inflict evil on the individuals involved and the society at large.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, rahimahullah, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">&#8220;And it is not the right of anyone to impute kufr on anyone of the Muslims even if he errs and does wrong until evidence is established upon him and the matter is made clear to him. And the one whose Islaam is affirmed with certainty then it ceases not to exist with him due to doubt. Rather his (state) of Islaam comes to an end only after the establishment of the proof and the elimination of the unclarity.&#8221;</span> [Majmoo&#8217; al-Fataawa, v. 12, p. 501]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Takfeer Practiced in Our Times:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>, a type of takfeer practiced in our time is the <span style="color:#ff0000;">unrestricted takfeer on the Muslim rulers</span> who do not rule by the rule of Allaah. This generalization, without details, has led many of the young Muslims to conclude that it is permissible to rebel against these rulers by force. Consequently confrontations, bloodshed and other problems arising from this are still growing. Moreover, it is bringing chaos and instability to the Muslim world as it is evident to everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, this thought did not stop at the rulers but has been extended to the government employees, security forces, and others. It has also reached many imams of masajid (mosques), muadhineen (those who give adhan), and scholars. This arises from the pretext that these are all collaborators with the government.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This pretext has even been extended to the Muslim society at large. Those who do not hold to the belief of these groups are considered kafir. This is not an issue in a vacuum; this is real. As such, one is not surprised as to why they kill Muslims or bomb places where there are many Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has reached the extent that these groups have called for the complete disassociation from their societies, thinking that all of the society is kafir so they can not stay with them. They even abandon their wives if they do not adhere to the same belief as the person holding the takfeer principle; similarly, if a wife holds this takfeer principle, they say it is incumbent upon her to leave her husband if he does not agree with that. Furthermore, they tell their followers not to make the congregation prayers in the mosques claiming these are not real mosques, and that the imams of these mosques are not Muslims since they were assigned by the government. This is happening in some Muslim countries.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Solution:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The solution to this problem is to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>spread the knowledge of the righteous predecessors, alilm ash-shari’ saheeh (the correct knowledge of Islaam)</strong></span>. This comes from the knowledge taught by the reliable scholars and the books of the salaf. The young should return to the ulama to seek their advice instead of following these so-called thinkers and their takfeeri books. All of those who write advocating this methodology are not even known for being from the true ulama holding to the path of the salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, Muslim societies and governments should take the <strong>corrective approach</strong> of adhering to the shar&#8217;eeah. Once this is done for the sake of Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’ala), then the promise of Allaah to bestow strength and steadfastness upon the ummah will surely be manifested.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, there should always be a <strong>hand extended to our youth who may have influenced by takfeer</strong>. There should be useful discussions in this matter and a refuting of the views held by them based on evidences and proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If there is anything we need to emphasize every now and then, whether regarding this matter or the understanding of Islaam as a whole, it is that people should be very serious about knowing Islaam from its two sources, the Qur’an and the way of the Rasool Allaah (Messenger of Allaah) in accordance with the understanding of the companions. This is the criteria of safety; this is the path that every Muslim should give his utmost effort to learn; this is the true safeguard mechanism for the individual and thus for the family and the society at large.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">And Advice to the Youth:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally, we all know that emotions are real, and care for Islaam is a strong motivation to its adherents. The motivation by care, sincerity, and emotion if not guided by the following of the Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in accordance with the way of the salaf, then it can turn into a blazing fire of destruction. Hence, a sincere advice is stressed again for all of our youth: seek knowledge from its reliable sources and from the ulama who are on the path of the companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah the most High guide us and our Muslim youth to be on the path of righteousness and wisdom, and may Allaah, the Most High, safe guide this ummah from the fitnah of takfeer.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Imaam Ibnul Qayyim</b> (rahimahullaah) talked about what people think is the fitnah of &#8220;our times&#8221;, i.e. meaning his own times, but this applies just as well to the contemporary fitnah of our own times. About the ways of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) in this creation vis-a-vis the rulers and the ruled, he said :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And contemplate Allaah&#8217;s (Azza wa Jal) Wisdom when He made people of authority, making them a reflection of the ruled. It is as if the deeds of the ruled appear in the form and deeds of their rulers :</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the <b>ruled</b> are upright, then their <b>rulers</b> will be upright</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the <b>ruled</b> incline away from uprightness, then their<b> rulers</b> will do the same to them</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the <b>ruled</b> transgress and oppress, then their <b>rulers</b> will do the same to them</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if there appears deception and plotting from the <b>ruled</b>, then it will be the same from their <b>rulers</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the <b>ruled </b>take away the rights of the people and become miser as to the rights of others, then their <b>rulers</b> will do the same to them and deprive them of their rights</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">if the<b> ruled </b>take away from the oppressed /weak among them that which they deserve not to take in their transactions with them, then their <b>rulers</b> will do that towards the ruled&#8217;s wealth and take what they deserve not, and impose on the<b> ruled </b>taxes and assignments</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and whenever the <b>ruled</b> take from the oppressed and weak unjustly, then their <b>rulers</b> will do the same to them and take it by force</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">so the actions of the <b>ruled </b>appear in the actions of the <b>rulers</b> and <b>it is not in the Divine Wisdom that Allaah (Azza wa Jal) assigns authority over the wicked and evils ones, EXCEPT to the ones who are of their own kind<br />
</b><br />
Since the first generation was of the best generation and of the most righteous, &#8230; so were their leaders righteous</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>It is not befitting Allaah&#8217;s Wisdom that in &#8220;our times&#8221; (Ibnul Qayyim&#8217;s times) that those assigned to authority over us be the like of Muawwiya and &#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Aziz, not to mention Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar. The leaders of those before us were in accordance with their own conditions and ranks. Our leaders are in accordance with our own condition and rank. In both cases, this is entailed by the Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal).&#8221;</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such is the conclusion of Imaam Ibnul Qayyim (rahimahullah) concerning his times, i.e. the 8th century A.H., so what do you think about our own times?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) pertains to His Attributes. He puts things in accordance with His Hikmah and puts them in their proper places with what fits. The Wisdom of Allaah (Azza wa Jal) has a noble and most perfect objective.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who hasten in making these roads for &#8220;deliverance&#8221; and see getting rid of the rulers as the solution to their problems, they confuse symptoms and disease.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rulers are seen as being the causes when in reality they are only the symptoms. The true illness is within the ruled. Therefore, all endeavors towards finding a solution should focus on the ruled themselves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The deeds of the ruled are reflected in the deeds of the people having authority over them. When the people are not ready and are away from the deen of Allaah, who would you expect them to deserve as rulers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contemplate this very carefully!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr Saleh As-Saleh(rahimahullaah)</p>

<p><strong>Read the article:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Position of the Ma’muum With Respect to Following the Imaam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The position of the ma’muum with respect to following the imaam falls into four categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>1) Getting ahead (musabaqaah)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#333300;"><strong> 2) Conformity (muwafaqaah)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#333300;"><strong> 3) Staying behind (takhalluf)</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#333300;"><strong> 4) Following (mutaaba’)</strong></span></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>(1) al-Musabaqaah (Going Ahead)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Musabaqaah entails getting ahead of the imaam in either sayings or actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Concerning sayings</strong></span>,</span> it is acceptable to get ahead of the imaam, except in two matters; they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Takbeerat al-Ihraam</strong> – If the follower precedes the imaam in it, then his salaah is invalid, even if he forgot.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Tasleem</strong> – If the follower deliberately precedes the imaam in it, then his salaah is nullified. However, if it was unintentional, then he simply repeats it after the imaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if someone recites al-Faatiha, the remembrances of sujuud and rukuu, or the tashahhud before the imaam, then there is nothing upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Regarding preceding the imaam <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in actions</span>,</span></strong> it is divided into two situations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Going ahead of the imaam to a rukn (pillar)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Example: Someone made rukuu before the imaam. Later, the imaam caught up with him. At this point, the follower should stand up and make rukuu with the imaam, so as to follow him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Going ahead of the imaam by a rukn (pillar)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: Someone made rukuu and then lifts himself up before his imaam bows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Going ahead of the imaam in actions is forbidden in all of its forms and is from the major sins, as evident in the sunnah. If someone knowingly goes ahead of the imaam, then his salaah is invalid. Correspondingly, the salaah of the person who did it ignorantly or due to forgetfulness is valid. However, if the legal excuse (e.g. forgetfulness or ignorance) is lifted before the imaam catches up, then it is incumbent upon the ma’muum to follow the imaam in those acts which he did prematurely.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: Someone made sujuud and lifted up from it before his imaam prostrated. Therefore, he must return to position of the imaam and follow him. If his action was done deliberately, then his salaah is invalid; if it was due to ignorance or forgetfulness, then his salaah is valid.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>(2) al-Muwafaqaah (Conforming)</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Conformity with the imaam can also be through sayings or actions. If it is in sayings, then it is not harmful except in two situations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Takbeerat al-Ihraam</strong> – If the follower conforms with the imaam in it, then his salaah is invalid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Tasleem</strong> &#8211; If the follower deliberately conforms with the imaam in it, then his salaah is nullified. Correspondingly, if it was done due to forgetfulness and he returns later to follow his imaam in tasleem, then there is nothing upon him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also disliked (makrooh) to have conformity with the imaam in actions because the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“If he makes rukuu, then make rukuu, and do not make rukuu till he makes rukuu.”</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth makes it clear that we should follow the actions of the imaam, not conform with them. As such, if someone conforms with the imaam in sujuud by reaching the ground at the same time as him, then this is disliked; the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said in the same hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Do not make sujuud until he makes sujuud.”</span>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported from al-Baraa ibn ‘Aazib (radiyallaahu ‘anhu):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“When Allaah&#8217;s Messenger said, ‘Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah’ none of us bent his back (for prostration) till the Prophet prostrated, and then we would prostrate after him.”</span> [3]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">(3) at-Takhalluf (Staying Behind)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">at-Takhalloof is of two types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1) Staying behind due to a valid excuse – In this situation, the person brings what he failed to perform and follows the imaam. There is nothing upon him, even if he fell behind by a pillar or more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) A person did not hear his imaam until the imaam moved ahead of him by a rukn or two. In such a situation, he does that which he failed to perform and then follows his imaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) While a person was praying in congregation, he did not hear the imaam make rukuu. However, he later heard the imaam say, “Sami’a Allaahu liman hamidah.” In this case, the ma’muum makes rukuu and then follows his imaam, without losing the rakaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if someone lagged behind the imaam to the point that the imaam caught up with him in the next rakaah, then the person does not bring that which he failed to perform at this stage. Instead, he follows his imaam, and this will be the beginning of a new rakaah for him. After the imaam makes tasleem, the ma’muum must make up the rakaah he missed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) While a person is praying in congregation, the imaam makes a complete rakaah, but the maamum could not hear the speakers until the imaam began his second rakaah. As such, the ma’muum must follow the imaam, and the imaam’s second rakaah will be his first. Therefore, when the imaam completes his salaah by making tasleem, the ma’muum must stand up and pray an additional rakaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) During salaat al-jumu’ah, a person heard the imaam reciting al-Fatiha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this point, there was a power outage. During the time the electricity was cut, the imaam completed a full rakaah. When the power returned, the ma’muum heard the imaam reciting Surah al-Ghaashiyah (Chapter 88), at which point he realized he missed the first rakaah since this surah is recited during the second rakaah of salaat al-jumu’ah. As such, the ma’muum should remain in his position and follow the imaam, and the imaam’s second’s rakaah will be his first. When the imaam makes tasleem, the ma’muum should then stand for a second rakaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, if the person recognizes his failure to follow the imaam before the imaam reaches the same position as him, then he makes up what he failed to perform and follows the imaam. Otherwise, he follows the imaam and makes up the missing rakaah after the imaam makes tasleem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Staying behind without a valid excuse</strong> – This can either be through staying behind the imaam within a pillar or staying behind him by a pillar. Both are hraam (unlawful) if done deliberately. Staying behind within a pillar entails following the imaam and catching up with him in the pillar he has moved to perform.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Example</strong>: The imaam makes rukuu while the ma’muum is lagging behind having yet to complete one or two verses for a surah he recited after al-Fatiha. Then, the follower completes the surah and catches up with the imaam in rukuu. His action is haraam, and his rukuu is valid but in opposition to the sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Staying behind by a pillar involves the imaam going past the ma’muum by an entire pillar. In this case, the ma’muum’s salaah is nullified if there was not a valid excuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) The imaam makes rukuu and rises from it before the ma’muum has bowed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) The imaam lifts up from the first sajdah while the ma’muum remains in sujood making du’aa. The imaam then does the second sajdah, preceding the ma’muum by one rukn (pillar). This is common in many mosques, but it nullifies the ma’muum’s salaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">(3) al-Mutaaba’ (Following)</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the imaam entails the ma’muum performing an action of salaah immediately after the imaam; this is the sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examples</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">a) The ma’muum follows the imaam into rukuu even if he has yet to finish a second surah after al-Fatiha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">b) When the imaam lifts his head from sujuud, the ma’muum follows him; this is better than continuing to make du’aa as the ma’muum’s salaah is linked to his imaam, and they are commanded to follow him.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Summary</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The position of the ma’muum with respect to following the imaam falls into four<br />
categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1) Getting ahead (musabaqaah)</strong> – This is forbidden in all of its forms. Anyone who knowingly or intentionally does it invalidates his salaah. However, if it is done out of ignorance or forgetfulness, then the salaah is valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) Conformity (muwafiqaah)</strong> – This is makrooh (disliked).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3) Staying behind (takhalloof)</strong> – This can be either due to an invalid or valid excuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4) Following (mutabbaa’)</strong> – This is the sunnah and correct.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions, and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Hurayrah (May Allaah be pleased with him), that Allaah&#8217;s Apostle (<em>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</em>) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;If anyone of you performs ablution he should put water in his nose and then blow it out and whoever cleans his private parts with stones should do so with odd numbers. And whoever wakes up from his sleep should wash his hands three times before putting them in the water for ablution, because nobody knows where his hands were during sleep.&#8221; </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in a narration by Muslim:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Let him take water into his nose, washing the nose by putting water in it”. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And he who makes ablution, then let him take water into his nose.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Sahih al-Bukhari, Volume 1, Book 4, Number 163]</p>
<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Narrator</strong></span></h3>
<p>The narrator is Abu Hurayrah and some aspects of his biography have already been mentioned in hadeeth number two.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Subject and Overall Explanation</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of this hadeeth is explaining and making known some types of purification. The meanings of some of the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">•<em> Ithaa tawadhdha’a</em> means“ If he starts his <em>wudhuu</em>’”<br />• <em>Wudhuu</em>’ means “ablution”<br />• <em>Anf</em> means “nose”<br />• <em>Istijmar</em> means “cleaning the private parts with stones.”<br />• <em>Istinshaq</em> means “drawing water into the nose.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The overall meaning is that it is from the completion of Shari’ah and its care and concerns regarding purification, that it comprehensively dealt with the types of purification needed to complete such act of worship (the ablution). In this hadeeth, The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam</em>) spoke about three types of perfection of <em>taharah</em> and taking the precautionary measures regarding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Completing the <em>taharah</em> of the face in <em>wudhuu</em>’ by making <em>istinshaq</em> (drawing the water into the nose).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The person does this by himself; draws the water into the nose then blows it out to clean what’s therein.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. In the <em>istijmar</em> (the cleansing of the private parts), this is to remove what comes out from these parts and from the perfection of this is that the person does this with odd numbers. So if it cleans the place by three times of cleansing then he holds. And if the place is cleansed by four times usage of the stones then he increases a fifth one in order to attain the <em>witr</em> – the odd number- and this is like many matters in Shari’ah that end up with <em>witr</em> – the odd number.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Concerns the washing of the hands after waking from sleep before immersing it in the water for ablution. The Prophet (<em>sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam</em>) commanded that this be done three times..</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From the Benefits of this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Seeking to wash the inside of the nose and to clean it by blowing the water out is done before the washing of the face. It is from the completion of the face washing and therefore it is an obligation like the obligation of washing the face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Seeking to disconnect the <em>istijmar</em> upon <em>witr</em> (the odd number) is done even if the cleansing takes place with even steps. What is obligatory is the cleansing, and the odd number is added as the perfection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Seeking to wash the hands, of the person upon waking up, three times before immersing them in the utensil of water for ablution, or any utensil containing water or the like of liquids. The wisdom is that the person does not know where his hands were during sleep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The good way of teaching by the Prophet (<em>`alayhi salaatu was-salaam</em>), where he linked the ruling to its wisdom so that the legally responsible person increases his eemaan by knowing the wisdom. Through this, the perfection of the Sharia’ah is manifested and its signs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. The comprehensibility and perfect state of the Shari’ah where it dealt with and gave high attention to the matters of purification and also taking precaution in these matters.</p>

<h3><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Narrators</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr ibnu-l’Aas ibn Waa’il al-Qurayshi. He was a devout worshipper, memorizing narrations from the Prophet (`alayhi salaatu wassalaam), but limited are the narrations from him. His narrations were not as many as those reported by Abu Hurayrah (may Allaah be pleased with all of them), because he was a worshipper utilising much of his time in worship. As to his date of death; there is differences among the historians as to when and where did he die. It is reported from Imaam Ahmad, that he died at the end of Dhul-Hijjah the year 63 AH (may Allaah be please with him).</p>
<p>Abu Hurayrah was spoken about earlier.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aa’ishah, Ummul-Mu’mineen (the mother of the believers), the daughter of Abi Bakr ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Uthman ibn ‘Aamir al-Qurayshi at-Taymee (may Allaah be pleased with her and her father), was born in Islaam and the Prophet (`alayhi salaatu was-salaam) married her in Makkah following the death of Khadeejah and before his marriage to Sawdah. The marriage contract was done when she was six and the commencement of the marriage took place in Madeenah when she was nine. The Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam) died when she was eighteen years of age. The marriage of ‘Aa’ishah in knowledge and wisdom and understanding is well known. The Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam) spoke about her saying: “The merits of ‘Aa’ishah and her excellence over the rest of women is like the excellence of ath-Thareed (a meat dish) over the rest of food. [Bukhaaree and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many used to consult with her concerning aspects of knowledge. She died in the city of Madeenah in the month of Ramadaan 58 years AH, after a life spent propagating much knowledge that benefited the Ummah. May Allaah be pleased with her.</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Subject and Overall Explanation</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject of this hadeeth is improperly performing wudhuu’. As to the meanings of some of the words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• waylun : This is a threat (wa’eed). And it is said that this could be a valley in Hellfire, and the other opinion is that it means punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">• Al-a’qaab &#8211; The plural of‘ aqib (heel). This refers to the heels which were left not completely wet in wudhuu’.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The overall meaning is that since taharah (purification) is one of the greatest and most important conditions for salaah, improperly doing it will take away from the salaah. That is why the Prophet (`alayhi salaatu was-salaam) warned against incompletion or improperly making the purification to the degree that he gave such a threat regarding improper handling of one of the parts upon which wudhuu’ is to be made; a threat of Punishment in Hell on that particular part. Why did the Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam) particularize the heels as the part? This is because it was the place where the wudhuu’ on it was not completed as in the hadeeth referring to this incident.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the version reported by &#8216;Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr he said: “We returned from Makkah to Madeenah with the Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), and when we came to some water on the way, some of the people were in a hurry at the time of the afternoon prayer and performed ablution hurriedly; and when we reached them, their heels were dry, no water had touched them. The Prophet (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: ‘Woe to (dry) heels, because of Hell-fire. Make your ablution thorough’.” [Muslim]. In another narration also by &#8216;Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr who said: “The Messenger of Allaah (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) lagged behind us on a journey. We travelled (back) and we took him; and then came the time of the afternoon prayer, and as we were going to wipe our feet he (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) called out: ‘Woe to the heels because of Hell-fire’.” [Muslim]. So this is the reason behind the hadeeth, and in the version by Abi Hurayrah, he reported that: “Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) saw a man who did not wash his heel and he remarked: ‘Woe to the heels because of Hell-Fire’.” [Muslim].</p>
<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>From the Benefits of this Hadeeth</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It is obligatory to complete the wudhuu’ on each part of the parts of wudhuu’ thoroughly, leaving no dry spots.<br />
2. There is a warning and a threat as to the one who neglects this and improperly handles it.<br />
3. Since there is a threat, then negligence regarding this matter is a major sin.<br />
4. Washing the feet in wudhuu’ is obligatory if they are uncovered.<br />
5. Affirming the recompense on the actions. The recompense is related to the kind of action.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Questions for this Hadeeth</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Why is it that ‘Abdullaah ibn ‘Amr ibnu-l’Aas did not report many narrations?<br />
2. When did ‘Aa’ishah (may Allaah be pleased with her) die?<br />
3. What is intended in this hadeeth?<br />
4. True or False<br />
a. The Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam) died when ‘Aa’ishah was a teen.<br />
b. The Prophet (sallallaahu `alayhi was-sallam) particularized the heels because they are the places of accumulation of filth.<br />
c. Washing the feet in wudhuu’ is mandatory if they are uncovered.<br />
d. Negligence concerning any of the parts of wudhuu’ is from the minor sins.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">’<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Abd</strong> </span>[Lit. ‘slave’]. Mankind and Jinn are ‘<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibaad</strong> </span>(singl.‘abd) of Allaah meaning they surrender to Allaah’s Universal Pre-decree, none is able to escape His Pre-ordainment, because they are a Creation of His. So, whether believers or non-believers in Allaah, they are, in the general sense, slaves [‘Ibaad] of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Exalted, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto Ar- Rahmaan (the One Whose Mercy encompasses everything) as a slave.&#8221;</em> </span>[Qur’aan, soorat Maryam (19): 93].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believer, however, who devotes his worship to Allaah alone, is distinguished as being a “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>slave-worshipper</strong></span>” to Allaah. In this sense, the term ‘Abd is specific as being the “slaveworshipper” of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The slave (‘Abd) of Allaah, who obeys Allaah, is a “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>worshipping slave</strong></span>.” In the general sense, he is part of the creation and thus he is also a “<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>submissive slave</strong></span>.” The Kaafir, however, is a “submissive ‘Abd” in the general sense only. The believing slaves fulfill the exclusive meaning of the ‘Uboodiyyah. And the‘Uboodiyyah of the Messengers (‘alayhimus- Salaam: May Allaah protect them from all kinds of evil) is the very special slavery to Allaah, Most High. None can compete with the Messengers’ degree of ‘Uboodiyyah to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">By Our Sh. Muhammad bin Salih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah)<br />
Prepared by Saleh As-Saleh (rahimahullaah)<br />
Transcribed by Br. Abu Abdullaah al-Amreeki, Jazaahullaahu Khairan, from live duroos in Paltalk&#8217;s &#8220;Understanding Islam 1&#8221; room. Text edited by sis Umm Ahmad al-Kanadiyyah, Jazaahaallaahu Khairan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Shaykh, Muhammad ibn Saalih al-&#8216;Uthaimeen (rahimahullaah), was asked:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“There is a phenomenon with some women, wearing short and tight dresses which expose their features and dresses without sleeves exposing the chest and back, appearing almost naked. When we advise them, they say that they do not wear such clothes except in the presence of other women and that the ‘awrah [1] of the woman in front of other women is from the navel to the knee. What is the ruling regarding this, and what is the ruling regarding wearing these types of clothes in front of mahrams [2]? May Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala) reward you abundantly on behalf of the Muslims and Muslimat and magnify your reward.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (rahimahullaah) answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer for this is to say that it is authentically narrated [by Abu Huraira, radiallaahu &#8216;anhu] that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">Two are the types amongst the denizens of Hell whom I have never seen, the one possessing whips like the tail of an ox, and they flog people with them. (The second one) women kasiyatun &#8216;aariyaat: who would be naked in spite of their being dressed, who are seduced (to wrong paths) and seduce others with their hair high like humps. These women would not get into Paradise, and they would not perceive its odor, although its fragrance can be perceived from such and such distance (from a great distance).</span></em>” [Reported by Muslim, hadith no. 6840; see also hadith no. 5310]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of knowledge interpreted the phrase kasiyatun &#8216;aariyaat (dressed but naked)” as those women who put on tight, short, or light clothes that do not shield what is underneath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, Shaykh al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah mentioned that the clothes of women in their homes at the time of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) covered what is between the ankle and the palm; when they would leave for the market, it is known that the women of the companions used to wear overflowing dresses that were so long that the lower end of the dress would drag on the earth. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) made it permissible for them to lower the end of their garment to extend to an arm’s span, without exceeding that. However, what became unclear to some women of the saying of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), “<em><span style="color:#008000;">No man should look at the ‘awrah of another man, and no woman should look at the ‘awrah of another woman.</span></em>” [Reported by Muslim, hadith no. 338] and of ‘awrah of the woman with respect to other women being from her navel to her knee led them to the [false] conclusion that this indicates that it is permissible to wear short clothes. However, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not say, “The dress of a woman is between the navel and the knee, ” such that it would be taken as an an evidence. On the contrary, he said, “no woman should look at the ‘awrah of another woman.” Therefore, he forbade the one who looks because the one who wears overflowing clothes may accidentally uncover her private parts because of a need or for some other reason.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, when the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, “No man should look at the ‘awrah of another man,” did the companions then wear izar (waist garments) from the navel to the knee or pants from the navel to the knee? Is it now sound for a woman to go out and meet other women having on nothing except that which shields the area from the navel to the knee? No one says this; this is not the case, except with the women of the kufar. So those women who understood otherwise from this hadith are incorrect. The hadith’s meaning is obvious and apparent. The Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) did not say, &#8220;“The dress of a woman is between the navel and the knee.&#8221; So women should fear Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala) and assume shyness and bashfulness, which is from the characteristics of the woman; this is from iman (faith) as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said, “Modesty is a branch of faith” [Reported by Muslim, hadith no. 56] Likewise, we know the parable: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“More bashful than a woman kept in her private quarter.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Not even the women of the pre-Islamic era [Jahilliyah] used to shield only that which was between the navel and the knee; this was not even the case with men in that time. Do these women want the Muslim woman to be in a worse situation than the women of Jahilliyah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary, the dress is something and looking at the ‘awrah is something else. The legal dress of the woman in front of other women should cover that which is between the ankle and the palm. However, if the woman needs to tuck up her dress for work or something else, then she may tuck it all the way to the knee. Similarly, if she needs to roll up her sleeves all the way to the shoulder, then she may do so as needed only. However, to make this her normal dress then it is not allowed, and the hadith does not indicate this under any circumstances. That is why the address was to the one looking, not the one being looked at, and the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) mentioned absolutely nothing about the dress. He did not say, &#8220;“The dress of a woman is between the navel and the knee,&#8221; such that this would constitute a pretext for the misunderstanding by those women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With respect to looking by mahrams, then the ruling is the same as looking of a woman at a woman, meaning it is permissible for the woman to uncover in front of her mahrams that which she uncovers in front of other women, namely the head, neck, feet, hands, arms, shins, and so forth. But she must not make her dress short.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] &#8216;Awrah: The private parts that must be covered.<br />
[2] Mahaarim pl. of mahram a husband and a woman&#8217;s male siblings who are not lawful for her to marry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~~<br />
This is the answer of our Shaykh (rahimahullaah) concerning this question, which is often raised by many sisters. I ask Allaah (subhannahu wa ta’ala) to make it a benefit for all of us. All Praise is due to Allaah, and may the salaah and salaam be on Prophet Muhammad, his household, the noble companions and those who follow them until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">One may notice that sometimes Allâh refers to Himself by We or Us. This is not an indication of different &#8220;personalities&#8221; or &#8220;forms&#8221; of Allâh as it is the case in the Trinity concept of the Catholic Church. Allâh (God) is One.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The use of <strong>We and Us is always associated with verses referring to Allâh&#8217;s Greatness in His Lordship</strong> e.g. Creation, Power, Might, etc&#8230; This is very common in the Arabic Language. a king issues orders or statements by saying &#8220;We&#8221; or &#8220;Us.&#8221; The power and might of any king is imperfect. Allâh Glorification of Himself is Perfect because He is Perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In His address to mankind by <strong>calling them to direct their worship to Him, Allâh always refers to Himself by I, Me and Myself</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is well understood in Arabic and also in other Semitic languages. Even in English, there is the &#8220;<strong>Royal We and Us</strong>&#8221; as we hear it from statements by members of the Royal Family in England and elsewhere. To Allâh, however, belongs the Best Examples, Names, Attributes, and Actions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From the kind of permissible <strong>Tawassul</strong>: that a person asks someone to supplicate to Allaah, The Most High, for him, if it is hoped for that this person’s supplication will be answered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it should be that <strong><span style="color:#000000;">the person requesting someone to supplicate Allaah for him intends to benefit himself and his brother, the one from whom he asked the supplication, so that the request is not solely for his own interest</span></strong>. Since if you want to benefit your friend as well as yourself, then this will end up as something good for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because when a man supplicates to Allaah for his brother in his absence, the angel says: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">Aameen, and for you the same</span></em>.” Similarly when someone supplicates Allaah for his brother, then he is from those who do good by virtue of this supplication, and Allaah loves those who do good.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Bismillah ir-Rahman ir-Rahim (بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 59:</strong> <span style="color:#993300;">What is the affirmed and nullified intercession?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Ash-Shafaa’ah</em> is derived from <em>ash-Shaf’a</em> and it is the opposite of <em>witr</em> (one), and it is to make a single thing one of a pair or couple, for example to make the one two, the three four and so forth. This is as far as its linguistic derivation is concerned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Traditionally, however, it means the laying of a petition (interceding, mediating) with someone in favor of another, in procuring a benefit or warding off a harm, i.e. the intercessor lays down a mediation between the one on whose behalf an intercession is sought (al-mashfoo’ilahu) and the one pleaded with (al-mashfoo’ ilayh), in order to procure a benefit for al-mashoo’ilahu or repel from him something harmful.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Intercession is<strong> two types</strong>, confirmed and correct intercession, and a false one that is of no benefit to its people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the confirmed and correct intercession, then it is the one which Allaah, The Most High, has confirmed in His Book, and which His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) has confirmed. And it is approved only for the people of Tawheed and those of pure intentions. Since Aboo Hurayrah (رضي الله عنه) said: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">O Messenger of Allaah! Who will be the luckiest person, who will gain your intercession on the Day of Resurrection?</span></em>” He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: “<em><span style="color:#008000;">The one who says la ilaaha illallaah (none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah) purely from his heart</span></em>.” [83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this type of intercession has <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>three conditions</strong></span> to it:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First condition:</strong> Allaah being pleased with the intercessor.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second condition:</strong> Allaah being pleased with the one on whose behalf intercession is being sought, and the</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third condition:</strong> Allaah’s permission for the intercessor to intercede.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These conditions are collectively stated in the Saying of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And there are many angels in the heavens, whose intercession will avail nothing except after Allaah has given leave for whom He Wills and is Pleased with.&#8221;</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat an-Najm (53): 26].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they are mentioned in details in the following Sayings of Allaah, The Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Who is he that will intercede with Him except by His Permission?&#8221;</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat al-Baqarah (2): 255)].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;On that day no intercession shall avail, except the one for whom Ar-Rahmaan has given permission and whose word is acceptable to Him.&#8221;</em></span> [Qur’aan, soorat Taha (20): 109].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is Pleased.&#8221;</span> </em>[Qur’aan, soorat al-Anbiyaa’ (21): 28].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is inevitable that these three conditions be met in order for intercession to take place. And based upon this, then we come to know the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">second type of intercession</span></strong>. And this is the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">annulled intercession</span></strong>, which avails not its people, and which the Mushriks (polytheists) claim to be the intercession of their gods for them, with Allaah (عز و جل). Indeed, this intercession avails them not, as Allaah, The Most High, Says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And so no intercession of intercessors will be of any use to them.&#8221;</span> </em>[Qur’aan, soorat al-Muddath-thir (74): 48].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since Allaah, The Most High, accepts not the Shirk of those Mushriks, and that He would not give Permission for them to intercede. Since there is no intercession except for those whom Allaah is Pleased with, and Allaah accepts not Kufr for His servants and He Loves not mischief. So, the Mushrik’s attachment of importance on the gods that they worship whilst they say, “these are our intercessors with Allaah”, is false and has no benefit. Rather this will only keep them farther away from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the confirmed shafaa’ah, as the scholars, may Allaah’s Mercy be upon them, mentioned, is divided into two kinds: <strong>General</strong> and <strong>Special</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of <strong>General</strong> is that Allaah (عز و جل) Permits whom He Wishes from His righteous servants to intercede on behalf of those whom Allaah has given the Permission for intercession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <strong>Special</strong> [means] the intercession particular to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), and the greatest of which is <strong>ash-Shafaa’atul-‘Uthmaa (the greatest intercession)</strong> and which takes place on the Day of Resurrection when the people will suffer such distress and trouble as they will not be able to tolerate. So they will look for someone who will intercede for them with Allaah (عز و جل) to relieve them from this greatly distressing and long-standing situation. So they go to Aadam, then to Noah, Ibraaheem, Moosaa, and then to ‘Eessa. None of them intercede, until the matter reaches Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم). So he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) stands up and intercedes with Allaah (عز و جل) to save His slaves from this immense situation. So Allaah responds to his supplication and accepts his intercession. And this is part of <strong>al-Maqaam al- Mahmood</strong> (the highest station of praise and glory) which Allaah, The Most High, has Promissed to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) in His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And in some parts of the night offer the salaat with it (i.e. recite the Qur’aan in the prayer), as an additional prayer (tahajjud) for you (O Muhammad). It may be that your Rabb will raise you to al-Maqaam al-Mahmood.&#8221;</span></em> [Qur’aan, soorat al- Israa’ (17): 79].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the intercession that is particular to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is his <strong>intercession for ahlul-Jannah</strong> (the people of Paradise) to enter al-Jannah. Because after they cross the siraat (the bridge over Hell) the people of al-Jannah will be stopped at a bridge between Paradise and Hell, and here their hearts will be rendered free from the wrongs they have committed against each other until they are cleaned and purified. Then after that they will be granted permission to enter into al-Jannah. However, they will not be admitted therein until after the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) intercession with Allaah for them to enter Paradise. Therefore the gates of al-Jannah will open by virtue of the Prophet’s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) intercession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regard the <strong>general intercession by the Prophet</strong> (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and by others besides him from the righteous slaves of Allaah, then it is to intercede for the People of the Fire from the sinful believers who do not deserve the endless dwelling therein. He (صلى الله عليه و سلم) intercedes on their behalf for them to get out of the Fire. And this type of intercession is confirmed for him (صلى الله عليه و سلم) as well as for others from the Prophets, the martyrs, and the righteous, and Allaah knows best.</p>
