										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Compiled &amp; Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya hafidhahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1- The ‘<em>Allamaa</em> The <em>Muhadith </em>Muhammad Nasr ud-Deen al-Albaani</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani says;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;&#8230;.As for the people who know about this science then they do not have any doubt in the weakness of this type of hadeeth.  Here we have Shaykh Muqbil bin Haadee al-Yemani who mentions in his checking of &#8216;Ibn Katheer&#8217; (v1 p.513) after briefly speaking about the narrators of the <em>isnaad</em> one by one;&#8217; the hadeeth is weak due to a break in the <em>isnaad</em> and because of the weakness of UbaydAllaah bin Waleed ar-Rasaafee&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;Silsilah ad-Da&#8217;eefah  V5 p.95&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh al-Albaani was asked about Muqbil bin Haadee al-Waadi&#8217;ee and Rabee bin Haadee al-Madkhalee he answered with;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;We, by no doubt praise Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> that He has subjected/provided for this righteous <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, which stands upon the Book, the Sunnah and the methodology of the <em>Salaf as-Saalih</em>, many callers to Islaam in the different Islaamic countries who establish the duty which is established by very few of the people in the Islaamic world today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore these two shaykhs are a blessing, the two callers to the Book, the Sunnah and what the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> were upon, who battle against those who oppose this correct <em>Manhaj.</em>  As everyone knows (regarding those who oppose these two shaykhs) &#8211; that this certainlyemanates from two types of people; &#8216;either from an ignorant person or a person who follows his desires&#8217;.  As for the ignorant person then it is easy to guide him, since he thinks that he has some knowledge-so when correct knowledge is explained to him he is guided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why I have said on many occasions that many of the organisations which are prevalent today, even though they have deviated away from our <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, we find amongst them those who have sincerity &#8211; which is more beloved to me than some of those in our <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>.  Although it becomes clear that they are not with us in the sincerity which is a condition for the acceptance of all good actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who follows his desires, then we have no other way for him except that Allaah <em>Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala</em> guides him.  So those who criticise the two Shaykhs, are as we mentioned either ignorant, so they are educated, or he who follows his desires, then Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought from this person&#8217;s evil, and we request from Allaah that He either guides him or He breaks his back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Shaykh Muqbil, I have not read much of his works, unlike the case of our brother Rabee.  What seems apparent is that Rabee is more active in writing than Shaykh Muqbil and vice versa in <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>, (Shaykh Muqbil is more involved in) mixing with the people and inviting them to the Book and the Sunnah, admonishing them and directing them more so than Shaykh doctor Rabee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Shaykh Muqbil then the people of Makkah know their pastures better &#8211; the news that reaches us from you is the best testimony that Allaah has blessed him with ability which is probably unparalleled when compared to some of the other callers to Islaam on the face of the earth today. So we ask Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal </em>that He grants the Muslims the capability to acknowledge firstly their (i.e. the two shaykhs’) religion and that they are far from following their desires.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;Silsilah hudaa wa Noor No. 851   Date 1416/7/9&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2) The <em>Allaama</em> The <em>Faqeeh</em> Ash-Shaykh AbdulAzeez bin Baz</strong></p>
<p>A questioner from Yemen asked the Shaykh where he should go to study knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh answered: &#8216;Go to Shaykh Muqbil.&#8217;</p>
<p>When Shakyh Bin Baz spoke about the history of the Dawa&#8217; in Yemen he mentioned: &#8216;this is the result of the fruits of honesty and sincerity.&#8217;</p>
<p>Shaykh Bin Baz would accept references -from Shaykh  Muqbil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Muqbil mentioned: At that time a person escaped to Riyadh and he said to Shaykh Bin Baz: O Shaykh I&#8217;m from <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em> but I don&#8217;t have any documents.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Bin Baz said to him: &#8216;Prove to me that you&#8217;re from <em>Ahl-us-Sunnah</em>.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The man took out a piece of paper with a reference from me, upon that the Shaykh wrote a letter for him with which he could travel to wherever he wanted.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;Rathaa shaykhina libin Baz p. 16&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3) Shaykh the <em>Faqeeh</em> Uthaymeen.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Uthaymeen said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Tell him that I regard him as a reviver of Islaam.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;Nubtha Mukhtasira&#8217; (p.9) by Umm Abdullaah the daughter of Shaykh Muqbil</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4) Shaykh Muhaddith Rabee bin Haadee al-Madkhalee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Rabee also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;He is a reviver of Islaam in the country of Yemen. There has not been, since the time of AbdurRazaq as-Sanaani until our time, anyone who has established the <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and revived it like al-Waadi&#8217;ee.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;Nubtha Mukhtasira&#8217; (p.9) by Umm Abdullaah the daughter of Shaykh Muqbil</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said in his advice to the <em>Salafis</em> of Yemen and in poetry he recited when mourning for the Shaykh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;This is what we express as condolence about the flag bearer of the Sunnah and <em>Tawheed</em>, that caller to Allaah, the reviver in truth in the land of Yemen. The effects of his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> reached to many regions of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say to you what I believe, that your country, after the best generations, came to know the Sunnah and the <em>Manhaj</em> of the <em>Salaf as-Saalih</em>.  The Sunnah appeared at different periods of time with strength, yet still I do not know of any period like this, with which Allaah has blessed you and the people of Yemen at the hands of this righteous man, the<em>Muhadith</em>, the <em>Zahid</em>, the <em>Wara&#8217;</em> who stamped the world and its adornment under his feet.&#8217;   Dated: 1422/5/1</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;al-Abhaaj bitarjamat al-Allama al-Muhadith Abee Abu AbdurRahmaan Muqbil bin Hadi al-Waadi&#8217;ee wa Dar al-hadeeth bi-Damaj&#8217; p.163</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Rabee also said: On the death of our Shaykh the Imam Muqbil bin Haadee al-Waadi&#8217;ee may Allaah have mercy on him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;May Allaah make your reward great and give good condolences, may He forgive your dead.  Allaah gives and takes what is His and everything has an appointed time.  This is the Sunnah of Allaah<em>Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala</em> and all praise belongs to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah that He covers this man with His mercy and is pleased with him. This man <em>Zahid</em>, the pious, whom I regard InshAllaah as a reviver in our time from the revivers of Islaam.  May Allaah have mercy on him.  He was burdened with carrying the <em>Dawa&#8217; </em>and he handled its responsibility, its difficulties and toiling with patience,<em>Zuhud</em> and piety.  All these means helped in spreading his <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> and raising his status InshAllaah with his Lord and with the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory on his students that they continue on the path of the noble Messenger <em>-alayhi as-sallat wa sallam &#8211;</em> in the light of the Book and the Sunnah and upon the <em>Manhaj </em>of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em> &#8211; upon the actions of the <em>Manhaj </em>of this man who you saw with your eyes, witnessed with your sight and came to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that his example was a living example for you to follow in the<em>Deen</em> and to hold onto in piety and <em>Zuhud</em> and with patience at theharm faced in making the word of Allaah <em>Tabaraka wa Ta&#8217;ala</em> high and spreading the <em>Deen</em> of Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;al-Abhaaj bitarjamat al-Allama al-Muhadith Abee Abu AbdurRahmaan Muqbil bin Hadi al-Waadi&#8217;ee wa Dar al-hadeeth bi-Damaj&#8217; p.164</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>5) Shaykh Ahmad bin Yahya an-Najmee</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Mufti</em> of the south said when he came to visit Dar al-hadeeth in Dammaj after the shaykh passed away. His visit was on 3rd Jumad al-Akhir 1422 A.H.:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Praise belongs to Allaah on His <em>Qada</em> and His <em>Qadr</em>.  It is necessary to have patience since all people will die.  However whoever leaves behind the likes of this then he is not regarded as one who has died, since he has established something, he has reformed, he has invited and he has exerted himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We love that he is regarded (as being) of the virtuous people and of the pious from the highest of the <em>Awliyah</em>.  This is how we regard him and Allaah will take all of us to account.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However we see all this, we see it with our own eyes, and feel it with our senses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we know <em>&#8211; alhamdulillah &#8211;</em> that he did a lot of good, very few people can reach what he did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these centres of learning which emanated from Yemen are goodness from his good deeds, rather from some of his good deeds. Every person who is in charge of a centre is from his students and all of them are examples to be followed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that anyone who establishes good or does a good action and whoever follows that good action, then the person who initiated that good deed will have a reward as well as the reward of the one who acts upon that deed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like the Prophet <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said, &#8220;whoever calls to goodness then he will be rewarded and he will have the reward of the one who acts upon what he calls to from goodness.  Whoever originates misguidance or calls to it then upon him is the sin and the sin of the one who acts upon that evil.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah for forgiveness and goodness. This gathering, which we see, is nothing except from the good deeds of this great Shaykh who called to Allaah and was patient and steadfast.  He sacrificed all that was dear and every precious thing in gathering these faces, encouraging them to study knowledge and placing them on the correct path-the path that Allaah <em>Subhanahu Ta&#8217;ala</em> ordered to follow since He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">((And verily, this is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become <em>Al-Muttaqoon</em> (God fearing)))</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last of our call is that we ask Allaah <em>Azza wa  Jal </em>that He forgives our dead and our afflicted Ummah altogether. That Allaah forgives him and pardon his mistakes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal</em> to forgive him his mistakes.  We are completely convinced <em>InshAllaah</em> that the like of these deeds are a reason for Allaah forgiving His slave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah that He forgives Shaykh Muqbil and that He gives usthe ability to take him as an example in these good deeds and that we follow the path he followed in giving the correct <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> to the Book of Allaah, to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> and to the actions of the <em>Salaf as-Salih</em>.  We ask for the ability to follow this <em>Salafi Manhaj</em>, which is the methodology of the<em>Salaf</em> -may Allaah be pleased with them.  May Allaah send prayers upon our Prophet Muhammad and his Family and his Companions.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from &#8216;al-Abhaaj bitarjamat al-Allama al-Muhadith Abee Abu AbdurRahmaan Muqbil bin Hadi al-Waadi&#8217;ee wa Dar al-hadeeth bi-Damaj&#8217; p.164-166</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>6) Shaykh Salih ibn Fawzan al-Fawzan</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was asked about the <em>Aqeedah</em> of Shaykh Muqbil, and he replied with:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Yes, Shaykh Muqbil &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him- studied here in this country, in the Islamic University.  He learnt <em>Tawheed</em> and went to Yemen.  He called to Allaah and to <em>Tawheed</em>.  His <em>Dawa&#8217;</em> is good, as far as I have heard and as far as the fruits from that <em>Dawa&#8217;</em>go.  Allaah caused him to benefit.  May Allaah have mercy on him.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Died 1422H: Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee</strong><b></b></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee (<strong>Autobiography</strong>)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> SOURCE: Tarjamah Abee ‘Abdir-Rahmaan (pg. 16-29, with minor abridgement) [2nd Edition; 1999] </span><span style="color:#008000;">PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;">I come from Waadi’ah, which is a place to the east of the city of Sa’adah from the valley of Dammaaj. My name is Muqbil bin Haadee bin Muqbil bin Qaa’idah al-Hamdaanee al-Waadi’ee al-Khallaalee, from the tribe of Aali Raashid. [1] </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise due to Allaah, most of the people of Waadi’ah, who neighbor Sa’adah defend me and the Da’wah. Some of them wish to defend the Religion while others defend their tribal devotion. If it were not for Allaah first, then them, the enemies of the (Salafi) Da&#8217;wah, particularly the Shee’ah of Sa’adah, would not have left behind any signs or traces of us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will mention some examples of them for which I ask Allaah to reward them, one of which was when I faced severe opposition in the Haadee Mosque because I turned people away from the (Shiite) Da’wah there. So some men from Waadi’ah and others stood by me to the point that Allaah saved me through their hands. The Shiites desired to rule against me. This was at the time of Ibraaheem Al-Hamdee. And evil people amongst the Communists and Shiites raised their heads and imprisoned me for a period of eleven days during Ramadaan. About fifty of the youth from Waad’iah would come to visit me in prison during some of the nights, while another hundred and fifty of their men would also go to the prison caretakers during these nights, so much so that the caretakers got fed up and released me from jail, all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example is that the enemies of the Da’wah would sometimes come to Dammaaj with their weapons, so the people of Dammaaj would drive them away and they would be forced to leave in humiliation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example is during our journeys. When I would say: “We wish to travel”, they would compete with one other, may Allaah preserve them, to see who would accompany and guard me. So sometimes we would go out on some of our travels in about 15 cars!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During these days, the Da’wah was progressing in a superb manner because, all praise be to Allaah, I had grown older. Perhaps at this point I have reached about 62 years of age. So it was the calamities and the advice from those who love the Da’wah that drove me to have kindness and to not keep up with the enemies, who don’t have anything but insults and abuses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, due to my teaching, writing and giving Da’wah, I was not able to find time to keep up with those enemies. So let them say what they want for my sins are many, and perhaps because of their slander, my sins will be lightened for me and instead fall upon their shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>My Studies and Teachers:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I studied at school until I completed the school’s curriculum. Then a long time passed without me seeking knowledge since there was no one who would encourage me or assist me in seeking knowledge. And I used to love seeking knowledge. So I sought knowledge from the Al-Haadee Mosque but I was not assisted in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After some time, I left my homeland (of Yemen) and went to the sacred lands (Makkah/Madeenah) and Najd. I would listen to the speakers and be fascinated by their sermons. So I sought the advice of some of the speakers on what beneficial books I should buy? They advised me to get Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, Buloogh al-Maraam, Riyaadh as-Saaliheen, and Fath-ul-Majeed, the explanation of Kitaab at-Tawheed. And they gave me copies of the textbooks from the Tawheed courses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At that time, I used to work as a security guard in a building in Makkah, and so I would cling tightly to those books, and the material would stick to my head because what the people in our country did was the opposite of what was in these books, especially Fath-ul-Majeed. After some time had passed, I returned to my country and began to rebuke everything I saw that contradicted what was in those books, such as offering sacrifices to other than Allaah, building shrines over the graves, and calling unto the deceased. So news of this reached the Shiites and they began to censure what I was upon. One of them would say (the hadeeth): <b>“Whoever changes his religion, then kill him.”</b> Another one sent a letter to my relatives saying: “If you don’t prevent him, we will imprison him!” But after that, they agreed to let me enter the Haadee Mosque in order to study with them, so that they may (perhaps) remove the misconceptions that had clung to my heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after that, I was admitted to study with them in the Haadee Mosque. The head of education there was the Judge Mutahhir Hanash. I studied the book <i>Al-‘Aqd-uth-Thameen</i> and <i>ath-Thalaatheen Mas’alah</i>, along with its explanation by Haabis. From the teachers that taught me there was Muhammad bin Hasan al-Mutamayyiz. One time we were discussing the subject of seeing Allaah in the Hereafter, so he began to mock and ridicule Ibn Khuzaimah and other Imaams of Ahlus-Sunnah, but I used to conceal my creed. Despite that, I was too weak to put my right hand over my left hand during prayer, and I would pray with my hands by my side. We studied the text of al-Azhaar up to the section on Marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also studied an explanation of the Laws of Inheritance from a large book that was above the standard level, but I did not benefit from it. So I saw that the assigned books were not beneficial, except for Grammar, since I studied the books <i>al-Aajroomiyyah</i> and <i>Qatar an-Nadaa</i> with them. Then I asked the Judge, Qaasim bin Yahyaa ash-Shuwayl, to teach me Buloogh al-Maraam. So we started it, but then we were disapproved of, so we left it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when I saw that the assigned study books were of a Shiite and Mu’tazlite nature, I agreed to only take from the books of Grammar. So I studied <i>Qatar an-Nadaa</i> several times under Isma’eel al-Hatbah, may Allaah have mercy on him, in the masjid that I would live in and he would pray in. And he would give us a lot of time and attention. One time, Muhammad bin Hooriyyah came to the masjid and I advised him to abandon astrology (<i>tanjeem</i>). So he advised the people there to kick me out of the study program, but they interceded on my behalf and he kept quiet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Shiites would pass by me while I was studying <i>Qatar an-Nadaa</i> and say something with the meaning that education would not have any effect on me. But I would just remain silent and benefit from the books on Grammar. I did this until the revolution started in Yemen, when we left our country and settled in Najraan. There I studied with Abul-Husayn Majd-ud-Deen al-Mu’eed and benefited from him particularly in the Arabic Language. I stayed in Najraan for the length of two years. Then when I became sure that the war between the Republic party and the King’s party (in Yemen) was all for the sake of worldly reasons, I resolved to travel to the sacred lands (Makkah/Madeenah) and to Najd. I lived in Najd for one and a half months in a school for Qur’aanic memorization, which was run by Shaikh Muhammad bin Sinaan Al-Hadaa’ee. He was very hospitable to me because he saw that I benefited from the knowledge. And he advised me to stay for a while until he could send me to the Islamic University (of Madeenah). But the environment in Riyaadh changed for me and I decided to travel to Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to work whenever I found work, and I would seek knowledge at night, attending the lessons of Shaikh Yahyaa bin ‘Uthmaan al-Paakistaanee on Tafseer Ibn Katheer, Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree and Saheeh Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would go over several books and there I met two noble Shaikhs from the scholars of Yemen:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First:</b> The Judge, Yahyaa al-Ashwal. I would study <i>Subul-us-Salaam</i> of as-San’aanee with him and he would teach me any subject that I asked him about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second:</b> Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razzaaq ash-Shaahidhee al-Muhwaytee. He would also teach me whatever I asked him about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the educational institute in Makkah opened and I took the entrance exam with a group of students, and I passed, all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most distinguished of our teachers there was Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez as-Subayyal. I, along with a group of students from the institute, would also study with Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad bin Humayd, may Allaah have mercy on him, the book <i>at-Tuhfah as-Saniyyah</i> after ‘Ishaa at the Haram. He, may Allaah have mercy on him, would bring many points of benefit from Ibn ‘Aqeel and other scholars’ explanation. The lessons were above the level of my colleagues, so they began to slip away until he eventually stopped the class.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also studied along with a group of students with Shaikh Muhammad as-Subayyal, may Allaah preserve him, the subject of the Laws of Inheritance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After staying in the institute for some time, I left to go to my family in Najraan. Then I brought them to live with me in Makkah. We resided there together for the length of my studies in the institute and the Haram itself, which lasted six years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The blessing of studying in the masaajid is well known. Do not ask about the friendly environment and relaxation we felt while in the masaajid. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) indeed spoke the truth when he said: <b>“A group of people do not gather together in one of the Houses of Allaah, reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it amongst themselves, except that tranquility descends upon them, angels surround them, mercy engulfs them, and Allaah mentions them to those by Him.” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I would spend the day studying in the institute, and all of the lessons would assist my Creed and Religion. Then from after ‘Asr till after the ‘Ishaa prayer, I would go to the Haram and drink from the Zamzam water, about which the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Verily, it is a drink that satiates and a cure for diseases.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we would listen to the speakers that came to Makkah from different lands to perform Hajj or ‘Umrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the teachers that we learned from at the Haram between Maghrib and ‘Ishaa was Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Raashid an-Najdee, author of the book “<i>Tayseer-ul-Wahyain fil-Iqtisaar ‘alal-Qur’aani was-Saheehain</i>”, in which he has errors that we don’t agree with him on. He, may Allaah have mercy on him, used to say: “The authentic ahaadeeth that are not found in the two Saheeh Collections can be counted on one’s fingers.” This statement of his stuck to my mind since I had objections to it. This was all the way until I decided to write “<i>As-Saheeh-ul-Musnad mimmaa laysa fis-Saheehain</i>” after which I became more certain about the falsehood of his statement, Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, he was a man of Tawheed, who had strong knowledge of the Science of Hadeeth and was able to distinguish the authentic from the weak and the defective from the pure with regard to hadeeth. What amazed me about him was that he would call people away from <i>taqleed</i> (blind-following), to the point that he wrote a treatise called “<i>At-Tawaagheet-ul-Muqanna’</i>” [Masked Deities of Falsehood]. So the government, and likewise some of the senior scholars, thought that he intended them by it. So the committee of senior scholars gathered together to debate with him. They said: “Did you intend us and the government with this book?” So he replied: “If you feel that you possess the characteristics that I mentioned in the book, then it includes you. And if you feel that you do not possess those characteristics that I mentioned in the book, then it doesn’t include you.” Thereafter, the book was banned from entering into the Kingdom. I was informed about this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night, he was asked to give a class, but it was as if to only test him. So he began his class with Allaah’s statement: <b>“Follow that which has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow false gods besides Him. Little do you remember.”</b> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 3] He followed that with numerous ayaat that prove the prohibition of <i>taqleed</i> (blind-following). After this, he was restricted from teaching at the Haram, and we ask Allaah’s aid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from my teachers at the Grand Mosque (Haram) of Makkah who I benefited from was Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdillaah as-Sumaalee, for I attended his lessons for about seven or more months. And he was an <i>ayah</i> (manifest sign) in terms of knowledge of the narrators used by the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim). I benefited immensely from him in the Science of Hadeeth. All praise to my Lord, since I started seeking knowledge, I didn’t love anything except knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After I completed the intermediate and secondary levels of the educational institute in Makkah, and after completing all of my religious lessons, I moved to Madeenah to go to the Islamic University there. Most of us transferred to the Faculty of Da’wah and Usool-ud-Deen. The most distinguished of those who taught us there were: Shaikh as-Sayyid Muhammad al-Hakeem and Shaikh Mahmood ‘Abdul-Wahhaab Faa’id, both from Egypt. When vacation time came, I feared that time would go by wasted so I joined the Faculty of Sharee’ah, due to two reasons, the first of which was to acquire knowledge:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was since some of the classes there were successive while others were combined. So it was a like a repetition of what we had studied in the Faculty of Da’wah. I completed both Faculty courses, all praise be to Allaah, and I was given two degrees. However, all praise be to Allaah, I give no regard to certificates; what merits recognition in my opinion is knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the same year that I finished the two College courses, an advanced studies program opened in the Islamic University, which they called the Masters program. So I went for the interview exam and passed, all praise be to Allaah. The advanced studies course was on the Science of Hadeeth. All praise be to Allaah, I studied the subject that I loved the most. The most prominent of those who taught us there was Shaikh Muhammad al-Ameen al-Misree, may Allaah have mercy on him, Shaikh As-Sayyid Muhammad al-Hakeem al-Misree, and during the last part of my studies, Shaikh Hammaad bin Muhammad al-Ansaaree. On some nights, I would attend the classes of Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz in the Prophet’s Mosque (in Madeenah) on the subject of Saheeh Muslim. I would also attend the gatherings of Shaikh Al-Albaanee, which were specified to only the students of knowledge, in order to learn from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was in Makkah, I would teach some of the students of knowledge from the books <i>Qatar-un-Nadaa</i>and <i>at-Tuhfah as-Saniyyah</i>. And while I was in Madeenah, I would teach some of my brothers the book <i>at-Tuhfah as-Saniyyah</i> in the Prophet’s Mosque. Then I promised my Muslim brothers that I would hold classes on the <i>Jaami’</i> (<i>Sunan</i>) of at-Tirmidhee, <i>Qatar-un-Nadaa</i> and <i>Al-Baa’ith-ul-Hatheeth</i> for them in my house after ‘Asr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a great wave of Da’wah spread from Madeenah, which filled the world in the time-span of six years. It was some righteous people who were ones who took on the task of financing it, while Muqbil bin Haadee and his Muslim brothers were the ones who took on the task of teaching their fellow brothers. As for traveling for the purpose of Calling to Allaah throughout all regions of the Kingdom, then this was shared between all of the brothers – the student of knowledge so that he can acquire knowledge and benefit others, and the common person so that he could learn. This was such that many of the common folk benefited and grew to love the (Salafi) Da’wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of our Muslim brothers from amongst the students of knowledge was an Imam of a masjid in Riyadh. One time some people of knowledge rebuked him for using a sutrah. So he said: “We are unable to in front of you, but by Allaah, no one but a common person will get up to teach you the ahaadeeth of the Sutrah.” So he called a brother from the general folk who loved the Da’wah and had memorized the ahaadeeth of the Sutrah from “<i>Al-Lu’lu wal-Marjaan feemataffaqa ‘alayhi ash-Shaikhaan</i>.” So he got up and narrated these ahaadeeth, after which the opposers felt ashamed and stayed quiet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this, the blind followers and the scholars of evil began to set in motion, and the reason for this stirring of the blind-followers, who were considered scholars in the eyes of the people, was because whenever they would find a young student of knowledge amongst our students and they would use a hadeeth as proof, the student would say to them: “Who reported the hadeeth?” And this was something they were not accustomed to. Then he would say to them: “What is the status (i.e. grading) of the hadeeth?” This was something that they also weren’t accustomed to. So they would embarrass them in front of the people. And sometimes the student would say to them: “This is a weak hadeeth. There is so and so in its chain of narration and so and so declared him weak.” So upon hearing this, it is as if the earth would become constricted beneath these blind-followers. And they would then go about spreading lies that these students were Khawaarij, when in fact the brothers were not from the Khawaarij who make it lawful to shed a Muslim’s blood and who deem a Muslim a disbeliever on the count of sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there would occur some errors on the part of some of the new brothers, and this was because the beginner is almost always overwhelmed with excessive zeal. At that time, I was preparing my Master’s dissertation, when all of a sudden one night, before I knew what was happening, they arrested me and arrested almost one hundred and fifty others. Some people were able to escape, but the earth trembled between those who opposed and those who agreed with out arrest. We remained in prison for a month or a month and a half. After that we were set free, all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shortly after this, the treatises from Juhaymaan were released and a group of us were again arrested. [2] During the interrogation, they asked me: “Where you the one who wrote this?” What, Juhaymaan can’t write? So I denied this, and Allaah knows that I didn’t write it nor did I assist in any part of it. But after staying in jail for three months, an order was made for foreigners to be deported.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I arrived at Yemen, I went back to my village and stayed there for a while teaching the children Qur’aan. Before I knew it, it seemed like the whole world was in an all-out battle against me. It was as if I had come out to destroy the country, the Religion and the rulership. At that time, I didn’t know any leader or tribal chief. So I would say: “Allaah is sufficient for me and the best of Guardians.” When things would get tight, I would go to San’aa or to Haashid or to Dhimmaar, and also to Ta’iz, Ibb and Hudaydah to give Da’wah and to visit the Muslims brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After some days, some good-doers sent me my library from Madeenah. They sent the books to Sa’adah where the head of shipments there was malicious of the Sunnah. Some of our companions went to request the books from him, so he said: “Come back after Dhuhr, Allaah willing.” But he didn’t return after Dhuhr. Instead, some Shiites mobilized and requested the caretakers to confiscate the books because they were Wahaabbi books!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not ask about the monetary fees, hardships and injustice that occurred to me as a result of trying to get my books! Many of the brothers from the inhabitants of my country made great efforts to follow that up, including Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Husayn al-Ahmar, Shaikh Hazaa’ Dab’aan, the caretakers of the Guidance and Counseling Center, such as the Judge Yahyaa al-Fasayyal, may Allaah have mercy on him, and brother ‘Aa’id bin ‘Alee Mismaar. After a long difficulty, the people of Sa’adah sent a telegraph to the President ‘Alee bin ‘Abdillaah bin Saalih, so he assigned the case to the judge, ‘Alee as-Samaan. The judge sent me a letter and promised that he would turn over the library to me. And he said: “The people of Sa’adah are very strict. They call the scholars of San’aa disbelievers.” So I went to San’aa to get my books. Allaah decreed that my books arrive there while the judge ‘Alee Samaan was out of the country on a mission. So when some of the brothers went to ask for it, the head of the Ministry of Endowments told them: “These books need to be inspected.” So some of our Muslim brothers at the Center for Guidance and Counseling mobilized and went to request the books. So they said: “These books are under our jurisdiction. We must examine them, so whatever is upright, we will hand over to al-Waadi’ee and whatever violates the Religion, we will keep it with us.” So by doing this, they discovered that the books were in fact purely religious and turned the them over to me without inspecting them, so may Allaah reward them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I brought the books into my country, all praise be to Allaah. And my close ones, may Allaah reward them, built a small library and a small masjid. And they said: “We will pray Jumu’ah here to avoid hardships and problems. Sometimes we would pray there with only six people present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One time the governor Haadee al-Hasheeshi asked for me, so I went to Shaikh Qaa’id Majlee, may Allaah have mercy on him, who then called him and said: “What do you want from al-Waadi’ee?” He said: “Nothing, except to get to know him.” So he said: “We will look for him in his institute.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another instance, some other leader asked for me and so Husayn bin Qaa’id Majlee went with me to see him. He (Majlee) began to talk against the Shee’ah and explain to him that we call to the Qur’aan and the Sunnah and that the Shee’ah hate us because of that because they fear that the truth will come out about them, so this leader said: “Indeed, the Shiites have tainted the history of Yemen, so as long as your Da’wah (call) is as you say it is, then call to it and we are with you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this I spent some time with my library. Only a few days had passed when some Egyptian brothers came and we started classes on some of the books of Hadeeth and the Arabic Language. After this, students continued to come from Egypt, Kuwait, the Sacred Lands (Makkah and Madeenah), Najd, ‘Aden, Hadramaut, Algeria, Libya, Somalia, Belgium, and other Muslim and non-Muslim countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The number of students has now reached between six to seven hundred students, amongst which are a hundred and seventy families.[3] And Allaah is the One who provides them with sustenance. And all of this is not because of our might or power, nor due to the amount of knowledge we have or because of our courage or eloquence in speech. Rather, this is something that Allaah willed to be. So He was the One, all praise to Allaah, that granted us this blessing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[End of Translation of Shaikh Muqbil’s Autobiography]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Death:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee passed away on the 2nd of Jumaadal-Oolaa, 1422H (7/21/2001) due to a liver disease that he was suffering from for a long time, and due to which he traveled to America, Germany and Saudi Arabia during the last part of his life to seek treatment for. He was around seventy years of age when he died in Jeddah. His funeral prayer was held in Makkah and he was buried in the Al-‘Adl Cemetery near the graves of Shaikhs Ibn Baaz and Ibn Al-‘Uthaimeen, may Allaah have mercy on all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Scholars’ Praise for him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> “Tell him that I consider him to be a mujaddid.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Al-Albaanee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“So degrading and belittling these two Shaikhs (Rabee&#8217; and Muqbil), who call to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and what the Salaf As-Saalih were upon and who wage war against those who oppose this correct methodology. As is quite clear to everyone, it either comes from one of two types of people. Either it comes from someone who is ignorant or someone who follows his desires&#8230; If he is ignorant, then he can be taught. But if he is one who follows his desires, then we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evil of this person. And we ask Allaah, Mighty and Sublime, to either guide him or break his back.&#8221;</span> [The Audio series <i>Silsilah al-Hudaa wan-Noor</i>: 1/851]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee said about him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“He is the mujaddid in the lands of Yemen” and that he said: “there can’t be found from the time of ‘Abdur-Razaaq as-San’aanee to this present day someone who established the Da’wah and revived it as the likes of Al-Waadi’ee.”</span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b><span style="color:#993300;">Footnotes</span>:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> In her biographical account of her father, Umm ‘Abdillaah Al-Waadi’iyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“His father died while he was young and he didn’t know him. So he grew up as an orphan and under the care of his mother for a period of time. She would ask him to work to make money and order him to look at the state of his community so that he could be like them. But he would turn away from this and say: ‘I will go out to study.’ So she would say: ‘May Allaah guide you.’ She would supplicate for him to be guided, as several women who were around at that time informed me. Perhaps her supplication coincided with the time when supplications are accepted since he became one of the guided, guiding others.” </span>[<i>Nubdhah Mukhtasarah</i>: pg. 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> This refers to Juhaymaan bin Muhammad al-‘Utaybee, a deviant from Saudi Arabia who took over the Grand Mosque of Makkah with hundreds of followers in 1979, and held it for several days, after which the senior scholars allowed force to be used in the sacred site of the Ka’bah in order to regain it. The Saudi National Guard subdued them about two weeks later after much blood was shed and casualties were lost on the part of the rebels and the Saudi army. The remaining dissidents that were captured were later beheaded. Shaikh Al-Albaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) mentioned this Juhaymaan in his book <i>as-Saheehah</i> (5/872), saying: “…And like the followers of the Saudi Juhaymaan, who caused the fitnah in the Grand Mosque in Makkah at the beginning of the 1400’s (Hijree). He claimed that the awaited Mahdee was with him and sought from those present in the Mosque to give him <i>bay’ah</i> (allegiance). Some of the simple-minded, heedless and evil people followed him. Then Allaah put an end to their fitnah after they had shed much of the Muslims’ blood.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 7 : The Condemnation of the People of Knowledge for this Dome</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the people of knowledge &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; condemn what has been prohibited by the Sharia&#8217;. Some of them have clearly mentioned their condemnation and some of them -perhaps- have remained silent, since what is known is that there is no advantage to this speech.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps they took into account the permissibility of remaining silent because of the saying of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; to &#8216;Aeysha -radiAllaah anhu:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;If it were not that your people had recently left kufr (disbelief) I would have rebuilt the house (Ka&#8217;ba) on the foundations upon which Ibraheem built it.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Agreed upon by Bukharee and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is understood is that those who openly mentioned their condemnation fulfilled what Allaah had made obligatory upon them, which is advising for the sake of Islaam and the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following are some of those who condemned the building of this dome.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in his book &#8216;Iqtidaa Siraat ul-Mustaqeem&#8217; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;…….And this is why, when his apartment was built in the time of the Tabieen (the followers of the Companions) &#8211; I would sacrifice my mother and father for him &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- that<span style="color:#993300;"> they left the top of it as a skylight towards the sky</span>. And it was like that until recent times, with wax placed upon it and rocks on its edges which held it together.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The roof was projecting upwards towards the sky and it was like that at the time the masjid and the mimbar (pulpit) were burnt down in the year six hundred and fifty odd. The fire was so severe in the land of the Hijjaz that it lit up the necks of the camels in Basra. After that came the fitnah (trial) of the Tartars in Baghdad and other Fitn (trials) also came.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Then the Masjid was re-built as it had originally been, as was the roof, and a wooden wall was introduced around the apartment. Then, after a number of years, the dome was erected on the roof whilst there were those who condemned it.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Sanaani &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in &#8216;Tatheer al-I&#8217;tiqaad&#8217; :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;If you say: This is the grave of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, a great dome has been built upon it and a lot of money has been spent on it. Then, I say that this is major ignorance of the reality of the situation.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Without doubt this dome was not built by the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, nor by his Companions, nor by their successors (Tabieen), nor the followers of the successors, nor the scholars of the Ummah &#8211; the Imaams of his people.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Rather, this dome was imposed on his grave &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and was built by one of the latter kings of Misr (Eygpt), Qaloon as-Salihee, more well known as king al-Mansoor in the year 678.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He mentioned it in: &#8216;Tahqeeq an-Nasraah bi Talkheehs mu&#8217;aalim Dar al-Hijrah&#8217; and these matters are issued by the governments and not based upon evidences from the text.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Shaykh Hussain bin Mahdi an-Nuaymi mentions, in his book &#8216;Ma&#8217;arij alAlbaab&#8217;, the statements of some of those who were tried as a result of taking the dome of the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; as sanction for the permissibility of building all domes. A Mufti states, &#8216;From what is well known is that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; had a dome, just like the &#8216;Aawliya of Madeenah and the &#8216;Aawliya of the rest of the different cities. Building domes is the fashion in every era; it is believed that having a dome is the cause of receiving blessings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nuaymi &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; commented by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;I say: if this is the case, then what about the fact that the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, warned against this, he cautioned and cleared his blessed and pure self &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam from what you did. You did exactly what he specifically prohibited. Was it not sufficient for you that you opposed his command? This (alone) is evidence against yourselves. You were forward in the presence of the Messenger (ie his statement). Did he &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – allude to any of what you hold permissible? Was he pleased with that or did he not prohibit this? As for your belief of blessings descending, then this is from yourselves and not from Allaah, and Allaah has refuted you.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Ikhwaan &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; entered Madeenah at the time of AbdulAzeez &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him -, it was of great importance to them to remove the dome. If only they had done so, but they &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on them &#8211; feared that the fitnah from the <strong>Qubooreeyeen</strong> (the sect of grave-worshippers) would be greater than removing the dome i.e. that removing an evil might lead to something more evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look how many false arguments the Qubooreeyeen have when they are called to remove these domes, some of which are similar to al-Laat, Uzza and Habil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance. &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Chapter 11 &#8211; The prohibition of praying to graves, upon them and in the graveyard</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 &#8211; On the authority of Abdullaah bin Umasr on the authority of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; where he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Pray some of your prayers in your houses, and do not take them as graves</strong></span>.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhaaree (v.2 p.75) &amp; Muslim (v.6 p.68)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- On the authority of Abu Huraira -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Do not make your houses into graveyards, verily Shaytaan runs away from the house in which Soorah alBaqarah is recited.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim (v.6 p.568)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is deduced from these two hadeeth, is that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; ordered that some of the optional prayers should be prayed in homes, and prayer is not kept away from homes, as it is kept away from the graveyards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 &#8211; On the authority of Abu Murthid al-Ghanawee who said that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8216;Do not sit on graves and do not pray towards them.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Muslim (v.7 p.38) Abu Dawood (v.3 p. 210), Tirmidhee (v.2 p. 154) Nisaee (v.2 p.53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- On the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;eed al-Khudree -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; who said: that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;The whole earth is a place in which to pray except for graveyards and bathing places.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood (v.1 p.184), Tirmidhee (v.2 p.263) Ibn Majah (v.1 p.246) Ahmad (v.3 p.83) by way of Muhammad bin Ishaaq on the authority of &#8216;Amr bin Yahya bin &#8216;Imarrah on the authority of his father on the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;eed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also by way of Hamad bin Salmah on the authority of &#8216;Amr bin Yahya on the authority of his father. Also as narrated from ath-Thawaree in a Mursalan form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also (p.96) by way of AbdulWahid bin Ziyad on the authority of the &#8216;Amr bin Yahya in a Mosoolun form. It was narrated by Ibn Hibban in his Saheeh, likewise in &#8216;Muwaarid athaaman&#8217; (p.104) &amp; Hakim (v.1 p.251) and he said it fulfilled the conditions of Bukhaaree &amp; Muslim and ad-Dhahabi agreed with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymeeyah said in &#8216;Iqtida as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem&#8217;: &#8216;Narrated by Ahmad and Abu Dawood, Tirmidhee, Ibn Majah and Bazzar and other than them, with good chains of narrations and whoever speaks against this hadeeth has not gathered all its chains.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- On the authority of Abu Huraira -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; who said: that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Do not make your houses into graves, do not make my grave as a place of Eid (i.e. regularly visited), and send your prayers upon me, since your prayers reach me from wherever you are.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abu Dawood and Ahmad (v.8 p.155) from the &#8216;Tarteeb of al-Musnad&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul-Islaam &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said in &#8216;Iqtida as-Siraat ul Mustaqeem&#8217; (p.321): &#8216;This chain is Hasan.&#8217; then he mentioned what was said regarding one of the narrators, Abdullaah bin Nafa&#8217; asSaaigh, and he mentioned its supporting narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6- On the authority of Abdullaah bin &#8216;Amr -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Prohibited praying in a graveyard.&#8217;</strong></span> Narrated by Ibn Hibban as is mentioned in &#8216;muwaarid athaaman&#8217; (p. 105).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7- On the authority of Anas -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>-&#8216;prohibited praying to graves.&#8217;</strong></span> and in another wording: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;He prohibited praying between graves.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by lbn Hibban as in &#8216;Muwaarid&#8217; (p.105), and al Haythamee said in &#8216;Mua&#8217;jam al-zawaid&#8217; (v.2 p.27): narrated by Bazaar, and its narrators are the narrators of the saheeh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8- On the authority of &#8216;Amroo bin Dinaar who was asked about praying between graves &#8211; who said, &#8216;It was mentioned to me that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Banu Israeel took the graves of their Prophets as places of prayer due to that Allaah Ta&#8217;ala cursed them.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Abdur Razzaq (v.1 p.407) and it is a mursal hadeeth (not attributed to the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9- On the authority of Abu Sa&#8217;eed the freed slave al-Mahree who said that the Messenger of Allaah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8216;Do not take my house as a place of Eid, nor your houses as graves and send your prayers upon me wherever you are, verily your prayers reach me.&#8217;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hadeeth mursal narrated by Sa&#8217;eed bin Mansoor, as is mentioned in &#8216;Iqtida Siraat ul-Mustaqeem&#8217; (p.322)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Therefore, what is exempted from the prohibition of praying in a graveyard is the funeral prayer, due to the ahadeeth which were mentioned about it:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- On the authority of Ibn Abbas -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; passed by a grave where someone was buried just that night and he said; &#8216;when was this person buried?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said; &#8216;last night.&#8217;<br />
He said: &#8216;Why did you not inform me?&#8217;<br />
They said: &#8216;He was buried in the dark of the night, and we disliked to wake you up.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8212; stood for the funeral prayer and we stood in a row behind him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas said: &#8216;and I was among them, and we prayed over him.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhaaree (v.3 p.433), Muslim (v.6 p.24 &amp; p.25), and Ahmad (v.7 p.226) with the tarteeb of Sa&#8217;aatee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- On the authority of Abu Huraira -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A black man or woman used to live in the masjid, and he died. The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -did not know about his death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that day the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -mentioned him and said: &#8216;What happened to that person?&#8217;<br />
They said: &#8216;He died O Messenger of Allaah.&#8217;<br />
He said: Why did you not inform me?<br />
They said: Surely he was such and such, such is his story, and they belittled his matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; said: Show me where his grave is.&#8217; He came to his grave and prayed over him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Bukhaaree (v.3 p.448) and Muslim (v.6 p.25, 26), Ahmad (v.7 p.223, 224) from the tarteeb of Musnad</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- On the authority of Anas bin Malik -radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A black man used to clean the masjid and he died, he was buried during the night, and when the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; came, he was informed about him. He said: &#8216;Go to his grave.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they went to his grave and he said: &#8216;Certainly these graves are full of darkness for the inhabitants, and indeed Allaah Azza wa Jaal illuminates them by my prayer over them.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he came to the grave and prayed over it, a man from the Ansaar said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah! Indeed my brother died and he was not prayed over.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked: &#8216;Where is his grave?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he told him, and the Messenger of Allaah went with the Ansaar.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad (v.7 p.225), Sa&#8217;atee mentions in his Takhreej: narrated by al-Bayhaaqi, ibn Mundah and Abu Dawood at-Tayalisee and al-Haythamee mentioned with his wording and said: a part of it is in asSaheeh, it is narrated by Ahmad and its narrators are the narrators of As-Saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Also on the authority of Anas that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; prayed for the woman at her grave, who had been already buried.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad (v.7) from tarteeb of al-Musnad, as-Sa&#8217;atee mentions: narrated by al-Bazzar and alBayhaqi and narrated by Muslim also by way of Shobah with a chain of the hadeeth from that chapter; concise, with the wording that the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -prayed at a grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is apparent is that the grave is of the woman who used to live in the masjid. This is what is generally understood although another meaning is possible. Allaah Subhana wa Ta&#8217;ala knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 &#8211; On the authority of Yazeed bin Thaabit -radiAllaah anhu &#8211; who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We went out with the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; and when we reached al-Baqee (the graveyard). He came across a new grave. He questioned us about it, so it was said it was such and such woman, and he knew her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you inform me about her.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah you were sleeping and fasting, we disliked to wake you up.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8216;Don’t do that. There is none amongst you who dies and I am here amongst you, except that you should inform me about that person. Verily my prayer over him is mercy for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yazeed said; then he came to the grave and we made rows behind him, he prayed the funeral prayer over it with four Takbirs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Ahmad (v.7 p.225) from the Tarteeb of al-Musnad. Sa&#8217;atee mentions: it was narrated by anNisa&#8217;ee, al-Bayhaqee and its Sanad is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam a-Bayhaqee &#8211; may Allaah have mercy on him &#8211; said: (v.4 p.48): We were informed by Abu Abdullaah al-Hafidh and Abu Sa&#8217;eed bin Abee &#8216;Amr who both said: Abul-Abbas Muhammad bin Yaqoob narrated to us that ar-Rabia&#8217;bin Sulaiman narrated to us that Bashr bin Bakr narrated to us that al-Awaz&#8217;aee narrated to me that Ibn Shihab informed me on the authority of Abee Umamah bin Sahl ibn Haneef al-Ansaari that some of the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; informed him that &#8211;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">the Messenger of Allaah used to visit the poor, sick Muslims and those who were weak. He would follow their funerals, and no one used to pray over them except the Messenger. There was a poor woman from the people of al-Awaali (a place in Madinah) whose sickness lasted a long time. The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -used to ask her neighbours about her, from those who used to visit her. He would order them that they should not bury her if anything happened to her, so that he could pray over her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The woman died that night. So, they carried her and brought her with the funeral bier &#8211; or he mentioned the place of the funeral prayer &#8211; in the masjid of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -so that the Messenger of Allaah could pray over her as he had ordered them. However, they found that he had gone to sleep after the Isha prayer, and they disliked waking him from his sleep. They prayed over her, took her and buried her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the morning the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -asked about her from her neighbours who came to visit him. They informed him about her and that they disliked to wake the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; for her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8212; said to them: &#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you do it? Let&#8217;s go.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they went with the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; until they reached her grave. They arranged themselves in rows behind the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; as they would arrange themselves in rows for the funeral prayer. The Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211; prayed over her, and said four takbeers just like he would say the takbeer for the funeral prayer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now, our noble Shaykh AbdulGhaffar al-Hindi &#8211; may Allaah preserve him &#8211; mentioned during the debate, that he required me to discuss the saying of Allaah Azza Wa Jal: &lt;&lt; <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Then those who won their point said: &#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221;</span></strong> &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since it is from the greatest doubts of the Qubooreeyeen (grave worshippers). I responded to his request &#8211; may Allaah preserve him &#8211; after the debate had ended, and I wrote the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Qubooreeyeen have a doubt, and it is regarding the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala &lt;&lt; then those who won their point said: &#8220;We verily shall build a place of worship over them.&#8221; &gt;&gt;</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say: building masajid on graves was permitted in the Sharia&#8217; for those before us, and it is also permissible for us now, as long as there is no abrogation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reply to this doubt is from the following angles:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Firstly</strong>: this action was the action of the people of the companions of the cave. The companions of the cave said, describing this nation: &lt;&lt;These, our people, have taken for worship gods other than Him (Allaah) &gt;&gt; Therefore whoever claims that the people of the companions of the cave accepted Islaam after the people of the cave isolated themselves, then he has certainly relied upon the stories of Banu Israeel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the evidences showing that their people remained upon their disbelief is the saying of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala: &lt;&lt; And thus We made their case known to the people, that they might know that the Promise of Allaah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He who does not know that the promise of Allaah is true and that there is no doubting the final Hour, then he is not a Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly if we accept, for the sake of argument, that they were Muslims, then where do we find in their Sharia&#8217; that building masajid on graves was permissible for them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not possible that they arrived at an understanding and were mistaken? Thirdly if we accept for the sake of argument that it has been permitted in the Sharia&#8217; for those before us, then now it has been abrogated with our Sharia&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Ahadeeth are Mutaawatir (recurring chains) from the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -which prohibit the taking of the graves as places of worship. The curse of the Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam -is upon the one who does this, as is mentioned in Bukharee and Muslim from the hadeeth of &#8216;Aeysha -radiAllaah anha.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace and blessings be upon our final Prophet Muhammad, his family, his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some of the Takfeeris make takfeer of themselves (i.e. declare themselves disbelievers). One of the brothers who was in Afghanistan informed me that he sat next to one of them one time while this Takfeeri was busy making takfeer (of people). Then all of a sudden that Takfeeri called him, so he said: What do you want?” So he (the Takfeeri) said: “I have committed kufr (disbelief)!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: Yes, they make takfeer on themselves and they make takfeer on one another. I would like for my brothers in Islaam to refer to the book: “<strong>Al-Farq bainalFiraq</strong>” and the book “<strong>Al-Milal wan-Nihal</strong>” of ash-Shahrastaanee, as well as “<strong>AlFasl</strong>” of Ibn Hazm. So perhaps four or five of them may sit in one gathering and they will not get up from that meeting except that one of them has made takfeer of another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There can be found a group of these Takfeeris in ‘Aden in the central Mosque. They have entered the masjid recently. How should we deal with them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: It is obligatory to warn the people about them because if you present them with the opportunity, they will shed blood and make lawful that which is prohibited, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم informed us they would do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The hadeeth of Umm Salamah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) reported by Muslim: “There will come upon you leaders of whom you will approve of (the good they do) but reject (the bad). So whoever rejects (their bad deeds), he is absolved from blame. And whoever hates (their bad deeds), he is (also) saved. However, whoever is pleased with them and follows them (i.e. bad deeds), (then he is destroyed).” They (the Sahaabah) said: “Shall we fight against them?” He said: “No, so long as they establish the prayer amongst you.” Isn’t this hadeeth a refutation against them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, I have not mentioned several ayaat and ahaadeeth (during this discussion), such as the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah bin As-Saamit (radhi Allaahu anhu), who reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever bears witness that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah; that ‘Eesaa is the slave and messenger of Allaah, His word, which He placed in Maryam, and a spirit from Him; and that Paradise is true and the Hellfire is true, Allaah will admit him into Paradise, regardless of what actions he has.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth and those similar to it prove that it is not permissible to fight against Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The lowest level of Islaam is not persisting upon committing sins. So if you persist upon committing a sin, then you are a disbeliever. How would you reply to this claim?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: If someone persists on committing a sin, there is no proof that indicates that he is a disbeliever, unless he is persisting upon committing disbelief. As for him persisting upon continuously committing a sin, then this person is guilty of committing a major sin. And Allaah praises the righteous people, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَلَمْ یُصِرُّواْ عَلَى مَا فَعَلُواْ وَهُمْ یَعْلَمُونَ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“And they do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know.”</span><br />
[Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 135]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this person is sinning if he persists in his evil. But as for this action taking him to the level of disbelief, then where is the evidence for this??</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for us to make takfeer of the Jamaa’ah at-Takfeer (i.e. declare them to be disbelievers)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, we do not declare them to be disbelievers, for the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “Whoever says to his brother: ‘O Kaafir’, then it falls back on one of them. If he is as he said he is (then it falls on him), and if not then it returns back to him.” So we do not say that they are disbelievers. ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib said about the Khawaarij: “Flee from kufr (disbelief).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we consider them to be innovators and misguided, more astray that the donkey of their people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible to wage war against the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We should not wage war agsint them unless they inititate it against us and we feel that they will present a danger to Islaam and the Muslims. So in that case, we should do what ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib did. Otherwise, the core foundation with regard to the Muslim is that his blood (i.e. life) is sacred, and it is not permissible to wage war against them, unless they initiate first by fighting against the Muslims or it is feared that they will bring harm to the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Jamaa’at at-Takfeer use as evidence the argument that the proof was established upon mankind with Allaah’s statement:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ مِن بَنِي آدَمَ مِن ظُهُورِهِمْ ذُرِّیَّتَهُمْ وَأَشْهَدَهُمْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ أَلَسْتَ بِرَبِّكُمْ</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">قَالُواْ بَلَى شَهِدْنَا أَن تَقُولُواْ یَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّا آُنَّا عَنْ هَذَا غَافِلِينَ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And remember when your Lord brought forth from the Children of Aadam from their loins, their seed and made them testily as to themselves, saying: ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said: ‘Yes, we testify’ lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: ‘Verily we were unaware of this.’” [Surah Al-A’raaf: 172]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And they deem Ibn ‘Abbaas’ interpretation (tafseer) of Allaah’s statement:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">وَمَن لَّمْ یَحْكُم بِمَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And whoever doesn’t rule by what Allaah has revealed, then they are the disbelievers” [5] in which he said: “It is a (minor) disbelief less than (major) disbelief” to be a weak narration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: As for using this ayah as evidence, it states that Allaah has taken a covenant from the Children of Aadam, however there is no mention in it that there is not left any excuses for them. the proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَمَا آُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولاً<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“And We never punish until We have sent a messenger (to forewarn).”</span> [Surah AlIsraa: 15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another proof is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَمَا آَانَ اللّهُ لِيُضِلَّ قَوْمًا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَاهُمْ حَتَّى یُبَيِّنَ لَهُم مَّا یَتَّقُونَ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“And Allaah will never lead a people astray after He has guided them until He (first) makes clear to them what they should avoid.”</span> [Surah At-Tawbah: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the Saheeh, from the narration of Hudhaifah radhi Allaahu anhu, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم informed us that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There was a man who when death approached him asked his children: ‘What kind of a father was I to you?’ They replied: ‘The best father.’ So he said: ‘If I order you to do something, would you do it?’ They said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘When I die, burn my body and scatter my ashes (throughout the land and sea), for I swear by Allaah, if Allaah is able to get a hold of me, He will surely punish me with a severe torment, the likes of which no other creature in the universe will face.’ So when he died his children did what he asked. So Allaah commanded the land and the sea to gather his remains, until he brought the man forth and Allaah said to him: ‘What caused you to do what you did?’ He replied: ‘My fear of you.’ So Allaah said to him: “I have indeed forgiven you.’” This is proof that this individual was excused due to his ignorance. He doubted Allaah’s Ability. We don’t say that the word qadira here holds the meaning of: to restrain. So its meaning is not: “If Allaah restrains me.” This is since according to the context of the hadeeth, the appropriate meaning is that it refers to Allaah’s Ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also the hadeeth of Hudhaifah radhi Allaahu anhu, in which he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is imminent that a time will come upon the people in which one will not know what fasting or prayer is.” So it was said: “What then will remain with them, O Hudhaifah?” He replied: “The testification that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah.” It was said: “And what benefit will this testification be for them?” He said: “It will take them out from the Hellfire.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there are many proofs in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah that indicate that one is excused due to ignorance. One of these proofs is the hadeeth reported by Abu Hurairah radhi Allaahu anhu and Al-Aswad bin Saree’ in Musnad Ahmad concerning how the people of Fitrah (innate inclination) will be tested:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“On the Day of Judgement, three types of people will present their arguments to Allaah. One of them will say: ‘I was deaf and could not hear.’ Another will say: ‘I was simple-minded and didn’t have any intellect.’ And the third will present his argument. So Allaah will bring forth a strip from the Hellfire and say to them: ‘Enter it.’ So if they enter it, it will be cool and safe on them. And if they do not enter it, He will say to them: ‘Now you have disobeyed Me. And you would have been the most disobedient to My messengers.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jamaa’at at-Takfeer is a deviant group of people. So we advise our brothers in AlBaydaa and Ibb and other places to beware of them and to regard them as misguided individuals who are far away from the Religion. And they should consider them as a danger to Islaam and the Muslims. So they serve as an instrument for everyone that wishes to attack the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, we advise them to repent to Allaah, and to turn back to the people of knowledge. And if they remain upon their misguidance and meet Allaah holding these deviant beliefs, they will regret it, and Allaah is the One who we ask for assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Who is the one who has the ability to make takfeer (declare someone a disbeliever)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The scholars are the ones who are capable of placing rulings upon an individual – i.e. if he is either a Muslim or a disbeliever, unless of course if he is a Christian or a Jew or a Communist. Then in this case it is known to the Muslims that such people are disbelievers. There can be found a group that is called Jamaa’at atTakfeer, which is present in Egypt, Sudan and Yemen. This group declares Muslims to be disbelievers due to sins (they commit). And we have made several refutations against them. They feel restrained and pressed back by Da’wah but not by prison and terrorism. However, by calling to the Book and the Sunnah their misguidance can be exposed. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever says to his brother: ‘O Kaafir’, then it falls back on one of them. If he is as he said he is (then it falls on him), and if not then it returns back to him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible for a Muslim to declare other Muslims to be disbelievers.[6]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcription of the Video </strong>:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What are the recommended Sunnah actions upon the birth of a newborn?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Muqbil bin Hadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The recommended sunnah actions: Rather what is obligatory is the &#8216;Aqeeqah as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) stated: &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Every child is mortgaged with his &#8216;Aqeeqah. &#8216;And the &#8216;Aqeeqah is two sheep for a boy and one sheep for a girl&#8221;</span></strong>. That is one affair, the other affair is selecting a good name; meaning naming him with a pleasant name as Imam Muslim narrated in his Sahih from Abdillah ibn Umar that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The most beloved names to Allah are ’Abdulah and ’Abdur Rahman&#8221;</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beware beware! From naming your newborn with the names of the kufaar like George or the names of oppressors like Saddam, Ma&#8217;mar al Qadhafi or Hafidh Asad. So beware of naming it with these names. Also, naming the newborn Jamal is permissible. However, if what is desired from this is naming after Jamal Abdul Nasir -May Allah not have mercy upon him- then no. What is important is to choose a good name.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After that, also choosing a righteous wet nurse as the child is influenced by the woman who breastfeeds him. Also, beware beware of breastfeeding from an imbecilic woman or from a crazy woman or a woman suffering from a nervous condition as all of these affect the child, wallahul musta&#8217;aan</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>A Clarification of the Death of Shaikh Muqbil Ibn Haadee Al-Waadi’ee</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on the one who was sent as a mercy and guidance, and on his Companions and family. To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“<span style="color:#008000;">Every soul shall taste death</span>.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“<span style="color:#008000;">Every one on it (the earth) will perish, and the Face of your Lord will remain, possessing glory and honor</span>.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, we console ourselves and all the Muslims, in general, and Ahl-us-Sunnah in particular, upon news of the death of the Supporter of the Sunnah and the Subduer of Innovations and Partisanship, the Muhaddith of the world during his time, the Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Muqbil Ibn Haadee Ibn Muqbil Al-Waadi’ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His death occurred while he was in the city of <strong>Jeddah</strong> at 8:30 pm on Sunday night, the 2nd of Jumaadaa Al-Oolaa <strong>1422H</strong>. He was close to <strong>seventy years</strong> of age at the time of his death, which came as a result of a liver disease that he was suffering from for more than seven years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Janaazah (funeral) prayer was held in <strong>Masjid Al-Haraam</strong> after the Fajr Prayer on Sunday (morning), and he was buried in the <strong>Al-‘Adl graveyard in Makkah</strong> next to the two noble shaikhs, ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Ibn Baaz and Muhamamd Ibn Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen, may Allaah have mercy on all of them. This was in accordance with his final request, which he made while on his sickbed in Germany.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah to forgive him and to raise his status to the level of those who guide. Indeed to Allaah we belong and indeed to Him we will return. And there is no might nor power except by the Will of Allaah, the Most High, Most Great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah gave him the joy and satisfaction during his life of seeing the effects of his da’wah (call), which were witnessed and felt. But the enemies of the da’wah should not feel happy at news of his death, for he has left behind for them that which will grieve and displease them, such as his scholarly students, his precious books, his widely distributed tapes and his pure methodology, which had no obscurities in it. So he enjoyed the bounties that Allaah bestowed on him. Likewise, he established the foundation for the lofty palace and strong fortress of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we hope from Allaah that He cause his reward to remain continuous as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Whoever calls towards an act of guidance, he will have the same reward as those who follow him (in that act of guidance), and that will not detract anything from their good deeds.”</b></span> Reported in Saheeh Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: The Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>“When the Son of Aadam dies, his good deeds come to an end except three: a continuously recurring charity, knowledge from which benefit is derived, and a righteous child that supplicates for him.”</b> </span>Reported by Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, spent his whole life in <strong>(seeking) knowledge, teaching, writing and calling to Allaah</strong>. This is such that the flatlands and the mountain areas became filled with his students, his books and his tapes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even in his last days, he still was still being asked religious questions on Hadeeth, Fiqh, Shawaahid and ‘Iraab. He was stricken with unconsciousness and then when he recovered and awoke, he was asked questions. From his last words were those that he uttered when he phoned us during his sickness while in Germany. And we asked about the hadeeth of Anas (radhi Allaahu anhu): <b>“O Hayy (Living), O Qayyoom (Eternal), By your mercy we ask for your help.”</b> – “Did you mention it in (your book) As-Saheeh Al-Musnad with this wording?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this point we cannot forget to give the good tidings to all of our Muslim brothers that this educational center (in Dammaaj) will continue, <i>inshAllaah</i>, as it was during the life of our Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him. So the classes are active and continuing and the affairs are going according to the plans of our Shaikh, by Allaah’s granting that for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh had some final requests for his students, loved ones and brothers from Ahl-us-Sunnah in his handwriting, which will be distributed in these blessed pages, by Allaah’s permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is so that our brothers across the various Islaamic lands and those who constantly ask about the future of this center can be at rest and tranquility. So we say: Be calm for the matters are going according to the best way, and the da’wah is preserved from our Lord. So pay no mind to those who spread false rumors and reports. And Allaah is sufficient for us and He is the best of guardians.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of the small treatise titled <b><i>“Hiwaar ma’a Jamaa’at at-Takfeer”</i></b> (A Debate with the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer) by Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this e-book was the treatise that is found within Imaam Muqbil’s book Fadaa’ih wa Nasaa’ih (pg. 168-186) [Dar-ul-Haramain: 1st Edition; 1999]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Imaam Muqbil refutes the false concepts of the Takfeeri Jamaa’at, a group that was founded in Egypt by a man named Shukree Mustafaa, and which later spread to other Muslim countries. Their beliefs revolve around declaring Muslims to be disbelievers, hence the name Jamaa’at at-Takfeer, declaring the leaders infidels and actively calling the people to revolt against the Muslim governments and anyone that supports them. Even though Mustafaa was executed in 1978, the false concepts of his group have still managed to creep into the hearts of many Muslims today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise is especially important, since it deals with the beliefs of those who in recent times call to rebellion, revolution, terrorism and those who seek to spread instability in the Muslim lands as well as throughout the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The best remedy for them is to seek knowledge. As for one of them remaining ignorant and not knowing anything about the Arabic language, and then he says: ‘We are men and the Companions are (also) men’, then yes, you are men and the Companions, too, are men. However, the difference between you and the Companions is like the difference between the heavens and the earth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Who is it that the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer preys on? They prey on those individuals who have enthusiasm and zeal for their Religion based on ignorance. The founder of the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer, which has appeared during these recent times, was Shukree Mustafaa Al-Misree, who used to be part of the Bankrupt Brotherhood (Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen). Then he experienced great trials in prison and was hardened along with a group of individuals. The governments (at that time) strove hard to disunite the Muslims. So this group would call themselves the Jamaa’at-ul-Hijrah (The Party of Withdrawal). This Shukree Mustafaa used to have some knowledge and he would challenge the faculty of the Azhar University to debate with him, but the Azharees would be afraid due to two reasons: <b>First:</b> All that many of them had to offer was a scanty portion of knowledge of Hadeeth and knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah. So they were either only strong in their knowledge of Grammar or their knowledge of Fiqh. <b>Second:</b> They feared that if they beat him, he and his group (Jamaa’at) would come to them at night and kill them. As a result of this, the group grew and spread. So it originated in the Jamaal ‘Abdun-Naasir Prison and then spread to Sudan and to the lands of the Sacred Precincts (Makkah and Madeenah), inconspicuously, and to Yemen, openly. Jamaa’at Ansaar-us-Sunnah rose against them in Sudan after we said that there were some individuals from the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer amongst them. So they feared that people would hear this speech and therefore not support them anymore.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the one who these Takfeeris prey on is the individual who has lots of zeal for the Religion based on ignorance. I challenge all of them – the Egyptians, Sudanese, Yemenis, Kuwaitis and Algerians among them to bring forth one scholar from amongst them. And they claim that they strive hard to have a scholar amongst their ranks! We seek refuge in Allaah from any scholar agreeing with your Da’wah, for he would then be one of the dogs of the Hellfire on the Day of Judgement, and he would shoot out from the Religion just as an arrow shoots out from the hunted game.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is how Ahlus-Sunnah is, may Allaah preserve them – they are the ones who confront the people of falsehood, such as the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer. Don’t think that I am condoning the other groups, for I consider them to be the product of ignorance and calamities caused by the enemies of Islaam in order to split up the ranks of the Muslims. So I say to the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer: You must repent to Allaah and ask the people of knowledge (when you are unaware of matters), as Allaah says in His Noble Book: <b>‘So ask the People of the Reminder if you don’t know.’</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 43] This is since if you were to ask one of them what’s your proof on raising the hands in prayer, you would find him saying: ‘I don’t know.’ Or if you were to ask him what’s your proof for prostrating on the seven limbs, he would reply: ‘I don’t know.’ But yet after all that, he puts himself in charge of declaring Muslims to be disbelievers! So take things easy, you small ignoramus! How can you put yourself in charge of declaring Muslims to be disbelievers?? By doing this, you would be assisting the Communists, the Ba’athees, the Naasirees and the governments, rather, the enemies of Islaam, in splitting up the ranks of the Muslims. Then you would just dwindle away (and be forgotten) like Shabeeb, Naafi’ bin al-Araq, ‘Imraan bin Hattaan and other heads of the Khawaarij. So the ignorant ones melt way, but the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger remains and continues.”</p>

<span style="color:#808080;">Source: Fadaa’ih wa Nasaa’ih (pg. 163-164)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;">Produced By: Al-Ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Al-Ahdal said: “A summary of Tafseer Ibn Katheer can be found in the tafseer Fee Dhilaal-il-Qur’aan (of Sayyid Qutb).”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer by Imam Muqbil (rahimahullaah):</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then let him bring us ten or twenty hadeeths with their <strong>chains of narration</strong> in the tafseer Adh-Dhilaal. Or let him bring us one example of where (Sayyid Qutb) declares <strong>a hadeeth authentic or weak</strong>! And let him show us where the ‘<strong>Aqeedah of the Salaf</strong> is in the tafseer, Adh-Dhilaal. Rather, the majority of what is in Adh-Dhilaal is from the (individual) <strong>ideologies of Sayyid Qutb</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for Tafseer Ibn Katheer,</strong></span> then Imaam Ash-Shawkaanee said about it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“His tafseer is from the best of tafseers, if not THE best.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suyootee said in “Tabaqaat-ul-Huffaadh”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“His tafseer is from the best of tafseers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He has interpreted the Qur’aan with the Qur’aan, and he has interpreted the Qur’aan with the Sunnah. He has interpreted the Qur’aan with the statements of the Salaf, and he has interpreted the Qur’aan with the Arabic language. Then he authenticated and weakened (reports) and mentioned which ahaadeeth had no basis (i.e. source). And he refuted those who use some of these ahaadeeth as proof (for their views) by showing that they are not authentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I remember when I was in Madeenah, one person, who was from the seniors amongst the Ikhwaan al-Mufliseen, told me that he advises the youth to read tafseer Adh-Dhilaal, and that it is better for them than Tafseer Ibn Katheer!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But these farces will soon die just as the books of <strong>Sa’eed Hawaa</strong>, which served the ideologies of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen, died. And the books of <strong>Salaah as-Saawee</strong>, which aid the ideologies of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen will soon die as well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <strong>‘Abdullaah bin Faysal Al-Ahdal</strong> will die (i.e. his da’wah) – the one who launches attacks against Ahlus-Sunnah. And we say to him: “Where is your attack against the Sufis, who have transgressed so much so that they supplicate and seek assistance from other than Allaah? Have you called the people to destroy and demolish the shrines (graves) in al-Hawta, and in al-‘Aynaat, and those which are in Shihr itself?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I must say: It is as if the Devil has deceived you. So it is as if you are prepared to (only) wage war against Ahlus-Sunnah. However, Ahlus-Sunnah give no importance to you. And if it were not that I were encouraged and requested by others to make a refutation against you, I would not have refuted you. This is since these words that come out from you are demented and have no worth whatsoever. So all praise be to Allaah, the Sunnah and good are both widespread. And the people do not look to and rely in (anyone) except Ahlus-Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So your words will only increase the people in their trust and reliance in the da’wah of Ahlus-Sunnah. One time, when the Communists were in ‘Aden, one person from the inhabitants of ‘Aden said to me: “We came to love you before we even saw you.” So it was said to him: “How is that so?” He responded: “Because the Communists used to say to us: ‘There exists a people in Sa’adah who go to their slaves from behind when they want to pray’, so we knew that the Communists did not speak against anyone except for righteous people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people know <strong>‘Abdullaah Al-Ahdal</strong> and what he is upon from deviation and misguidance, so his words only serve to aid the Sunnah…</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee<br />
SOURCE: Tuhfat-ul-Mujeeb ‘alaa As’ilat-il-Haadir wal-Ghareeb (pg. 143-147) [Original source is a tape “Questions from England” recorded in Ramadaan 13, 1416H]<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> There is a group amongst us (in Britain) called Muntadaa Al-Markaz Al-Islaamee. They are connected with Muhammad Suroor and they sell his books and interact with him. And they have a tazkiyah (approval/recommendation) from Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Ibn Baaz and Shaikh Ibn ‘Uthaimeen that encourages cooperating with them and being connected to them. So what is your advice to Al-Muntadaa Al-Islaamee and what is your advice to the Salafees who cooperate and work with them in Da’wah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> My advice to them is that they return to the condition they were upon when they were spreading the Qur’aan and Sunnah in their magazine “Al-Bayaan” and in their magazine “As-Sunnah”. We were extremely pleased with the magazine “As-Sunnah” and likewise with the magazine “Al-Bayaan”. But then the reality became clear – that they were in fact Hizbees (partisans), who called people away from the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I advise them to not clash with the Muslim rulers. This partisanship (<i>hizbiyyah</i>) has caused divisions within the unity of the callers to Allaah from among the Ahlus-Sunnah in Yemen, and in the lands of the Haramayn, Najd and in Sudan and in Egypt, as well as in many of the Muslim countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They call people to not have any concern for knowledge. There used to be a group of students that was studying with us, then they attached themselves to these people, and all of sudden they started to have contempt for their brothers (other students) and for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Studying the Qur’aan and the Sunnah to them is like a seashell (i.e. it is hollow and empty). And performing worship in the masjid to them is also like a seashell. And these are the masaajid, about which the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“If one of you makes wudoo (ablution) and he does it well, then he goes out to the masjid – nothing brings him out except the prayer, he does not take one step except that Allaah raises him one level due to it and one sin gets erased from him. So when he prays, the angels do not stop sending their prayers upon him, as long as he is in prayer, saying: ‘O Allaah, bless him, O Allaah, have mercy on him.’ And none of you ceases to be in prayer while he is waiting for the (next) prayer.” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say: If Shaikh Ibn Baaz and Shaikh Ibn ‘Uthaimeen gave <i>tazkiyah</i> (approval) to Al-Muntadaa before the Gulf Crisis, then they are both excused from that, because even we ourselves praised the magazine “Al-Bayaan” a lot, and we called people to cooperate in working with them. And if they gave their <i>tazkiyah</i> after the Gulf Crisis – and I don’t think that is so – then they are both considered to be in error. So I say to the two Shaikhs: These people have split the Muslims here in Yemen and they have turned to attacking and showing enmity to the Ahlus-Sunnah. Rather, their harm has become great – and I do not say that their harm is greater than that of the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen – for they are only like scraps as compared to the Ikhwaan al-Muslimeen. And they are the ones who transgress against many of the masaajid of Ahlus-Sunnah, amongst which is a masjid in ‘Aden, the masjid of the people in Buraiqah, which Shaikh Ahmad Ibn ‘Uthmaan is the Imaam of…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these two Shaikhs issued a <i>tazkiyah</i> (religious approval), then they should take it back, just as I took mine back when their affair became clear to me during the Gulf Crisis, and when their enmity became apparent to me in Yemen. And from their heads is ‘Abdul-Majeed Ar-Reemee, Muhammad Al-Baydaanee and ‘Abdullaah Ibn Faysal Al-Ahdal. They have begun mocking and ridiculing their brothers. And if you were to read the Qasaa’id (poetic verses) of ‘Abdul-Majeed you would have found them according to the Sunnah, but now they have diluted and melted away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise the mashaayikh to recant form their approvals (<i>tazkiyaat</i>), for Allaah says in His Noble Book: <b>“And do not argue on behalf of those who deceive themselves. Verily, Allaah does not like anyone who is a betrayer, sinner.” </b>[Surah An-Nisaa: 107]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“Have you not seen those who claim sanctity for themselves (i.e. given themselves <i>tazkiyahs</i>). Nay, but Allah sanctifies whom He wills. And they will not be dealt with unjustly, even equal to the extent of a <i>fateel</i> (small thread).” </b>[Surah An-Nisaa: 49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says in His Glorious Book: <b>“So do not purify (give <i>tazkiyah</i> to) yourselves, He knows best who has Taqwaa.” </b>[Surah An-Najm: 13?]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they use this <i>tazkiyah</i> (approval) for the purpose of deceiving the people, so it is not acceptable if it is used for this time, because it has become clear from them that they attack Shaikh Al-Albaanee and that they criticize Shaikh Ibn Baaz, when he issued a fatwa allowing the treaty with the Jews during the Gulf Crisis. And they rejoice at this so that they can chase the people away from the scholars, because no one has remained with them! So they say: “We have no choice for these people, except to attack their scholars, because we (ourselves) are scholars.” And if their Shaikh opposes them he suddenly becomes from the Takfeeri group!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They invited Abu Suhaib, who was Syrian, to teach amongst them. So after he taught amongst them for as long as Allaah willed, they said: “We feel that the fruits of your teaching should be repaid to you, so pick any land and we will give you the proper permits. So he responded: “The lands belong to Allaah and do not belong to you. Cut off the salary you pay me because I don’t want it.” Then the students remained with him and all praise be to Allaah not one student was produced from them. Even though they are troublemakers, still by Allaah’s Grace, they have no effect. So I advise the Salafi brothers to stay far away from these Hizbees (partisans), because they are not looking for anything except to build the membership of their party.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if ‘Aqeel Al-Muqtaree comes to you, or Muhammad Al-Mahdee or other than these two, and the people say: “This is a scholar from the scholars of Yemen”, then do not host him or allow him entry. And do not attend his lectures, because he only goes touring around for the sake of collecting dollars!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And one brother who came from America informed me that they were touring through America, giving lectures, and they would say: <b>“The one who supports an orphan and me are like this!”</b>[1] So a man from the crowd stood up – and he was looking for aid for Bosnia and Herzog – and said: “The one who supports the orphan is the one who feeds him not the one who begs.” So they began to dispute with one another all because of the worldly matters (Duniyaa)!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When worldly aspirations enter into the Da’wah, it’s blessing diminishes, as Allaah says: <b>“Does not the sincere worship belong to Allaah?” </b>[Surah Az-Zumar: 3] And He says: <b>“And they were not commanded except to worship Allaah, making their worship (Religion) sincerely to Him (alone).” </b>[Surah Al-Bayyinah: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for their magazine of begging, which we call “Al-Furqah” (causing divisions) Magazine, and which they call “Al-Furqaan” (The Criterion), then I challenge them to bring any of its issues which doesn’t have begging in it. And I challenge Muhammad al-Mahdee to bring forth a student of knowledge that can be studied under. Rather, you find that he has transformed ‘Abdullaah Ibn Ghaalib, Muhammad Al-Baydaanee and many others, for they used to be students of knowledge here (in Yemen), but then he deluded them and misled them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I forgot to mention Muhammad Al-Hadeeyah who came charging from Sudan to Riyadh, then to Jeddah, then to Qatar and then to Abu Dhabi, then to Dubai, all for the purpose of building a masjid for the Sufis!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise you to stay far away from these individuals! And perhaps someone may say: “So then who should we study under?” So my response is: I hold that it is an obligation on our noble brothers in the lands of the Haramayn and Najd to send to their brothers some people (to teach them) who are not Hizbees (partisans). And it is an obligation on us also, to send to our brothers in England some of our students who can be studied under, even if they stay for three or five months.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore I say: It is an obligation to turn our attention to the Qur’aan and the Sunnah. As for the lectures of the innovators, then you will see them stampeding and ramming (like wild beats) in their lectures, but then when they finish, they say: “We have a project for establishing an educational center.” And this educational center is in the district of Daleel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise the brothers – may Allaah preserve them – to request from Shaikh Ibn Baaz – may Allaah preserve him – that he send to them someone that can teach them. And I advise my brothers here (in Yemen), that one of them should go to (them) and stay for three months, then return and someone else go. This does not fall into the realm of advice only; rather I consider it to be an obligation. But I don’t mean that a brother should arrive at England and then they waste his time by traveling around or that he doesn’t find students who want to seek knowledge from him. So they must learn some Arabic, ‘Aqeedah (Creed), Islamic Fiqh and Hadeeth of the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee<br />
SOURCE: His book Tuhfat-ul-Mujeeb &#8216;alaa As&#8217;ilat-il-Haadir wal-Ghareeb (pg. 179-185)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question: </b>What is Suroorism and what are its clear signs. Is it real or just part of one&#8217;s imagination?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer: </b>All praise is due to Allaah, Lord of the worlds and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on our Prophet, Muhammad, his family and Companions. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah &#8211; alone and with no partner. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and messenger. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Suroorism is an ascription to the brother Muhammad Suroor Zayn-ul-&#8216;Aabideen. He used to be in Kuwait where he came out with some good books in which he clarified the beliefs of the Shee&#8217;ah, as well as other good books. Then he moved to Germany and then to England where he eventually settled. There, he produced the Magazine entitled &#8220;Al-Bayaan&#8221; and we were extremely pleased with it. Then he produced another magazine called &#8220;As-Sunnah&#8221; and likewise we were extremely pleased with it. And we said: &#8220;This is the answer to what we have been waiting for.&#8221; And some of our brothers praised the magazine &#8220;Al-Bayaan&#8221; and even we praised it in the past, saying: &#8220;There cannot be found anything equal to it.&#8221; However the condition of the Hizbees is that in the beginning they call to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah until the people&#8217;s hearts grow attached to them and their strength increases. Then when they come to know that criticism against them will have no effect on them, they manifest what they are truly upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The magazine &#8220;As-Sunnah&#8221;, of which it is more proper that it be called &#8220;Al-Bid&#8217;ah&#8221; calls people away from the scholars and it accuses them of being inactive, paid by the government and not having an understanding of current affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But all praise be to Allaah, the reality of the Surooris came out in the open during the Gulf Crisis. This was from the Grace of Allaah, &#8216;azza wa jall. I remember reading at that time some words (in their magazine) in which there was an attack against Shaikh Al-Albaanee for having produced a tape called: &#8220;An Encounter with a Suroori.&#8221; Then a few pages later they praised Shaikh Ibn Baaz. So I realized the significance of this praise &#8211; so that it won&#8217;t be said that: &#8220;They attack the scholars!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some days after the fatwa of Shaikh Ibn Baaz concerning the permissibility of making a treaty with the Jews was issued, they launched an attack against Shaikh Ibn Baaz. So it was in fact a well-devised scheme to chase the people away from the scholars! And the magazines &#8220;Al-Bayaan&#8221; and &#8220;As-Sunnah&#8221; gave the understanding that it was more proper to refer to those Salafees who understood the current affairs in Yemen concerning the affair of the Yemeni Crisis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say: O you masaakeen [1]&#8230;who is it that is unaware of the condition of the Muslims? Rather, all of the matter lies in fixing this current situation we find ourselves in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what has befallen the Muslims from losses, fear and suffering, then it is due to our sins. Allaah says: <b>&#8220;Allaah puts forth the example of a town (Makkah) that dwelt in security and well-being; it&#8217;s provision coming to it in abundance from every place, but it denied the Blessings of Allaah. So Allaah made them taste the extreme hunger (famine) and fear because of what they used to do.&#8221; </b>[Surah An-Nahl: 112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if we have come to realize the sickness, then what is the cure? Allaah says: <b>&#8220;Allaah has promised those among you who believe and do good deeds, that He will certainly grant them ascendancy (i.e. Khilaafah) in the land as he granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the ability to practice the Religion, which He has chosen for them. And He will place in exchange of their fear a sense of security (provided), that they worship Me and do not ascribe any partners to Me.&#8221; </b>[Surah An-Noor: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is the sins that have brought humiliation upon the Muslims. And it is their dealing with interest, their allowing of fornication in many of the Islamic lands and their preferring and submitting to man-made laws brought by way of the enemies of Islaam, and how much more can we list&#8230;and the going out without Hijaab and indecent exposure, and their mixing of the sexes in the schools and the universities.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the cure is in returning to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah, and then by returning to the scholars. Allaah says: <b>&#8220;And when there came to them a matter concerning (public) security or fear, they announced it to the people. But if only they had referred it back to the Messenger or to those encharged with authority amongst them, those who have the ability to derive a proper conclusion from it would have understood it.&#8221;</b>[Surah An-Nisaa: 83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is an obligation on us to return to the scholars: <b>&#8220;These are the parables that We send forth to the people, yet no one (truly) understands them except those with knowledge.&#8221; </b>[Surah Al-&#8216;Ankaboot: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what you see is a person memorizing three or four subjects and then he takes that around to the masaajid, charging and ramming (like a bull). Then his companions nickname him Shaikh-ul-Islaam! So is this knowledge? Rather, knowledge is sitting upon a mat with your needs tucked below you (hearing from a shaikh) &#8211; enduring with patience the hardships of hunger and bareness. Just look at the condition of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and what they went through.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the people of knowledge, they are the ones who put each thing in it&#8217;s proper place, as was stated in the previous ayah. And Allaah says: <b>&#8220;Verily, in that is a reminder to those who possess knowledge.&#8221; </b>[Surah Ar-Room: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <b>&#8220;Is the one who knows that what has been revealed to you from your Lord is the truth then like he who is blind? But it is only the men of understanding that pay heed.&#8221; </b>[Surah Ar-Ra&#8217;ad: 19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The affliction that the Muslims are being tested by is their being ignorant about their Religion. So anyone that memorizes some ayaat and ahaadeeth and then begins to talk about it, especially if he has some eloquence in speech, people say: &#8220;This is a Shaikh.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, the reality of the matter became clear, as it is said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;If you hear the eloquent one speaking, do not give yourself into him<br />
For this unnatural (way of speaking) is something artificial<br />
Be pleased with taking knowledge and understanding, and<br />
His eloquent speech will come to an end without any fight.&#8221;</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says when informing us of the story of Qaaroon: <b>&#8220;So he (Qaaroon) went forth before his people in his arrogance. Those who are desirous of the life of this world said: &#8216;Ah, would that we had the like of what Qaaroon has been given! Verily, he is the owner of a great fortune.&#8217; But those who had been given knowledge said: &#8216;Woe to you! The reward of Allaah is better for those who believe and do righteous deeds, and this none shall attain except those who are patient. So We caused the earth to swallow him and his dwelling place. Then he had no group or party to help him against Allaah, nor was he one of those who could save themselves. And those who had desired to have been in his position the day before, began to say: &#8216;Know you not that it is Allaah who enlarges the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His slaves. Had it not been that Allaah was gracious to us, He could have caused the earth to swallow us up (also)!&#8217; Know you not that the disbelievers will never be successful?'&#8221; </b>[Surah Al-Qasas: 79-82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is an obligation on us to return to the people of knowledge and to learn, just as when Jibreel went to the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) to teach the Companions how to ask questions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I will never forget what &#8216;Abdul-Qaadir Ash-Shaybaanee, the small ignoramus, said: &#8220;We will send some of our brothers to Abee &#8216;Abdir-Rahmaan (i.e. Shaikh Muqbil) to get some gulps (of knowledge) in two months, and then we will send them to some of the centers to take over grounds from the Ikhwaan Al-Muslimeen.&#8221; So I said: &#8220;In two months it&#8217;s possible to produce callers to Allaah?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if it is the ignorant ones that are in charge of directing the Da&#8217;wah groups, then I give the tidings of the demise of such Da&#8217;wah groups. So we must gather with the scholars and take knowledge from them, as our scholars in the past did. Salmaan Al-Faarisee sat and sought knowledge with the first scholar he encountered until he died, and then a second and a third until he came upon the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) and followed him. And this is how the companions of Mu&#8217;aadh (raa) were. Before he passed away, they said to him: &#8220;Who shall we go to (for knowledge after you)?&#8221; He said: &#8220;To &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Mas&#8217;ood.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when one of the brothers demands one of the Hizbees to seek knowledge, he says: <b>&#8220;Amongst you are those who want this world and amongst you are those who want the Hereafter.&#8221;</b>[Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 152] And then he says: &#8220;Allaah said this ayah with regard to the Companions&#8221; &#8211; meaning, they acknowledge that they have no patience in seeking knowledge and in suffering hunger. They prefer to live close to people in buildings and cars and in the worldly life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then we hear them say: &#8220;You attack the different organizations.&#8221; So who told you that we attack the organizations? Yes, we attack some of the organizations that consist of partisanship, restricted Walaa (loyalty), thievery and misappropriation of money. These are the kinds of groups that we criticize and call the people away from.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a Da&#8217;wah (call) that is based on lies and deceptions, but the reality will become manifest. For the Da&#8217;wah of &#8216;Alee Ibn Al-Fadl manifested itself and the reality of the Da&#8217;wah of the Mu&#8217;tazilah, the Shee&#8217;ah and Sufis manifested themselves. And the ones who will expose and make these realities manifest, by the Permission of Allaah, are Ahlus-Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise be to Allaah, Ahlus-Sunnah are the ones who always examine and rectify the Muslim ummah. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;There will not cease to be a group from my ummah that is triumphant upon the truth. Those who abandon them will not be able to harm them until Allaah&#8217;s Command (i.e. Promise) comes to pass and they are upon that (condition).&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee, may Allaah preserve him, in the lands of the Haramayn and Najd, is exposing the Hizbees and clarifying what beliefs they are upon. And likewise Shaikh Abul-Hasan in Ma&#8217;ribi[2] and Shaikh Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab in Hudaydah and Shaikh Muhammad Al-Imaam in Ma&#8217;bar and Shaikh Qaasim and the brother Muhammad As-Somalee in Jaami&#8217;-ul-Khair in San&#8217;aa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I advise the brothers, because many of them all praise be to Allaah are receptive, to return to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and to call to them, and to not waste away their lives in glorifying Shaikh so and so. And if they were to abandon such sheikhs, they would say: &#8220;Beware of him, he is from Jamaa&#8217;at At-Takfeer&#8221; or &#8220;He is a government agent.&#8221; These are words of one who doesn&#8217;t fear Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b class="Marker">Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Footnotes">[1] <b>Translator&#8217;s Note:</b> This is the plural of the Arabic word miskeen, which means someone needy. In this context it refers to someone who is ignorant and lacking knowledge, thus being needy (of it).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <b>Translator&#8217;s Note:</b> It is important to note that this article appeared in the first edition (printed in the year 2000) of the book &#8220;Tuhfat-ul-Mujeeb&#8221;. Since then, and after the passing away of Imaam Muqbil Al-Waadi&#8217;ee, the scholars have become aware of errors in creed and manhaj committed on the part of Abul-Hasan Al-Ma&#8217;ribee. So the likes of Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Al-Madkhalee, Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee and Shaikh &#8216;Ubayd Al-Jabiree refuted him and warned against him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="line-height:1.5em;">Source:Tuhfat-ul-Mujeeb &#8216;alaa As&#8217;ilat-il-Haadir wal-Ghareeb (pg. 141-143) [1]<br />
Taken from al-ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> There is a group amongst us (here in the UK) called Hizb-ut-Tahreer. They call for the Islamic Khilaafah and they speak against the scholars. How can they be refuted and what is the way towards achieving the proper Islamic Khilaafah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> All praise be to Allaah and may the peace and blessings be on our prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions. I testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah &#8211; alone and with no partner. And I testufy that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regard to the issue of partisanship, people are divided into two parties: The party of Ar-Rahmaan (Allaah) and the party of ash-Shaytaan (the Devil). So the party of ar-Rahmaan &#8211; it is not permissible for them to be divided amongst themselves. Allaah, the Most High, says: <b>&#8220;Verily those who divide their Religion and break up into sects, you have no concern with them in the least.&#8221;</b> [Surah Al-An&#8217;aam: 159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;The Jews split up into seventy-one or seventy-two sects. And the Christians split up into seventy-one or seventy-two sects. And my ummah will split up into seventy-three sects.&#8221;</b> This hadeeth was reported by Abu Dawood from the narration of Abu Hurairah (<i>radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu</i>). Abu Dawood reported a similar hadeeth from Mu&#8217;awiyah but in it there occurs: <b>&#8220;All of them (these sects) will be in the Hellfire, except one sect.&#8221;</b> They asked: <b>&#8220;Who is it O Messenger of Allaah?&#8221;</b> He (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;The Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221;</b> Then he said: <b>&#8220;And there will indeed come a people of whom vain desires will move them just as rabies moves around the one it affects.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) warned us of has already come to pass, for the desires have become many and the parties and groups have multiplied. And Allaah, the Lord of Glory, says in His Noble Book: <b>&#8220;And hold on tightly to the Rope of Allaah, all of you, and be not divided.&#8221;</b> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;You will indeed follow the ways of those who came before you, step by step, even if they were to enter the hole of a lizard you would enter into it (after them).&#8221; We said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah, do you mean the Jews and the Christians?&#8221;</b> He (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: &#8220;Who else?&#8221; And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>&#8220;The beleiver with respect to another beleiver is like a building, each part supports the other.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for these parties, then they chase each other away and they attack one another. In fact, if one were to say: &#8220;These splitting into parties has actualized what the enemies of Islaam have desired from splitting up the ummah, dividing its ranks and weaking its strength&#8221; he would be speaking truthfully.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, (I say that) Hizb-ut-Tahreer is a hizb (party) that is wicked. Perhaps you think this is a grave statement since I am the first one to say such a thing, but it is proper that I introduce such a statement. So I say again, it is indeed a wicked party, which began in Jordan. They split away from the Ikhwaan al-Muslimoon, who wrote to them requesting them to return but they refused to go back to them. Their leader was Taqee-ud-Deen an-Nubhaanee. Concerning the matters related to Creed, they say: <b>&#8220;Nothing should be accepted except for that which conforms to the intellect.&#8221;</b> So if there is found some hearing (of a report), then this hearing must be eliminated. That is why they reject the Punishment in the Grave and they reject that the Dajjaal will be brought forth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they have no concern for teaching good etiquettes nor with spreading knowledge. So it is a party that cultivates its followers upon seekiing after and studying politics, which opposes the Religion. And it was once said to the leader of this group: &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we see any schools for the memorization of the Qur&#8217;aan in your party?&#8221; So he responded: &#8220;I do not want to produce dervishes!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They rely on politics only, and they do not rely on knowledge and etiquettes, nor on the heart-softening narrations. And with regard to issues of Fiqh, they make it permissible for a man to shake hands with a woman that is not related to him. And they say that it is permissible for a woman to be a leader and that she can sit in a governing council (majlis ash-shuraa). In fact they even allow a disbeliever to be in the governing council and that he can be given general leadership positions! So it is a deviant group that has surpassed the extent of deviance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I am surprised at those who join and adhere to this party. So I advise every brother to stay far away from this group and to warn against it. And if it were not that we make excuses for them, that they misinterpret the texts, we would have said that they were disbelievers because they reject the Punishment in the Grave and they reject the coming of the Maseeh ad-Dajjaal. And their leader says that he does not like to teach his students the Qur&#8217;aan so that they will not come out as dervishes.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question:</strong>Which books should a student of knowledge begin with? And then after those, if he wants to widen his study?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books, which a student of knowledge, who is a beginner, should start reading with [if he can read and write well] are:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Fath ul-Majeed Sharh Kitaab ut-Tawheed , which is a mighty book,</li>
<li>Aqeedat ul-Waasitiyyah<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> by Shaykh ul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah, </span></li>
<li>al-Qawl ul-Mufeed Fee Adillatit Tawheed<span style="line-height:1.5em;"> by our brother Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wasaabee, </span></li>
<li>Bulugh al-Maraam</li>
<li>Riyaadh us-Saaliheen</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When you have read these books, you yourself will crave for more. If you could, start with the memorization of the Qur’aan, and this more good and desirable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the issue, regarding the &#8216;Arabic language, for our foreign brothers, then it is very important. If there is a foreign person who does not speak the &#8216;Arabic language well, then a person may come to him in his Islaamic appearance and then he begins to explain the Qur’aan to him other than how it ought to be, as happened with the Mu’tazilah.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In her biographical account of her father, Umm ‘Abdillaah Al-Waadi’iyyah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“His father died while he was young and he didn’t know him. So he grew up as an orphan and under the care of his mother for a period of time. She would ask him to work to make money and order him to look at the state of his community so that he could be like them. But he would turn away from this and say: <strong>‘I will go out to study.’</strong> So she would say: <strong>‘May Allaah guide you.’</strong> (<strong>hadaakAllaah). </strong>She would supplicate for him to be guided, as several women who were around at that time informed me. Perhaps her supplication coincided with the time when supplications are accepted since he became one of the guided, guiding others.” [<i>Nubdhah Mukhtasarah</i>: pg. 18]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Do not pray against your children:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sal Allahu alaihi wa sallam) forbade praying against one&#8217;s children, one&#8217;s wealth and one&#8217;s own self, lest that be at a time when the du&#8217;aa is answered. He (sal Allahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Do not pray against yourselves, do not pray against your children, do not pray against your wealth, lest that coincides with a time when Allah is asked and He gives, so He answers your prayer.&#8221; </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Muqbil</strong> ibn Haadee al-Waadi&#8217;ee &#8211;<em>rahimahullaah</em>&#8211; said in ‘<em>al-Jaami &#8216;us-Saheeh mimmaa laisa fis-Saheehayn</em>’ (2/505-506): &#8220;<span style="color:#333300;"><strong>Three Whose Supplications Are Not Rejected</strong></span>&#8220;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Maajah</strong>&#8211;<em>rahimahullaah</em>&#8211; said (vol. 1, p. 557): `Alee ibn Muhammad narrated to us: Wakee` narrated to us from Sa`daan al-Juhanee: from Sa`d, Aboo Mujaahid at-Taa·ee &#8211; and he was reliable: from Aboo Mudillah &#8211; and he was reliable: from Aboo Hurairah, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger (<em>Sallalaahu alaihi wa sallam</em>) said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">There are three whose supplication is not rejected: the just ruler, the fasting person <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>until he breaks his fast</strong></span>, and the supplication of the oppressed person: Allaah will raise it up under the clouds on the Day of Resurrection, and the gates of heaven will be opened for it, and He says: ‘By My Might, I shall certainly aid you, even if it be after a time.’</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And Imaam Ahmad</strong> <em>-rahimahullaah-</em> reported (vol. 2. pp. 304-305): Aboo Kaamil and Abun-Nadr narrated to us, both saying: Zuhayr narrated to us: Sa`daan at-Taa·ee narrated to us. Abun- Nadr said: Sa`d, Aboo Mujaahid: Abul-Mudillah, the freed slave of the Mother of the Believers, narrated to us that he heard Aboo Hurairah say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah! When we see you our hearts become tender, and we are from the people of the Hereafter; but when we depart from you this world attracts us, and we smell the women and the children.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">If you were</span> &gt;&gt;, or he said: &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">If you were to be , in every state, upon the condition which you are upon when you are with me then the Angels would shake hands with you, and they would visit you in your houses; and if you did not commit sins, then Allaah would bring a people who committed sins so that He could forgive them</span>. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We said: O Messenger of Allaah! Tell us about Paradise: What is its structure?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said : &lt;&lt; <span style="color:#008000;">One brick of gold, and the next brick of silver, and its mortar is fragrant musk. Its pebbles are pearls and rubies. Its soil is saffron. Whoever enters it will enjoy bliss, and will never be unhappy. He will live forever, and he will not die. His clothes will not wear out, and his youth will not pass away. There are three whose supplication is not rejected: The just ruler, and <strong><span style="color:#993300;">the fasting person</span></strong> <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>until he breaks his fast</strong></span>, and the supplication of the oppressed: it is carried upon the clouds, and the gates of heaven will be opened for it, and the Lord -the Mighty and Majestic- says: ‘By My Might! I shall certainly aid you, even if it be after a time.’</span>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a <em>Saheeh</em> hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh al-Albaanee</strong> said in ‘as-Saheehah’ (2/657/no. 969):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is a weak chain of narration, on account of this Abul- Mudillah. adh-Dhahabee said: ‘He is hardly known. No one narrates from him besides Aboo Mujaahid’, and there occurs in ‘at-Taqreeb’: ‘Maqbool (Acceptable when supported)’, and the rest of the narrators of the chain of narration of the hadeeth are reliable, narrators of al-Bukhaaree. I say: <span style="color:#993300;">However it is a ‘hasan’ or a ‘Saheeh’ hadeeth, on account of its previous witnesses and others&#8230;”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translated by <span style="color:#666699;"><strong>Aboo Talhah Dawud ibn Ronald Burbank</strong></span>.</p>
