										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Dream of the Prophet Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> Volume 9, Book 87, Number 171: [<small>Interpretation of Dreams ]</small> : <span style="line-height:1.5em;">Narrated Samura bin Jundub</span><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s Apostle very often used to ask his companions, “Did anyone of you see a dream?” So dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allah wished to tell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One morning the Prophet said,</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>“Last night two persons came to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>I set out with them and we came across a man Lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man’s head, injuring it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man, his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded and came to a man Lying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man’s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man’s face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded and came across something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).” I think the Prophet said, “In that oven there was much noise and voices.” The Prophet added, “We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly. I asked them, ‘Who are these?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>And so we proceeded and came across a river.” I think he said, “…. red like blood.” The Prophet added, “And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time the performance was repeated, I asked my two companions, ‘Who are these (two) persons?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, ‘Who is this (man)?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, ‘Who is this?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded till we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, ‘Go up and I went up’ The Prophet added, “So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the best shape.” The Prophet further added, “My two companions (angels) said to me, ‘This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.’ I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, ‘That (palace) is your place.’ I said to them, ‘May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.’ They replied, ‘As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day)</p>
<p>I said to them, ‘I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?’<br />
They replied, ‘We will inform you:</p>
<p>As for the first man you came upon whose head was being injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers.</p>
<p>As for the man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it spreads all over the world. And</p>
<p>those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses;,</p>
<p>and the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of usury (Riba) and</p>
<p>the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and</p>
<p>the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith).”</p>
<p>The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, “O Allah’s Apostle! What about the children of pagans?” The Prophet replied, “And also the children of pagans.”</p>
<p>The Prophet added, “My two companions added,</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div>
<p>‘The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave them.’”</p>
</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-size:11px;line-height:1.5em;">Source : </span>Sahih Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A number of miracles were bestowed upon and performed by Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) to establish the proof of his prophethood. The greatest miracle bestowed upon him was the revelation of the Qur&#8217;an. The Qur&#8217;an is miraculous in a number of aspects: Its linguistic perfection and inimitability, its validation by recent historical, archaeological, and scientific discoveries, its prophecies and so on. Unlike the miracles of other prophets before him, the miracle of the Qur&#8217;an is eternal. Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) also provided us with a number of true prophecies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are accounts of the some of the other miracles of Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) . Before reading these, it helps to know something about the Science of Traditions (Arabic: <i>Ahadith</i>), an exacting and comprehensive system developed by early Muslim scholars to verify the chain of transmission of these accounts, as well as investigating the trustworthiness and capability of every narrator at every level of the chain. This thorough authentication process ensures that these accounts are real, validated narrations of the sayings, actions, and tacit approvals of the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Traditions mentioned below are all from Sahih al-Bukhari, the most authentic collection of ahadith.</p>
<ol style="text-align:justify;">
<li>Splitting of the Moon</li>
<li>Food Multiplication</li>
<li>Water Multiplication</li>
<li>Supplication for Rain</li>
<li>Lights to guide Companions</li>
<li>Crying of the stem of the Date-palm Tree</li>
<li>Glorification of Allah by the Prophet&#8217;s meals</li>
<li>The explusion of a liar&#8217;s corpse by the Earth</li>
<li>The Speech of the Wolf</li>
<li>The Prophet&#8217;s Night Journey to Jerusalem and Ascent to the Heavens</li>
</ol>
<h4 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Splitting</strong></a><strong> of the Moon </strong></h4>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder&#8221; </i>[Qur&#8217;an 54:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 6, Book 60, Number 388:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The moon was cleft asunder while we were in the company of the Prophet, and it became two parts. The Prophet said, Witness, witness (this miracle).&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Food</strong></a><strong> Multiplication</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 780:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Jabir:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father had died in debt. So I came to the Prophet and said, &#8220;My father (died) leaving unpaid debts, and I have nothing except the yield of his date palms; and their yield for many years will not cover his debts. So please come with me, so that the creditors may not misbehave with me.&#8221; The Prophet went round one of the heaps of dates and invoked (Allah), and then did the same with another heap and sat on it and said, &#8220;Measure (for them).&#8221; He paid them their rights and what remained was as much as had been paid to them.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Water</strong></a><strong> Multiplication</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 779:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to consider miracles as Allah&#8217;s Blessings, but you people consider them to be a warning. Once we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on a journey, and we ran short of water. He said, &#8220;Bring the water remaining with you.&#8221; The people brought a utensil containing a little water. He placed his hand in it and said, &#8220;Come to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah.&#8221; I saw the water flowing from among the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle , and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah, when it was being eaten (by him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 777:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Al-Bara:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were one-thousand-and-four-hundred persons on the day of Al-Hudaibiya (Treaty), and (at) Al-Hudaibiya (there) was a well. We drew out its water not leaving even a single drop. The Prophet sat at the edge of the well and asked for some water with which he rinsed his mouth and then he threw it out into the well. We stayed for a short while and then drew water from the well and quenched our thirst, and even our riding animals drank water to their satisfaction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 1, Book 7, Number 340:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Imran:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we were traveling with the Prophet and we carried on traveling till the last part of the night and then we (halted at a place) and slept (deeply). There is nothing sweeter than sleep for a traveler in the last part of the night. So it was only the heat of the sun that made us to wake up and the first to wake up was so and so, then so and so and then so and so (the narrator &#8216;Auf said that Abu Raja&#8217; had told him their names but he had forgotten them) and the fourth person to wake up was &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab. And whenever the Prophet used to sleep, nobody would wake him up till he himself used to get up as we did not know what was happening (being revealed) to him in his sleep. So, &#8216;Umar got up and saw the condition of the people, and he was a strict man, so he said, &#8220;Allahu Akbar&#8221; and raised his voice with <i>Takbir</i>, and kept on saying it loudly till the Prophet got up because of it. When he got up, the people informed him about what had happened to them. He said, &#8220;There is no harm (or it will not be harmful). Depart!&#8221; So they departed from that place, and after covering some distance the Prophet stopped and asked for some water to perform the ablution. So he performed the ablution and the call for the prayer was pronounced and he led the people in prayer. After he finished from the prayer, he saw a man sitting aloof who had not prayed with the people. He asked, &#8220;O so and so! What has prevented you from praying with us?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I am <i>junub</i> and there is no water. &#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Perform <i>tayammum</i> with (clean) earth and that is sufficient for you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet proceeded on and the people complained to him of thirst. Thereupon he got down and called a person (the narrator &#8216;Auf added that Abu Raja&#8217; had named him but he had forgotten) and &#8216;Ali, and ordered them to go and bring water. So they went in search of water and met a woman who was sitting on her camel between two bags of water. They asked, &#8220;Where can we find water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;I was there (at the place of water) this hour yesterday and my people are behind me.&#8221; They requested her to accompany them. She asked, &#8220;Where?&#8221; They said, &#8220;To Allah&#8217;s Apostle .&#8221; She said, &#8220;Do you mean the man who is called the <i>Sabi&#8217;</i>, (with a new religion)?&#8221; They replied, &#8220;Yes, the same person. So come along.&#8221; They brought her to the Prophet and narrated the whole story. He said, &#8220;Help her to dismount.&#8221; The Prophet asked for a pot, then he opened the mouths of the bags and poured some water into the pot. Then he closed the big openings of the bags and opened the small ones and the people were called upon to drink and water their animals. So they all watered their animals and they (too) all quenched their thirst and also gave water to others and last of all the Prophet gave a pot full of water to the person who was <i>junub</i> and told him to pour it over his body. The woman was standing and watching all that which they were doing with her water. By Allah, when her water bags were returned the looked like as if they were more full (of water) than they had been before (Miracle of Allah&#8217;s Apostle) Then the Prophet ordered us to collect something for her; so dates, flour and <i>sawiq</i> were collected which amounted to a good meal that was put in a piece of cloth. She was helped to ride on her camel and that cloth full of food-stuff was also placed in front of her and then the Prophet said to her, &#8220;We have not taken your water but Allah has given water to us.&#8221; She returned home late. Her relatives asked her: &#8220;O so and so what has delayed you?&#8221; She said, &#8220;A strange thing! Two men met me and took me to the man who is called the <i>Sabi</i>&#8216; and he did such and such a thing. By Allah, he is either the greatest magician between this and this (gesturing with her index and middle fingers raising them towards the sky indicating the heaven and the earth) or he is Allah&#8217;s true Apostle.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards the Muslims used to attack the pagans around her abode but never touched her village. One day she said to her people, &#8220;I think that these people leave you purposely. Have you got any inclination to Islam?&#8221; They obeyed her and all of them embraced Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu &#8216;Abdultah said: The word <i>saba&#8217;a </i>means &#8220;The one who has deserted his old religion and embraced a new religion.&#8221; Abul &#8216;Ailya said, &#8220;The <i>Sabis</i> are a sect of people of the Scripture who recite the Book of Psalms.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">Supplication for <a>Rain</a></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 8, Book 73, Number 115:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet on a Friday while he (the Prophet) was delivering a sermon at Medina, and said, &#8220;There is lack of rain, so please invoke your Lord to bless us with the rain.&#8221; The Prophet looked at the sky when no cloud could be detected. Then he invoked Allah for rain. Clouds started gathering together and it rained till the Medina valleys started flowing with water. It continued raining till the next Friday. Then that man (or some other man) stood up while the Prophet was delivering the Friday sermon, and said, &#8220;We are drowned; Please invoke your Lord to withhold it (rain) from us&#8221; The Prophet smiled and said twice or thrice, &#8220;O Allah! Please let it rain round about us and not upon us.&#8221; The clouds started dispersing over Medina to the right and to the left, and it rained round about Medina and not upon Medina. Allah showed them (the people) the miracle of His Prophet and His response to his invocation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Lights</strong></a><strong> to guide Companions</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 1, Book 8, Number 454:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two of the companions of the Prophet departed from him on a dark night and were led by two lights like lamps (going in front of them from Allah as a miracle) lighting the way in front of them, and when they parted, each of them was accompanied by one of these lights till he reached their (respective) houses.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Crying</strong></a><strong> of the stem of the Date-palm Tree</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 783:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to deliver his sermons while standing beside a trunk of a datepalm. When he had the pulpit made, he used it instead. The trunk started crying and the Prophet went to it, rubbing his hand over it (to stop its crying).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><a><strong>Glorification</strong></a><strong> of Allah by the Prophet&#8217;s meals</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 779:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to consider miracles as Allah&#8217;s Blessings, but you people consider them to be a warning. Once we were with Allah&#8217;s Apostle on a journey, and we ran short of water. He said, &#8220;Bring the water remaining with you.&#8221; The people brought a utensil containing a little water. He placed his hand in it and said, &#8220;Come to the blessed water, and the Blessing is from Allah.&#8221; I saw the water flowing from among the fingers of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and no doubt, we heard the meal glorifying Allah, when it was being eaten (by him).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The <a>expulsion</a> of a liar&#8217;s corpse by the Earth</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 814:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read <i>Surat-al-Baqara</i> and <i>Al-Imran,</i> and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet. Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221; They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground).</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;">The Speech of the <a>Wolf</a></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 3, Book 39, Number 517:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abu Huraira:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;While a man was riding a cow, it turned towards him and said, &#8216;I have not been created for this purpose (i.e. carrying), I have been created for sloughing.l&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar believe in the story.&#8221; The Prophet went on, &#8220;A wolf caught a sheep, and when the shepherd chased it, the wolf said, &#8216;Who will be its guard on the day of wild beasts, when there will be no shepherd for it except me?&#8217; &#8220;After narrating it, the Prophet said, &#8220;I, Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar too believe it.&#8221; Abu Salama (a sub-narrator) said, &#8220;Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar were not present then.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been written that a wolf also spoke to one of the companions of the Prophet near Medina as narrated in <i>Fath-al-Bari</i>:Narrated Unais bin &#8216;Amr: Ahban bin Aus said, &#8220;I was amongst my sheep. Suddenly a wolf caught a sheep and I shouted at it. The wolf sat on its tail and addressed me, saying, &#8216;Who will look after it (i.e. the sheep) when you will be busy and not able to look after it? Do you forbid me the provision which Allah has provided me?&#8217; &#8221; Ahban added, &#8220;I clapped my hands and said, &#8216;By Allah, I have never seen anything more curious and wonderful than this!&#8217; On that the wolf said, &#8216;There is something (more curious) and wonderful than this; that is, Allah&#8217;s Apostle in those palm trees, inviting people to Allah (i.e. Islam).&#8217; &#8220;Unais bin &#8216;Amr further said, &#8220;Then Ahban went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and informed him what happened and embraced Islam.)&#8221; palm trees or other trees and share the fruits with me.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Prophet&#8217;s <a>Night</a> Journey to Jerusalem</strong> (Arabic: <i>Israa</i>) <strong>and Ascent to the Heavens</strong> (Arabic: <i>Miraj</i>)</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 228: </i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the Statement of Allah&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;And We granted the vision (Ascension to the heavens) which We made you see (as an actual eye witness) was only made as a trial for the people.&#8221;</i> (17.60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas added: The sights which Allah&#8217;s Apostle was shown on the Night Journey when he was taken to Bait-ul Maqdis (i.e. Jerusalem) were actual sights, (not dreams). And the Cursed Tree (mentioned) in the Quran is the tree of <i>Zaqqum</i> (itself) .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><i>Volume 4, Book 54, Number 462:</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, &#8220;On the night of my Ascent to the Heaven, I saw Moses who was a tall brown curly-haired man as if he was one of the men of Shan&#8217;awa tribe, and I saw Jesus, a man of medium height and moderate complexion inclined to the red and white colors and of lank hair. I also saw Malik, the gate-keeper of the (Hell) Fire and Ad-Dajjal amongst the signs which Allah showed me.&#8221; (The Prophet then recited the Holy Verse): &#8220;So be not you in doubt of meeting him&#8217; when you met Moses during the night of Mi&#8217;raj over the heavens&#8221; (32.23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas and Abu Bakra: &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8220;The angels will guard Medina from Ad-Dajjal (who will not be able to enter the city of Medina).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Volume 5, Book 58, Number 227:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Abbas bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Malik bin Sasaa said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle described to them his Night Journey saying, &#8220;While I was lying in Al-Hatim or Al-Hijr, suddenly someone came to me and cut my body open from here to here.&#8221; I asked Al-Jarud who was by my side, &#8220;What does he mean?&#8221; He said, &#8220;It means from his throat to his pubic area,&#8221; or said, &#8220;From the top of the chest.&#8221; The Prophet further said, &#8220;He then took out my heart. Then a gold tray of Belief was brought to me and my heart was washed and was filled (with Belief) and then returned to its original place. Then a white animal which was smaller than a mule and bigger than a donkey was brought to me.&#8221; (On this Al-Jarud asked, &#8220;Was it the Buraq, O Abu Hamza?&#8221; I (i.e. Anas) replied in the affirmative). The Prophet said, &#8220;The animal&#8217;s step (was so wide that it) reached the farthest point within the reach of the animal&#8217;s sight. I was carried on it, and Gabriel set out with me till we reached the nearest heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he asked for the gate to be opened, it was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel answered, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has Muhammad been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217; The gate was opened, and when I went over the first heaven, I saw Adam there. Gabriel said (to me). &#8216;This is your father, Adam; pay him your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me till we reached the second heaven. Gabriel asked for the gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel answered, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel answered in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217; The gate was opened.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I went over the second heaven, there I saw Yahya (i.e. John) and &#8216;Isa (i.e. Jesus) who were cousins of each other. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;These are John and Jesus; pay them your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted them and both of them returned my greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the third heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is!&#8217; The gate was opened, and when I went over the third heaven there I saw Joseph. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;This is Joseph; pay him your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fourth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed, what an excel lent visit his is!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The gate was opened, and when I went over the fourth heaven, there I saw Idris. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;This is Idris; pay him your greetings.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the fifth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked. &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said He is welcomed, what an excellent visit his is! So when I went over the fifth heaven, there I saw Harun (i.e. Aaron), Gabriel said, (to me). This is Aaron; pay him your greetings.&#8217; I greeted him and he returned the greeting to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the sixth heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked. &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. It was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I went (over the sixth heaven), there I saw Moses. Gabriel said (to me),&#8217; This is Moses; pay him your greeting. So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious brother and pious Prophet.&#8217; When I left him (i.e. Moses) he wept. Someone asked him, &#8216;What makes you weep?&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;I weep because after me there has been sent (as Prophet) a young man whose followers will enter Paradise in greater numbers than my followers.&#8217; Then Gabriel ascended with me to the seventh heaven and asked for its gate to be opened. It was asked, &#8216;Who is it?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Gabriel.&#8217; It was asked,&#8217; Who is accompanying you?&#8217; Gabriel replied, &#8216;Muhammad.&#8217; It was asked, &#8216;Has he been called?&#8217; Gabriel replied in the affirmative. Then it was said, &#8216;He is welcomed. What an excellent visit his is!&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when I went (over the seventh heaven), there I saw Abraham. Gabriel said (to me), &#8216;This is your father; pay your greetings to him.&#8217; So I greeted him and he returned the greetings to me and said, &#8216;You are welcomed, O pious son and pious Prophet.&#8217; Then I was made to ascend to <i>Sidrat-ul-Muntaha</i> (i.e. the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) Behold! Its fruits were like the jars of Hajr (i.e. a place near Medina) and its leaves were as big as the ears of elephants. Gabriel said, &#8216;This is the Lote Tree of the utmost boundary) . Behold ! There ran four rivers, two were hidden and two were visible, I asked, &#8216;What are these two kinds of rivers, O Gabriel?&#8217; He replied,&#8217; As for the hidden rivers, they are two rivers in Paradise and the visible rivers are the Nile and the Euphrates.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then <i>Al-Bait-ul-Ma&#8217;mur</i> (i.e. the Sacred House) was shown to me and a container full of wine and another full of milk and a third full of honey were brought to me. I took the milk. Gabriel remarked, &#8216;This is the Islamic religion which you and your followers are following.&#8217; Then the prayers were enjoined on me: They were fifty prayers a day. When I returned, I passed by Moses who asked (me), &#8216;What have you been ordered to do?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I have been ordered to offer fifty prayers a day.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;Your followers cannot bear fifty prayers a day, and by Allah, I have tested people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel (in vain). Go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your followers&#8217; burden.&#8217; So I went back, and Allah reduced ten prayers for me. Then again I came to Moses, but he repeated the same as he had said before. Then again I went back to Allah and He reduced ten more prayers. When I came back to Moses he said the same, I went back to Allah and He ordered me to observe ten prayers a day. When I came back to Moses, he repeated the same advice, so I went back to Allah and was ordered to observe five prayers a day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I came back to Moses, he said, &#8216;What have you been ordered?&#8217; I replied, &#8216;I have been ordered to observe five prayers a day.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Your followers cannot bear five prayers a day, and no doubt, I have got an experience of the people before you, and I have tried my level best with Bani Israel, so go back to your Lord and ask for reduction to lessen your follower&#8217;s burden.&#8217; I said, &#8216;I have requested so much of my Lord that I feel ashamed, but I am satisfied now and surrender to Allah&#8217;s Order.&#8217; When I left, I heard a voice saying, &#8216;I have passed My Order and have lessened the burden of My Worshippers.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Aisha (Radi-Allahu &#8216;anha):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of Quraish worried about the lady from Bani Makhzum who had committed theft. They asked, &#8220;Who will intercede for her with Allah&#8217;s Apostle?&#8221; Some said, &#8220;No one dare to do so except Usama bin Zaid the beloved one to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Usama spoke about that to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Wa Sallam), Allah&#8217;s Apostle (Sallallahu &#8216;Alaihi Wa Sallam) said, (to him), &#8220;Do you try to intercede for somebody in a case connected with Allah&#8217;s Prescribed Punishments?&#8221; Then he got up and delivered a sermon saying, &#8220;What destroyed the nations preceding you, was that if a noble amongst them stole, they would forgive him, and if a poor person amongst them stole, they would inflict Allah&#8217;s Legal punishment on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>By Allah, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad stole, I would cut off her hand</strong>.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;">From last hadith in The Book of Revelation of the 1st Volume of Sahih Bukhari:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sufyan bin Harb informed me that Heraclius had sent a messenger to him while he had been accompanying a caravan from Quraish. They were merchants doing business in Sham (Syria, Palestine, Lebanon and Jordan), at the time when Allaah&#8217;s Messenger had truce with Abu Sufyan and Quraish infidels. So Abu Sufyan and his companions went to Heraclius at Ilya (Jerusalem). Heraclius called them in the court and he had all the senior Roman dignitaries around him. He called for his translator who, translating Heraclius&#8217;s question said to them, &#8220;Who amongst you is closely related to that man who claims to be a Prophet?&#8221; Abu Sufyan replied, &#8220;I am the nearest relative to him (amongst the group).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8220;Bring him (Abu Sufyan) close to me and make his companions stand behind him.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, Heraclius told his translator to tell my companions that he wanted to put some questions to me regarding that man (The Prophet) and that if I told a lie they (my companions) should contradict me.&#8221; Abu Sufyan added, &#8220;By Allaah! Had I not been afraid of my companions labeling me a liar, I would not have spoken the truth about the Prophet. The first question he asked me about him was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;What is his family status amongst you?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;He belongs to a good (noble) family amongst us.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius further asked, &#8216;Has anybody amongst you ever claimed the same (i.e. to be a Prophet) before him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8216;Was anybody amongst his ancestors a king?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius asked, &#8216;Do the nobles or the poor follow him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;It is the poor who follow him.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8216;Are his followers increasing decreasing (day by day)?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;They are increasing.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then asked, &#8216;Does anybody amongst those who embrace his religion become displeased and renounce the religion afterwards?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8216;Have you ever accused him of telling lies before his claim (to be a Prophet)?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8216;Does he break his promises?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;No. We are at truce with him but we do not know what he will do in it.&#8217; I could not find opportunity to say anything against him except that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius asked, &#8216;Have you ever had a war with him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said, &#8216;What was the outcome of the battles?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I replied, &#8216;Sometimes he was victorious and sometimes we.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius said, &#8216;What does he order you to do?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, <strong>&#8216;He tells us to worship Allaah and Allaah alone and not to worship anything along with Him, and to renounce all that our ancestors had said. He orders us to pray, to speak the truth, to be chaste and to keep good relations with our Kith and kin.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius asked the translator to convey to me the following, I asked you about his family and your reply was that he belonged to a very noble family. In fact all the Messengers come from noble families amongst their respective peoples. I questioned you whether anybody else amongst you claimed such a thing, your reply was in the negative. If the answer had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man was following the previous man&#8217;s statement. Then I asked you whether anyone of his ancestors was a king. Your reply was in the negative, and if it had been in the affirmative, I would have thought that this man wanted to take back his ancestral kingdom.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I further asked whether he was ever accused of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>So I wondered how a person who does not tell a lie about others could ever tell a lie about Allaah.</strong></span> I, then asked you whether the rich people followed him or the poor. You replied that it was the poor who followed him. And in fact all the Messengers have been followed by this very class of people. Then I asked you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You replied that they were increasing, and in fact this is the way of true faith, till it is complete in all respects. I further asked you whether there was anybody, who, after embracing his religion, became displeased and discarded his religion. Your reply was in the negative, and in fact this is (the sign of) true faith, when its delight enters the hearts and mixes with them completely. I asked you whether he had ever betrayed. You replied in the negative and likewise the Messengers never betray. Then I asked you what he ordered you to do. You replied that he ordered you to worship Allaah and Allaah alone and not to worship any thing along with Him and forbade you to worship idols and ordered you to pray, to speak the truth and to be chaste. If what you have said is true, he will very soon occupy this place underneath my feet and I knew it (from the scriptures) that he was going to appear but I did not know that he would be from you, and if I could reach him definitely, I would go immediately to meet him and if I were with him, I would certainly wash his feet.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Heraclius then asked for the letter addressed by Allaah&#8217;s Messenger which was delivered by Dihya to the Governor of Busra, who forwarded it to Heraclius to read. The contents of the letter were as follows: &#8220;In the name of Allaah the Beneficent, the Merciful (This letter is) from Muhammad the slave of Allaah and His Messenger to Heraclius the ruler of Byzantine. Peace be upon him, who follows the right path. Furthermore I invite you to Islam, and if you become a Muslim you will be safe, and Allaah will double your reward, and if you reject this invitation of Islam you will be committing a sin by misguiding your Arisiyin (peasants). (And I recite to you Allaah&#8217;s Statement:)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>O people of the scripture! Come to a word common to you and us that we worship none but Allaah and that we associate nothing in worship with Him, and that none of us shall take others as Lords beside Allaah. Then, if they turn away, say: Bear witness that we are Muslims (those who have surrendered to Allaah).</strong> (3:64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sufyan then added, &#8220;When Heraclius had finished his speech and had read the letter, there was a great hue and cry in the Royal Court. So we were turned out of the court. I told my companions that the question of Ibn-Abi-Kabsha) (the Prophet Muhammad) has become so prominent that even the King of Bani Al-Asfar (Byzantine) is afraid of him. Then I started to become sure that he (the Prophet) would be the conqueror in the near future till I embraced Islam (i.e. Allaah guided me to it).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sub narrator adds, &#8220;Ibn An-Natur was the Governor of llya&#8217; (Jerusalem) and Heraclius was the head of the Christians of Sham. Ibn An-Natur narrates that once while Heraclius was visiting ilya&#8217; (Jerusalem), he got up in the morning with a sad mood. Some of his priests asked him why he was in that mood? Heraclius was a foreteller and an astrologer. He replied, &#8216;At night when I looked at the stars, I saw that the leader of those who practice circumcision had appeared (become the conqueror). Who are they who practice circumcision?&#8217; The people replied, &#8216;Except the Jews nobody practices circumcision, so you should not be afraid of them (Jews).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Just Issue orders to kill every Jew present in the country.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While they were discussing it, a messenger sent by the king of Ghassan to convey the news of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger to Heraclius was brought in. Having heard the news, he (Heraclius) ordered the people to go and see whether the messenger of Ghassan was circumcised. The people, after seeing him, told Heraclius that he was circumcised. Heraclius then asked him about the Arabs. The messenger replied, &#8216;Arabs also practice circumcision.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(After hearing that) Heraclius remarked that sovereignty of the &#8216;Arabs had appeared. Heraclius then wrote a letter to his friend in Rome who was as good as Heraclius in knowledge. Heraclius then left for Homs. (a town in Syrian and stayed there till he received the reply of his letter from his friend who agreed with him in his opinion about the emergence of the Prophet and the fact that he was a Prophet. On that Heraclius invited all the heads of the Byzantines to assemble in his palace at Homs. When they assembled, he ordered that all the doors of his palace be closed. Then he came out and said, &#8216;O Byzantines! If success is your desire and if you seek right guidance and want your empire to remain then give a pledge of allegiance to this Prophet (i.e. embrace Islam).&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(On hearing the views of Heraclius) the people ran towards the gates of the palace like onagers but found the doors closed. Heraclius realized their hatred towards Islam and when he lost the hope of their embracing Islam, he ordered that they should be brought back in audience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(When they returned) he said, &#8216;What already said was just to test the strength of your conviction and I have seen it.&#8217; The people prostrated before him and became pleased with him, and this was the end of Heraclius&#8217;s story (in connection with his faith).</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam once climbed the mountain of Uhud with Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar and &#8216;Uthman radhiallahu `anhum. The mountain shook with them. The Prophet said (to the mountain), &#8220;Be firm, O Uhud! For on you there are no more than a Prophet, a Siddiq and two martyrs.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( Sahih Bukhari Companions of the Prophet [VOL 5: Hadith No. 1-119] )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Narrated Abu Musa Al-Ashari:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I performed ablution in my house and then went out and said, &#8220;Today I shall stick to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and stay with him all this day of mine (in his service).&#8221; I went to the Mosque and asked about the Prophet . They said, &#8220;He had gone in this direction.&#8221; So I followed his way, asking about him till he entered a place called Bir Aris. I sat at its gate that was made of date-palm leaves till the Prophet finished answering the call of nature and performed ablution. Then I went up to him to see him sitting at the well of Aris at the middle of its edge with his legs uncovered, hanging in the well. I greeted him and went back and sat at the gate. I said, &#8220;Today I will be the gatekeeper of the Prophet.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr came and pushed the gate. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Bakr.&#8221; I told him to wait, went in and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Abu Bakr asks for permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; So I went out and said to Abu Bakr, &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise&#8221; Abu Bakr entered and sat on the right side of Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well and hung his legs n the well as the Prophet did and uncovered his legs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I then returned and sat (at the gate). I had left my brother performing ablution and he intended to follow me. So I said (to myself). &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so (i.e. my brother) He will bring him here.&#8221; Suddenly somebody moved the door. I asked, &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He said, &#8220;&#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab.&#8221; I asked him to wait, went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, greeted him and said, &#8216;Umar bin Al-Khattab asks the permission to enter.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings that he will be in Paradise.&#8221; I went to &#8220;Umar and said &#8220;Come in, and Allah&#8217;s Apostle, gives you the glad tidings that you will be in Paradise.&#8221; So he entered and sat beside Allah&#8217;s Apostle on the built edge of the well on the left side and hung his legs in the well.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I returned and sat (at the gate) and said, (to myself), &#8220;If Allah wants good for so-and-so, He will bring him here.&#8221; Somebody came and moved the door. I asked &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Uthman bin Affan.&#8221; I asked him to wait and went to the Prophet and informed him. He said, &#8220;Admit him, and give him the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall him.&#8221; So I went up to him and said to him, &#8220;Come in; Allah&#8217;s Apostle gives you the glad tidings of entering Paradise after a calamity that will befall you. &#8220;Uthman then came in and found that the built edge of the well was occupied, so he sat opposite to the Prophet on the other side. Said bin Al-Musaiyab said, &#8220;I interpret this (narration) in terms of their graves.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Narrated <strong>Abu Huraira</strong>, that he heard Rasulullah sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah willed to test three who were a leper, a blind man and a bald-headed man.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he sent them an angel who came to the leper and said, &#8220;What thing do you like most?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Good color and good skin, for the people have a strong aversion to me.&#8221; The angel touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given a good color and beautiful skin. The angel asked him, &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Camels (or cows).&#8221; (The narrator is in doubt, for either the leper or the bald-headed man demanded camels and the other demanded cows.) So he (i.e. the leper) was given a pregnant she-camel, and the angel said (to him), &#8220;May Allah bless you in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, &#8220;What thing do you like most?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease, for the people feel repulsion for me.&#8221; The angel touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given good hair. The angel asked (him), &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Cows.&#8221; The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, &#8220;May Allah bless you in it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angel went to the blind man and asked, &#8216;What thing do you like best?&#8217; He said, &#8220;(I like) that Allah may restore my eye-sight to me so that I may see the people.&#8221; The angel touched his eyes and Allah gave him back his eye-sight. The angel asked him, &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Sheep.&#8221; The angel gave him a pregnant sheep.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and multiplied and brought forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels filling a valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of sheep filling a valley.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper, went to the leper and said, &#8220;I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on a journey. So none will satisfy my need except Allah and then you. In the Name of Him Who has given you such nice color and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give me a camel so that I may reach my destination.&#8221; The man replied, &#8220;I have many obligations (so I cannot give you).&#8221; The angel said, &#8220;I think I know you; were you not a leper to whom the people had a strong aversion? Weren&#8217;t you a poor man, and then Allah gave you (all this property)?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;(This is all wrong), I got this property through inheritance from my fore-fathers.&#8221; The angel said, &#8220;If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you as you were before.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said, &#8220;If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you as you were before.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to the blind man and said, &#8220;I am a poor man and a traveler, whose means of livelihood have been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help me except Allah, and after Him, you yourself. I ask you in the Name of Him Who has given you back your eye-sight to give me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my journey.&#8221; The man said, &#8220;No doubt, I was blind and Allah gave me back my eye-sight; I was poor and Allah made me rich; so take anything you wish from my property. By Allah, I will not stop you for taking anything (you need) of my property which you may take for Allah&#8217;s sake.&#8221; The angel replied, &#8220;Keep your property with you. You (i.e., the three men) have been tested and Allah is pleased with you and is angry with your two companions.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Anas radhiallahu `anhu:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My uncle Anas bin An-Nadr was absent from the battle of Badr. He said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! I was absent from the first battle you fought against the pagans. (By Allah) if Allah gives me a chance to fight the pagans, no doubt Allah will see how (bravely) I will fight.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the day of Uhud, when the Muslims turned their backs and fled, he said, &#8220;O Allah! I apologise to You for what these (i.e., his companions) have done, and I denounce what these (i.e., the pagans) have done.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he advanced and Sa`d bin Mu`adh met him. He said, &#8220;O Sa&#8217;d bin Mu`adh! By the Lord of An-Nadhr, Paradise! I am smelling its aroma coming from before (the mountain of) Uhud.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Later on, Sa`d said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! I cannot achieve or do what he (i.e., Anas bin An-Nadhr) did. <strong>We found more than eighty wounds by swords and arrows on his body. We found him dead and his body was mutilated so badly that none except his sister could recognize him by his fingers</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We used to think that the following verse was revealed concerning him and other men of his sort: &#8220;Among the believers are men who have been true to their covenant with Allah.&#8221; [Surah Al-Ahzab 33:23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~ <strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Nararted Abu Jamra: Ibn `Abbas radhiallahu `anhu said to us, &#8220;Shall I tell you the story of Abu Dharr&#8217;s conversion to Islam?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8220;Abu Dharr said: I was a man from the tribe of Ghifar. We heard that a man had appeared in Makkah claiming to be a Prophet. I said to my brother, &#8216;Go talk to that man and talk to him and bring me his news.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He set out, met him and returned. I asked him, &#8216;What is the news with you?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8216;By Allah, I saw a man enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him, &#8216;You have not satisfied me with this information.&#8217; So, I took a a waterskin and a stick and proceeded towards Makkah. Neither did I know him (i.e. the Prophet ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. I kept on drinking zam zam water and staying in the Mosque.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then `Ali radhiallahu `anhu passed by me and said, &#8216;It seems you are a stranger?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did he ask me anything, nor did I tell him anything. The next morning, I went to the Mosque to ask about the Prophet but no-one told me anything about him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali passed by me again and asked, &#8216;Hasn&#8217;t the man recognized his dwelling place yet?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Come along with me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked me, &#8216;What is your business? What has brought you to this town?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him, &#8216;If you keep my secret, I will tell you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said, &#8216;I will do.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said to him, &#8216;We have heard that a person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I thought of meeting him personally.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali said (to Abu Dharr), &#8216;You have reached your goal; I am going to him just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a warning), and you should go away then.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Ali proceeded and I accompanied him till he entered a place, and I entered with him to the Prophet sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam to whom I said, &#8216;Present (the principles of) Islam to me.&#8217; When he did, I embraced Islam immediately.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said to me, &#8216;O Abu Dharr! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your town; and when you hear of our victory, return to us. &#8216;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said, &#8216;By Him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will announce my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels).&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dharr went to the Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, &#8216;O folk of Quraish! I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I (also) testify that Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, &#8216;Get at this Sabi (i.e. Muslim)!&#8217; They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al-`Abbas saw me and threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and said, &#8216;Woe to you! You want to kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your communications are through the territory of Ghifar?&#8217; They therefore left me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The next morning, I returned (to the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, &#8216;Get at this Sabi!&#8217; I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-`Abbas found me and threw himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day before.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, that was the conversion of Abu Dharr radhiallahu `anhu to Islam.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah radhiallahu `anhu has said that the Messenger of Allah sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam mentioned a man of the Bani Israel saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked another to lend him a thousand dinars. The lender asked him to bring witnesses but the borrower said, &#8220;Allah is sufficient as a witness.&#8221; The lender asked him to furnish a surety but the borrower again asserted, &#8220;Allah is sufficient as a surety.&#8221; The lender agreed, &#8220;You are correct,&#8221; and lent him money for a specified period.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The debtor went across the sea. When he had finished his work, he looked for a conveyance to take him back for the punctual repayment of his debt, but he did not find any conveyance. So he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it. He inserted in it the one thousand dinars and a letter to the lender and closed the hole tightly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He took the piece of wood to the sea and said, &#8220;O Allah! You know well that I took a loan of one thousand dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety from me but I told him that Allah&#8217;s surety was enough and he accepted Your Guarantee. He then demanded a witness and I told him that Allah was sufficient as a witness. No doubt I have tried much to find a conveyance so that I might pay back his money but could not find one, so I hand this money over to you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saying that, he threw the piece of wood into the sea till it went far out into it, and then he went away. Meanwhile he kept looking for a conveyance to take him to the lender&#8217;s place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day, the lender came out of his house to see whether a ship had arrived bringing his money, and all of a sudden, he saw a piece of wood in which was the money. He took it home to use as firewood. When he sawed it, he found his money and the letter inside it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shortly after that, the debtor came with a thousand dinars and said, &#8220;By Allah! I had been trying to get a boat so I could bring you your money but failed to get one before the one I have come by.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The lender said, &#8220;Allah has delivered on your behalf the money you sent in the piece of wood. So you may keep your thousand dinars and go, guided on the right path.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">~ <strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Bukhari </strong>recorded that Abu Hurayrah said, &#8220;A man came to the Prophet and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! Poverty has stuck me.&#8217; The Prophet sent a messenger to his wives (to bring something for that man to eat) but they said that they had nothing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger said, &#8216;Who will invite this person or entertain him as a guest tonight; may Allah grant His mercy to him who does so.&#8217; An Ansari man said, &#8216;I, O Allah&#8217;s Messenger!&#8217; So he took him to his wife and said to her, &#8216;Entertain the guest of Allah&#8217;s Messenger generously.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah ! We have nothing except the meal for my children.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Let your children sleep if they ask for supper. Then turn off the lamp and we go to bed tonight while hungry.&#8217; She did what he asked her to do.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In the morning the Ansari went to Allah&#8217;s Messenger who said, &#8216;Allah wondered (favorably) or laughed at the action of so-and-so and his wife.&#8217; Then Allah revealed, &#8216;and they give them preference over themselves even though they were in need of that.&#8217; (Surah al-Hashr:9)&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhari recorded this Hadith in another part of his Sahih. Muslim, At-Tirmidhi, An-Nasa&#8217;i collected this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration for this Hadith, the Companion&#8217;s name was mentioned, it was <strong>Abu Talhah Al-Ansari</strong>, may Allah be pleased with him</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imams Bukhari and Muslim</strong> reported that the Messenger sallallahu `alayhi wa sallam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Three persons of a people before you, were on a journey when they were overtaken by a storm and therefore they took shelter in a cave. A rock slipped down from the mountain and blocked the exit from cave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them said: &#8220;The only way for deliverance left is to beseech Allah in the name of some virtuous deed.&#8221; Thereupon one of them supplicated, &#8220;O Lord, my parents were very old, I used to offer them their nightly drink of milk before my children and the other members of the family. One day I went astray far away in search of green trees and could return only after my parent had gone to sleep. When I had milked the animals and brought their nightly drink to them, They were fast asleep, but I did not like to disturb them, nor would give any part of the milk to my children and other members of the family till after my parents had their drink. Thus, with the vessel in hand, I awaited their awakening till the flush of dawn, While the children cried out of hunger at my feet. When they woke up, they had their drink. O Lord, if I did this thing seeking only your pleasure, then do relieve us of the distress wrought upon us by this rock.&#8221; Thereupon, The rock moved a little but that not enough to let them pass out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the second man supplicated: &#8220;O Lord, I had a cousin whom I loved her more passionately than any loves a woman. I tried to seduce her but she would have none of me, till in a season of great hardship due to famine, she approached me (for help) and I gave her one hundred and twenty Dinars on condition that she would have sexual intercourse with me. She agreed, and when we got together and I was just going to have intercourse with her, she pleaded: &#8216;Fear Allah, and do not break the seal unlawfully&#8217;; whereupon I moved away from her, despite the fact that I desired her most passionately; and I let her keep the money I had given her. O Lord, if I did this thing seeking only your pleasure, then do move the distress in which we find ourselves.&#8221; Again the rock moved a little but not enough to let them pass out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the third supplicated: &#8220;O Lord, I hired some laborers and paid them their dues, but one of them left leaving behind what was due to him. I invested it in business and the business prospered greatly.&#8221; After a time the laborer came Back and said: &#8216;O servant of Allah, hand over to me my wages.&#8217; I said to him: &#8216;All that you see is yours &#8211; camels, cattle, goats and slaves.&#8217; He said: &#8216;Don&#8217;t play joke with me, O servant of Allah.&#8217; I assured him: &#8216;I am mot joking.&#8217; So he took all of it sparing nothing. O Lord, If I did this seeking only for your pleasure, do relieve us of our distress.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The rock then moved away, and all the three came out of the cave safe and sound.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> Volume 4, Book 55, Number 583: </em></p>
<p>Narrated Ibn Abbas:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of Ishmael. She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah. Abraham brought her and her son Ishmael while she was suckling him, to a place near the Ka&#8217;ba under a tree on the spot of Zam-zam, at the highest place in the mosque. During those days there was nobody in Mecca, nor was there any water So he made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. Ishmael&#8217;s mother followed him saying, &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;">O Abraham! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?</span></em>&#8221; She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her Then she asked him, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Has Allah ordered you to do so?&#8221;</span></em> He said, <span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</em> </span>She said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then He will not neglect us,&#8221;</span></em> and returned while Abraham proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniya where they could not see him, he faced the Ka&#8217;ba, and raising both hands, invoked Allah saying the following prayers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring dwell in a valley without cultivation, by Your Sacred House (Kaba at Mecca) in order, O our Lord, that they may offer prayer perfectly. So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (O Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks.&#8217;</span> </em>(14.37) Ishmael&#8217;s mother went on suckling Ishmael and drinking from the water (she had).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him (i.e. Ishmael) tossing in agony; She left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then she descended from Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached the Marwa mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between Safa and Marwa) seven times.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet said, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This is the source of the tradition of the walking of people between them (i.e. Safa and Marwa).&#8221; </span></em>When she reached the Marwa (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said, &#8216;O, (whoever you may be)! You have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?&#8221; And behold! She saw an angel at the place of Zam-zam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her hand in this way, and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet added, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;May Allah bestow Mercy on Ishmael&#8217;s mother! Had she let the Zam-zam (flow without trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zam-zam would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet further added, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, &#8216;Don&#8217;t be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and his father, and Allah never neglects His people.&#8217;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The House (i.e. Kaba) at that time was on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way of Kada&#8217;. They landed in the lower part of Mecca where they saw a bird that had the habit of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, &#8216;This bird must be flying around water, though we know that there is no water in this valley.&#8217; They sent one or two messengers who discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came (towards the water).&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was sitting near the water. They asked her, &#8216;Do you allow us to stay with you?&#8221; She replied, &#8216;Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.&#8217; They agreed to that.&#8221; The Prophet further said, &#8220;Ishmael&#8217;s mother was pleased with the whole situation as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became permanent residents there. The child (i.e. Ishmael) grew up and learnt Arabic from them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After Ishmael&#8217;s mother had died, Abraham came after Ishmael&#8217;s marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find Ishmael there. When he asked Ishmael&#8217;s wife about him, she replied, &#8216;He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217; Then he asked her about their way of living and their condition, and she replied, &#8216;We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and destitution,&#8217; complaining to him. He said, &#8216;When your husband returns, convey my salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).&#8217; When Ishmael came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife, &#8216;Has anyone visited you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, an old man of so-and-so description came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living, and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty.&#8217; On that Ishmael said, &#8216;Did he advise you anything?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;It was my father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.&#8217; So, Ishmael divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished and called on them again but did not find Ishmael. So he came to Ishmael&#8217;s wife and asked her about Ishmael. She said, &#8216;He has gone in search of our livelihood.&#8217; Abraham asked her, &#8216;How are you getting on?&#8217; asking her about their sustenance and living. She replied, &#8216;We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).&#8217; Then she thanked Allah&#8217; Abraham said, &#8216;What kind of food do you eat?&#8217; She said. &#8216;Meat.&#8217; He said, &#8216;What do you drink?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Water.&#8221; He said, &#8220;O Allah! Bless their meat and water.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;At that time they did not have grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Mecca.&#8221; The Prophet added,&#8221; Then Abraham said Ishmael&#8217;s wife, &#8220;When your husband comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his gate.&#8217; When Ishmael came back, he asked his wife, &#8216;Did anyone call on you?&#8217; She replied, &#8216;Yes, a good-looking old man came to me,&#8217; so she praised him and added. &#8216;He asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that we were in a good condition.&#8217; Ishmael asked her, &#8216;Did he give you any piece of advice?&#8217; She said, &#8216;Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should keep firm the threshold of your gate.&#8217; On that Ishmael said, &#8216;It was my father, and you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Abraham stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them afterwards. He saw Ishmael under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows. When he saw Abraham, he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Abraham said, &#8216;O Ishmael! Allah has given me an order.&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;Do what your Lord has ordered you to do.&#8217; Abraham asked, &#8216;Will you help me?&#8217; Ishmael said, &#8216;I will help you.&#8217; Abraham said, Allah has ordered me to build a house here,&#8217; pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.&#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka&#8217;ba). Ishmael brought the stones and Abraham was building, and when the walls became high, Ishmael brought this stone and put it for Abraham who stood over it and carried on building, while Ishmael was handing him the stones, and both of them were saying, &#8216;O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&#8217; The Prophet added, <em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Then both of them went on building and going round the Ka&#8217;ba saying: O our Lord ! Accept (this service) from us, Verily, You are the All-Hearing, the All-Knowing.&#8221;</span></em> (2.127)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Saheeh al Bukhaaree</strong> : Volume 5, Book 59, Number 702</p>
<p>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah ibn Kab bin Malik:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Who, from among Kab&#8217;s sons, was the guide of Kab when he became blind: I heard Kab bin Malik narrating the <strong>story of (the Ghazwa of) Tabuk</strong> in which he failed to take part.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab said, &#8220;I did not remain behind Allah&#8217;s Apostle in any Ghazwa that he fought except the Ghazwa of Tabuk, and I failed to take part in the Ghazwa of Badr, but Allah did not admonish anyone who had not participated in it, for in fact, Allah&#8217;s Apostle had gone out in search of the caravan of Quraish till Allah made them (i.e. the Muslims) and their enemy meet without any appointment. I witnessed the night of Al-&#8216;Aqaba (pledge) with Allah&#8217;s Apostle when we pledged for Islam, and I would not exchange it for the Badr battle although the Badr battle is more popular amongst the people than it (i.e. Al-&#8216;Aqaba pledge). As for my news (in this battle of Tabuk), I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind the Prophet in that Ghazwa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, never had I two she-camels before, but I had then at the time of this Ghazwa. Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle wanted to make a Ghazwa, he used to hide his intention by apparently referring to different Ghazwa till it was the time of that Ghazwa (of Tabuk) which Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought in severe heat, facing, a long journey, desert, and the great number of enemy. So the Prophet announced to the Muslims clearly (their destination) so that they might get prepared for their Ghazwa. So he informed them clearly of the destination he was going to. Allah&#8217;s Apostle was accompanied by a large number of Muslims who could not be listed in a book namely, a register.&#8221; Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;Any man who intended to be absent would think that the matter would remain hidden unless Allah revealed it through Divine Revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah&#8217;s Apostle fought that Ghazwa at the time when the fruits had ripened and the shade looked pleasant. Allah&#8217;s Apostle and his companions prepared for the battle and I started to go out in order to get myself ready along with them, but I returned without doing anything. I would say to myself, &#8216;I can do that.&#8217; So I kept on delaying it every now and then till the people got ready and Allah&#8217;s Apostle and the Muslims along with him departed, and I had not prepared anything for my departure, and I said, I will prepare myself (for departure) one or two days after him, and then join them.&#8217; In the morning following their departure, I went out to get myself ready but returned having done nothing. Then again in the next morning, I went out to get ready but returned without doing anything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Such was the case with me till they hurried away and the battle was missed (by me). Even then I intended to depart to take them over. I wish I had done so! But it was not in my luck. So, after the departure of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, whenever I went out and walked amongst the people (i.e, the remaining persons), it grieved me that I could see none around me, but one accused of hypocrisy or one of those weak men whom Allah had excused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle did not remember me till he reached Tabuk. So while he was sitting amongst the people in Tabuk, he said, &#8216;What did Ka&#8217;b do?&#8217; A man from Banu Salama said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! He has been stopped by his two Burdas (i.e. garments) and his looking at his own flanks with pride.&#8217; Then Mu&#8217;adh bin Jabal said, &#8216;What a bad thing you have said! By Allah! O Allahs Apostle! We know nothing about him but good.&#8217; Allah&#8217;s Apostle kept silent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab bin Malik added, &#8220;When I heard that he (i.e. the Prophet ) was on his way back to Medina. I got dipped in my concern, and began to think of false excuses, saying to myself, &#8216;How can I avoid his anger tomorrow?&#8217; And I took the advice of wise member of my family in this matter. When it was said that Allah&#8217;s Apostle, had come near all the evil false excuses abandoned from my mind and I knew well that I could never come out of this problem by forging a false statement. Then I decided firmly to speak the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allah&#8217;s Apostle arrived in the morning, and whenever he returned from a journey., he used to visit the Mosque first of all and offer a two-Rak&#8217;at prayer therein and then sit for the people. So when he had done all that (this time), those who had failed to join the battle (of Tabuk) came and started offering (false) excuses and taking oaths before him. They were something over eighty men; Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted the excuses they had expressed, took their pledge of allegiance asked for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness for them, and left the secrets of their hearts for Allah to judge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I came to him, and when I greeted him, he smiled a smile of an angry person and then said, &#8216;Come on.&#8217; So I came walking till I sat before him. He said to me, &#8216;What stopped you from joining us. Had you not purchased an animal for carrying you?&#8217; I answered, &#8220;Yes, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! But by Allah, if I were sitting before any person from among the people of the world other than you, I would have avoided his anger with an excuse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, I have been bestowed with the power of speaking fluently and eloquently, but by Allah, I knew well that if today I tell you a lie to seek your favour, Allah would surely make you angry with me in the near future, but if I tell you the truth, though you will get angry because of it, I hope for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness. Really, by Allah, there was no excuse for me. By Allah, I had never been stronger or wealthier than I was when I remained behind you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;As regards this man, he has surely told the truth. So get up till Allah decides your case.&#8217; I got up, and many men of Banu Salama followed me and said to me. &#8216;By Allah, we never witnessed you doing any sin before this. Surely, you failed to offer excuse to Allah&#8217;s Apostle as the others who did not join him, have offered. The prayer of Allah&#8217;s Apostle to Allah to forgive you would have been sufficient for you.&#8217; By Allah, they continued blaming me so much that I intended to return (to the Prophet) and accuse myself of having told a lie, but I said to them, &#8216;Is there anybody else who has met the same fate as I have?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;Yes, there are two men who have said the same thing as you have, and to both of them was given the same order as given to you.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Who are they?&#8217; They replied, Murara bin Ar-Rabi Al-Amri and Hilal bin Umaiya Al-Waqifi.&#8217; By that they mentioned to me two pious men who had attended the Ghazwa (Battle) of Badr, and in whom there was an example for me. So I did not change my mind when they mentioned them to me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Apostle forbade all the Muslims to talk to us, the three aforesaid persons out of all those who had remained behind in that Ghazwa. So we kept away from the people and they changed their attitude towards us till the very land (where I lived) appeared strange to me as if I did not know it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We remained in that condition for fifty nights. As regards my two fellows, they remained in their houses and kept on weeping, but I was the youngest of them and the firmest of them, so I used to go out and witness the prayers along with the Muslims and roam about in the markets, but none would talk to me, and I would come to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and greet him while he was sitting In his gathering after the prayer, and I would wonder whether the Prophet did move his lips in return to my greetings or not. Then I would offer my prayer near to him and look at him stealthily. When I was busy with my prayer, he would turn his face towards me, but when I turned my face to him, he would turn his face away from me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When this harsh attitude of the people lasted long, I walked till I scaled the wall of the garden of Abu Qatada who was my cousin and dearest person to me, and I offered my greetings to him. By Allah, he did not return my greetings. I said, &#8216;O Abu Qatada! I beseech you by Allah! Do you know that I love Allah and His Apostle?&#8217; He kept quiet. I asked him again, beseeching him by Allah, but he remained silent. Then I asked him again in the Name of Allah. He said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know it better.&#8217; Thereupon my eyes flowed with tears and I returned and jumped over the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ka&#8217;b added, &#8220;While I was walking in the market of Medina, suddenly I saw a Nabati (i.e. a Christian farmer) from the Nabatis of Sham who came to sell his grains in Medina, saying, &#8216;Who will lead me to Kab bin Malik?&#8217; The people began to point (me) out for him till he came to me and handed me a letter from the king of Ghassan in which the following was written:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;To proceed, I have been informed that your friend (i.e. the Prophet ) has treated you harshly. Anyhow, Allah does not let you live at a place where you feel inferior and your right is lost. So join us, and we will console you.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I read it, I said to myself, &#8216;This is also a sort of a test.&#8217; Then I took the letter to the oven and made a fire therein by burning it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When fourty out of the fifty nights elapsed, behold ! There came to me the messenger of Allah&#8217;s Apostle and said, &#8216;Allah&#8217;s Apostle orders you to keep away from your wife,&#8217; I said, &#8216;Should I divorce her; or else! what should I do?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, only keep aloof from her and do not cohabit her.&#8217; The Prophet sent the same message to my two fellows. Then I said to my wife. &#8216;Go to your parents and remain with them till Allah gives His Verdict in this matter.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab added, &#8220;The wife of Hilal bin Umaiya came to Apostle and said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Hilal bin Umaiya is a helpless old man who has no servant to attend on him. Do you dislike that I should serve him? &#8216; He said, &#8216;No (you can serve him) but he should not come near you.&#8217; She said, &#8216;By Allah, he has no desire for anything. By, Allah, he has never ceased weeping till his case began till this day of his.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On that, some of my family members said to me, &#8216;Will you also ask Allah&#8217;s Apostle to permit your wife (to serve you) as he has permitted the wife of Hilal bin Umaiya to serve him?&#8217; I said, &#8216;By Allah, I will not ask the permission of Allah&#8217;s Apostle regarding her, for I do not know What Allah&#8217;s Apostle would say if I asked him to permit her (to serve me) while I am a young man.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then I remained in that state for ten more nights after that till the period of fifty nights was completed starting from the time when Allah&#8217;s Apostle prohibited the people from talking to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I had offered the Fajr prayer on the 50th morning on the roof of one of our houses and while I was sitting in the condition which Allah described (in the Qur&#8217;an) i.e. my very soul seemed straitened to me and even the earth seemed narrow to me for all its spaciousness, there I heard the voice of one who had ascended the mountain of Sala&#8217; calling with his loudest voice, &#8216;O Kab bin Malik! Be happy (by receiving good tidings).&#8217; I fell down in prostration before Allah, realizing that relief has come. Allah&#8217;s Apostle had announced the acceptance of our repentance by Allah when he had offered the Fajr prayer. The people then went out to congratulate us. Some bringers of good tidings went out to my two fellows, and a horseman came to me in haste, and a man of Banu Aslam came running and ascended the mountain and his voice was swifter than the horse. When he (i.e. the man) whose voice I had heard, came to me conveying the good tidings, I took off my garments and dressed him with them; and by Allah, I owned no other garments than them on that day. Then I borrowed two garments and wore them and went to Allah&#8217;s Apostle.<br />
The people started receiving me in batches, congratulating me on Allah&#8217;s Acceptance of my repentance, saying, &#8216;We congratulate you on Allah&#8217;s Acceptance of your repentance.&#8221; Kab further said, &#8220;When I entered the Mosque. I saw Allah&#8217;s Apostle sitting with the people around him. Talha bin Ubaidullah swiftly came to me, shook hands with me and congratulated me. By Allah, none of the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants) got up for me except him (i.e. Talha), and I will never forget this for Talha.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Kab added, &#8220;When I greeted Allah&#8217;s Apostle he, his face being bright with joy, said &#8220;Be happy with the best day that you have got ever since your mother delivered you.&#8221; Kab added, &#8220;I said to the Prophet &#8216;Is this forgiveness from you or from Allah?&#8217; He said, &#8216;No, it is from Allah.&#8217; Whenever Allah&#8217;s Apostle became happy, his face would shine as if it were a piece of moon, and we all knew that characteristic of him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I sat before him, I said, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Because of the acceptance of my repentance I will give up all my wealth as alms for the Sake of Allah and His Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8216;Keep some of your wealth, as it will be better for you.&#8217; I said, &#8216;So I will keep my share from Khaibar with me,&#8217; and added, &#8216;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Allah has saved me for telling the truth; so it is a part of my repentance not to tell but the truth as long as I am alive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, I do not know anyone of the Muslims whom Allah has helped fortelling the truth more than me. Since I have mentioned that truth to Allah&#8217;s Apostle till today, I have never intended to tell a lie. I hope that Allah will also save me (from telling lies) the rest of my life. So Allah revealed to His Apostle the Verse: &#8220;Verily, Allah has forgiven the Prophet, the Muhajirin (i.e. Emigrants (up to His Saying) And be with those who are true (in word and deed).&#8221; (9.117-119)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Allah, Allah has never bestowed upon me, apart from His guiding me to Islam, a Greater blessing than the fact that I did not tell a lie to Allah&#8217;s Apostle which would have caused me to perish as those who have told a lie perished, for Allah described those who told lies with the worst description He ever attributed to anybody else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah said:&#8211; &#8220;They (i.e. the hypocrites) will swear by Allah to you when you return to them (up to His Saying) Certainly Allah is not pleased with the rebellious people&#8211;&#8221; (9.95-96) Kab added, &#8220;We, the three persons, differed altogether from those whose excuses Allah&#8217;s Apostle accepted when they swore to him. He took their pledge of allegiance and asked Allah to forgive them, but Allah&#8217;s Apostle left our case pending till Allah gave His Judgment about it. As for that Allah said):&#8211; And to the three (He did forgive also) who remained behind.&#8221; (9.118) What Allah said (in this Verse) does not indicate our failure to take part in the Ghazwa, but it refers to the deferment of making a decision by the Prophet about our case in contrast to the case of those who had taken an oath before him and he excused them by accepting their excuses.</p>
