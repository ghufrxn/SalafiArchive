<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Dharr (radiAllahu anhu), that the Prophet (sallAllahu alayhi wasallam) said &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Whoever says ten times immediately after finishing the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong><a href="http://wp.me/p1FIuh-ck" target="_blank"><span style="color:#000000;">Fajr (Dawn) Payer</span></a>,</strong></span> before moving from his place or talking to anyone,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;laa ilaaha illallaahu wahdahu laa shareeka lahu, lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu yuhyee wa yumeetu wa huwa alaa kulli shay’in qadeer &#8211; [ none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah alone having no partner, sovereignty is His and all praise is for Him and He brings life and He causes death and He has full power over everything,]”</span></p>

(At Tirmidhi no.3484 [5/515])</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhi commented on this hadeeth saying, &#8220;This is a hasan, saheeh hadeeth (i.e a good and authentic hadeeth)&#8221;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise it is an act of Sunnah to say dhikr ten times straight after Magrib salah too, according to a hadith related by Imaam Ahmad Hanbal (rahimahullah) on the authority of Umm Salamah (radiAllahu anha), hadith number 26430. Also stated in Sahih Ibn Hibban no. 2023.</p>

&lt;p&gt;&#8220;No Salat is more burdensome to the hypocrites than the Fajr (dawn) prayer and the `Isha&#8217; (night) prayer; and if they knew their merits, they would come to them even if they had to crawl to do so.&#8221; [Al-Bukhari &amp;amp; Muslim]&lt;/p&gt;
