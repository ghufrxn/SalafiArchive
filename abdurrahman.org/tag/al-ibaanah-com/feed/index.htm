<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Rule:</strong> You must know that the disbelievers whom the Messenger of Allaah fought against agreed that Allaah was the Creator and the Administrator. But this (belief) did not cause them to enter into the fold of Islaam. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ مَن يَرْزُقُكُم مِّنَ السَّمَاءِ وَالْأَرْضِ أَمَّن يَمْلِكُ السَّمْعَ وَالْأَبْصَارَ وَمَن يُخْرِجُ الْحَيَّ مِنَ الْمَيِّتِ وَيُخْرِجُ الْمَيِّتَ مِنَ الْحَيِّ وَمَن يُدَبِّرُ الْأَمْرَ ۚ فَسَيَقُولُونَ اللَّهُ ۚ فَقُلْ أَفَلَا تَتَّقُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Say: ‘Who provides for you from the sky and the earth, or who owns the hearing and the sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who administers the affairs?’ They will surely say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘Will you then not be dutiful to Him?’”</span> [Surah Yoonus: 31]</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Language:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em>Muqirroon</em> </strong>(agreed) means they acknowledged; <em><strong>Al-Mudabbir</strong> </em>(Administrator) The One who disposes of all affairs; <em><strong>tattaqoon</strong> </em>(dutiful) means putting a shield and a barrier between yourselves and what you fear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Explanation</strong><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of these rules is: Knowing that the polytheists during the time of Allaah’s Messenger, from the disbelievers of Makkah and others, affirmed and acknowledged Allaah’s Lordship (<em>Ruboobiyyah</em>), which is to single Allaah out and make Him one with regard to His creating, administering and controlling of the universe. They did not ascribe partners to Him in these aspects. The proof for this is Allaah’s saying: <span style="color:#008000;">“Say: ‘Who provides for you from the sky and the earth, or who owns the hearing and the sight? And who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living? And who administers the affairs?’ They will surely say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘Will you then not be dutiful to Him?’”</span> [Surah Yoonus: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also His saying:</p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَئِن سَأَلْتَهُم مَّنْ خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ لَيَقُولُنَّ اللَّهُ</span></h2>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;">قُلِ الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ ۚ بَلْ أَكْثَرُهُمْ لَا يَعْلَمُونَ</span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And if you ask them: ‘Who created the heavens and the earth (?)’, they will certainly say: ‘Allaah.’ Say: ‘All praise be to Allaah.’ But most of them know not.”</span> [Surah Luqmaan: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>ayaat</em> that provide evidence for this are many. All of them make it clear that the polytheists acknowledged that Allaah alone was the only Creator, Provider and Administrator of all affairs. However, they ascribed and mixed partners with Him in worship, so this acknowledgement was of no benefit to them. And this did not cause them to enter into the fold of Islaam nor did it make their lives and wealth sacred (i.e. unlawful to be violated). Rather, the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) fought against them and made lawful (the taking of) their lives and their wealth because of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were <strong>not</strong> judged as being Muslims simply because they acknowledged and agreed to Allaah’s Lordship. Rather he (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) made their abiding by T<em>awheed Al-Uloohiyyah</em> (i.e. that worship is only for Allaah), acknowledging it and acting upon it as a condition for judging them as Muslims, withholding from causing harm to them, and sparing their lives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Summary<span style="color:#993300;">:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The polytheists during the time of Allaah’s Messenger used to affirm and acknowledge Allaah’s Lordship (i.e. that He was the sole Creator and Administrator)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Acknowledging that Allaah is the one and only Lord (i.e. <em>Ruboobiyyah</em>) is not sufficient to affirm that an individual be judged as a Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Examination</strong><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What was the stance the polytheists during the time of the Prophet took with regard to Allaah’s Lordship? Bring three ayaat that prove what you say.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. What was the stance Allaah’s Messenger took with regard to these polytheists during his time?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Is acknowledging that Allaah is the sole Creator and Administrator (<em>Ruboobiyyah</em>) enough to affirm that someone is Muslim? Provide evidence for your answer.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[6] Question</strong></span>:</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">How do we combine between the two ayahs:</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>وَمَن يَبْتَغِ غَيْرَ الْإِسْلَامِ دِينًا فَلَن يُقْبَلَ مِنْهُ وَهُوَ فِي الْآخِرَةِ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</strong></span></h3>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Whoever seeks other than Islaam as a Religion, it will never be accepted from him”</strong></span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan 3:85] and</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading" style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَالَّذِينَ هَادُوا وَالصَّابِئُونَ وَالنَّصَارَىٰ مَنْ آمَنَ بِاللَّهِ وَالْيَوْمِ الْآخِرِ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا فَلَا خَوْفٌ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا هُمْ يَحْزَنُونَ</strong></span></h3>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, those who have believed and those who were Jews, Sabians, and Christians who believed in Allaah and the Last Day and do righteous deeds – there is no fear upon them nor do they worry.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah 5:69]</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[6] Answer by Imam al-Albaani </strong>(<em>rahimahullaah</em>)<strong>:</strong></span></p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no contradiction between these two ayahs as the question suggests. And this is because the verse about Islaam (3:85) came after the Message of Islaam was conveyed to those people whom Allah described in the second ayah as: “<strong>There is no fear upon them nor do they worry</strong>.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah mentions amongst them the Sabians. When the word Sabian is mentioned what quickly comes to mind is a reference to those who worship the stars. However, in reality, this term applies to all people that fall into Shirk after having been from among the adherents of Tawheed. So the Sabians were once proponents of pure Monotheism, but then they were subjected to polytheism and worshipping of stars. So the ones mentioned in this verse refer to the believers amongst them, the adherents of Tawheed.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Before the Message of Islaam came, these people were like the Jews and Christians, whom were also mentioned in the same list as the Sabians. So this refers to those among them that were practicing their Religion at their time. They were from among the believers of whom: “There is no fear upon them nor do they worry.”</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">However, after Allaah sent Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) with the Religion of Islaam, the Message of Islaam was conveyed to these three types of people – the Jews, the Christians and the Sabians. And so nothing else but Islaam was accepted from them.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allaah’s statement: “<strong>Whoever seeks other than Islaam as a Religion</strong>” refers to after Islaam was conveyed to him upon the tongue of the Messenger (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) and after the Message of Islaam was passed on to him. So at that point, nothing other than Islaam was acceptable</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who died before the advent of the Messenger of Allaah (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) or those who are alive today on the face of the earth but yet the Message of Islaam has not reached them or the Message of Islaam has reached them but in a manner that is distorted from its true and original state – as I have mentioned in some occasions about the Qadiyanis, for example, who today have spread throughout Europe and America, claiming Islaam, however this Islaam, which they claim to be upon is not from Islaam at all, since they believe that prophets will come after the final Prophet, Muhammad (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) – then these people, among the Europeans and Americans that have been called to the Qadiyani form of Islam while the true Message of Islaam was not conveyed to them, they fall into two categories:</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The first category contains those who remained upon their prior (pure) Religion and held steadfast onto it. This is how the ayah: “there is no fear upon them nor do they worry” should be understood.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">The second category consists of those who deviated from this Religion – as is the case with many Muslims today – so the proof is established against them.</p>



<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those whom the Call to Islaam has not been conveyed to at all – whether after Islaam came or before it, such people will get a special treatment in the Hereafter. And it is by Allaah sending them a messenger that will test them, just as the people were tested in the worldly life. So whoever answers the call of this messenger on the Day of Judgement and obeys him will enter Paradise. And whoever disobeys him will enter the Hellfire.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of a treatise entitled “<strong>Kayfa Yajibu ‘alaynaa an Nufassir al-Qur’aan-al-Kareem</strong>” (How are we Obligated to Interpret the Noble Qur’aan).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The source used for the translation was the Al-Maktabah al-Islaamiyyah first edition published in 1421H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The foundation of this treatise is questions that were posed to the Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, to which he responded in recorded format. These questions and answers were then transcribed, printed on paper and presented to the Shaikh who read them and commented on them in his own handwriting. The publishing house printed and distributed the book after the death of Imaam Al- Albaanee due to the great benefit found in the work since the author discusses several rules and principles related to interpreting the meanings of the Qur’aan, which every Muslim should follow when trying to understand the Book of Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[2] Question: </b><span style="color:#993300;">Noble Shaikh, I try to read the Noble Qur’aan and I love the Book of Allaah greatly. However, the matter becomes difficult for me and I am not able to complete my recitation. What is the solution to this problem?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[2] Answer by Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The solution can be found in that which Allaah has instructed when He said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>فَإِذَا قَرَأْتَ الْقُرْآنَ فَاسْتَعِذْ بِاللَّهِ مِنَ الشَّيْطَانِ الرَّجِيمِ</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّهُ لَيْسَ لَهُ سُلْطَانٌ عَلَى الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَلَىٰ رَبِّهِمْ يَتَوَكَّلُونَ</strong></span></h3>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>إِنَّمَا سُلْطَانُهُ عَلَى الَّذِينَ يَتَوَلَّوْنَهُ وَالَّذِينَ هُم بِهِ مُشْرِكُونَ</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>“So when you recite the Qur’aan, seek refuge in Allaah from the outcast Devil. Verily, he has no power over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord (Allaah). His power is only over those who obey and follow him and those who associate partners in worship with Him (i.e. Allaah).”</b></span> [Surah An-Nahl: 16: 98-100]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has instructed us to seek refuge in Him from the outcast Devil before reciting the Qur’aan. This is so that Allaah can remove and distance this enemy from us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And you must also always reflect on the Qur’aan</strong></span>, since reflecting on it is one of the things that will cause you to be conscious about it and incite you towards the noble Qur’aan. All of your longing should not be geared towards just completing a surah or finishing up a juz and so on. Rather, your objective in reciting the Qur’aan should be to reflect and ponder upon the meaning of what you recite from the verses of Allaah. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would prolong his recitation during the Night Prayer, and he would not pass upon a verse related to Allaah’s Mercy except that he would stop and ask Allaah (for Mercy), nor would he pass upon a verse in which (Allaah’s) punishment was mentioned except that he would stop and seek refuge in Allaah (from that). All of this shows that he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would recite the Qur’aan whilst reflecting on it and having a conscious and attentive heart.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b style="color:#993300;">[</b><b style="color:#993300;">Text from Imam Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab’s &#8220;Four Rules Regarding Shirk&#8221;]</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know, may Allaah grant you the ability to obey Him, that the <em>Haneefiyyah</em>, the religion of Ibraaheem is that <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>you worship Allaah alone, making the Religion sincere for only Him</strong></span>, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</strong><br />
</span>[Surah Adh-Dhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you come to realize that Allaah created you in order to worship Him, then know that worship is not called worship unless it is accompanied by Tawheed, just as prayer is not called that unless it is accompanied by (ritual) purity. So if Shirk (mixing partners) enters into one’s worship, it ruins it, just like impurity when it enters into the (ritual) purity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when you come to realize that Shirk – when mixed into one’s worship – spoils it, invalidates one’s actions, and makes the person who possesses it into one who will reside eternally in the Hellfire, you will know that the most important thing that is binding upon you is to gain knowledge of that, so that perhaps Allaah may absolve you from this trap, which is ascribing partners to Allaah (i.e. Shirk) about which Allaah said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him in worship, but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This can be achieved by knowing <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/islamic-book-study/the-four-rules-regarding-shirk-al-qawaaid-ul-arbaah/"><strong>Four Rules</strong></a> that Allaah has mentioned in His Book.</p>

<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation from Dr. Muhammad Bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis&#8217; explanation of <em><a style="color:#993300;" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/21/explanation-of-four-rules-of-shirk-shaykh-muhammad-al-khumayyis/">Four Rules Regarding Shirk</a></em></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Language</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Haneefiyyah</em> comes from <em>Haneef</em>, which is someone that turns away from Shirk while being firmly established upon Tawheed; <em>ahbata</em> (invalidates) nullifies; <em>maa doona dhaalik</em> (what is less than that) i.e. what is less than Shirk such as sins and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, began by clarifying the foundation of <em>AlHaneefiyyah</em>, which is the upright religion of Ibraaheem. Its basis is found in what Allaah has stated, calling the people to follow Ibraaheem:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَنْ أَحْسَنُ دِينًا مِّمَّنْ أَسْلَمَ وَجْهَهُ لِلَّهِ وَهُوَ مُحْسِنٌ وَاتَّبَعَ مِلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face </strong>(i.e. himself)<strong> to Allaah, while being a good-doer, and follows the Religion of Ibraaheem as a Haneef </strong>(i.e. rejecting Shirk and affirming Tawheed)<strong>?”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">قُلْ إِنَّنِي هَدَانِي رَبِّي إِلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ دِينًا قِيَمًا مِّلَّةَ إِبْرَاهِيمَ حَنِيفًا ۚ وَمَا كَانَ مِنَ الْمُشْرِكِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say </strong>(O Muhammad)<strong>: ‘Truly my Lord has guided me to a Straight Path, and upright religion, the religion of Ibraaheem – Haneef – and he </strong>(i.e. Ibraaheem)<strong> was not from the polytheists.’”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 161]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So its foundation is: Singling Allaah out in the worship and sincerity that is due to Him, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَمَا خَلَقْتُ الْجِنَّ وَالْإِنسَ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُونِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me.”</strong></span><br />
[Surah AdhDhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah did not create mankind except for them to worship Him. And it is not truthful to call worship by this name unless Tawheed accompanies it, since one of the conditions for its validity is that it (i.e. worship) must be done sincerely for Him alone. Similarly, it is not truthful to call prayer by this name unless (ritual) purity accompanies it, since it is a condition for its existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if this is not so, then if a condition is absent this means that the thing that requires this condition will also be absent. Shirk entering and mixing into worship spoils and nullifies it, just as an impure occurrence (hadath) causes the (ritual) purity to be spoiled and nullified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when it becomes clear that Shirk spoils the worship once it mixes into it, causing its reward to be lost and it to return rejected to the one that performed it, as well as canceling out his deeds, as Allaah says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَلَقَدْ أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ وَإِلَى الَّذِينَ مِن قَبْلِكَ لَئِنْ أَشْرَكْتَ لَيَحْبَطَنَّ عَمَلُكَ وَلَتَكُونَنَّ مِنَ الْخَاسِرِينَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Had you committed Shirk, we would have surely cancelled out your deeds and you would have indeed been one of the losers”</strong></span> [Surah Az-Zumar: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and that the one who falls into this Shirk by committing it deserves eternity in the Hellfire, as Allaah says in His Book:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">وَالَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا أُولَٰئِكَ أَصْحَابُ النَّارِ خَالِدِينَ فِيهَا ۖ وَبِئْسَ الْمَصِيرُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And those who disbelieve and reject Our signs </strong>(i.e. verses)<strong>, they are the inhabitants of the Hellfire, wherein they will reside forever – what an evil destination”</strong></span> [Surah At-Taghaabun: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then at this point it will become clear that the most important thing that is obligated on the servant is that he know how to single Allaah out solely for worship and how to avoid Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, perhaps he may be set free from this satanic trap, which the Devil has set up in order to mislead the people away from their Lord and into committing Shirk with Allaah. This is the sin that Allaah does not forgive, as He says:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;">إِنَّ اللَّهَ لَا يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاءُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him in worship </strong>(i.e. Shirk)<strong>, but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this cannot be accomplished unless one knows the following four rules, which Allaah has mentioned in His Book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Summary:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The foundation of the Religion of Ibraaheem is to make one’s worship sincerely for Allaah alone and not mix partners into His worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Shirk spoils one’s worship and causes a person’s good deeds to be invalidated. And the person that commits it will reside eternally in the Hellfire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The most important thing that the servant (of Allaah) is obligated to learn is knowledge of Tawheed so that he may act on it, and knowledge of Shirk so that he may avoid it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Examination:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. What is the foundation of the Religion of Ibraaheem and what is the proof for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Explain the effect that Shirk has on worship and what it resembles. Give an example for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. What is the most important thing the servant (of Allaah) is obligated to learn and know?</p>

<span style="color:#808080;"> Source: His editing of the book &#8220;Al-Ba&#8217;ith-ul-Hatheeth&#8221;</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> Produced By: Al-Ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was <strong>Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Shaakir</strong> bin Ahmad bin &#8216;Abdil-Qaadir. His lineage traces back to <span style="color:#993300;">Al-Husayn bin &#8216;Alee</span>, may Allaah be pleased with them both. He was born and died in Cairo, Egypt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His father, <strong>Shaikh Muhammad Shaakir</strong>, was among the men responsible for passing judgements (qadaa) and religious rulings (fatwa). He assumed the position of Chief Judge of Sudan in 1900. So while residing there, he enrolled his son, Ahmad, in the Ghawrdoon School. Then in the year 1904, Ahmad enrolled in the Institute of Alexandria (in Egypt) and then joined the Al-Azhar University, attaining the level of scholarly grade in 1917.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He then took on some judicial positions. Then he was appointed judge and head of the highest religious court, in which position he served until 1951, when he retired with a pension.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a strong love for the <strong>subject of Hadeeth</strong>, such that he took an interest in its books (i.e. collections of Hadeeth) since 1909. And that was under the direction and instruction of his father. He obtained ijaazahs (written approvals) on Hadeeth from &#8216;Abdullaah bin Idrees As-Sanoosee, the Scholar and Muhaddith of Morocco, and from Ahmad bin ash-Shams Ash-Shanqeetee. He also learned under Shaikh Taahir Al-Jazaa&#8217;iree Al-Atharee and other scholars, whose specialization was the Prophetic Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Ahmad took on the role of working on a number of these books of the Sunnah. Among these books was the <b>Musnad</b> of Imaam Ahmad, which he worked on, covering close to a third of it, but without completing it. Also, he worked on <b>Sunan At-Tirmidhee</b> of which two volumes got printed. He also worked on <b>Saheeh Ibn Hibbaan</b>, of which the first volume was printed, and he wrote a valuable introduction for it. He also edited the book <b>Ar-Risaalah</b> of Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, and the methodology he employed in verifying and checking it is considered an example to be followed. He also wrote an explanation of the book <b>&#8220;Ikhtisaar &#8216;Uloom Al-Hadeeth&#8221;</b> of Ibn Katheer, which is the present book. He also participated in the verification and checking (tahqeeq) of a number of books like <b>Sharh Sunan Abee Dawood</b>, <b>Kitaab Jamaa&#8217;ul-&#8216;Ilm</b> of Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, <b>Al-Muhallaa</b> of Ibn Hazm, <b>Tafseer At-Tabaree</b> and others. He also wrote an excellent explanation to the <b>Alfiyyah</b> of Imaam Suyootee concerning Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His brother, Mahmood, said: &#8220;As for the most important book he wrote, then it was <b>&#8220;Nidhaam At-Talaaq&#8221;</b>, which shows his Ijtihaad and his lack of fanaticism towards one particular madh-hab. In this book, he brings out the &#8220;Rules and Regulations of Divorce&#8221; from the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the explanations of the Sunnah concerning divorce. And there was great excitement amongst the scholars upon the appearance of this book.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh died in Egypt in the year 1958 (1377H). For further information on his life, his biography can be found in <i>Al-A&#8217;alam</i> (1/253) and <i>Mu&#8217;jam-ul-Mu&#8217;allifeen</i> (13/368).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>
<p><strong>His Name, Kunyah, Nickname and Lineage</strong></p>
</div>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was the noble Imaam, the Haafidh, the Critic, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Zayn-ud-Deen</strong></span> ‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin Ahmad bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan bin Al Hasan bin Mohammad bin Abil Barakaat Mas’ood As-Salaamee Al Baghdaadee (due to his place of birth), Al Hanbalee (due to his Madh-hab), Ad-Dimashqee (due to his place of residence and death).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Kunyah was <strong>Abul Faraj</strong>, and his nickname was Ibn Rajab, which was the nickname of his grandfather who was born in that month (of Rajab).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Birth and Upbringing</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in Baghdad in 736H and was raised by a knowledgeable family, firmly rooted in knowledge, nobility and righteousness. His father played the greatest role in directing him towards the beneficial knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Teachers</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He learned and took knowledge from the greatest scholars of the Ummah during his time. In Damascus, he studied under:</p>
<p>1. Ibnul Qayyim Al Jawziyyah,<br />
2. Zayn-ud-Deen Al ‘Iraaqee,<br />
3. Ibn An-Naqeeb,<br />
4. Mohammad bin Isma’eel Al Khabaaz,<br />
5. Dawood bin Ibraaheem Al ‘Ataar,<br />
6. Ibn Qaadee Al Jabal,<br />
7. Ahmad bin ‘Abdil Haadee Al Hanbalee.</p>
<p><strong>In Makkah, he heard from:</strong></p>
<p>8. Al Fakhr ‘Uthmaan bin Yoosuf An-Nuwayree.</p>
<p><strong>While in Jerusalem, he heard from:</strong></p>
<p>9. Al Haafidh Al ‘Alaa’ee.</p>
<p><strong>In Egypt, he heard from:</strong></p>
<p>10. Sadr-ud-Deen Abul Fath Al Maydoomee,<br />
11. Naasir-ud-Deen bin Al Mulook.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Educational Positions he was appointed to</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab devoted himself to knowledge and spent all his time in researching, writing, authoring, teaching, working in the field of knowledge and issuing legal rulings. He was given a teaching position in the Hanbalee School in 791H but then it was taken from him. During the lifetime of his father, he was appointed the Halaqah (study circle) on Tuesday in the Central Masjid of Banu Umayyah. This was after the death of Ibn Qaadee Al Jabal, may Allaah have mercy on him, in 771H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Students</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Students of knowledge turned to Al Haafidh Ibn Rajab (rahimahullaah) to learn under him, benefit from his knowledge and hear his narrations. This was since he was an Imaam in the Science of Hadeeth – both in reporting and investigating. The reason for this was because he spent such a large portion of his time engrossed in that subject that he wasn’t known except through the Hadeeth. There was no one found that was more proficient in it (during his time) besides him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the most famous of his students were</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Abul ‘Abbaas Ahmad bin Abee Bakr bin ‘Alee Al Hanbalee, known as Ibn Ar-Risaam [d. 884H],<br />
2. Abul Fadl Ahmad bin Nasr bin Ahmad, the Muftee of the lands of Egypt [d. 844H],<br />
3. Dawood bin Sulaymaan Al Mawsilee [d. 844H],<br />
4. ‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin Ahmad bin Mohammad Al Muqree,<br />
5. Zayn-ud-Deen ‘Abdur-Rahmaan bin Sulaymaan bin Abil Karam, well known as Abu Shi’ar,<br />
6. Abu Dharr Az-Zarkashee [d. 846H],<br />
7. The Judge ‘Alaa-ud-Deen Ibn Al-Lahaam Al Ba’alee [d. 803H],<br />
8. Ahmad bin Sayf-id-Deen Al Hamawee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Scholars’ Praise for Him </strong><em>[This section was added to the translation for additional benefit.]</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Qaadee Shuhbah said of him in his biography, as is stated in Al Jawhar-ul-Munaddad (pg. 48): <span style="color:#993300;">“He read and became proficient in the various fields of science. He engrossed himself with the issues of the (Hanbalee) Madh-hab until he mastered it. He devoted himself to the occupation of knowledge of the texts, defects and meanings of the Hadeeth. And he withdrew himself in seclusion in order to write.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hajr said of him in Inbaa-ul-Ghamr: <span style="color:#993300;">“He was highly proficient in the scientific disciplines of Hadeeth in terms of the names of reporters, their biographies, their paths of narration and awareness of their meanings.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem bin Mohammad Ibn Muflih said of him: <span style="color:#993300;">“He was the Shaykh, the great scholar, the Haafidh, the one who abstained from the worldly life. He was the Shaykh of the Hanbalee Madh-hab and he wrote many beneficial books.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Creed</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab (rahimahullaah) treaded the Manhaj of the Salaf with regard to the issues of Eemaan and acquiring knowledge. And he supported it and defended it from the false arguments of the opponents. His books are loaded with that. And he wrote some treatises specifically on this topic such as his book ‘Bayaan Fadlu‘Ilm-is-Salaf ‘alaal-Khalaf.’ However, there can be found traces of Sufism in his books, may Allaah protect him from inclining towards it’s dangerous paths, due to what Allaah has given him from vast knowledge of the Narrations and a clear Salafee Methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Madh-hab with regard to the Subsidiary Issues</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Fiqh, he (rahimahullaah) followed the Madh-hab of the venerable Imaam, Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy on him. He is counted as being one of the major scholars of the (Hanbalee) Madh-hab, and of those who were highly proficient in it. What provides evidence for this is his book: ‘Al Qawaa’id Al Kubraa fil-Furoo&#8217;’ for this is one of his most prominent works on the subject of Fiqh, which shows his vast knowledge on the intricate details of Fiqh issues. This is such that Al Haafidh Ibn Hajr said in his book Ad-Durar: “He did excellent work in it.” And Ibn Qaadee Shuhba and Ibn Muflih said: “It indicates his complete knowledge of the (Hanbalee) Madh-hab.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Kashf-udh-Dhunoon it states: “It is a book from the marvels of this time. And it is such that he sought to explain much in it. Some claim that he found the scattered principles of Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah and gathered them together, but that is not the case. Rather, he, may Allaah have mercy on him, was above that. This is what was stated.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al Haafidh Ibn Rajab, may Allaah have mercy on him, was deeply attached to the works of Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, for he would issue legal rulings according to them and would constantly reference his books. This is since he served as a student under Ibnul Qayyim Al Jawziyyah, the most outstanding student of Shaykh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah, may Allah have mercy on all of them. But in spite of this, he (rahimahullaah) wasn’t a blind follower or a fanatical adherent (to his teacher). Rather, he would review, authenticate, verify and follow the evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>His Written Works</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al Haafidh Ibn Rajab, may Allaah have mercy on him, was considered one of the most able and famous scholars in his time at writing. Thus, he has numerous and beneficial works on the subjects of Tafseer, Hadeeth, Fiqh, History and Raqaa’iq (Heart-Softening Material). Amongst his books are:<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><b>1315H–1389H: Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad Al-Qar’aawee</b></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#999999;">Author: Fawaaz bin ‘Alee Al-Madkhalee</span><br />
<span style="color:#999999;"> Source: His compilation “Tareeq-ul-Wusool ilaa Eedaah ath-Thalaathat-il-Usool. </span><span style="color:#999999;">Produced By:  <a href="https://abdurrahman.org/al-ibaanah-com/">Al-Ibaanah.com</a></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was <strong>Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad bin Hamad bin Muhammad Al-Qar’aawee</strong> [2] An-Najdee from the district of Qaseem in Najd. He played a great role in Calling to Allaah and spreading the authentic creed, particularly in the southern regions of Saudi Arabia, where this (Salafee) Da’wah thrived and prospered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, may Allaah have mercy on him, was born in Dhul-Hijjah of 1315H in the <strong>city of ‘Unayzah</strong>. His father passed away two months prior to his birth, so he was raised an orphan under the care and auspices of his mother and paternal uncle. He was brought up learning the basic elementary studies, uprightness, purification and memorization of the Qur’aan. During the first part of his life, he occupied himself with conducting business, but he changed to seeking knowledge. He traveled to India twice and then moved throughout the cities of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia seeking knowledge. So he traveled from Buraydah to Makkah and then to Madeenah, Riyadh, Ihsaa and Qatar. In fact, he even transcended beyond the Arabian Peninsula, visiting Iraq, Egypt and Syria.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterward, he commenced his Call to reformation, turning his attention to the southern region of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He settled in <strong>Saamitah</strong> and made it the center for his Da’wah. So he began calling the people to have Taqwaa of Allaah and to adhere to the beliefs of the pious predecessors (Salaf as-Saalih), with wisdom and fair admonition. Many students would gather around him, and so he would have a large following of people who came to him seeking knowledge. So he held gatherings, teaching them the Qur’aan, Tafseer, Tajweed, Tawheed, Hadeeth, Fiqh, Laws of Inheritance, and some of the sciences of the Arabic language. [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he focused on some of the neighboring towns of Saamitah and opened various educational institutes, appointing some of his main students as teachers in them – students the likes of <strong>Shaikh Haafidh Al-Hakamee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>)</strong>, about whom he said: “<span style="color:#008000;">He is one of my students, however he has surpassed me in knowledge by far</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would supply these schools with everything that students stood in need of, such as books, notepads and so on, purchasing that with his personal donations. He would also go out in person to visit the neighboring villages on certain days to the point that the people turned towards seeking knowledge under him. The Shaikh’s schools spread out from the district of Tuhaamah to the district of ‘Aseer. He opened many schools and institutes within these regions and appointed his major students to teach in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the main objectives of his Da’wah were to rectify the Creed in the people’s souls, to cultivate the true Islaam into the hearts of the Muslim youth and to guide them to the correct path. Prior to his arrival, the community was living upon ignorance and false notions. So the Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, produced students that were strong in their Creed to guide the people and call them to Allaah. So his efforts were crowned with success and many of the people began to perform the obligations at their proper times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the last part of his life, he was afflicted with a painful sickness, as a result of which he was forced to move to Riyadh where he was admitted into its central hospital. On Tuesday, the 8th of Jumaadaal-Oolaa, 1389H, the Shaikh passed away, having reached around 73 years of age – a lifetime which he spent serving knowledge, seeking it and spreading it to the people. He, may Allaah have mercy on him, is regarded today as one of the Imaams of the Islamic Da’wah of the 14th Hijree Century, particularly in the districts of Tuhaamah and ‘Aseer, which serve as the birthplace of his Da’wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For more about Imaam Al-Qar’aawee, refer to the book <strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Shaikh Haafidh bin Ahmad Al-Hakamee – His Life and Effects”</span> </strong>(pg. 31-35) written by our sheikh, Zayd bin Muhammad Al-Madkhalee, rahimahullaah, and the book <strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Al-Qar’aawee and his Da’wah in the South of the Kingdom”</span></strong> (pg. 12) by As-Sahlee.</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;" align="center">

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Footnotes:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>Translator’s Note: </b>This book was compiled by Fawaaz al-Madkhalee from classes Shaikh Zayd Al-Madkhalee (rahimahullaah) gave on the explanation of the famous book “The Three Fundamental Principles” in the First Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad Al-Qar’aawee Educational Seminar, which was held in 1415H in the district of Jaazaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <b>Translator’s Note: </b><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Al-Qar’aawee</strong> was the nickname of his grandfather, which was an ascription to a town he lived in called al-Qar’aa, within the confines of the city of Buraydah</span>. See <i>Fatawaa al-Jaliyyah</i>, footnote 3 on (pg. 5).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Al-Qar’aawee served as one of the carriers of the Sunnah and one of the callers to it during that time period. He studied under the noble scholars of his region of Najd and elsewhere. He longed to be one of the callers to Allaah and to be one of those who would revive His Religion, aiding the truth, and guiding the people from deviation to the truth and from Shirk to Tawheed. He yearned to be from those who would warn the people against the evils that are the cause for Allaah’s Anger. So Allaah willed for him to be from those who called to his Path in the southern region of Saudi Arabia. This was due the suggestion of his teacher at that time, the former Muftee of Saudi Arabia, <strong>Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem (<i>rahimahullaah</i>)</strong>, to go there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This happened after Shaikh Al-Qar’aawee confided in him a dream he had in which he saw himself go down to the southern regions of Saudi Arabia. So he set out for the south and ended up in Jaazaan in the year 1358H. Thereafter, he advanced to the city of Saamitah, and Allaah benefited the people of these lands through him. So the people of the south learned the Book and the Sunnah from him and they began to understand the Religion of Allaah at his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When he first came to Saamitah, he opened the first Madrasah Salafiyyah (Salafee School) there in Sha’baan 1358H, and began teaching in it shortly thereafter. The school was opened in the house of Shaikh Naasir bin Khaloofah, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>At the head of his students, were:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shaikh Haafidh bin Ahmad al-Hakamee,</li>
<li>Shaikh Ahmad bin Yahyaa An-Najmee,</li>
<li>Shaikh ‘Umar Jardee Al-Madkhalee,</li>
<li>Shaikh Muhammad bin Ahmad Al-Hakamee, and</li>
<li>other scholars, at whose hands Allaah raised the Sunnah and subdued innovation.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><b>1330H-1420H: Imaam ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin Baaz</b></p>
<p>Author : BinBaz.Org.sa<br />
Source: BinBaz.Org.Sa [Abridged and with Additions]<br />
Produced By: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Name and Lineage:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was the noble and exemplary scholar, ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan bin Muhammad bin ‘Abdillaah Aali Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him. Baaz was a family that had deep roots in knowledge. business, and agriculture. They were known for their virtues and character. Shaikh Sulaymaan bin Hamdaan, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in his book on the biographies of the Hanbalee scholars: “Their origin was in Madeenah, then one of their ancestors moved to Dur’eeyah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Birth and Early Youth:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in Riyadh, the capital city of Najd on the 12th of Dhul-Hijjah, 1330H. This is where he spent his childhood, adolescence and early adult years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz was raised in an environment engrossed in knowledge, since Riyadh at that time was filled with scholars and people of guidance. It was also a place of security and peace since King ‘Abdul-‘Azeez had re-conquered it and established justice there based on the laws of Islaam. This was after Riyadh had been a place of endless turmoil and instability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz first started by learning the Qur’aan as was the custom of the Salaf, who would memorize and master the Qur’aan before moving on to other subjects. So he memorized the entire Qur’aan by heart before reaching the age of puberty. He then went on to study at the hands of the scholars in his area.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also important to note that his mother, may Allaah have mercy on her, played a large role in his path towards knowledge, since she would be the one who would constantly encourage and incite him towards acquiring knowledge, as he stated towards the end of one of his lectures, “My journey with the writers”, in which he discussed some examples of his life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz had sight for the first part of his life. Then due to Allaah’s infinite wisdom, He willed that the Imaam’s sight weaken due to an eye disease in 1346H, which eventually lead to him completely losing his eyesight in 1350H when he was close to twenty years of age. However, this did not prevent him from his perseverance and diligence in seeking knowledge, which he continued to do and excel in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Remarkably, losing his eyesight was a means of benefit for Imaam Ibn Baaz, since he was able to achieve several advantages of which we will mention four, as an example and not to limit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1. Reward from Allaah:</b> Imaam Al-Bukhaaree reported in his Saheeh a hadeeth qudsee, in which Allaah said: <b>“If my servant is tested with losing his two beloved (eyes), I will substitute them with Paradise.”</b>[Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: no. 5653]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>2. Strong Memorization:</b> Imaam Ibn Baaz was the Haafidh (Memorizer) of this era when it came to Knowledge of Hadeeth. If you were to ask him on a hadeeth found in the Six Collections of Hadeeth or other collections such as the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad, you would find him well versed in the hadeeth’s chain of narration, textual wording, the scholars who spoke on it, its narrators and its explanation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>3. Lack of Interest in Worldly Splendors:</b> Imaam Ibn Baaz refrained from chasing after the pleasures of the worldly life, living an abstentious and humble lifestyle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>4. High Determination:</b> Losing sight, only made Imaam Ibn Baaz more determined and perseverant in his quest for seeking and acquiring knowledge, to the point that he became one of the senior scholars, known throughout the world. Allaah indeed replaced the light in his eyes with light in his heart, love for knowledge, and following of the Prophet’s Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Teachers:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After memorizing the Qur’aan, Imaam Ibn Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him, went on to study the other Islaamic sciences under many of the scholars of Riyadh, the most prominent of whom were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Lateef Aali Shaikh, the great-great grandson of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab,<br />
2. Shaikh Saalih bin ‘Abdil-‘Azeez Aali Shaikh, the great-great grandson of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab and the Chief Judge of Riyadh,<br />
3. Shaikh Sa’ad bin Hamad Al-‘Ateeq, Judge of Riyadh,<br />
4. Shaikh Hamad bin Faaris, Vice-Chancellor of the Treasury of Riyadh,<br />
5. Shaikh Sa’ad Waqqaas Al-Bukhaaree, from the scholars of Makkah whom he learned the science of Tajweed from in 1355H,<br />
6. Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh, former Chief Muftee of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He attended his study circles for about ten years, learning all of the Islamic sciences from him, from 1347H to 1357H, when his teacher nominated him to be a judge. May Allah have mercy on all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Educational Life:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Imaam Ibn Baaz was selected for being the Judge of the Kharj district, he accepted it unwillingly since he had no desire or love for position. But it was due to the encouragement of his teacher, Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh, and the order of King ‘Abdul-‘Azeez that he took up the position. So he went to ad-Dalam, the capital city of the Kharj district at that time, and the people greeted him warmly. As soon as he got out of the car that transported him there, he ascended the Central Mosque and prayed two rak’at, in accordance with the Sunnah. Then he rested for a while in the presence of the Ameer of ad-Dalam at that time, Naasir bin Sulaymaan al-Huqbaanee, may Allaah have mercy on him. Thereafter the people gathered around him and so he gave them a profound admonition. From the things he told them was that he had no desire to be the Judge of their district but that he was ordered and so he must obey the leader.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As soon as he commenced working at his position, Allaah brought much good through his hands and he judged the people with justice and kindness. He served in this position for a little over fourteen years. During this time, the Kharj district became a place of good and uprightness. Imaam Ibn Baaz would attribute this success to the good hearts of the people and their high esteem for virtue and justice. Because the courts were in ad-Dalam, he lived there in the Judge’s Residence given to him by Imaam ‘Abdullaah bin Faysal bin Turkee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz was well known throughout the Muslim world for his religious verdicts (<i>fataawaa</i>) and his beneficial books. He would preside over committees for educational seminars in Saudi Arabia, and give various lectures over the telephone to Muslims outside of the Kingdom. He would also answer the questions of the people over the radio and during the blessed times of Hajj and Ramadaan. And his words would appear in Muslim newspapers, magazines, and articles throughout the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Books and Treatises:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though the Imaam was pressed for time as a result of his duties and role in giving da’wah and educating, he still made time to write books and treatises that addressed important issues, which the Muslims were in need of knowledge of. Amongst his most famous works were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Obligation of Following the Sunnah<br />
2. The Ideological Attack<br />
3. The Life and Call of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab<br />
4. Three Treatises on the Prayer<br />
5. The Correct Belief and what Opposes It<br />
6. Important Lessons for the Muslim Ummah<br />
7. A Criticism of Arab Nationalism<br />
8. The Dangers of Tabarruj<br />
9. Two Essays on Fasting and Zakaat<br />
10. The Ruling on Pictures<br />
11. The Ruling on Celebrating the Prophet’s Birthday<br />
12. A Warning against Innovations</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there are many more books, which can be read and printed at the Imaam’s official web site binbaz.org.sa. This was in addition to his many fataawaa (religious verdicts) that were collected, compiled and published, which range in numerous volumes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Educational and Religious Positions:</b><br />
1. He served as a Judge in the Kharj District of Saudi Arabia for fourteen years from 1357H to 1371H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He taught at the Educational Institute of Riyadh in 1372H and in the College of Sharee’ah after its inception in 1373H, covering the subjects of Fiqh, Tawheed and Hadeeth. He remained in this teaching position for nine years until 1380H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. In 1381H, he was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the Islamic University of Madeenah, where he served until 1390H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. He was then appointed as the Chancellor of the Islamic University of Madeenah in 1390H, after its former Chancellor, Shaikh Muhammad bin Ibraaheem Aali Shaikh died in Ramadaan of 1389H. He remained in this position until 1395H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. In 10/14/1395H, the King ordered that Imaam Ibn Baaz be appointed as Head of the Council for Islamic Research, Verdicts, Da’wah and Guidance. He held this position until 1414H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. In 1/20/1414H, the King appointed Imaam Ibn Baaz as the Chief Muftee of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He held this position along with being the Head of the Council of Senior Scholars and the Head of the Committee for Islamic Research and Verdicts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>He also held the following positions:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Head of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Verdicts,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. President and Member of the Founding Committee for the Muslim World League,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. President of the higher World League Council,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. President of the World Supreme Council for Mosques,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. President of the Islamic Fiqh Assembly in Makkah, which is under the Muslim World League,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Member of the Higher Council of the Islamic University of Madeenah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Member of the Supreme Committee for Islamic Propagation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Students:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz, may Allaah have mercy on him, had numerous students that would attend his classes and study circles. The most famous and distinguished among them were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen, former member of the Council of Senior Scholars, may Allaah have mercy on him,<br />
2. ‘Abdullaah bin Hasan Al-Qu’ood, current member of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Fataawaa and of the Council of Senior Scholars,<br />
3. ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Ghudayyaan, current member of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Fataawaa and of the Council of Senior Scholars,<br />
4. ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad, former Chancellor and Vice-Chancellor of the Islamic University of Madeenah,<br />
5. Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, current member of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research and Fataawaa and of the Council of Senior Scholars,<br />
6. Rabee’ bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee,<br />
7. ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah Ar-Raajihee</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Physical Attributes and Appearance:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him, was of medium build, and neither tall nor short. He had a round face and was of a golden-brown color. He had a curved nose and a beard that was short on the cheeks but thick below the chin. His beard used to be black, but when too many white hairs started showing, he dyed it with henna. Indeed, his description resembled that of many of the scholars before him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He had a beautiful appearance. He would always try to wear white garments, and would love wide clothes, and thawbs that would reach the middle of his shin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Humility and Piety:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Imaam knew his own worth and so he would be very humble before Allaah. So he would treat the people in a kind manner, with gentleness and mercy. He would not transgress over anyone or show arrogance to anyone. He would not give a false impression of grandness nor would he get up to the leave when in the company of the poor and needy, or refrain from walking and intermingling with them. He would also never turn away from listening to the advice of those who were below him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also showed his humbleness was that he would answer the invitation of his students and close friends to come to their wedding gatherings. He would always arrive early and ask one of the brothers to recite some <i>ayaat</i> from the Qur’aan, which he would then go on to explain to everyone present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Death:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Baaz passed away on Thursday, the 27th of Muharram, 1420H (5/13/1999), due to heart failure. He was 89 years old at the time. Millions of people throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia gathered to witness his funeral prayer and he was buried in the ‘Adl Cemetery in Makkah. Muslims throughout the world mourned his loss and it was only a few months later that the Muslim world would lose another great scholar, Imaam Al-Albaanee, may Allaah have mercy on them both.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">FOREWORD</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on His Messenger. This book you have before you is a translation of a small pamphlet that was prepared, printed and distributed by Maktabah Al-Idreesee from San&#8217;aa, Yemen concerning &#8220;<em>The Scholars&#8217; Praise for Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise was also made available over the Internet as a downloadable file in such sites as rabee.net and alsalafia.com. This is where we obtained our source for this current translation. So we encourage all readers who wish to access the Arabic source for this book to go to the above mentioned web sites and download the file called &#8220;<em>Shifaa-ul-&#8216;Aleel fee Thanaa-il-&#8216;Ulamaa &#8216;alaa Ash-Shaikh Rabee</em>&#8216;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There were many reasons for selecting this current book for translation and publishing. <strong>The first and most important</strong> of them was to allow the Muslims to become acquainted with who the scholars of our time are and to get a first hand look at how the scholars of Ahl-us-Sunnah praise and commend one another. <strong>Secondly</strong>, in recent times there have been big debates amongst the Muslims, especially those of them who adhere to the way of the Salaf, on certain issues concerning this noble Shaikh. We felt that this is largely due to their being unaware of who Shaikh Rabee&#8217; is and what the scholars have said about him. Shaikh Rabee&#8217;, as indicated by Shaikh AlAlbaanee, is in our current times, the leading personality in the field of Al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel (i.e. declaring who is reliable, trustworthy and upon the correct way from those who are unreliable and on a deviant way). At times, this field requires those specialized in it to speak about certain popular and renowned figures in order to clarify their mistakes or expose their deviations. So no doubt, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; has spoken against some callers and teachers in the Muslim world that are esteemed by many. But this was only part of his sincere advice, as he was fulfilling his duty of clarifying to the ummah the mistakes of certain people so that the Muslims will not follow them in that. But unfortunately the result of this at times is that the Muslims do not readily accept from him and question his authority, and even go further and ridicule and belittle him. So we felt that it was important, especially amidst the rumors and lies being spread about this noble scholar, to present our Muslim readers with the present treatise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, we ask Allaah to reward all those brothers in charge of putting the book together in its Arabic form, namely the brothers in Yemen. They have also included several footnotes, which add clarification to certain issues and they have categorized the treatise into easy to read and access sections. So may Allaah reward them with the best of rewards and may He make this treatise a source for strengthening and putting light to this blessed da&#8217;wah of the Way of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Written by abu maryam isma&#8217;eel alarcon</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, all praise is due to Allaah, we praise Him, we seek His assistance and we ask for His forgiveness. We seek refuge in Him from the evils of our souls and the evils of our actions. Whoever Allaah guides, no one can lead him astray and whoever is caused to go astray, there is no one that can guide him. I bear witness that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah &#8211; alone with no partners. And I bear witness that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe, fear Allaah as He ought to be feared and do not die except while you are Muslims.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O mankind, fear Allaah who created you from a single soul (Adam) and from that, He created its mate (Eve). And from them He brought forth many men and women. And fear Allaah to whom you demand your mutual rights. Verily, Allaah is an ever AllWatcher over you.&#8221;</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe, fear Allaah and speak a word that is truthful (and to the point) &#8211; He will rectify your deeds and forgive you your sins. And whoever obeys Allaah and His Messenger has achieved a great success.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 70-71]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the best of speech is the Book of Allaah, and the best guidance is the guidance of Muhammad, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam. And the worst of matters are those that are newly invented, for every newly invented matter is an innovation, and every innovation is a misguidance and every misguidance is in the Hellfire. To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah had indeed promised us that He would protect His Religion and that He would preserve His Book and His Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, We have revealed the Dhikr (Qur&#8217;aan and Sunnah) and surely We will preserve it.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hijr: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Allaah&#8217;s way of preserving His Religion &#8211; as well as His mercy for His servants &#8211; is that He has prepared for it men who will continue to pass it down to those that come after them, in its pure and unadulterated form, free from any defects. These are the individuals who recorded the Knowledge and the Religion in books while preserving that in their hearts &#8211; not growing weak or tired of doing that until they reached their graves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people are the scholars &#8211; the adherents to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Hadeeth and the inheritors of the Prophets, who defend Allaah&#8217;s Religion and fight to clarify His Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has given the scholars a high and lofty position in Islaam, as well as an honorable rank amongst mankind, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah will raise those who believe amongst you and who have been given knowledge, many levels.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Say: Are those who have knowledge equal to those who do not have knowledge?&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Mujaadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has commanded us to refer our questions to them and to turn back to their sayings. And He made that like a certification on their part, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And We have not sent before you except men whom We gave revelation to. So ask the people of dhikr (remembrance, i.e. knowledge) if you don’t know.&#8221;</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of dhikr are the scholars &#8211; those who have knowledge of what Allaah revealed to His prophets.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ad-Dardaa, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu, reported:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I heard the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam, say: &#8216;Whoever treads a path, by which he seeks knowledge, Allaah will pave a way for him to Paradise because of it. Verily, the angels lower their wings out of contentment for the seeker of knowledge. And indeed, everything in the heavens and in the earth &#8211; even the fish in the sea &#8211; asks forgiveness (from Allaah) for the scholar. The virtue of the scholar over the worshipper is like the virtue of the moon over all the stars. Truly, the scholars are the inheritors of the prophets. And indeed the prophets do not leave behind any deenar or dirham (currency) for inheritance, but rather they only leave behind knowledge as inheritance. So whoever takes hold of it, then he has taken hold of an abundant share (of inheritance).'&#8221;</span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ayaat, ahaadeeth and athaar (narrations from the Salaf) concerning their high virtue are many. So they have the greatest share and the loftiest portion in terms of virtue and status. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Brother, listen to the great words of the Imaam of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah, Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, when he spoke on the characteristics of the scholars and their effect on the people and the people&#8217;s effect on them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#3366ff;">&#8220;All praise be to Allaah who placed in every era, after the period of the messengers, remnants from the people of knowledge, who call those who deviated to guidance and who have patience with their harm. And with the Book of Allaah, they revive the dead and with the light of Allaah, they cause the blind to see. So how many people, whom the Devil has killed, have they revived? And how many people, who were lost and astray have they guided? So what a great effect do they have upon the people! And what an ugly effect do the people have on them! They (i.e. the scholars) take away from the Book of Allaah, the distortions of the extremists, the false claims of the liars and the wrong interpretations of the ignorant &#8211; those who hold high the banners of innovation and unleash the outbreaks of mischief (fitnah). So they are in disagreement with the Qur&#8217;aan, they are in opposition to the Qur&#8217;aan and they unanimously agree with one another to withdraw themselves from the Qur&#8217;aan. They say things about Allaah and about the Book of Allaah without knowledge. They talk about the ambiguous matters in speech and they deceive the ignorant people on matters that are obscure to them. We seek refuge in Allaah from the fitan (trials) of the misguided ones.&#8221;</span> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So look at the biographies of the noble and distinguished Scholars and Muhadditheen throughout the history and generations, from the time of the righteous Sahaabah and their Successors (Taabi&#8217;een), then those that came after them from the eminent Imaams, to this current day of ours. You will find that they sacrificed their lives, their wealth and their time for the sake of being sincere to Allaah, His Book, His Messenger, the Muslim leaders and their common folk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the right that these scholars possess over others is that they (the people) do not mention them except with goodness. And whoever mentions them in an evil way, then he is on other than the Correct Path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is from the principles of Ahl-us-Sunnah and from the requirements of their beliefs, that it is an obligation to love the People of the Sunnah, to praise and speak highly of them and to not criticize them. This is such that the Salaf, may Allaah have mercy on them, considered the criticizing of Ahl-us-Sunnah and those who defend the Sunnah to be from the signs of the people of innovation and misguidance. In fact, they would consider a person to be from the people of innovation by just him criticizing the scholars (alone).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, rahimahullaah, said: <strong>&#8220;If you see a man slander Hamaad Ibn Salamah then have doubt about his Islaam, for indeed he (Hamaad) was harsh against the innovators.&#8221;</strong> [AsSiyar (7/447)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Zur&#8217;ah, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you see a man from Koofah speak vilely about Sufyaan Ath-Thawree and Zaa&#8217;idah, then no doubt he is a Raafidee. And if you see a person from Shaam speak vilely about Mak-hool and AlAwzaa&#8217;ee, then no doubt he is a Naasibee. And if you see a person from Khurasaan speak vilely about &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Al-Mubaraak, then no doubt he is a Murji&#8217;ee. And know that all of these groups are united in their hatred for Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, because there is no one amongst them except that he has in his heart an arrow (ready) for him, which cannot be recovered from.&#8221; [Tabaqaat-ul-Hanaabilah (1/199-200)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Na&#8217;eem Ibn Hamaad, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you see a man from Iraq speak (badly) about Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, then have doubt about his Religion. And if you see a person from Basrah speak (badly) about Wahb Ibn Jareer, then have doubt about his Religion. And if you see a man from Khurasaan speak (badly) about Ishaaq Ibn Raahawaih, then have doubt about his Religion.&#8221; [Taareekh Baghdad (6/438) and Taareekh Dimashq (8/132)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ja&#8217;far Ibn Muhammad Ibn Haaroon Al-Mukhramee, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you see a man attacking Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, then know that he is an innovator, a deviant.&#8221; [Taqdimah Al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel (pg. 308-309) and Taareekh Dimashq (5/294)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Haatim Ar-Raazee, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;If you see a person from Rayy or anyone else hating Abu Zur&#8217;ah, then know that he is an innovator.&#8221; [Taareekh Baghdad (10/329) and Taareekh Dimashq (38/31)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Haatim, rahimahullaah, also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>A sign of the people of innovation is their battling against the people of Narrations</strong>.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee (1/179)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu &#8216;Uthmaan As-Saaboonee, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;The signs of the people of innovation are clear and obvious. The most apparent of their signs is their severe enmity for those who carry the reports of the Prophet.&#8221;</strong> [&#8216;Aqeedat-us-Salaf (pg. 101)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Safaareenee, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And we are not focusing on mentioning the virtues of the people of Hadeeth, for indeed their virtues are well known and their merits are many. So whoever belittles them, then he is despicable and lowly. And whoever hates them, then he is from the backward party of the Devil.&#8221; [Lawaa&#8217;ih-ul-Anwaar (2/355)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among these distinguished scholars and eminent Mujaahideen is the Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, Abu Muhammad Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee &#8216;Umair Al-Madkhalee, may Allaah continue to let him remain in defense of His Religion and cause us to benefit from this prolonging of his life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah preserve him, has truly worked hard to clarify the Sunnah, and he has struggled intensely to explain what the Correct Way is. All of this is from his sincerity to Allaah, His Book, His Messenger, the Muslims leaders and their common folk. So how many confused people did he cause to see, and how many people who went astray did he direct to the way of guidance? So we ask Allaah to grant him the best reward for what he has done on behalf of Islaam and the Muslims. And we ask Allaah to place him, as well as us, in the company of the prophets, the siddeeqeen (those who believed in the prophets), the martyrs, and the righteous &#8211; and what a great company they are.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there is no doubt that for every good blessing that exists (for someone) there is someone envious of it, and for every truth, there is someone who rejects or denies it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-Lateef Aali Shaikh, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;From the natural habit of the people of innovation is that when they are broke of possessing any proofs and the avenues (of arguing) have become constricted for them, they cast faults and blemishes on the Ahl-us-Sunnah and criticize them, while praising themselves.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Raafidah (group) met their ruin at the hands of the Prophet&#8217;s Companions, and so did the people of the Great Slander (against &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah). And likewise, Ahmad Ibn Abee Duwaad and others from the Mu&#8217;tazilah met their destruction with Ahmad Ibn Hanbal. And Ibn Makhloof AlMaalikee met his ruin at the hands of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah. As-Subkee met his ruin at the hands of Al-Haafidh Adh-Dhahabee and so did Ibn Dihlaan and his followers from the Sufis at the hands of Shaikh-ul-Islaam Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab, as well as all the other followers of the Shaytaan who met their fate at the hands of the followers of Ar-Rahmaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this was due to Allaah testing His servants from Ahl-us-Sunnah to know who the truthful and believing ones were from the lying and hypocritical. And it was so Allaah could increase the reward of these servants of His, due to the criticism they receive from those who are astray and lead others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In order to clarify the truth and to advise the ummah, we decided to distribute and spread these words and recommendations that the noble scholars have given to Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee AlMadkhalee. This is so that one who is unaware (of the Shaikh) could know his status and so that the hearts of the believers could be at rest and tranquility and so that someone who is ruined at his hands does not fall into such a circumstance without first being informed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And all praise be to the One, through whose grace, all good deeds are completed. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Muhammad and on his family and Companions. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">A BIOGRAPHY OF SHAIKH RABEE’ IBN HAADEE AL-MADKHALEE [5]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Name and Lineage:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah , the Muhaddith, Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Ibn Muhammad ‘Umair AlMadkhalee from the tribe of Mudaakhala, a well-known tribe in the Jaazaan district in the southern part of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This is one of the tribes of Banoo Shabeel. Shabeel was Ibn Yashjab Ibn Qahtaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Birth:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in the village of Jaraadiyah, which is a small village to the west of the town of Saamitah, close to three kilometers away from it. Now, the village is connected to that town. He was born in the year 1351H, towards the last part of the year. His father passed away almost a year and a half after his birth, so he was raised and brought up in the house of his mother, may Allaah have mercy on her. She supervised him and took charge of raising him in the best possible manner, and she taught him good characteristics, such as honesty and trustworthiness and to be motivated about making the prayers. She would make him go pray, while under the supervision of his paternal uncle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Educational Upbringing:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Shaikh reached the age of eight, he joined the study circles of the village. There, he learned proper handwriting and recitation (of the Qur’aan). From those who taught him handwriting, were Shaikh Shaibaan Al-‘Areeshee and Al-Qaadee Ahmad Ibn Muhammad Jaabir Al-Madkhalee. He also learned under a third person, called Muhammad Ibn Husain Makkee from the town of Sibyaa’. He studied the Qur’aan under Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Muhammad Jaabir Al-Madkhalee, as well as the subjects of Tawheed and Tajweed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards he studied in the Salafee School of Saamitah. From the teachers whom he studied under in this school, were: the knowledgeable, Shaikh Naasir Khaloofah At-Tiyaash Mubaarakee, rahimahullaah, who was a famous scholar from the major students of Shaikh Al-Qar’aawee, rahimahullaah. He studied the books Buloogh Al-Maraam and Nuzhat-un-Nadhr of Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr under him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he joined the educational institute in Saamitah after that, and there he studied under a number of noble Mashaayikh, the most famous of whom, generally speaking, were: Shaikh Haafidh Ibn Ahmad Al-Hakamee &#8211; the well-known great scholar, rahimahullaah, and his brother, Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Al-Hakamee. He also studied under the great scholar, the Muhaddith, Ahmad Ibn Yahyaa An-Najmee, may Allaah preserve him, and the Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, Dr. Muhammad Amaan Ibn ‘Alee Al-Jaamee, rahimahullaah. He also studied under the Shaikh, the Faqeeh Muhammad Sagheer Khameesee the book Zaad Al-Mustaqni’ with regard to the subject of Fiqh. And there are many others whom the Shaikh studied under, such as in the subjects of Arabic Language, Literature, Eloquent Speech (Balaagha), etc. In the year 1380H, upon finishing his allotted time, the Shaikh graduated from the educational institute of Saamitah. In the beginning of the year 1381H, he joined the Faculty of Sharee’ah in Riyadh and stayed there for a period of one or two months. Then the Islaamic University of Madeenah opened, so he moved to Madeenah and joined the Islaamic University’s Faculty of Sharee’ah. He studied there for the length of four years and graduated in the year 1384H with a grade of Mumtaz (Excellent).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The teachers whom the Shaikh studied under while in the Islaamic University:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, the former Chief Muftee of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, ‘Abdul- ‘Azeez Ibn ‘Abdillaah Ibn Baaz, rahimahullaah, under whom he studied Al-‘Aqeedah AtTahaawiyyah.<br />
2. The ‘Allaamah, the Muhaddith, Shaikh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee, rahimahullaah, under whom he studied the subject of Hadeeth and its chains of narration.<br />
3. The Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, ‘Adul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad, under whom he studied the subject of Fiqh for three years, with the book Bidaayat-ul-Mujtahid.<br />
4. The Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, the Haafidh and Mufassir, Muhammad Al-Ameen Ash-Shanqeetee, author of the book Adwaa-ul-Bayaan, under whom he studied the subjects of Tafseer and the Principles of Fiqh for four years.<br />
5. Shaikh Saalih Al-‘Iraaqee, under whom he studied ‘Aqeedah (Creed).<br />
6. The Shaikh, the Muhaddith, ‘Abdul-Ghaffaar Hasan Al-Hindee, under whom he studied the Science of Hadeeth and its terms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After graduating from the Islaamic University of Madeenah, he worked as a teacher in one of the learning institutes of the Islaamic University for a while. Then he joined the Department for Higher Studies at Umm Al-Qurraa University, where he continued his studies, obtaining his Masters Degree in the subject of Hadeeth in 1397H, by having completed his dissertation, which is well known as “Between the two Imaams, Muslim and Ad-Daaraqutnee.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in the year 1400H, he obtained his Doctorate Degree from Umm Al-Qurraa also, with the grade of Mumtaz (Excellent). And this was because of his checking of the book “An-Nukat ‘alaa Kitaab Ibn As-Salaah” of Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr, rahimahullaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After that, he went back to working as a teacher in the Islaamic University (of Madeenah) in the Faculty of Hadeeth, where he taught Hadeeth and its Sciences. He became head of the Dept. of Sunnah in the Department for Higher Studies several times. Now, he currently holds the position of chair-holding professor.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Attributes and Characteristics:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, may Allaah preserve him, is distinguished by his great humbleness in front of his (Muslim) brothers, students, questioners and visitors. He is humble with regard to his household, his clothes and his means of transportation &#8211; not liking to have luxury in any of these things. He is also always joyful and with a cheerful countenance. He doesn’t fatigue his students with too much talk. And his gatherings are always filled with readings in Hadeeth and the Sunnah and warnings against innovation and its people, to the extent that a person that doesn’t know him well or mix with him, may think to himself that the Shaikh doesn’t preoccupy himself except with doing this! He loves the Salafee Students of Knowledge and he is polite to them and treats them nicely. And he strives to assist them with their needs as much as he is able to, both physically and financially. His home is always open to the students of knowledge, to the point that not one day passes that he is able to eat his breakfast or lunch or dinner by himself. And he inquires about his students and assists them and shares with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is among the persistent and enthusiastic callers to the Qur’aan and the Sunnah and the Creed of the Salaf. Many in these times cannot equal his great zeal and passion for the Sunnah and the Creed of the Salaf. And in our time, he is from those who are defending this methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih, day and night, in hidden and in open, without letting the accusations of critics censure him, for the sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>His Books:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His books are many, all praise be to Allaah. The Shaikh has written on many important and required topics, especially that of refuting the people of innovation and desires in these times, in which the rectifiers are few and the troublemakers are many. His books include:[6]</p>

30. &#8220;The Islaamic Ruling concerning the one who reviles Allaah&#8217;s Messenger or criticizes some part of His Message&#8221; &#8211; This is an article that appeared in the Kuwaiti newspaper Al-Qabs (Issue 8576) on 9/5/1977.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh has other books that we did not mention here. We ask Allaah to assist him in completing the good and to grant him the ability to do what He loves and is pleased with. Surely, Allaah has power over that and He is Able to do it</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE SCHOLARS&#8217; PRAISE FOR THE SHAIKH, DR. RABEE&#8217; IBN HAADEE &#8216;UMAIR AL-MADKHALEE</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. The Muhaddith, the &#8216;Allaamah, Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a cassette [7] the following question was presented to the Shaikh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Despite the stance that the two Shaikhs, Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee and Muqbil Ibn Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee, have taken in fighting against innovations and the deviant opinions and sayings, some of the youth have doubts as to if the two Shaikhs are upon the Salafee way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaikh, rahimahullaah, answered by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Without a doubt, we praise Allaah, the Most High, for preparing for this upright Da&#8217;wah, which is based on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah according to the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih, numerous callers throughout the various parts of the Muslim lands. They are the ones who take charge of the communal obligation (fard kifaa&#8217;ee), when there are very few who take this responsibility in the Muslim world today. So degrading and belittling these two Shaikhs (Rabee&#8217; and Muqbil), who call to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and what the Salaf As-Saalih were upon and who wage war against those who oppose this correct methodology. As is quite clear to everyone, it either comes from one of two types of people. Either it comes from someone who is ignorant or someone who follows his desires&#8230; If he is ignorant, then he can be taught. But if he is one who follows his desires, then we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evil of this person. And we ask Allaah, Mighty and Sublime, to either guide him or break his back.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaikh, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And furthermore, I want to say that what I saw from the writings of the Shaikh, Dr. Rabee&#8217;, was that they were beneficial. And I do not recall seeing any error on his part (in these books) nor any deviation from the methodology, which we are in conformity with him on and he with us.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, rahimahullaah, also said, commenting on the conclusion of the book <em>&#8220;Al-&#8216;Awaasim mimmaa fee Kutub Sayyid Qutb min Al-Qawaasim&#8221;</em> (Protection against the Dangers that are found in the Books of Sayyid Qutb):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Everything that you have refuted Sayyid Qutb in is true and correct. From this, it will become quite clear to every Muslim, who has some sort of Islaamic education, that reads this that Sayyid Qutb was not knowledgeable about Islaam, whether about its fundamental principles (Usool) or its subsidiary issues (Furoo&#8217;).[8] So may Allaah reward you, O brother (Rabee&#8217;) for fulfilling this obligation of clarifying and exposing his ignorance and deviation from Islaam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. The Imaam, the Muhaddith, the &#8216;Allaamah, Shaikh &#8216;Abd-ul-&#8216;Azeez Ibn Baaz:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Bin Baaz was asked about what he meant by his &#8220;Clarification&#8221; (a speech he gave), so he responded on (7/28/1412) in a cassette entitled &#8220;Explaining the Clarification&#8221;:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This clarification that we spoke about &#8211; what was intended by it was the da&#8217;wah (call) of everyone &#8211; all of the callers and scholars &#8211; in a constructive criticism. And our intent was not our brothers in Madeenah from amongst the students of knowledge, teachers and callers. And our intent was not other than them from the people in Makkah or Riyadh or Jeddah. Rather, our intent was that of all the people in a general manner. And our brothers &#8211; the well-known mashaayikh in Madeenah &#8211; we have no doubt in them. They possess sound Creed and are from the Ahl-usSunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah, such as Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Ibn &#8216;Alee (Al-Jaamee), Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee (Al-Madkhalee), Shaikh Saalih Ibn Sa&#8217;ad As-Suhaymee, Shaikh Faalih Ibn Naafi&#8217; and Shaikh Muhammad Ibn Haadee. All of them are known to us for their perseverance, knowledge and sound Creed…However, the callers to falsehood &#8211; those who hunt in murky water (i.e. aimlessly)9 &#8211; they are the ones who confuse the people. And they talk about these matters, saying &#8220;He meant by it such and such&#8221;, and this is not good. It is an obligation to take someone&#8217;s words according to the best manner of understanding.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also in the tape &#8220;Sticking to the Salafee Manhaj&#8221;, which was recorded in the masjid of Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah) in Taa&#8217;if, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; gave a lecture on Thursday (3rd of Muharram 1413) called &#8220;Sticking to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah&#8221;. In this talk, the Shaikh incited the people to follow these two sources while in the presence of Shaikh Bin Baaz. And after Shaikh Rabee&#8217; finished with his talk, Shaikh Ibn Baaz commented on it saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;In the Name of Allaah, and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Muhammad, his family, Companions and those who follow his guidance. All of us have listened to the words of the noble Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee on the subject of sticking to the Book and the Sunnah and warning against what opposes them and (warning against) the causes for splitting and dividing and being fanatical to one&#8217;s desires. And he has indeed done well and spoken correctly and benefited us, may Allaah reward him and multiply his reward. This is the obligation upon all of the ummah &#8211; to stick to the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah and refer to them for judging affairs &#8211; whether small or big. So we ask Allaah that He grant the noble Shaikh Rabee&#8217; every good and that He reward him for his talk…&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the tape &#8220;Questions from Sweden&#8221;, Shaikh Ibn Baaz was asked about Shaikh Rabee&#8217; and responded by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; is from the scholars of the Sunnah &#8211; (and then he mentioned Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee with him and said) &#8211; the two of them are know to me for their knowledge and virtue.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also refer to the book &#8220;The Methodology of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah in Criticizing Men, Books and Groups&#8221; (of Shaikh Rabee&#8217;) to see Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Ibn Baaz&#8217;s good words for this book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Truly, we don’t know any man that is upon what Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Ibn Baaz was upon &#8211; inwardly and outwardly &#8211; from love of the Sunnah and support for its people and hatred for innovation and warning against its people, like Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee is. The Shaikh did not cease to love him, praise him and recommend him &#8211; in fact, he granted him permission to something greater than all of this, and it was permission for him to teach in his masjid in Makkah. There he taught his well-known class on Fat&#8217;h-ul-Majeed &#8211; which continues until today &#8211; and this is a proof that the Shaikh died while he was pleased with him and with his manhaj (methodology). [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">3. The Muhaddith, the &#8216;Allaamah, Muqbil Ibn Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the cassette entitled &#8220;Questions from Hadhramaut&#8221;, Shaikh Muqbil was asked: &#8220;What is your opinion concerning those who say that Shaikh Rabee&#8217; is mutahawwir (rash and hasty)?&#8221; So the Shaikh responded by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Shaikh Rabee&#8217; has experience in knowing the current state of affairs because he lived with the Ikhwaan Al-Mufliseen for a long period of time. All praise be to Allaah, he is the best at rectifying these affairs and refuting the innovations of the innovators, so I ask Allaah to preserve him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the cassette &#8220;Question regarding the Sunnah posed to the great scholar of the lands of Yemen: Questions from the youth of Taa&#8217;if&#8221;, the Shaikh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;From those who have the most insight and knowledge of the groups (jamaa&#8217;aat) and the pollution of these groups in our time is the brother, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee, may Allaah preserve him. Whoever Shaikh Rabee&#8217; says about that he is a hizbee (partisan), then you will discover after a few days that he is really a hizbee.[11] You will remember that. An individual may conceal himself in the beginning &#8211; he doesn&#8217;t want that his true nature be discovered. But when he gains strength and followers and he knows that talk abut him will not harm him, he manifests and reveals what he is truly upon. So I advise that his (Shaikh Rabee&#8217;s) books be read and that benefit be derived from them, may Allaah preserve him.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>4. The Shaikh, the &#8216;Allaamah, Muhammad Ibn Saalih Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the cassette &#8220;Al-&#8216;Uthaimeen&#8217;s Meeting with Rabee&#8217; Al-Madkhalee and Muhammad Al-Imaam&#8221;, the Shaikh, rahimahullaah, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Indeed, we praise Allaah that He has enabled our brother, Doctor Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee AlMadkhalee to visit this province (in Saudi Arabia) so that those who are unaware of certain matters may know that our brother is on the side of the Salafiyyah &#8211; the way of the Salaf. May Allaah grant success to him and us. And I do not mean by &#8220;salafiyyah&#8221; that it is a separate and individual party (hizb) that opposes those apart from it amongst the Muslims. Rather what I mean by &#8220;salafiyyah&#8221; is that he is following the way of the Salaf in his methodology and especially in comprehending Tawheed and denouncing those who oppose it. And we all know that Tawheed is the foundation of the Message for which reason Allaah sent his messengers… Our Brother Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee&#8217;s visit to this province and specifically to our region of &#8216;Unayzah, no doubt it will have an effect here. And it will become clear to many of the people what they were unaware of due to their inflaming, propagating and allowing their tongues to talk freely.12 And how many are the people that feel sorrow for what they have stated against the scholars when it becomes clarified to them that they were in fact correct.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then on the same tape, one of the people in the gathering said: “There is a question concerning the books of Shaikh Rabee’?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he, rahimahullaah, responded: “It is clear that this question is in no need of my response, for as Imaam Ahmad was once asked about Ishaaq Ibn Raahawaih – may Allaah have mercy on them all – so he said: “The likes of me is asked about Ishaaq? Rather Ishaaq should be asked about me!”13 I have already spoken at the start of my talk about what I know of Shaikh Rabee’, may Allaah gave him tawfeeq. And I still insist on what I stated then until now. And his coming here and his talk in which he informed me of what he did &#8211; no doubt &#8211; are from the things that only increases a person in his love for him and his supplicating for him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the tape “Shaikh Rabee’s meeting with Shaikh Ibn ‘Uthaimeen concerning the manhaj”, he, rahimahullaah, was asked the following question:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We know about many of the deviations of Sayyid Qutb, but the only thing that I have not heard about him, but which I heard from one of the students of knowledge and which I am not satisfied with – is that Sayyid Qutb was from those who held the belief in wahdat-ul-wujood. Naturally, this is clear-cut disbelief. So was Sayyid Qutb from those who held the belief in wahdat-ulwujood? I hope for your response and may Allaah reward you. With good.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaikh, rahimahullaah, responded: “My examination of the books of Sayyid Qutb is little and I do not know of the condition of this man. However, the scholars have written remarks about his book on tafseer (i.e. Fee Dhilaal-il-Qur’aan), such as the books of Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Ad-Duwaish, rahimahullaah. Also, our brother Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee wrote some remarks about Sayyid Qutb concerning his tafseer and other aspects. So whoever wants to refer to them, then he should refer to them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was also asked about Shaikh Rabee’ in the cassette “Questions from Sweden” and responded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“With respect to Shaikh Rabee’, I do not know anything of him except good. And the man is one who possesses (knowledge and following of) the Sunnah and Hadeeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another tape entitled “Unveiling the contradictions of Ahmad Salaam”, which was a telephone link-up from Holland, the question was posed to the Shaikh:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“What is your advice to the one who prevents the tapes of Shaikh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee from being distributed claiming that they will lead to fitnah (turmoil), and that in these tapes is praise for the leaders in Saudi Arabia &#8211; and this praise of his for the leaders is hypocrisy?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaikh answered: “Our view is that this is a mistake and a great error. Shaikh Rabee’ is from the scholars of the Sunnah and from the people of goodness. And his Creed is sound and his methodology is upright. But when he spoke out against some (popular) figures amongst the people of recent times, and he deafened them with (his exposition of) these faults…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5. Shaikh Dr. Saalih Ibn Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his introduction to (Shaikh Rabee’s) book “Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah” (pg. 12-13), the Shaikh says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And this is because Islaam calls to gathering together upon the truth, as Allaah says: ‘That you should establish the Religion and not make division within it.’ [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: ’And hold firmly onto the Rope of Allaah – all of you together – and do not divide (into sects).’ [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since clarifying and explaining this matter is an obligation, a group amongst the scholars &#8211; that have protectiveness (of this Religion) and the ability to verify – took the responsibility of cautioning against the errors of these groups. And they took charge of explaining their opposition to the Call towards the Methodology of the Prophets, so that perhaps these groups may return to the truth &#8211; for indeed, arriving at the truth is the objective of the believer – and so that those who are unaware of the errors of these groups will not continue to be deceived by them. And from those scholars that have taken charge of this duty, acting on the hadeeth &#8211; (‘The Religion is sincerity. Religion is sincerity. Religion is sincerity.’ We said: ‘To who, O Messenger of Allaah?’ He said: ‘To Allaah, His Book, His Messenger, the Muslim leaders and their common folk’) – from those who clarified and advised is Shaikh Dr. Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee. In this book, which is before us, entitled “Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah”, he has explained &#8211; may Allaah grant him success and reward him with good &#8211; the methodology of the Messengers in Calling to Allaah according to what is stated in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. And he has compared this with the methodology of the opposing groups so that the difference between the methodology of the messengers and those various methodologies in opposition to the methodology of the messengers can become clear…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his introduction to the book (also by Shaikh Rabee’) “One Group not many groups and One Path, not several”, the Shaikh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“However, during recent times, there appeared groups that ascribed themselves to the Da’wah and which were guided by leaders specific to their groups. Each of these groups made a specific methodology for themselves the result of which was dividing, differing and a constant struggle between these groups – all of which the Religion forbids and which the Book and the Sunnah prohibit. So when the scholars refuted this methodology employed by these groups, which was foreign to Islaam, some brothers set out to defend them. And from the people that defended these groups was the Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaaan ‘Abdul-Khaaliq, by way of his printed treatises and recorded cassettes. He did all of this in spite of being advised not to do it by his brothers. Then he added to that, his reproaching and condemnation of those scholars that didn’t agree with him in his actions. And he labeled them with descriptions that were unbefitting of them, and he did not desist from that – not even against some of the sheikhs that taught him! The noble Shaikh, Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee took the responsibility of refuting him in this book, which the reader holds before him, by the title ‘One Group not many groups and One Path, not several.’ And I have read it and found that it sufficiently fulfills its objective, all praise be to Allaah.” And in the cassette “Questions from Sweden” (recorded on Rabee’-ul-Aakhira 1417H), the Shaikh said after mentioning Shaikh Rabee’ along with a group of other scholars:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“They are from the prominent scholars that have an active role in the Da’wah (Call) and in refuting those who desire to deviate from the correct way of the Da’wah. So his tapes must be distributed for there is a huge benefit in them for the Muslims.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6. The &#8216;Allaamah, Shaikh Muhammad Ibn ‘Abd-il-Wahhaab Marzooq Al-Bannaa:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his introduction to the book “One Group not many groups and One Path, not several”, the Shaikh, may Allaah preserve him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I know Dr. Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee from the days when I was a student at the Islamic University (in Madeenah) as someone who was anxious to learn the Sunnah and the Way of the Salaf As-Saalih, as well as to follow that methodology and call others to that Straight Path. I graduated with him and the brothers ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ‘Abdul-Khaaliq, ‘Umar Sulaymaan AlAshqar and Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee along with some Sudanese students that were upon the same methodology of Da’wah in Sudan during the summer recess of that year. And amongst the best of those (of us) who stood firm on this path (of the Way of the Salaf) was Shaikh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee. We ask Allaah that He continue his firmness, for he has filled the gap by defending the Sunnah and clarifying the mistakes of some people whom we bear witness to their virtuousness, yet whom many people are deceived by. This is such as his advice to the son, Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan (‘Abdul-Khaaliq) in the book ‘One Group not many groups and One Path, not several.’ And in this book, he clarifies the truth that he holds, so may Allaah reward him with the best reward and may He grant us, the brother ‘Abdur-Rahmaan, and all of the brothers, the methodology of the Straight Path. And may He protect us all from the deviant paths. And I have come to know of the death of Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, may Allaah forgive him and grant him a spacious place in Paradise. He was indeed among those who defended the Sunnah and who called to following the Way of the Salaf. I ask Allaah that He accept his efforts and that he forgive him and us.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>7. Shaikh Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdillaah As-Subayyal,</strong></span> chief caretaker of the affairs of Masjid Al-Haraam and Masjid An-Nabawee and the Imaam and khateeb of Masjid Al-Haraam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the book “An-Nasr-ul-‘Azeez ‘alaa Ar-Radd-il-Wajeez” (pg. 11), he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“All praise be to Allaah, and the peace and blessings on the one whom no prophet will come after him, Muhammad, and on his family and Companions. To proceed: Indeed, the noble Shaikh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee, who is a professor at the Islaamic University of Madeenah, is from the well-known scholars and popular callers in the scholarly and educational circles in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. He is known for his authority in the sciences of the Sunnah as well as other subjects from the Islaamic Sciences. The Shaikh has a big role in calling to Allaah upon the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih, defending the correct Salafee Creed and refuting those amongst the people of innovation and desires that oppose it by what is mentioned to him, so he is well thanked for that. So we ask Allaah to continue His blessing on him and that He increase him in his ability and his focus.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the cassette “Unveiling the contradictions of Ahmad Salaam” (tape 1), the following was recorded:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Question: “What is your advice to the one who prevents (the distribution of) the tapes of the well known scholars from Ahl-us-Sunnah, such as Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, rahimahullaah, and Shaikh Rabee’ Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee, hafidhahullaah, to the point that he says that the Shaikh’s tapes will bring about fitnah?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh answered: “I seek refuge in Allaah, I seek refuge in Allaah…no. Look, the tapes of these two Shaikhs are from the best of tapes. They call the people to the Sunnah and to cling tightly onto the Sunnah, but no one talks bad about them except one who follows his desires. Most of the people that talk about them are the people of sects and parties – those who affiliate themselves with one of the groups or parties. They are the ones who make such statements. As for these two Shaikhs, then they are known for sticking to the Sunnah and for possessing a Creed in accordance with the way of the Salaf. And they are from the best of people.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>8. Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the first cassette of the tape set &#8220;The Rulings of the Scholars on the Statements of &#8216;Adnaan &#8216;Aroor&#8221;,[14] the Shaikh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for Shaikh Rabee&#8217; &#8211; he is known for his effort in clarifying the Sunnah and refuting the innovators. May Allaah reward him with good.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>9. Shaikh &#8216;Ubaid Al-Jaabiree:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was asked about Shaikh Rabee&#8217; on the cassette &#8220;A Clarification of some of the Errors of &#8216;Adnaan &#8216;Aroor, and it was said to him: &#8220;There is a lot of talk going on about Shaikh Rabee&#8217; &#8211; is he considered one of the scholars of the Muslims?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he responded: &#8220;Shaikh Rabee&#8217;, all praise be to Allaah, is well-known with the elite personalities and the scholars. And furthermore, our shaikh (teacher), Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez Bin Baaz has praised and approved of him. And I would not think that you would present this question to me.&#8221;</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">CLOSING REMARKS</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is a small treatise containing some of the praises of the scholars for Dr. Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee, may Allaah preserve him and guard him and make Paradise his and our final abode. These statements are only a small portion of the many praises that the scholars &#8211; those living and those who have passed away &#8211; have given to this noble scholar (Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the testimony of the people of knowledge is sufficient for us as testimony. And Allaah has called on their testimony in His Book concerning the greatest matter that requires one&#8217;s testimony and that is Tawheed, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah bears witness that No deity has the right to be worshipped, and so do the angels and those who have been given knowledge. (He is always) maintaining His creation with justice. There is no deity worthy of worship except Him, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Aali-&#8216;Imraan: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And dear brother, do not be like the one about whom Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And when (news of) a matter comes to them concerning (matters of) security or fear, they propagate it…&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But rather implement the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;But if they had only returned it back to the Messenger and those in authority amongst them, those amongst them who are able to derive a correct conclusion from it would have understood it (and made it known to them).&#8221;</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware O brother of being from those about whom Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And those who harm the believing men and believing women undeservedly, they bear (on themselves) the crime of slander and plain sin.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 58]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And remember the saying of the Prophet, sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Whoever says something about a believer that is not true about him will be locked away in the boiling puss of the Hellfire, until he turns back from what he said.&#8221;</strong> [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these times, the false rumors and claims (against Shaikh Rabee’) have become widespread, but:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Indeed Allaah will defend those who believe. Verily Allaah does not love every treacherous, ungrateful person.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hajj: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So O servants of Allaah, do not listen to what these prejudiced and spiteful people say in their belittling and defaming of the Ahl-us-Sunnah. Rather act on the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O you who believe, if an evildoer comes to you with some news, then verify it, lest some people be afflicted by you due to ignorance and then you will feel remorse for what you did later.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hujuraat: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And take heed of the saying of the Prophet: <strong>&#8220;It is enough of a lie for a person that he narrate everything he hears.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is our conclusion and may Allaah send His peace and blessings on our sayyid, Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] Translator’s Note: The titles of the Shaikh’s books have been translated into English, however, this does not mean that they are available in the English language. From the list, we only know of one that has been translated and printed in English and it is “The Methodology of the Prophets in Calling to Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7]Translator’s Note: All cassette titles were translated from Arabic to English. This does not mean that the tape is available in the English language unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] How can the Qutubi Surroris make this man &#8211; Sayyid Qutb &#8211; a mujaddid and an Imaam when he was ignorant of the fundamental aspects of Islaam before the subsidiary aspects!! By Allaah, this is something very strange! So abandon your lies O you whom Allaah has tested by means of this man and defending of him. Can someone who is ignorant of the fundamental aspects of Islaam be considered a mujaddid (reviver)?! What will he revive? Rather, this kind of person can only be a mujaddid (reviver) of innovations and a reviver of diseases that are deadly to Islaam and to the Muslims. And this is known from his books, for he has revived the views of the Jahmiyyah and the Mu&#8217;tazilah and the views of the Rawaafid and the Khawaarij and the views of the Sufis, such as that of wahdat-ul-wujood (Allaah and the creation are all one existence). This is what Sayyid Qutb has revived, so how can someone who has this condition be considered an Imaam? &#8211; unless he is an Imaam of misguidance! And that is what he is, may Allaah protect us from his fitnah and his evil. Many of the scholars have refuted Sayyid Qutb, including Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Ad-Duwaish, Shaikh Rabee&#8217; Ibn Haadee Al-Madkhalee (in four separate books) and Shaikh Mahmood Shaakir. The latter has refuted Sayyid Qutb in the issue of his reviling of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. But Sayyid Qutb did not pay heed to the refutation of Shaikh Mahmood Shaakir and instead was proud and stubborn and persisted in his reviling and belittling of the Companions as is quite clear in the Introduction of the book &#8220;Mataa&#8217;in Sayyid Qutb fee Ashaabi Rasoolillaah&#8221; (The Abuses of Sayyid Qutub against the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger) of Shaikh Rabee&#8217; [Second Printing]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] The ones whom Shaikh Ibn Baaz, rahimahullaah, is referring to here are: Salmaan Al-&#8216;Awdah, Safar AlHawaali and Muhammad Sa&#8217;eed Al-Qahtaanee, as well as all others that stand in need of clarification. And the Shaikh has called them &#8220;callers to falsehood&#8221; and &#8220;those who hunt in murky water (i.e. aimlessly)&#8221;, wa laa Hawla wa laa Quwata illaa Billaah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] How can he not be pleased with him and his methodology when it is the methodology of the Salaf AsSaalih (Righteous Predecessors) in protecting the Tawheed and the Sunnah from the distortions and lies of the people of innovations and misguidance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11]By Allaah, he has spoken the truth, for Shaikh Rabee&#8217; has informed us of (the condition of) many people and after a while, that which the Shaikh said about them began to manifest itself, may Allaah preserve him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] These are the Hizbees (partisans) from the Ikhwaan Al-Muslimeen and the Suroori Qutubis!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] This is an assertion from the great scholar, Ibn &#8216;Uthaimeen, to the fact that Shaikh Rabee&#8217; is the Carrier of the Flag of Al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel. And also, this is a sign of the Shaikh&#8217;s humbleness, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] This &#8216;Aroor has invented false and corrupt principles by which he tries to defend the people of innovation and misguidance. And he is from the extremists with regard to promoting Sayyid Qutb, to the point that he said: &#8220;I do not know of any person on the face of this earth that has spoken about the minhaaj (methodology) in the manner that Sayyid Qutb has spoken about it&#8221;!!! And he has many statements in which he praises Sayyid Qutb and commends and exalts his books. And &#8216;Aroor is well known for lying and falsifying information about him (i.e. in favor of Sayyid Qutb), may Allaah protect us from the evil of the Qutubis. And we ask Allaah that He expose them day after day. Many of the scholars have refuted &#8216;Aroor and have clarified his falsifications, deceptions and lies on the Salafees &#8211; not to mention Shaikh Rabee&#8217; from one perspective and &#8216;Aroor&#8217;s excessiveness with regard to Sayyid Qutb from another perspective. So O brothers, strive to find out about &#8216;Aroor and every misguided innovator so that you can beware of them, especially in these times in which the people of innovations, desires and calamities are many.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Died 1422H: Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee</strong><b></b></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#008000;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee (<strong>Autobiography</strong>)</span><br />
<span style="color:#008000;"> SOURCE: Tarjamah Abee ‘Abdir-Rahmaan (pg. 16-29, with minor abridgement) [2nd Edition; 1999] </span><span style="color:#008000;">PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:justify;">I come from Waadi’ah, which is a place to the east of the city of Sa’adah from the valley of Dammaaj. My name is Muqbil bin Haadee bin Muqbil bin Qaa’idah al-Hamdaanee al-Waadi’ee al-Khallaalee, from the tribe of Aali Raashid. [1] </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise due to Allaah, most of the people of Waadi’ah, who neighbor Sa’adah defend me and the Da’wah. Some of them wish to defend the Religion while others defend their tribal devotion. If it were not for Allaah first, then them, the enemies of the (Salafi) Da&#8217;wah, particularly the Shee’ah of Sa’adah, would not have left behind any signs or traces of us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will mention some examples of them for which I ask Allaah to reward them, one of which was when I faced severe opposition in the Haadee Mosque because I turned people away from the (Shiite) Da’wah there. So some men from Waadi’ah and others stood by me to the point that Allaah saved me through their hands. The Shiites desired to rule against me. This was at the time of Ibraaheem Al-Hamdee. And evil people amongst the Communists and Shiites raised their heads and imprisoned me for a period of eleven days during Ramadaan. About fifty of the youth from Waad’iah would come to visit me in prison during some of the nights, while another hundred and fifty of their men would also go to the prison caretakers during these nights, so much so that the caretakers got fed up and released me from jail, all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example is that the enemies of the Da’wah would sometimes come to Dammaaj with their weapons, so the people of Dammaaj would drive them away and they would be forced to leave in humiliation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example is during our journeys. When I would say: “We wish to travel”, they would compete with one other, may Allaah preserve them, to see who would accompany and guard me. So sometimes we would go out on some of our travels in about 15 cars!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During these days, the Da’wah was progressing in a superb manner because, all praise be to Allaah, I had grown older. Perhaps at this point I have reached about 62 years of age. So it was the calamities and the advice from those who love the Da’wah that drove me to have kindness and to not keep up with the enemies, who don’t have anything but insults and abuses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, due to my teaching, writing and giving Da’wah, I was not able to find time to keep up with those enemies. So let them say what they want for my sins are many, and perhaps because of their slander, my sins will be lightened for me and instead fall upon their shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>My Studies and Teachers:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I studied at school until I completed the school’s curriculum. Then a long time passed without me seeking knowledge since there was no one who would encourage me or assist me in seeking knowledge. And I used to love seeking knowledge. So I sought knowledge from the Al-Haadee Mosque but I was not assisted in that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After some time, I left my homeland (of Yemen) and went to the sacred lands (Makkah/Madeenah) and Najd. I would listen to the speakers and be fascinated by their sermons. So I sought the advice of some of the speakers on what beneficial books I should buy? They advised me to get Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree, Buloogh al-Maraam, Riyaadh as-Saaliheen, and Fath-ul-Majeed, the explanation of Kitaab at-Tawheed. And they gave me copies of the textbooks from the Tawheed courses.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At that time, I used to work as a security guard in a building in Makkah, and so I would cling tightly to those books, and the material would stick to my head because what the people in our country did was the opposite of what was in these books, especially Fath-ul-Majeed. After some time had passed, I returned to my country and began to rebuke everything I saw that contradicted what was in those books, such as offering sacrifices to other than Allaah, building shrines over the graves, and calling unto the deceased. So news of this reached the Shiites and they began to censure what I was upon. One of them would say (the hadeeth): <b>“Whoever changes his religion, then kill him.”</b> Another one sent a letter to my relatives saying: “If you don’t prevent him, we will imprison him!” But after that, they agreed to let me enter the Haadee Mosque in order to study with them, so that they may (perhaps) remove the misconceptions that had clung to my heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after that, I was admitted to study with them in the Haadee Mosque. The head of education there was the Judge Mutahhir Hanash. I studied the book <i>Al-‘Aqd-uth-Thameen</i> and <i>ath-Thalaatheen Mas’alah</i>, along with its explanation by Haabis. From the teachers that taught me there was Muhammad bin Hasan al-Mutamayyiz. One time we were discussing the subject of seeing Allaah in the Hereafter, so he began to mock and ridicule Ibn Khuzaimah and other Imaams of Ahlus-Sunnah, but I used to conceal my creed. Despite that, I was too weak to put my right hand over my left hand during prayer, and I would pray with my hands by my side. We studied the text of al-Azhaar up to the section on Marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also studied an explanation of the Laws of Inheritance from a large book that was above the standard level, but I did not benefit from it. So I saw that the assigned books were not beneficial, except for Grammar, since I studied the books <i>al-Aajroomiyyah</i> and <i>Qatar an-Nadaa</i> with them. Then I asked the Judge, Qaasim bin Yahyaa ash-Shuwayl, to teach me Buloogh al-Maraam. So we started it, but then we were disapproved of, so we left it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when I saw that the assigned study books were of a Shiite and Mu’tazlite nature, I agreed to only take from the books of Grammar. So I studied <i>Qatar an-Nadaa</i> several times under Isma’eel al-Hatbah, may Allaah have mercy on him, in the masjid that I would live in and he would pray in. And he would give us a lot of time and attention. One time, Muhammad bin Hooriyyah came to the masjid and I advised him to abandon astrology (<i>tanjeem</i>). So he advised the people there to kick me out of the study program, but they interceded on my behalf and he kept quiet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the Shiites would pass by me while I was studying <i>Qatar an-Nadaa</i> and say something with the meaning that education would not have any effect on me. But I would just remain silent and benefit from the books on Grammar. I did this until the revolution started in Yemen, when we left our country and settled in Najraan. There I studied with Abul-Husayn Majd-ud-Deen al-Mu’eed and benefited from him particularly in the Arabic Language. I stayed in Najraan for the length of two years. Then when I became sure that the war between the Republic party and the King’s party (in Yemen) was all for the sake of worldly reasons, I resolved to travel to the sacred lands (Makkah/Madeenah) and to Najd. I lived in Najd for one and a half months in a school for Qur’aanic memorization, which was run by Shaikh Muhammad bin Sinaan Al-Hadaa’ee. He was very hospitable to me because he saw that I benefited from the knowledge. And he advised me to stay for a while until he could send me to the Islamic University (of Madeenah). But the environment in Riyaadh changed for me and I decided to travel to Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to work whenever I found work, and I would seek knowledge at night, attending the lessons of Shaikh Yahyaa bin ‘Uthmaan al-Paakistaanee on Tafseer Ibn Katheer, Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree and Saheeh Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I would go over several books and there I met two noble Shaikhs from the scholars of Yemen:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>First:</b> The Judge, Yahyaa al-Ashwal. I would study <i>Subul-us-Salaam</i> of as-San’aanee with him and he would teach me any subject that I asked him about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Second:</b> Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razzaaq ash-Shaahidhee al-Muhwaytee. He would also teach me whatever I asked him about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the educational institute in Makkah opened and I took the entrance exam with a group of students, and I passed, all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most distinguished of our teachers there was Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez as-Subayyal. I, along with a group of students from the institute, would also study with Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad bin Humayd, may Allaah have mercy on him, the book <i>at-Tuhfah as-Saniyyah</i> after ‘Ishaa at the Haram. He, may Allaah have mercy on him, would bring many points of benefit from Ibn ‘Aqeel and other scholars’ explanation. The lessons were above the level of my colleagues, so they began to slip away until he eventually stopped the class.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I also studied along with a group of students with Shaikh Muhammad as-Subayyal, may Allaah preserve him, the subject of the Laws of Inheritance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After staying in the institute for some time, I left to go to my family in Najraan. Then I brought them to live with me in Makkah. We resided there together for the length of my studies in the institute and the Haram itself, which lasted six years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The blessing of studying in the masaajid is well known. Do not ask about the friendly environment and relaxation we felt while in the masaajid. The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) indeed spoke the truth when he said: <b>“A group of people do not gather together in one of the Houses of Allaah, reciting the Book of Allaah and studying it amongst themselves, except that tranquility descends upon them, angels surround them, mercy engulfs them, and Allaah mentions them to those by Him.” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I would spend the day studying in the institute, and all of the lessons would assist my Creed and Religion. Then from after ‘Asr till after the ‘Ishaa prayer, I would go to the Haram and drink from the Zamzam water, about which the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said: <b>“Verily, it is a drink that satiates and a cure for diseases.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we would listen to the speakers that came to Makkah from different lands to perform Hajj or ‘Umrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the teachers that we learned from at the Haram between Maghrib and ‘Ishaa was Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Raashid an-Najdee, author of the book “<i>Tayseer-ul-Wahyain fil-Iqtisaar ‘alal-Qur’aani was-Saheehain</i>”, in which he has errors that we don’t agree with him on. He, may Allaah have mercy on him, used to say: “The authentic ahaadeeth that are not found in the two Saheeh Collections can be counted on one’s fingers.” This statement of his stuck to my mind since I had objections to it. This was all the way until I decided to write “<i>As-Saheeh-ul-Musnad mimmaa laysa fis-Saheehain</i>” after which I became more certain about the falsehood of his statement, Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, he was a man of Tawheed, who had strong knowledge of the Science of Hadeeth and was able to distinguish the authentic from the weak and the defective from the pure with regard to hadeeth. What amazed me about him was that he would call people away from <i>taqleed</i> (blind-following), to the point that he wrote a treatise called “<i>At-Tawaagheet-ul-Muqanna’</i>” [Masked Deities of Falsehood]. So the government, and likewise some of the senior scholars, thought that he intended them by it. So the committee of senior scholars gathered together to debate with him. They said: “Did you intend us and the government with this book?” So he replied: “If you feel that you possess the characteristics that I mentioned in the book, then it includes you. And if you feel that you do not possess those characteristics that I mentioned in the book, then it doesn’t include you.” Thereafter, the book was banned from entering into the Kingdom. I was informed about this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night, he was asked to give a class, but it was as if to only test him. So he began his class with Allaah’s statement: <b>“Follow that which has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not follow false gods besides Him. Little do you remember.”</b> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 3] He followed that with numerous ayaat that prove the prohibition of <i>taqleed</i> (blind-following). After this, he was restricted from teaching at the Haram, and we ask Allaah’s aid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from my teachers at the Grand Mosque (Haram) of Makkah who I benefited from was Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdillaah as-Sumaalee, for I attended his lessons for about seven or more months. And he was an <i>ayah</i> (manifest sign) in terms of knowledge of the narrators used by the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim). I benefited immensely from him in the Science of Hadeeth. All praise to my Lord, since I started seeking knowledge, I didn’t love anything except knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After I completed the intermediate and secondary levels of the educational institute in Makkah, and after completing all of my religious lessons, I moved to Madeenah to go to the Islamic University there. Most of us transferred to the Faculty of Da’wah and Usool-ud-Deen. The most distinguished of those who taught us there were: Shaikh as-Sayyid Muhammad al-Hakeem and Shaikh Mahmood ‘Abdul-Wahhaab Faa’id, both from Egypt. When vacation time came, I feared that time would go by wasted so I joined the Faculty of Sharee’ah, due to two reasons, the first of which was to acquire knowledge:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was since some of the classes there were successive while others were combined. So it was a like a repetition of what we had studied in the Faculty of Da’wah. I completed both Faculty courses, all praise be to Allaah, and I was given two degrees. However, all praise be to Allaah, I give no regard to certificates; what merits recognition in my opinion is knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the same year that I finished the two College courses, an advanced studies program opened in the Islamic University, which they called the Masters program. So I went for the interview exam and passed, all praise be to Allaah. The advanced studies course was on the Science of Hadeeth. All praise be to Allaah, I studied the subject that I loved the most. The most prominent of those who taught us there was Shaikh Muhammad al-Ameen al-Misree, may Allaah have mercy on him, Shaikh As-Sayyid Muhammad al-Hakeem al-Misree, and during the last part of my studies, Shaikh Hammaad bin Muhammad al-Ansaaree. On some nights, I would attend the classes of Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz in the Prophet’s Mosque (in Madeenah) on the subject of Saheeh Muslim. I would also attend the gatherings of Shaikh Al-Albaanee, which were specified to only the students of knowledge, in order to learn from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While I was in Makkah, I would teach some of the students of knowledge from the books <i>Qatar-un-Nadaa</i>and <i>at-Tuhfah as-Saniyyah</i>. And while I was in Madeenah, I would teach some of my brothers the book <i>at-Tuhfah as-Saniyyah</i> in the Prophet’s Mosque. Then I promised my Muslim brothers that I would hold classes on the <i>Jaami’</i> (<i>Sunan</i>) of at-Tirmidhee, <i>Qatar-un-Nadaa</i> and <i>Al-Baa’ith-ul-Hatheeth</i> for them in my house after ‘Asr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So a great wave of Da’wah spread from Madeenah, which filled the world in the time-span of six years. It was some righteous people who were ones who took on the task of financing it, while Muqbil bin Haadee and his Muslim brothers were the ones who took on the task of teaching their fellow brothers. As for traveling for the purpose of Calling to Allaah throughout all regions of the Kingdom, then this was shared between all of the brothers – the student of knowledge so that he can acquire knowledge and benefit others, and the common person so that he could learn. This was such that many of the common folk benefited and grew to love the (Salafi) Da’wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of our Muslim brothers from amongst the students of knowledge was an Imam of a masjid in Riyadh. One time some people of knowledge rebuked him for using a sutrah. So he said: “We are unable to in front of you, but by Allaah, no one but a common person will get up to teach you the ahaadeeth of the Sutrah.” So he called a brother from the general folk who loved the Da’wah and had memorized the ahaadeeth of the Sutrah from “<i>Al-Lu’lu wal-Marjaan feemataffaqa ‘alayhi ash-Shaikhaan</i>.” So he got up and narrated these ahaadeeth, after which the opposers felt ashamed and stayed quiet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this, the blind followers and the scholars of evil began to set in motion, and the reason for this stirring of the blind-followers, who were considered scholars in the eyes of the people, was because whenever they would find a young student of knowledge amongst our students and they would use a hadeeth as proof, the student would say to them: “Who reported the hadeeth?” And this was something they were not accustomed to. Then he would say to them: “What is the status (i.e. grading) of the hadeeth?” This was something that they also weren’t accustomed to. So they would embarrass them in front of the people. And sometimes the student would say to them: “This is a weak hadeeth. There is so and so in its chain of narration and so and so declared him weak.” So upon hearing this, it is as if the earth would become constricted beneath these blind-followers. And they would then go about spreading lies that these students were Khawaarij, when in fact the brothers were not from the Khawaarij who make it lawful to shed a Muslim’s blood and who deem a Muslim a disbeliever on the count of sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there would occur some errors on the part of some of the new brothers, and this was because the beginner is almost always overwhelmed with excessive zeal. At that time, I was preparing my Master’s dissertation, when all of a sudden one night, before I knew what was happening, they arrested me and arrested almost one hundred and fifty others. Some people were able to escape, but the earth trembled between those who opposed and those who agreed with out arrest. We remained in prison for a month or a month and a half. After that we were set free, all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shortly after this, the treatises from Juhaymaan were released and a group of us were again arrested. [2] During the interrogation, they asked me: “Where you the one who wrote this?” What, Juhaymaan can’t write? So I denied this, and Allaah knows that I didn’t write it nor did I assist in any part of it. But after staying in jail for three months, an order was made for foreigners to be deported.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I arrived at Yemen, I went back to my village and stayed there for a while teaching the children Qur’aan. Before I knew it, it seemed like the whole world was in an all-out battle against me. It was as if I had come out to destroy the country, the Religion and the rulership. At that time, I didn’t know any leader or tribal chief. So I would say: “Allaah is sufficient for me and the best of Guardians.” When things would get tight, I would go to San’aa or to Haashid or to Dhimmaar, and also to Ta’iz, Ibb and Hudaydah to give Da’wah and to visit the Muslims brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After some days, some good-doers sent me my library from Madeenah. They sent the books to Sa’adah where the head of shipments there was malicious of the Sunnah. Some of our companions went to request the books from him, so he said: “Come back after Dhuhr, Allaah willing.” But he didn’t return after Dhuhr. Instead, some Shiites mobilized and requested the caretakers to confiscate the books because they were Wahaabbi books!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do not ask about the monetary fees, hardships and injustice that occurred to me as a result of trying to get my books! Many of the brothers from the inhabitants of my country made great efforts to follow that up, including Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Husayn al-Ahmar, Shaikh Hazaa’ Dab’aan, the caretakers of the Guidance and Counseling Center, such as the Judge Yahyaa al-Fasayyal, may Allaah have mercy on him, and brother ‘Aa’id bin ‘Alee Mismaar. After a long difficulty, the people of Sa’adah sent a telegraph to the President ‘Alee bin ‘Abdillaah bin Saalih, so he assigned the case to the judge, ‘Alee as-Samaan. The judge sent me a letter and promised that he would turn over the library to me. And he said: “The people of Sa’adah are very strict. They call the scholars of San’aa disbelievers.” So I went to San’aa to get my books. Allaah decreed that my books arrive there while the judge ‘Alee Samaan was out of the country on a mission. So when some of the brothers went to ask for it, the head of the Ministry of Endowments told them: “These books need to be inspected.” So some of our Muslim brothers at the Center for Guidance and Counseling mobilized and went to request the books. So they said: “These books are under our jurisdiction. We must examine them, so whatever is upright, we will hand over to al-Waadi’ee and whatever violates the Religion, we will keep it with us.” So by doing this, they discovered that the books were in fact purely religious and turned the them over to me without inspecting them, so may Allaah reward them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I brought the books into my country, all praise be to Allaah. And my close ones, may Allaah reward them, built a small library and a small masjid. And they said: “We will pray Jumu’ah here to avoid hardships and problems. Sometimes we would pray there with only six people present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One time the governor Haadee al-Hasheeshi asked for me, so I went to Shaikh Qaa’id Majlee, may Allaah have mercy on him, who then called him and said: “What do you want from al-Waadi’ee?” He said: “Nothing, except to get to know him.” So he said: “We will look for him in his institute.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another instance, some other leader asked for me and so Husayn bin Qaa’id Majlee went with me to see him. He (Majlee) began to talk against the Shee’ah and explain to him that we call to the Qur’aan and the Sunnah and that the Shee’ah hate us because of that because they fear that the truth will come out about them, so this leader said: “Indeed, the Shiites have tainted the history of Yemen, so as long as your Da’wah (call) is as you say it is, then call to it and we are with you.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this I spent some time with my library. Only a few days had passed when some Egyptian brothers came and we started classes on some of the books of Hadeeth and the Arabic Language. After this, students continued to come from Egypt, Kuwait, the Sacred Lands (Makkah and Madeenah), Najd, ‘Aden, Hadramaut, Algeria, Libya, Somalia, Belgium, and other Muslim and non-Muslim countries.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The number of students has now reached between six to seven hundred students, amongst which are a hundred and seventy families.[3] And Allaah is the One who provides them with sustenance. And all of this is not because of our might or power, nor due to the amount of knowledge we have or because of our courage or eloquence in speech. Rather, this is something that Allaah willed to be. So He was the One, all praise to Allaah, that granted us this blessing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[End of Translation of Shaikh Muqbil’s Autobiography]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>His Death:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee passed away on the 2nd of Jumaadal-Oolaa, 1422H (7/21/2001) due to a liver disease that he was suffering from for a long time, and due to which he traveled to America, Germany and Saudi Arabia during the last part of his life to seek treatment for. He was around seventy years of age when he died in Jeddah. His funeral prayer was held in Makkah and he was buried in the Al-‘Adl Cemetery near the graves of Shaikhs Ibn Baaz and Ibn Al-‘Uthaimeen, may Allaah have mercy on all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>The Scholars’ Praise for him:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> “Tell him that I consider him to be a mujaddid.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Al-Albaanee said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“So degrading and belittling these two Shaikhs (Rabee&#8217; and Muqbil), who call to the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and what the Salaf As-Saalih were upon and who wage war against those who oppose this correct methodology. As is quite clear to everyone, it either comes from one of two types of people. Either it comes from someone who is ignorant or someone who follows his desires&#8230; If he is ignorant, then he can be taught. But if he is one who follows his desires, then we seek Allaah&#8217;s refuge from the evil of this person. And we ask Allaah, Mighty and Sublime, to either guide him or break his back.&#8221;</span> [The Audio series <i>Silsilah al-Hudaa wan-Noor</i>: 1/851]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee said about him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“He is the mujaddid in the lands of Yemen” and that he said: “there can’t be found from the time of ‘Abdur-Razaaq as-San’aanee to this present day someone who established the Da’wah and revived it as the likes of Al-Waadi’ee.”</span> [4]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> In her biographical account of her father, Umm ‘Abdillaah Al-Waadi’iyyah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“His father died while he was young and he didn’t know him. So he grew up as an orphan and under the care of his mother for a period of time. She would ask him to work to make money and order him to look at the state of his community so that he could be like them. But he would turn away from this and say: ‘I will go out to study.’ So she would say: ‘May Allaah guide you.’ She would supplicate for him to be guided, as several women who were around at that time informed me. Perhaps her supplication coincided with the time when supplications are accepted since he became one of the guided, guiding others.” </span>[<i>Nubdhah Mukhtasarah</i>: pg. 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> This refers to Juhaymaan bin Muhammad al-‘Utaybee, a deviant from Saudi Arabia who took over the Grand Mosque of Makkah with hundreds of followers in 1979, and held it for several days, after which the senior scholars allowed force to be used in the sacred site of the Ka’bah in order to regain it. The Saudi National Guard subdued them about two weeks later after much blood was shed and casualties were lost on the part of the rebels and the Saudi army. The remaining dissidents that were captured were later beheaded. Shaikh Al-Albaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) mentioned this Juhaymaan in his book <i>as-Saheehah</i> (5/872), saying: “…And like the followers of the Saudi Juhaymaan, who caused the fitnah in the Grand Mosque in Makkah at the beginning of the 1400’s (Hijree). He claimed that the awaited Mahdee was with him and sought from those present in the Mosque to give him <i>bay’ah</i> (allegiance). Some of the simple-minded, heedless and evil people followed him.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>CHARACTERISTICS OF THE PEOPLE OF KNOWLEDGE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Commander of the Believers (radhi Allaahu anhu) has described this category from the carriers of knowledge with certain attributes:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among them is that: “<strong>Through them, the knowledge is fortified upon the reality of evidences</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this is that the knowledge directs them to the highest of goals and this is the awareness of Allaah. Thus they fear Him and love Him to the point that everything that is difficult upon others becomes easy for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they do not look for a way towards that which others seek a way towards, from those who stop with this worldly life, its attractions and its pleasures. And from those who have pride in that and do not spread the knowledge, exaltation and honoring of Allaah in their hearts. Rather, they are the ones who turn towards that which the self-sufficient ones have abandoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily, the self-sufficient one, who has fallen and given into the desires of the world and its pleasures, finds difficulty in abandoning its desires and pleasures. This is because there is no substitute that could replace his desire for this world if he were to abandon it. So he does not have the patience to abandon it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the hearts of this type of people, for what they seek a way towards, is the biggest substitute over the desire to acquire the knowledge of Allaah and the love and honor for Him. This is as Al-Hasan (rahimahullaah) used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, the ones who love Allaah are only those who inherit the good life and taste its pleasures due to what they seek a way towards, such as the private attachment to their Beloved (Allaah), and due to what they find from the sweetness of their love for Him in their hearts.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These individuals only befriend that which the ignorant feel repelled by because those who are ignorant about Allaah are opposed to abandoning the worldly life and its pleasures. And this is because they don’t know anything that can compare to it (i.e. the worldly life) and thus it is that which they love and befriend. On the other hand, these individuals feel repelled by that and instead find love in Allaah, His remembrance, awareness of Him, love for Him, and the recitation of His Book. Meanwhile, those who are ignorant about Allaah feel repelled by these things and do not find any love or enjoyment in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another of their attributes, which the Commander of the Believers described them with, was that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong>They accompany the world with their bodies while their souls are drawn towards the great abode</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that they do not take this world as their home nor are they content with it as a place of residence or a place of rest. Indeed, they only see it as a transition and they do not take it as a final abode. All of the messengers and revealed Books advised towards this aspect. Allaah informed us in His Book of the believing man from the house of Pharaoh who said to his people while he was lecturing them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O my people! Truly, the life of this world is nothing but a (quick passing) transition, and verily, the Hereafter that is the home that will remain forever.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Ghaafir: 39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) said to Ibn ‘Umar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> “Be in this world as if you were a stranger or a passer-by.”</strong> [34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is to be in this world as if you did not exist and in the next life as if you did not cease to exist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another report it is stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Count yourself amongst the inhabitants of the graveyards.”</strong> [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the advice that the Maseeh ‘Eesaa gave, was his words to his companions: <strong>“Pass through it and do not become an inhabitant of it.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he also said:<strong> “Who is the one who will build a home upon the waves of the ocean? This is the worldly life, so do not take it as a home that will last forever.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the believer, in this world is like the stranger crossing through a land other than his own, longing for his homeland and the day when he will return to it. He makes provision of what is necessary for his path back homeward. He does not compete for status with the people of the land he is passing through. Nor does he grieve over the degradation he experiences while amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Fudayl bin ‘Iyaad (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The believer in this world is worried and distressed. His main concern is to repair his equipment (as one who is stranded fixes his vehicle).”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The believer in this world is like a stranger. He does not become upset when it (the world) degrades him, nor does he compete with others with regard to what it gives of honor. For him is a condition and for the people is a condition.” </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality, the believer is a stranger in this world because his forefather (Aadam) used to originally reside in the eternal abode and was then cast out from it. So he is constantly longing to return to his first place of residence. And he is always concerned with returning to the home from which he was cast out of.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is as is said: “Love of one’s homeland is part of Faith.” [36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as it is said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;How many homes in the world does the young man take charge of. Yet his longing will forever be for his first home.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of our scholars [37] have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“So rush to the Gardens of Eden for indeed<br />
It is your original home, and in it is a place of rest.<br />
However, we are in the captivity of the enemy, so don&#8217;t you see?<br />
Shall we return to our homes and find peace?<br />
And it has been determined that when the stranger is far away<br />
and his home has disappeared, then he is lost.<br />
So what type of strangeness is greater than our strangeness<br />
which the enemies amongst us have manifested?&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[36] This statement is based on a fabricated hadeeth: “Love of ones homeland is part of Eemaan (Faith).” Imaam Al-Albaanee declared it mawdoo’ (fabricated) and he listed several scholars from the past that held the same opinion. It is perhaps for this reason, that the author (Ibn Rajab) has not attributed it to the Prophet, but merely claimed it as a saying. However, the meaning of the statement itself seems to be incorrect. The scholars have discussed various meanings for it. What is the most correct is that if it is used as a saying, then it is correct in the context that the author (Ibn Rajab) has put it in here, in the sense that the homeland refers to the original abode of Paradise. Therefore, the love for this original abode is from the aspects of Faith. The saying taken in any other sense would breed love for nationalism and party spirit and these two are abhorred and detested in the Religion. Refer to Imaam Al-Albaanee’s long discussion of this statement in his al-Ahaadeeth ad-Da’eefah (vol. 1, no.36).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Some people would go on the pilgrimage (Hajj) with Muslims and not bring any provisions or supplies with them. They would do this claiming that they were putting their trust in Allaah and that they would be provided for without them having to bring provisions along with them. So Allaah said: <b>“And take provision with you for the journey, but indeed the best provision is Taqwaa (righteousness)”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 197], ordering them to take provisions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Provisions are of two types: The Provision of this world and the provision of the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The provision of the worldly life comes in the form of food, drink, clothes, and all of the other things that a person needs when he travels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the provision for the journey in the Hereafter, then it is Taqwaa. Allaah says: <b>“But indeed the best provision is Taqwaa.”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 197]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So take provisions for your worldly life and take provisions for your Hereafter. Take provisions for your worldly life with food, drink and the necessary supplies for traveling so that you will not need to depend on others. And take provisions for your Hereafter with Taqwaa, which can be defined as implementing Allaah’s commandments while abandoning His prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what is meant by Taqwaa is taking a wiqaayah, or a defense that protects you from Allaah’s punishment and anger, and protects you from the Fire. Such a defense can only be achieved by performing righteous actions. And with the Taqwaa of Allaah you will be able to save yourself from the Hellfire, as Allaah says: <b>“Then We shall save those who used to fear Allaah and were dutiful to Him. And We shall leave the wrongdoers therein (humbled) to their knees (in Hell).”</b> [Surah Maryam: 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, nothing grants salvation except for righteous deeds. Faith in Allaah and righteous deeds are the provisions of the Hereafter, and they are a protection from His anger, His fire and His punishment. The servant is commanded to seek after the requirements of his religious and worldly affairs. He is obligated to seek after the requirements of his affairs of this life and the next. He is obligated to put his trust in Allaah and to implement the means. So there must be a combination of this and that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one should understand the meaning of relying upon Allaah to be: Abandoning the require means. This is wrong. Nor should anyone understand that implementing the means suffices over putting one’s trust in Allaah. Rather, both – (1) relying upon Allaah and (2) implementing the required means – must be present.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question 27</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Question: </b>What is your opinion concerning people who sleep throughout the day in Ramadaan? Some of them pray in congregation while others do not. Is their fast valid?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer: </b>The fast of these types of people is valid and they have fulfilled their responsibility. However, it is very deficient and in opposition to what Allaah’s objective is behind fasting. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“O you who believe. Fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you in order that you may gain Taqwaa (fear and dutifulness to Allaah).”</b> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 183]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Whoever does not abandon false speech, acting upon that (falsehood) and ignorance, then Allaah has no need of him abandoning his food and drink.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">It is well known that missing the prayer and not showing any concern for it is not from Taqwaa (dutifulness to Allaah) nor is it from abandoning acting on falsehood.</span> <span style="color:#ff0000;">So it contradicts what Allaah and His Messenger intended by the obligation of fasting.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is strange that these people sleep the entire day and then spend the whole night awake. Perhaps they may even spend the night engaged in vain pastimes that have no benefit or in doing something unlawful by which they would be acquiring sin.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So my advice to these individuals and their likes is that they fear Allaah and ask Him to help them observe the fast in the manner that He is pleased with, which is <span style="color:#333300;"><strong>spending the fast engrossed in dhikr (remembrance) of Allaah, recitation of the Qur’aan, praying and showing kindness to the creation as well as doing other things mandated in the Religion</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) was the most generous of people, and the most generous that he would be was in the month of Ramadaan when Jibreel would meet him and teach him the Qur’aan. So during this time, the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would be more generous in spreading good than a pleasant breeze. [2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question 23</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Question: </b>Should children below the age of fifteen be ordered to fast as in the case with prayer?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer: </b>Yes, children who have not yet reached the age of puberty should be ordered to fast if they are able to do it. This is what the Companions would do with their children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars have stated that a guardian should order whichever youth he possesses guardianship over to fast so that they could practice it and become attached to it, and so that the foundations of Islaam could become instilled in their souls to the point that it becomes like second-nature to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, they are not required to fast if doing so will be difficult on them or bring harm to them. I would like to point out here an issue that some fathers or mothers do, and that is preventing their children from fasting, in direct opposition to what the Companions used to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They claim that they are preventing their children from fasting out of mercy and compassion for them. But the reality is that mercy for one’s children is in ordering them to practice the rites of Islaam and to grow accustomed and attached to them. This without a doubt is from the best and most complete forms of raising and cultivating one’s children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“Verily a man is a guardian for the members of his household and he will be questioned as to his flock.”</b> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (no. 2409) and Muslim (no. 1829)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That which is required for guardians with respect to those whom Allaah has given them authority over, such as family members and youth, is that they fear Allaah with regard to them and order them with what they were commanded to order them, such as implementing the rites of Islaam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Question 14</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>Question: </b>What is the ruling on fasting in Ramadaan when one does not pray?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer: </b>The one who fasts but does not pray, his fasting is of <strong>no use</strong> to him, <strong>nor will it be accepted</strong> from him, <strong>nor will it free him from his indebtedness (of prayer)</strong>. In fact, fasting is not required on him so long as he does not pray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since one who does not pray <strong>is like a Jew and a Christian</strong>. So what do you think about a Jew or a Christian that fasts but yet remains upon his religion – is it accepted from him? No. Therefore, we say to this individual: “<strong>Repent to Allaah by praying, and (then) fast</strong>.” And whoever turns to Allaah in repentance, Allaah will accept his repentance.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge means: The statements of Allaah and His Messenger and the statements of the Sahaabah (Companions), along with the unanimous agreement of the scholars (ijmaa’) and correct logical conclusion (qiyaas).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the Qur’aan and Sunnah must be understood in light of the understanding of the Companions and those who followed them in goodness. This is the Way of the Believers, as Allaah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَمَن يُشَاقِقِ الرَّسُولَ مِن بَعْدِ مَا تَبَيَّنَ لَهُ الْهُدَى وَيَتَّبِعْ غَيْرَ<br />
سَبِيلِ الْمُؤْمِنِينَ نُوَلِّهِ مَا تَوَلَّى وَنُصْلِهِ جَهَنَّمَ وَسَاءتْ مَصِيرًا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And whoever opposes the Messenger after the guidance has been made clear to him, and follows a way other than the Way of the Believers, We will turn him to what He has chosen and land him in Hell – what an evil destination.”</span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 115]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How excellent is the statement of the one who said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Knowledge is: (what) Allaah said, (what) His Messenger said, (and what) the Companions said, there being no variance in this. Knowledge is not that you present a difference imprudently between the Messenger and the view of a fool. Nay, nor is it the presenting of a difference ignorantly Between the texts and the view of a Faqeeh (Scholar) Nay, nor is it the rejection of texts intentionally out of fear of falling into tajseem [14] and tashbeeh.” [15]</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awzaa’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Knowledge is what the Companions of Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم have reported. Anything beyond this is not knowledge.”</strong> [16]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Az-Zuhree, may Allaah have mercy on him, would write down the statements of the Taabi’een, and Saalih bin Kaysaan would oppose him in this. Later, he felt remorse for having abandoned that. [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also the path that Abu Haneefah An-Nu’maan followed, may Allaah have mercy on him and be pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Mubaarak, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “I heard Abu Haneefah say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> ‘When something is reported from the Prophet, we take it. And when something is reported from the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, we choose from their opinions. And when something is reported from the Taabi’een, we contest with them (with our views as to which is correct).’”</strong> [18]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the same path taken by Maalik bin Anas Al-Asbahee, the Imaam of Madeenah, may Allaah have mercy on him and be pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When his book al-Muwatta’ was mentioned to him, Maalik said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“It contains the hadeeth of Allaah’s Messenger and the statement(s) and opinion(s) of the Sahaabah and the Taabi’een. I also voiced my opinion based on Ijtihaad (scholarly deduction) and on what I found the people of knowledge upon in our lands, not transgressing that for the views of others.”</strong> [19]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also the path that Ash-Shaafi’ee adhered to, may Allaah have mercy on him and be pleased with him. [20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Knowledge is of several categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>First</strong></span>: The Book and the Sunnah, if it is an authentically reported Sunnah;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Second</strong></span>: The unanimous agreement of the scholars in those matters in which proof from the Book and the Sunnah cannot be found;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Third</strong></span>: When some (or one) of the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said something and we don’t know of any opposition to that from the rest of them;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Fourth</strong></span>: When the Companions of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم differed among themselves, yet he صلى الله عليه وسلم did not object to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Fifth</strong></span>: Qiyaas (analytical deduction) of one of these categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should not go to another source apart from the Book and the Sunnah so long as they are both present (i.e. proof is found in them). Knowledge should be taken from the highest source.” [21]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was also the way of Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy on him and be pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahmad bin Muhammad bin Hanbal said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“If a hadeeth from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم exists on an issue, we should not take the opinion of someone else that is in opposition to it – regardless if he is one of the Companions or those that came after them.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And if there exist conflicting views from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger on a particular issue, we may choose from their opinions. However, we do not transgress from their opinions to the views of someone else.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And if no statement from the Prophet or his Companions exists on an issue, we may choose from the opinions of the Taabi’een…”</strong> [22]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Al-Hasan said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever is knowledgeable of the Book and the Sunnah, and of the opinions of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, and the views favored by the Muslim Fiqh scholars is allowed to exert his opinion by way of (scholarly) Ijtihaad in those matters in which he finds difficulty, thus ruling by it and implementing it in his prayer, fast, Hajj, and all of the other things he was commanded and prohibited to do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if he exerts his efforts to come up with an opinion, and investigates and applies analytical deduction, and still doesn’t come up with the correct view, he is permitted to act on his resulting view, even if he did err in attaining the correct view that should be followed.” [23]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin Al-Hasan also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> “Knowledge is of four types:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. That which is found in the clear Book of Allaah, and what is analytically deduced from it;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. That which is found in the reported Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger, and what is analytically deduced from it;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. That which the Sahaabah (Companions), may Allaah have mercy on them, unanimously agreed on, and what is analytically deduced from it;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This also includes the issues they differed on, so long as it doesn’t transgress beyond their views. If one of their opinions is chosen, that (view) is considered knowledge that was analytically arrived at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. That which the majority of the Muslim Fiqh scholars have favored as well as what is analytically deduced from that and which serves as an equivalent to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Knowledge does not exceed the boundaries of these four types.” [24]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>* This foundation consists of several matters, amongst which are:</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. A student of knowledge should accustom himself to connect issues with their evidences from the Book and the Sunnah, according to the understanding of the pious predecessors (Salaf as- Saalih). This is where the importance of the books written on the rulings found in ayaat and ahaadeeth and the books on the narrations of the Companions comes in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>2. The Sunnh of the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم is divided into two types:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. The apparent Sunnah, which is explicitly clear, and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">B. The unapparent Sunnah, which is not explicitly clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the first type of Sunnah, which is the clear and apparent Sunnah, then it refers to what is clearly attributed to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم from statements, actions, tacit approvals, behavioral descriptions and physical attributes. This is considered “the Sunnah” according to the scholars of Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the categories above, those that are related to religious rulings, and which serve to establish obligations and laws, are: his صلى الله عليه وسلم statements, actions, and tacit approvals. This is why the scholars that formulate principles (Usooliyoon) and those that excel in Jurisprudence (Fuqahaa) have limited the definition of the Sunnah to just these categories, since their main objective was just to clarify the religious laws.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second type of Sunnah, which is the Sunnah that is not explicitly clear, refers to that which is attributed to one of the Companions for which there is no room for opinions in the matter or that which takes on the ruling of being raised to a saying or action of the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This consists of the following scenarios:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. When a Companion makes a statement on a matter in which there is no room for one’s opinion to enter into it (i.e. so naturally he received knowledge of it from the Prophet);</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">B. When a Companion issues an opinion and there is no text that contradicts it;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">C. When a Companion explains the circumstances under which a verse from the Qur’aan was revealed, in a clear manner;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">D. When a Companion explains something that has been reported;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">E. What has been reported from the Companions concerning their difference of opinion in the description of acts of worship;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">F. What has been reported from the Companions, in that which is known as “Interpretative Recitation”;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">G. What has been reported from them as interpretations of the noble Qur’aan from some of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is for this reason that a student of knowledge must strive to find out what has been reported on the Companions with regard to issues of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are some shortcomings that occur in this aspect, and that is due to several reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: There is a general lack of concern for finding out which narrations are authentic from which are weak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: Verifying the opinion of a Companion on an issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third: Discrediting the ascription of an opinion to a Companion before verifying if it was the last of the views he had on the issue or not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. In order to fully implement this principle, you must know that it is not permissible for us to introduce an opinion on a particular issue that is outside the realm of their views.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their statements – may Allaah have mercy on them – show a unanimous agreement on this approach. So whoever transgresses beyond the fold of their views has departed from the path of the believers. We also just recently quoted their statements in this regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abul-Mudhfar As-Sama’aanee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We were ordered to follow and encouraged to do that. And we were prohibited from innovating as well as warned against it. The trademark of Ahlus-Sunnah is their following of the Salaf whilst abandoning everything that is innovated and newly-introduced.” [25]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Whoever interprets the Qur’aan or the Hadeeth, explaining them in a way that is different from the well-known interpretations of the Companions and Successors, is fabricating a lie on Allaah, denying Allaah’s verses and distorting words from their proper places. This is opening the door to heresy and atheism. The falsehood of this is known in the religion of Islaam by necessity.”</strong> [26]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not for anyone to interpret a verse or a hadeeth in a manner that contradicts the interpretation of the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger, may Allaah be pleased with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Rajab, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And in our time – I say: And in our time, this applies even more [27] – the recording of the statements of the exemplary Salaf is restricted to the time of Ash-Shaafi’ee, Ahmad, Ishaaq and Abu ‘Ubayd. So let the individual beware of what was introduced after them, for indeed there were many innovations that were introduced after their time. And there appeared those who ascribed themselves to following the Sunnah and the Hadeeth, such as the Dhaahirees and their likes who are the greatest in opposing it (i.e. the Sunnah) due to their deviation from the Imaams and their isolation from them in coming up with an understanding (of the texts), or their taking a view that the Imaams before them never held.” [28]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say:<br />
Ahmad bin Hanbal, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Beware of speaking on an issue for which you do not have an Imaam (i.e. scholar who preceded you in it).” </strong>[29]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. It is due to this principle – which is understanding the Glorious Qur’aan and the Prophetic Sunnah in light of the understanding of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them – that you will not find Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, the people of Hadeeth, engaging in the interpretation of the glorious Qur’aan or the explanation of the meanings of the Hadeeth from a linguistic and intellectual standpoint. Rather, you will find them investigating into the narrations, compiling the reports of the Salaf in their books, and basing their understanding and analytical deductions on that, contrary to the people of innovations and desires!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Murji’ah have deviated concerning this foundation (i.e. Eemaan) from what is clearly stated in the Qur’aan, the Sunnah and the statements of the Companions and those who follow them in righteousness. Instead, they have relied on their personal views and on the perverted interpretations they have reached from their understanding of the (Arabic) language. This is the way of the people of innovation. And this is why Imaam Ahmad would say: ‘The majority of the time that people fall into error is due to misinterpretation and incorrect analogy.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why we find the Mu’atazilah, the Murji’ah, the Raafidah and other groups of innovators interpreting the Qur’aan with their own opinions and intellects and what they understand from it linguistically. As a result of this, you will find that they do not rely on the narrations of the Prophet, the Companions, the Successors or the Muslim Imaams. So they neither rely on the Sunnah nor do they rely on the unanimous consensus or reports of the Salaf. Rather, they just rely on the intellect and the language.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also do not find them relying on the recorded books of Tafseer and Hadeeth and the narrations of the Salaf. Instead, they only rely on the books of literature and rhetoric that their leaders fabricated. This is also the way of the heretics. They only accept what is in the books of philosophy, literature and language. As for the books on Qur’aan, Hadeeth and Narrations, they do not give any importance to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These individuals turn away from the texts of the Prophets since according to them, they do not produce any knowledge!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they are the ones who interpret the Qur’aan according to their own personal views and understanding, without resorting to any of the narrations of the Prophet and his Companions. We already mentioned previously the statements of Imaam Ahmad and others which show the prohibition of this and an indication that this is the way of the people of innovation.” [30]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Innovations only entered into the beliefs of the innovators because of the fact that they turned away from this path and began to base the Religion of Islaam on leads that were not correct, either due to what the verbatim indicated or what was understood from the meanings. They did not reflect on the explanation that came from Allaah and His Messenger. All leads that contradict the explanation of Allaah and His Messenger are considered misguidance.” [31]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Disregarding the ahaadeeth and narrations of the Salaf while relying on just the language and intellect to understand the Qur’aan and Hadeeth is a method that has been embarked upon in recent times by the Orientalists. So when they need to research a narration, they simply quote from the books of Al-Jaahidh or from the book al-Aghaanee or from al-‘Aqd-ul-Fareed. And if quoting becomes hard on them, they just say: “This conforms to the intellect!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Contrary to this, a Muslim who follows what the Prophet and his Companions were upon confines his comprehension and understanding of the Glorious Qur’aan and Prophetic Sunnah to conform to the understanding of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, and doesn’t leave from their fold.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if he must resort to Ijtihaad (scholarly deduction) or investigation on an issue, he searches if there is someone before him (Salaf) that held that view so that he may follow him, and if not, he leaves it alone. This is since all good lies in following those who preceded (Salaf), while all evil lies in the innovating of those who came after (Khalaf). So stick to the early generation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fifth Provision: The Caller must destroy the obstacles that stand between him and the people</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Caller must destroy the obstacles that stand between him and the people. This is since many of our brothers who are Callers, when they see people committing some evil, their over-protectiveness and hatred for this evil causes them to not go to these people and advise them. This is an error and it is not from wisdom at all. Rather, wisdom mandates that you go to them and invite them (i.e. give them da’wah), that you convey to them the truth, inciting them and intimidating them (with the Qur’aan and the Sunnah). Do not say that these people are sinners and that I cannot walk amongst them. O Muslim Caller, if you can’t walk amongst these people and go to them to call them to Allaah, then who will take charge of them? Won’t one of those individuals take charge of them? Won’t people who have no knowledge take charge of them? This should never be. This is why the Caller must have patience. And doing this is part of the patience that we talked about previously that the Caller must have. He must have patience and hate these evils. However, he must break the barriers between him and the people, such that he is able to bring his da’wah (call) to those who are in need of it. But as for him being haughty, then this is in opposition to what the Messenger (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) used to do. As is well known, the Prophet would go to the polytheists in their gathering places and call them to Allaah. And it has been reported on the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) that he said: “<em><strong>Will not someone take me so that I may convey the words of my Lord, for indeed Quraish has prevented me from conveying the Words of my Lord</strong></em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the habit of our Prophet, our Imaam and our role model Muhammad <em>(sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>). So it is obligatory upon us to be like him when calling (Da’wah) to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>From the ideologies of disbelief that contradict the authentic Creed and oppose what the messengers came with is:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What the <strong>atheists</strong> of this era believe in, such as the followers of <strong>Marx</strong>, <strong>Lenin</strong> and others who call to atheism and disbelief, regardless of whether they call that <strong>socialism</strong>, <strong>communism</strong>, <strong>ba’athism</strong> or any other name, for indeed from the base principles of these atheists is the belief that there is no god and that life is only (based on) matter. And from their principles is to reject the Day of Final Return, Paradise, Hellfire, and to disbelieve in all of the religions. Whoever examines their books and studies what beliefs they were upon will come to know that with full certainty. No doubt this belief is in contradiction to all of the heavenly revealed religions and leads its followers to the worst of fates in this world and the Hereafter.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>From the apparent signs of condemning is:</strong> Exposing someone’s evil and propagating it under the pretense of advising, while claiming that it is only these defects that are making him do it, general or specific. Meanwhile, on the inside, his aim is only to condemn and cause harm.[33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he is from the brothers of the hypocrites, those whom Allaah has disparaged in His Book in many places, for indeed Allaah disparages those who outwardly display a good action or saying, while intending inwardly to accomplish a mischievous and evil goal. And He has counted that as one of the aspects of hypocrisy, as is stated in Surah Baraa,[34] in which He humiliates the hypocrites and exposes their despicable attributes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And as for those who set up a masjid in order to cause harm, (spread) disbelief, disunite the believers and to make it as an outpost for those who made war against Allaah and His Messenger since aforetime, they will indeed swear that their intention is nothing but good. But Allaah bears witness that they are certainly liars.”</span> [Surah At-Tawbah: 107]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done, and love to be praised for what they have not done – do not think that they are rescued from the torment. And for them is a painful punishment!”</span> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 188]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This ayah was sent down concerning the Jews, when the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم asked them about something and they concealed knowledge of it informing him instead of something else. Yet they showed to him that they had indeed informed him about what he had asked them. And they sought praise from him صلى الله عليه وسلم because of it and became joyous at what they gained by concealing it and because he صلى الله عليه وسلم asked them. This is what Ibn ‘Abbaas radhi Allaahu anhu stated and his hadeeth concerning that is transmitted in the two Saheeh collections. [35]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree radhi Allaahu anhu said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“There was a group of men among the hypocrites who when the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم would go out to fight in the (military) expeditions, would refrain from going with him. And they would be happy with opposing the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم with their sitting (instead of fighting). So when Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم would arrive, they would make excuses for themselves and swear to him. And they loved to be praised for that which they did not do. So this ayah was revealed.”</span> [36]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, these characteristics are the characteristics of the Jews and the hypocrites. And it is that someone outwardly displays a saying or an action, while presenting an image in which he appears to be upon good. Yet his intention in doing that is to accomplish an evil goal. So he is praised for what good he has made manifest outwardly, while accomplishing by it, the evil goal he has kept hidden inwardly. And he basks in the praise he receives for that which he has outwardly portrayed as being good, which is in fact evil on the inside, and he is happy that his evil hidden objective has been achieved. So his benefit is perfected for him and his scheme is carried out effectively by this deception!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone with this characteristic definitely falls under the (threat) of this ayah &#8211; thus he is threatened with a painful torment. An example of this is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When someone desires to defame a man, belittle him and expose his faults so that people turn away from him. This is done either because he loves to cause harm to him, because of his enmity towards him, or because he fears him due to a rivalry that exists between them with regard to wealth, leadership, or other blameworthy causes. So he does not find a way towards accomplishing his goal, except by publicly degrading him due to some religious reason.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, someone (i.e. a scholar) has refuted a weak opinion from the many opinions of a well-known and famous scholar. So this (evil) individual spreads that amongst those who respect that scholar, saying: “This person (that did the refutation) hates this scholar, and is only defaming and criticizing him.” So by doing this, he (the evil person) deceives all those people that hold that scholar in esteem, making them believe that such a refutation was done out of hatred and with insult on the part of the one refuting, and that his deed was full of audacity and arrogance. So he (the evil person) is (outwardly) defending this scholar and uplifting the abuse from him &#8211; and that is an act pleasing to Allaah and in obedience to Him. So he combines this outer facade of advising with two disgusting and forbidden things: [37]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: The insinuation that this scholar&#8217;s refutation of the other opinion was done out of hatred, seeking to belittle (the other scholar), and as a result of following his desires. But (in reality) he only desires by it to advise the believers and to make known some aspect of knowledge that is unlawful to keep concealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: He (the evildoer) manifests and magnifies the (scholar&#8217;s) criticism (for the other scholar), so that he can fulfill his desire and achieve his evil goal under the pretense of advising and defending the scholars of the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This type of evil plotting is similar to the injustice and oppression displayed by <strong>the tribe of Marwaan</strong> and their followers, who won the people&#8217;s affection and at the same time, turned these people&#8217;s hearts away from &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib, Al-Hasan, Al-Husayn and their offspring, may Allaah be pleased with all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When &#8216;Uthmaan radhi Allaahu anhu was killed, the Muslim nation did not see anyone possessing more right to succeed him other than &#8216;Alee radhi Allaahu anhu, so they pledged allegiance to him. So those who sought to turn the people away from him set about their goal by manifesting the outrageous and scandalous murder of &#8216;Uthmaan. And it was just as they said it was.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But then they added to it that the one who conspired his murder and carried it out was none other than &#8216;Alee radhi Allaahu anhu. And this was a lie and a slander against him! And &#8216;Alee radhi Allaahu anhu would swear and reaffirm his oaths in denying this accusation &#8211; and he was truthful and innocent in his oath, may Allaah be pleased with him. But they began to fight against him, claiming that their struggle was for the sake of the Religion and that it was pleasing to Allaah, and then they began to fight with his children. These individuals strove hard in publicizing this (lie), propagating it on the mimbars on the days of Jumu&#8217;ah, as well as on other occasions in which there were large gatherings. This continued until it settled into the hearts of their followers that the matter was as these individuals said it was, and that the tribe of Marwaan had more right (to the Khilaafah) than &#8216;Alee and his children due to their closeness to &#8216;Uthmaan, and that they had more right to avenge his radhi Allaahu anhu death. So in doing this, they were able to unite the hearts of the people against &#8216;Alee and his sons and to turn the people to fight against him and his children after him. This asserted the kingship for them and their rule became established as a result of that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While in privacy, one of them would say to those he confided in, something with the meaning: &#8220;No one amongst the Companions was more restrained from (causing harm to) &#8216;Uthmaan than &#8216;Alee.&#8221; So it would be said to him: &#8220;Then why did the people revile him?&#8221; So he would respond: &#8220;The kingship (i.e. end of the Khilaafah) would not be established if it weren&#8217;t for that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this is that if they did not turn the people&#8217;s hearts away from &#8216;Alee radhi Allaahu anhu and his children, and if they didn&#8217;t attribute the injustice done to &#8216;Uthmaan to them, the hearts of the people would not feel sympathy for them (later), due to what they knew of their beautiful attributes and honorable qualities, for they used to rush to follow them and pledge allegiance to them (in the past). And because of this, the Umayyah dynasty came to an end and the people ceased obeying them. [38]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[35]Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (9/301), Muslim (17/123), Ahmad (1/298) and Ibn Jareer (4/207).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[36] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (8/233), Muslim (17/123) and Ibn Jareer (4/205). It must be noted here that Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr mentioned in Al-Fath (9/301) that it is possible to combine these two causes for the ayah&#8217;s revelation found in the two hadeeths by saying that it was revealed with regard to both of these groups (Jews and hypocrites). Shaikh Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee said in his As-Saheeh-ulMusnad (pg. 35): &#8220;If the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed is more established then that takes more precedence because the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas is from that which the two Shaikhs have been criticized by, as has been stated in Muqaddimat-ul-Fath (20/132) and as is stated in Fath-ul-Baaree (9/302). And there is no point in restricting it to only the People of the Book…&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[37][Translator&#8217;s Note: We ask the noble readers to consider these precious words stated by the author and compare them with the likes of the situations we find today. No doubt the scholars of the Sunnah in these days are accused in such a manner. Such an example can be found in Imaam Muhammad Naasirud-Deen Al-Albaanee (rahimhullaah) and the lies and attacks that were launched against him by Hasan Saqqaf, Kabbani and their likes, who make themselves appear as though they&#8217;re advising the Muslim ummah. But yet in reality they are doing no more than discrediting, defaming and belittling a scholar. And the claims that come from them are well known in that these scholars, such as Al-Albaanee, who warn against &#8220;blind-following&#8221; are labeled as deviants who hate the four Imaams and who want to do away with their teachings! May Allaah give us the ability to see through the false accusations of the ignorant and the unjust.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[38] See Al-&#8216;Awaasim min-al-Qawaasim of the Qaadee Ibn Al-&#8216;Arabee al-Maalikee (rahimahullaah) for in there is what is sufficient for one who seeks the truth about this subject, Allaah willing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And when you ask them (i.e. Prophet’s wives) for something, then ask them from behind a veil (Hijaab).”</strong> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though the ones intended by this verse were the wives of the Prophet, the verse is general. So the wording in the verse is specific for the Prophet’s wives, while its meaning is universal for all women since the Prophet’s wives are the role-models for the believing women. Allaah explains this thoroughly in His next statement, where He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>ذَلِكُمْ أَطْهَرُ لِقُلُوبِكُمْ وَقُلُوبِهِنَّ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>“That is purer for your hearts and their hearts.”</strong> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah ordered that the women be asked from behind a Hijaab. What is meant by the word Hijaab is: Anything that covers a woman whether a garment, a wall, a door or any other object that can be used to screen a woman from a man when he is talking to her or asking her about something or handing her something. All of these should be done from behind a Hijaab, i.e. from behind a screen or covering. So he should not make any contact with her while she is unscreened or lacking covering and exposed. Rather, she must be behind a screen that covers her, regardless if it is her garment, her door, a wall or so on. This is since this is “purer for your hearts and their hearts” from temptation. If women screen themselves by way of a Hijaab and the gaze of men does not fall upon them, the hearts of both the men and women will be saved from temptation and enticement. This is clearly visible in the Muslim societies that strictly adhere to the Hijaab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A society that strictly adheres to the Hijaab is preserved from the corruption of morals. In fact, it is the lack of Hijaab that results in immorality and the temptation of men’s desires. Therefore Allaah’s saying: “That is purer for your hearts and their hearts” contains a basis that is universal for the whole ummah since the Hijaab consists of a purification of the hearts for both men and women in an equal manner. It blocks all the pathways that lead to the corruption of morals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Commander of the Believers has divided the carriers of knowledge into three categories:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Category One: The People of Doubts</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They consist of the one who has no evidences from the carriers of knowledge. <strong>Doubt</strong> has pierced his heart when it was first presented to him. He grasped it and thus fell into mass <strong>confusion</strong> and <strong>uncertainty</strong>. From that, he came out producing such acts as <strong>innovations</strong> and <strong>misguided affairs</strong>.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Category Two: The People of Desires</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Their portion is of <strong>two types</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first consists of he who <strong>seeks after the worldly life</strong>, under the pretense of desiring knowledge. So he makes knowledge a means of attaining worldly goals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second portion consists of the one who is <strong>overcome with the desire of amassing</strong> worldly gains, its riches and its treasures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">None of these types of people are from amongst the shepherds of the Religion. Rather, their similitude is only like that of the cattle.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For this reason, Allaah the Most High has compared those who were entrusted with the Torah and then failed that trust to donkeys carrying books. And He has compared the learner of evil, the one who detaches himself from the verses of Allaah, clinging onto this world and following his lusts, with the likeness of a dog. The donkey and the dog are the lowest forms of animals and the worst types of examples.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Category Three: The Carriers of Knowledge</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the possessors of knowledge. They uphold it, protect it and establish it upon the evidences and clear proofs of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It already has been stated that they are the fewest of people yet greatest in stature in the sight of Allaah. This is an indication towards their few numbers and towards the strangeness of the carriers of knowledge from this category.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan Al-Basree (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The reciters of the Qur’aan are of three types:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who take it as a commodity and gain their sustenance from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who establish its words, yet neglect its commandments (i.e. read it but don’t practice it). Due to (their knowledge of) it, they act arrogantly towards the people of their land and they use it (the Qur’aan) as a support for gaining positions of authority. These types of people from among the bearers of the Qur’aan are many. May Allaah diminish their number!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also a type of people that apply the remedy of the Qur’aan and thus place it over the sickness of their hearts. Due to it, their battles come to a standstill and they feel compassionate in their burnooses (long capes worn by the people of old). And they feel a sense of fear (of Allaah) and the worries (of the worldly life) have left them. They are the ones upon whom Allaah sends His rain down and He sends victory through them over the enemies. By Allaah, this type of people from among the carriers of the Qur’aan are more honorable than that of flaming torches in the sight of the rest of the reciters of the Qur’aan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, he (rahimahullaah) has informed us that this group – and they are the reciters of the Qur’aan who place it as a cure for their hearts, such that all traces of fear and worry leave them – is more honorable amongst the other reciters than the example of flaming torches.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Third: Humbling Oneself before Allaah and Asking Him for Success and Prosperity</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also ask his Lord to increase him in seeking knowledge, since an individual is destitute and in the utmost need of Allaah. This is why Allaah has encouraged His servants to ask of Him and to lower themselves before Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَقَالَ رَبُّكُمُ ادْعُونِي أَسْتَجِبْ لَكُمْ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Call unto Me, I will respond to you.”</strong></span> [Surah Ghaafir: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Our Lord descends every night to the lowest level of heaven and says: ‘Who is calling Me that I may respond? Who asks of Me that I may give him? Who seeks My forgiveness that I may forgive him?’”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah commanded His Prophet to ask Him for an increase in knowledge, as He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَقُل رَّبِّ زِدْنِي عِلْمًا<br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">“And say: ‘My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.’”</span></strong> [Surah TaHa: 114]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said speaking on behalf of Ibraaheem:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">رَبِّ هَبْ لِي حُكْمًا وَأَلْحِقْنِي بِالصَّالِحِينَ<br />
<strong><span style="color:#008000;">“My Lord! Bestow Hukm (i.e. knowledge) on me, and join me with the righteous.”</span></strong><br />
[Surah Ash-Shua’raa: 83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Hukm refers to knowledge, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “If the Haakim (judge), strives hard performing Ijtihaad…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم supplicated for Abu Hurairah radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu to be granted the ability to memorize. He صلى الله عليه وسلم also supplicated for Ibn ‘Abbaas to be granted knowledge, as he said: <strong>“O Allaah, give him understanding of the Religion, and teach him the ta’weel (interpretation of the Qur’aan).”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah answered His Prophet’s supplication, such that afterward Abu Hurairah radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu didn’t hear anything except that he memorized it and Ibn ‘Abbaas radiya Allaahu &#8216;anhu came to be the scholar of the ummah and the interpreter of the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars have continued to carry on this practice, thus lowering themselves before Allaah and asking Him to grant them knowledge. Look at the example of Shaikh-ul- Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him – He would go to the masaajid, prostrate to Allaah and supplicate to Him, saying: <strong>“O teacher of Ibraaheem, teach me! O educator of Sulaymaan, grant me understanding!”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah answered his supplication, such that Ibn Daqeeq-ul-‘Eid said about him: <strong>“Allaah gathered the knowledge for him to the point that it was as if it (i.e. the knowledge) was between his eyes and he would take what he wished from it and leave off what he wished from it.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Posted from : <a title="Permanent Link to Ten Guidelines for Obtaining Knowledge – Shaykh Abdullaah Adh-Dhufairee" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/30/ten-guidelines-for-obtaining-knowledge-shaykh-abdullaah-adh-dhufairee/" rel="bookmark"><strong>Ten Guidelines for Obtaining Knowledge – Shaykh Abdullaah Adh-Dhufairee. </strong></a>The treatise has been introduced and praised by Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee, one of the elder scholars in Saudi Arabia, thus indicating its importance and benefit. </em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Islaam has also prohibited a man from being in privacy with a woman – which means that he is alone with her in an isolated area with no one else present – since this leads to the occurrence of fitnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“Beware of entering in the presence of women.”</strong> The Companions said: “O Messenger of Allaah, what about the male in-laws (i.e. the husband’s male relatives)?” He صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: <strong>“The male in-laws are death.”</strong> [9] This means: The danger of these family members is greater. Why is this? It’s because a woman is less restrained from her husband’s male relatives as compared to other males. Her refraining from them is minimal. But in spite of this, there must be caution and awareness applied to a husband’s male relatives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for what we hear about today from some ignoramuses that a husband’s brother, paternal uncle or other male relative can greet his wife, shake her hand, be alone with her and enter into her presence – this is baseless. It is not permissible for a nonmahram to enter into the presence of a woman (without Hijaab), nor to shake her hand, nor to be alone in privacy with her unless there is someone else in the house through which the privacy will be removed. But as for him entering into a house that has no one in it but her, and he is not one of her mahaarim, then this is the forbidden type of privacy and it is dangerous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of this is if he enters an empty room – there being no one in there but him and her. This is not permissible since it is a means that leads to fitnah. This is even the case if the man that is alone with her in this private area is a doctor. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“No man is alone in privacy with a woman except that the Devil is the third party amongst them.”</strong> [10] This means that the Devil is present and makes falling into immorality appear pleasant to them. This is since he is always calling to fitnah and takes advantage of this opportunity to spread immorality between them. In order to cut off the pathway of the Devil and his supporters as well as the path to corruption, the Legislator has restricted men from being alone with women.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the new forms of this forbidden type of privacy that has appeared in our times is a <strong>woman riding in a car by herself with a driver that is not mahram to her</strong>. So he takes her to the school, to the market and even to the masjid! This is not permissible. It is not permissible for a woman to ride in her car alone with a driver that is not a mahram to her because this is from the prohibited forms of privacy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>The recompense of one who spreads the evil deeds of his believing brother and seeks after his faults and exposes his defects, is that Allaah will seek after his faults and disgrace him (by exposing them) even if he may have committed them in the privacy of his own home</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is based on what has been reported from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in several places, and Imaam Ahmad, Abu Dawood and At-Tirmidhee have transmitted it from numerous paths of narration. [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhee transmitted from the hadeeth of Waa’ilah Ibn Al-Asqa’ on the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Do not express joy at your brother’s misfortune or else Allaah will pardon him for it and test you with it.”</strong></span> [30]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (At-Tirmidhee) said that it was a hasan ghareeb hadeeth. He also reports the hadeeth of Mu’aadh &#8221; in marfoo’ form: <strong>“Whoever condemns his brother because of a sin (he committed) will not die until he commits it (himself).”</strong> Its chain of narration is munqati’ (broken).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan (Al-Basree) said: “It used to be said:<strong> &#8216;Whoever condemns his brother for a sin that he repented from, will not die until Allaah tests him with it (i.e. the same sin).&#8217;”</strong> [31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is reported from the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood &#8221; with a chain of narration that has weakness in it: <strong>“Affliction is charged by speech. So if a man condemns another man by saying that he breast-fed from a female dog, then that man (who said that) will indeed breast-feed from one.&#8221;</strong> [32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of this has been reported on a group amongst the Salaf. And when Ibn Sireen failed to return a debt he owed and was detained because of it, he said: “Indeed, I am aware of the sin (I committed) by which this befell me. I condemned a man forty years ago saying to him: ‘O bankrupt one.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] The checking for this has been stated previously</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;O you group of people that believe with your tongues but not with your hearts! Do not abuse the Muslims nor seek after their faults. For indeed, he who seeks after their faults, Allaah will seek after his faults. And whoever has Allaah seek after his faults, He will expose them, even if he may have committed them in the privacy of his own home.&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Abu Ya&#8217;laa in his Musnad (1675) and Abu Nu&#8217;aim in Ad-Dalaa&#8217;il (356) on the authority of Al-Baraa&#8217; radhi Allaahu anhu. Al-Haithamee (rahimahullaah) said in Al-Majma&#8217; (8/93): &#8220;Abu Laylaa reported it and its narrators are all reliable. It has also been reported from the hadeeth of Abu Barzah radhi Allaahu anhu with a strong chain of narration in Ahmad (4/421 &amp; 424) and Abu Dawood (4880).” And in this section occurs the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar with a hasan chain of narration in At-Tirmidhee (2033), Al-Baghawee (3526) and Ibn Hibbaan (1494 of the Mawaarid). See also At-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb (3/177) of Al-Mundhiree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[30] At-Tirmidhee reported it under number (2507) and in its chain is Al-Qaasim bin Umayyah Al-Hidhaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Hibbaan mentioned him in Al-Majrooheen (2/213) and said: &#8220;He was a shaikh who reported from Hafs bin Gayyaath many strange and weak narrations. It is not permissible to use him as a support when he is alone (in his narration).&#8221; Then he reported this hadeeth from him and commented upon it, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is no source for this found in the sayings of the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم.&#8221; I say: This hadeeth has also been reported by At-Tabaraanee in Al-Kabeer (22/53), Musnad Ash-Shaamiyeen (384), AlQadaa&#8217;ee in Musnad Ash-Shihaab (917-918) and Abu Nu&#8217;aim in Al-Hilyah (5/186). And it is also succeeded by &#8216;Umar bin Isma&#8217;eel bin Mujaalid found in At-Tirmidhee, Abu ash-Shaikh in Al-Amthaal (202) and Al-Khateeb in At-Taareekh (9/95-96). However, there is no point in that, since &#8216;Umar is matrook (rejected).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[31] The discussion of this has been stated previously in detail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[32] Reported by Abu Nu&#8217;aim in Akhbaar Asbahaan (1/161) Al-Khateeb in his Taareekh (13/279) and Ibn Al-Jawzee mentioned it in Al-Mawdoo&#8217;aat (2/83). Al-&#8216;Ajaloonee in Kashf-ul-Khufaa (2/343) added to that by attributing it to Ad-Daylamee. The hadeeth is reported through other paths from &#8216;Alee and Hudaifah, however they have severe weaknesses in them. See Al-Laalee Al-Masnoo&#8217;ah (2/293-295) of As-Suyootee and Mukhtasar Maqaasid-ul-Hasanah (pg. 83) of Az-Zurqaanee and Ad-Durr&#8211;ulMultaqitt (pg. 22) of As-Saghaanee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Jamaa’at-ut-Tableegh</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are a people that follow <strong>Muhammad Ilyaas</strong>, the founder of this Jamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A biography of the founder:</strong></span> Muhammad Ilyaas was born in 1302H. He memorized the Qur’aan and read the Six Collections of Hadeeth. [2] He was upon the Deobandi methodology, taking the Hanafee madh-hab, the Ash’aree and Matureedee Creed and the Sufi way. They have four Sufi orders amongst them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Naqshabandees<br />
2. The Sahroordees<br />
3. The Qaadirees, and<br />
4. The Jishtees</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Muhammad Ilyaas gave the Sufi bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to <strong>Shaikh Rasheed Al-Kankoohee, </strong>who later became<strong> Shaikh Rasheed As-Saharanpuree</strong>. Then he renewed it with Shaikh Ahmad As-Saharanpuree who certified him to take oaths of allegiance. Muhammad Ilyaas would sit in detached isolation (khalwah) by the grave of Shaikh Nur Muhammad Al-Badaayunee, in what is known as the Jishtee Muraaqabah (self meditation). And he would go out to the grave of ‘Abdul-Qudoos Al-Kankoohee, the one who forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood [3] on him. He resided and taught in Delhi and passed away in 1363H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Circumstances that brought about the start of the movement:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Abul-Hasan An-Nadwee saw that Muhammad Ilyaas took refuge in this way of giving Da’wah when the ways of blind-following failed to rectify the people of his region. Shaikh Miyaan Muhammad Aslam quotes one of Ilyaas’ sayings that he received kashf (mystic disclosure) to follow this way through a dream in which he was inspired with a new tafseer (interpretation) of Allaah’s saying: <b>“You were the best nation brought out for mankind, commanding good and forbidding evil and believing in Allaah.”</b> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 110] And it was that going out (khurooj) to call people to the way of Allaah cannot be realized by staying in one place based on Allaah’s word <b>“brought out”</b> and that one’s Eemaan increases by going out in this khurooj based on Allaah’s saying: <b>“and believing in Allaah”</b> after having said:<b>“brought out for mankind.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The following can be noted from what has just been mentioned:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The Qur’aan is not interpreted by makshoofaat (mystical disclosures), and by Sufi dreams, of which the majority of them, rather all of them come from the inspirations of the Devil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. It is apparent from what was stated previously that the founder of this Jamaa’ah was engrossed in Sufism from head to toe. This is because he gave two oaths of allegiance on it and was tested by its false beliefs and because he would spend his time sitting by the graves of Sufis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was a <strong>qubooree</strong> (grave worshipper) and a <strong>khuraafee</strong>. This is clear from his saying: “…and he would sit in detached isolation (<strong>khalwah</strong>) by the grave of Shaikh Nur Muhammad Al-Badaayunee.” And concerning the second person, he mentioned that he forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood on him. So his being attached to the grave of the one who forced the ideology of wahdat-ul-wujood on him is without doubt a clear proof that he held that same belief</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Those who believe in <strong>wahdat-ul-wujood</strong> claim that Allaah embodies Himself inside the attractive woman – and refuge is sought from Allaah! This is a matter that has reached the highest level of repulsiveness. May Allaah give them what they deserve of His curses and wrath!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The methodology of the Jamaa’at-ut-Tableegh can be summarized in six issues or six principles or six characteristics:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Actualizing the statement of Tawheed: <i>“Laa Ilaaha Illaallaah Muhammadur Rasoolullaah”</i> (There is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah and Muhammad is His Messenger)<br />
2. Praying with full submissiveness and humility<br />
3. Knowledge of the Virtues (<i>Fadaa’il</i>) and not the Fiqh issues (<i>Masaa’il</i>) along with knowledge of dhikr<br />
4. Showing generosity to the Muslim<br />
5. Correcting the intention<br />
6. Calling to Allaah (i.e. Da’wah) and going out (i.e. khurooj) for that purpose in the Way of Allaah upon the tablighi manhaj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an objective behind each of these six principles or characteristics as well as a virtue to be attained. So for example the objective behind (<i>Laa Ilaaha IllaAllaah</i>) is to: “Eradicate the corrupted yaqeen (Certainty) from the heart while placing the correct and valid yaqeen into the Essence (dhaat) of Allaah.” They really intend the belief of wahdat-ul-wujood with this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Point to be noted about Jamaa’at-ut-Tableegh:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was raised upon Sufism and gave two oaths of allegiance on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. He would position himself by graves, waiting to receive <strong>Kashf</strong> (Sufi mystical disclosure) and meditative ideas from the deceased inside them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. He would perform the <strong>Jishtee Muraaqabah</strong> (self meditation) at the gravesite of ‘Abdul-Quddoos Al-Kankoohee, who used to believe in wahadat-ul-wujood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The Jishtee Muraaqabah is to sit by a grave for half an hour of every week, covering the face and reciting this dhikr: “<em>Allaahu Haadiree, Allaahu Naadhiree</em>.” [4] This statement or this action if done sincerely for Allaah is an innovation. And if it is done for the person in the grave then it is committing Shirk with Allaah. And the last of the two is what is most evident.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. They have four of their graves located in the masjid from where their Da’wah emerged.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. The founder of this Jamaa’ah believed in Kashf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. The founder of this Jamaa’ah was a grave worshipper.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. The Tablighis perform their worship with an innovated form of dhikr, done in the way of the Sufis. This is by splitting up the statement of Tawhheed (<i>Laa Ilaaha IllaAllaah</i>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Whoever cuts off the negation part of the Statement of Tawheed from its affirmation part intentionally, by saying “Laa Ilaaha” (only), then this necessitates the fact that he has committed disbelief. Shaikh Hamood At-Tuwayjiree stated this, quoting it from the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. They make it permissible to wear amulets that have on them mystical writings and names of unknown people, which probably are names of devils! And this is not permissible.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>An Important Note:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obvious that after all of this we must say: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Indeed, the Sunnah that bears this importance in Legislation (i.e. making Islamic laws), only refers to the Sunnah that is authentically reported on the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم by way of the knowledge-based paths and authentic chains of narration, which are well known to the scholars of Hadeeth and Narrators</strong></span>. It does not refer to that which is contained within the various books of Tafseer and Fiqh, or the books on Targheeb and Tarheeb, or those of Raqaa’iq and Mawaa’idh, for indeed many of the weak, rejected and fabricated ahaadeeth can be found in them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of these ahaadeeth, Islaam is completely free from, such as the hadeeth about Harut and Marut, and the story on the satanic verses (gharaneeq). I wrote a specific treatise refuting this narration, which has been published.[2] I have referenced a score of them in my book, the collection: <em>Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth ad-Da’eefah wal-Mawdoo’ah wa Atharuhaa as-Sayy fil-Ummah</em>.” So far the number of ahaadeeth in them has reached close to four thousand.[3] And they consist of ahaadeeth that are either weak or fabricated. Only five hundred ahaadeeth from these have been published so far! So it is an obligation upon the people of knowledge, particularly those that propagate their Fiqh and verdicts to the people, to not be overconfident in using the hadeeth as proof except after becoming sure about its authenticity. This is especially since the books of Fiqh that are commonly referenced today are filled with ahaadeeth that are weak, rejected and those that have no source to them, as is well known to the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have commenced an important project in my opinion, which is beneficial for those who preoccupy themselves with Fiqh, which I call: “<strong>The Weak and Fabricated Ahaadeeth in the Major Fiqh Books</strong>.” By this I mean the following books:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <em>Al-Hidaayah</em> of Al-Margeenaani, regarding Hanafi Fiqh<br />
2. <em>Al-Mudawwanah</em> of Ibn Al-Qaasim, regarding Maalikee Fiqh<br />
3. <em>Sharh-ul-Wajeez</em> of Ar-Raafi’ee, regarding Shaafi’ee Fiqh<br />
4. <em>Al-Mughnee</em> of Ibn Qudaamah, regarding Hanbalee Fiqh<br />
5. <em>Bidaayat-ul-Mujtahid</em> of Ibn Rushd, on comparative Fiqh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Unfortunately, however, I did not get the chance to complete it because the Kuwaiti magazine, <em>Al-Wa’ee Al-Islaamee</em>, that promised to publish it and that received it graciously after reviewing it, didn’t print it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since I missed that opportunity, then perhaps I will be granted the opportunity, Allaah willing, on another occasion to offer a specific knowledge-based course to my brothers that are studying Fiqh, which will assist them and which will facilitate for them the way towards knowing the grades of the Hadeeth, by returning them to the necessary sources of the books of Hadeeth. And which will explain their special and distinct characteristics, as well as what can be relied on from them. And Allaah, Most High, is the One who grants success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] The book is called: “Nasab-ul-Majaaneeq fee Nasf Qissat-il-Gharaaneeq.” [Printed by Al-Maktab-ul- Islaamee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Now the number has passed five thousand ahaadeeth, may Allaah facilitate them to be printed soon</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[2] Question:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">Noble Shaikh! The Qur’aaniyoon [3] say: Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;">وَكُلَّ شَيْءٍ فَصَّلْنَاهُ تَفْصِيلًا</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>“And We have explained everything in detail with a full explanation.”<br />
</strong> [Surah Al-Israa: 12]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">And Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;">مَّا فَرَّطْنَا فِي الْكِتَابِ مِن شَيْءٍ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>“We have not neglected anything in the Book.”</strong></span><br />
<span style="color:#333333;"> [Surah Al-An’aam: 38]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">And the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“Verily this Qur’aan – part of it is in the Hand of Allaah and part of it is in your hands. So hold fast onto it, for you will never go astray nor will you ever be ruined after it.”</strong> [4]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333333;">We would like your comments on this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[2] Answer:</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah’s saying: <strong>“We have not neglected anything in the Book”</strong>, what is meant by the word “<strong>Book</strong>” here is the Preserved Tablet and not the Noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for Allaah’s statement: <strong>“And We have explained everything in detail with a full explanation”</strong>, if you attach what was explained previously to the Noble Qur’aan, then it becomes certain that Allaah has indeed explained everything in detail, however with another provision. You are aware that an explanation may at times be general, such as when one places general rules under which exist many particulars the likes of which cannot be confined due to their large number. So by the Wise Legislator placing well known rules for these many particulars, the meaning of the noble ayah becomes apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The explanation may also be detailed, and this is what is obvious from this ayah as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“I have not left behind anything that Allaah commanded me with except that I have ordered you to do it. And I have not left behind anything that Allaah forbade me from except that I have forbidden you from it.”</strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the explanation may at times be with rules, which many particulars (and details) fall under. And at other times it may be in such detail in terms of the vocabulary of the acts of worship and laws that it does not require being referenced to any of these rules.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the rules that numerous branches fall under – and which show the greatness of Islaam and the vast scope of Islaam in legislating – for example, are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“There is no harming (of oneself) or others.”</strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“Every intoxicant is alcohol and every alcohol is unlawful.”</strong> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his صلى الله عليه وسلم statement: <strong>“Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are rules and generalizations that do not exclude anything related to harming of one’s self or harming of one’s wealth, with respect to the first hadeeth, nor does it exclude anything related to that which intoxicates, with respect to the second hadeeth, whether the intoxicant is derived from grapes, which is the most popular form, or from corn or from any other substance. So long as the product is an intoxicant, it is unlawful (Haraam).</p>
<p><em><span style="color:#808080;">[<strong>Note</strong>: Read </span><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/2016/07/16/the-need-for-the-sunnah-in-order-to-understand-the-quraan/">The Need for the Sunnah in order to Understand the Qur’aan </a><span style="color:#808080;">– Shaykh al Albaani]</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for the third hadeeth – it is not possible to take into account the number of innovations due to their large amount. It is not possible to account for all of them. However in spite of this, this hadeeth – even though brief in size – states with all clarity: <strong>“Every innovation is misguidance, and every misguidance is in the Hellfire.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a detailed statement but with rules.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the laws that you are aware of, they are explained in detail by words that have been mentioned in the Sunnah in most cases and at times they are mentioned in the noble Qur’aan as is the case with the laws of inheritance, for example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth that was mentioned in the question, then it is an authentic hadeeth, and acting upon it is what we should try to adhere to as stated in the hadeeth in which the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <strong>“I have left two things amongst you by which you will never go astray so long as you hold steadfast onto them: The Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger.”</strong> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So holding steadfast onto the Rope of Allaah – which is in our hands – refers to acting upon the Sunnah, which explains the noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[3] Translator’s Note: This is a name given to those who claim that the Qur’aan is sufficient for deriving rules and laws in Islaam and that there is no need to turn to the Sunnah. Some even go so far as to reject the Sunnah in its entirety and rely solely on the Qur’aan.</span><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>A Weak Hadeeth from Mu’aadh regarding Opinion, and what is Rejected from it:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Before I finish my talk, I feel that it is necessary for me to direct the attention of the brothers in attendance to a famous hadeeth, which seldom is missing from the books on the Principles of Fiqh. I will mention it because <strong>it is weak</strong>, from the perspective of its chain of narration as well as it being in contradiction with what I spoke about in this talk, which was <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>the lack of there being any distinction between the Qur’aan and the Sunnah when it comes to deriving Laws, and the obligation of accepting these two sources together</strong></span><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed it is the hadeeth of Mu’aadh bin Jabal radhi Allaahu anhu who reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said to him when he sent him to Yemen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>“With what will you judge by?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “By the Book of Allaah.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “And if you don’t find (the answer in) it?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “Then by the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He replied: “And if you don’t find (the answer in) it?” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>He said: “I will strive to form my own opinion.” </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>So he صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “All praise be to Allaah who guided the messenger of Allaah’s Messenger to that which Allaah’s Messenger loves.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the weakness of its chain, then this is not the place to discuss it now. But I clarified this exhaustively, perhaps the likes of which was not undertaken in the past, in (my book) the <strong>“Silsilah”</strong> (of weak hadeeth) I mentioned previously. [4] But suffice it to say now that the Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen in Hadeeth, Imaam Al-Bukhaaree, said about this hadeeth that it was “rejected.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">So having said this, it is now possible for me to begin explaining the contradiction it </span></strong><strong><span style="color:#993300;">poses, which I stated earlier. So I say:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth establishes a methodology of ruling for the judge, based on three stages. He is not permitted to seek a ruling from his opinion unless after he acknowledges he can’t find it in the Sunnah. Nor is he allowed to derive a ruling from the Sunnah until after he establishes he can’t find it in the Qur’aan. With respect to the opinion, this method (of deriving a ruling) is valid and correct according to all of the scholars, which is why they would say: “When the narration is mentioned, the opinion is nullified.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, with respect to the Sunnah, this method is not correct, because the Sunnah determines and explains the Book of Allaah. So it is obligatory for one to look for the ruling in the Sunnah, even if he thinks that it exists in the Qur’aan, based on what we stated previously. So the Sunnah with respect to the Qur’aan is not like the opinion with respect to the Sunnah. No, definitely not. Rather we must consider the Qur’aan and the Sunnah as one source, there being no distinction between them at all. This is as has been indicated in the sayings of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Indeed, I was given the Qur’aan and something similar to it, along with it”</span></strong> – meaning the Sunnah – and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They will not be separated from one another until they return to the Fountain.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this dividing them into categories, mentioned in the hadeeth, is not correct, because it necessitates that they are separate from one another. And this is false, as I have explained previously.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">It is unfortunate that there can be found some contemporary tafseer writers and authors that have taken the view of making permissible what has been mentioned in the last two examples <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>[1]</strong></span> , such as the permissibility of eating predatory animals and wearing gold and silk, relying upon the Qur’aan (as proof) only! In fact, there can be found in this present time a group that call themselves the <strong>Qur’aaniyoon</strong>, who interpret the Qur’aan according to their desires and intellects, without seeking assistance for that in the authentic Sunnah. Rather, the Sunnah, according to them, is subordinate to their desires. So whatever part of it conforms to their desires, they affirm it, and whatever doesn’t conform to their desires, they throw behind their backs (rejecting it).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم indicated these individuals in an authentic hadeeth, when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Do not let any one of you sit reclining on his couch, then when something that I have commanded him to do comes to him, he says: ‘I don’t know! Whatever we find in the Book of Allaah, we will follow it.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by At-Tirmidhee]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration, he صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“…’whatever we find in it that’s unlawful, we will declare unlawful.’ Indeed, I was sent with the Qur’aan and something equal to it along with it.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another report, he صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Indeed, whatever the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم forbade is the same as what Allaah forbade.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, what is unfortunate is that one dignified author wrote a book on the Legislation and Creed of Islaam. He stated in his introduction that he wrote the book but he had no references in it except for the Qur’aan! So this authentic hadeeth provides clear proof that the Islamic Legislation is not based on the Qur’aan only, but rather it is based on the Qur’aan and Sunnah. So whoever takes hold of one in the absence of the other, doesn’t actually take hold of any of them. This is because each one of them commands that the other one be adhered to. This is as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whoever obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah An-Nisaa: 80]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah An-Nisaa: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allaah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any choice in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allaah and His Messenger, has indeed strayed in a plain error.” </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Surah Al-Ahzaab: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And whatever the Messenger gives you then do it, and whatever he forbids you from, then abstain from it.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Hashr: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In connection with this ayah, I am amazed at what has been authentically reported from Ibn Mas’ood radhi Allaahu anhu, which is that a woman once came to him and said: “Are you the one who said: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘May Allaah’s curse be on the woman that puck eyebrows and those who ask for their eyebrows to be plucked and those who tattoo…’</span></strong> He said: ‘Yes.’ She said: ‘I read the Qur’aan from its front to its back and I did not find in it that which you say!’ He responded: ‘If you had (truly) read it, you would have found it. Did you not read: ‘And whatever the Messenger gives you then take it (i.e. do it), and whatever he forbids you from, then stay away from?’ She said: ‘Of course!’ He صلى الله عليه وسلم said: ‘Then I indeed heard The Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم say: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘May Allaah’s curse be on the woman that pluck eyebrows and those who ask for their eyebrows to be plucked…’”</strong></span> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[7] Question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Allaah says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَجَعَلْنَا عَلَىٰ قُلُوبِهِمْ أَكِنَّةً أَن يَفْقَهُوهُ وَفِي آذَانِهِمْ وَقْرًا<br />
<span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>“And We placed veils upon their hearts – so that they understand it not – and deafness in their ears.”</strong> [Surah Al-An’aam: 25]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some people perceive this ayah to contain a sense of coercion in it (on the part of Allaah). So what is your opinion with regards to this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[7] Answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“placing”</strong> </span>is an existential (<em>kawnee</em>) type of placing. In order to understand this, we must explain the meaning of Allaah’s Divine Desire (<em>Iraadah</em>). Divine Desire is divided into two categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Shar’ee</em> (Legislative) Desire and the <em>Kawnee</em> (Existential) Desire</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Legislative Desire is everything that Allaah has legislated for His servants and incited them to do, such as acts of worship and obedience, regardless of their rulings, whether obligatory or recommended. Allaah desires and loves these acts of worship and obedience.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the Existential Desire, it may at times be something that Allaah did not legislate but yet preordained. This type of Desire is only called “Existential Desire” since its term was derived from Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّمَا أَمْرُهُ إِذَا أَرَادَ شَيْئًا أَن يَقُولَ لَهُ كُن فَيَكُونُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, His Command – when He desires something – is only that He says to it ‘Be’ and it is.”</strong> </span>[Surah YaaSeen: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <strong>“something”</strong> here is an indefinite noun which consists of everything, whether acts of obedience or acts of disobedience. Such things come into existence by Allaah’s saying to it: “Be.” Meaning: It occurs through His Will, Ordainment, and Pre- Decree. So if we come to realize this Existential Desire, which includes everything regardless if it is an act of obedience or an act of disobedience, it will definitely lead us back to the subject of Al-Qadaa wal-Qadar (Allaah’s Divine Ordainment and Pre- Decree, since Allaah’s statement: <strong>“Verily, His Command – when He desires something – is only that He says to it ‘Be’ and it is”</strong> means that the thing to which He said “Be” is something He decreed, which will definitely come into existence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything, according to Allaah, is decreed – it either consists of good or it consists of evil. However, that which applies from it to us – the two species of mankind and jinn who have been ordered by Allaah and are accountable for our actions – is that we look at what we do. The things we do either occur purely from our desire and free choice or they occur in spite of what we desire. Acts of obedience or disobedience do not apply to this second category and the end result of it is not Paradise or Hellfire. It is only the first category that the religious laws revolve around. And it is based on this that a person will be rewarded with either Paradise or the Hellfire. This means that whatever a person does based on his own desire and whatever he chases after through His actions and free choice, this is what he will be held accountable for. If it is good, then he will have good and if it is bad, then he will have bad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fact that a person has a free choice in a large portion of his actions is a fact that cannot be argued with whether religiously or intellectually.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for religiously, there are numerous texts from the Qur’aan and Sunnah that confirm that a person may choose to do what he is ordered to do and abandon what he is forbidden from doing. These texts are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for intellectually, it is clear to every person that is void of whims and desires that whenever he speaks or walks or eats or drinks or does anything that involves his free will, he is choosing on his own to do that action and not being forced to do that at all. For example, if I wish to speak right now, there is naturally no one that can force me to do that. However, this speech (of mine) is pre-decreed. What is meant by my speaking these words in spite of it being pre-decreed is that it is pre-ordained along with my free choice of what I will say and talk about. However, I have the ability to remain silent to make clear – to those doubtful about what I’m saying – that I have a free choice in the matter of speaking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, the fact that a person has a free choice and a free will is something that cannot be disputed or argued against. And as for one who does argue against such a fact, then this person is only arguing philosophically and casting doubts on self-evident intuitions. And when a person reaches this stage, he can no longer be talked to (logically).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the actions of a human being are divided into two categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Those that are done out of his choice and free will<br />
2. Those that are done as a result of him being forced and coerced to</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have nothing to say about the actions that are done due to coercion – not from a religious perspective or from a real-life perspective. The religion is only concerned with the matters of free choice and free will. This is the truth of the matter. If we implant this into our minds, we will be able to understand the afore-mentioned ayah: <strong>“And We placed veils upon their hearts.”</strong> This refers to the Existential Placing. We must remember that the afore-mentioned ayah: <strong>“Verily, His Command – when He desires something”</strong> refers to the Existential Desire. However, it is not done against the will and choice of this person whom Allaah has placed veils over his heart.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is an example of this from an actual perspective: When a human being is created, he is formed while his flesh is still soft and tender. Then as he gets older and older, his flesh becomes harder and his bones become stronger. However, not all people are the same in this regard. So lets say for example this person is devoted to (learning) some type of study or science. What part of the body will grow strong in this person? His mind will strengthen. His brain will become stronger in the field that he preoccupies it with and applies all of its abilities on. However, from a physical standpoint, his body will not strengthen nor will his muscles develop.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The opposite of this is exactly true as well, for there may be a person that completely applies himself physically. So everyday he engages in sports and physical training – as we say today. Such a person’s muscles and body will progress and become strong. And he will acquire an image just like those that we see sometimes in real-life and sometimes in pictures in which for example the bodies of these athletes have become all muscle. Was this person created this way? Or did he earn and acquire for himself this strong physique loaded with muscles? This is something that he has attained based on his own actions and free choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">This is the same example as someone who lingers in his misguidance, rejection, disbelief and denial and as a result attains this condition of these veils being placed by Allaah over his heart, not because Allaah compelled and forced this upon him but rather due to his actions and free choice.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So this is the existential placing which these disbelieving people have acquired (for themselves). They have gotten themselves to this point, which the ignorant think they were forced into, when in reality, such a fate was not obliged upon them, but rather came about due to what their own hands earned. And Allaah does not oppress His servants.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>[4] Question:</b> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Noble Shaikh, there are many books of tafseer, so which tafseer do you advise (us) to read. May Allaah reward you well.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[4] Answer: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of Tafseer are many, all praise be to Allaah. This is from the blessings of Allaah. However, these books of Tafseer vary – amongst them are those that are long and in depth and those that are short and abridged, as well as those that are free from errors and those that contain errors, particularly in matters of Creed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What I advise my brothers from amongst the youth to read is the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Tafseer of Ibn Katheer</span></strong> for it is the greatest of tafseers and the one that uses the best way and method (for interpreting the Qur’aan) in spite of it being abridged. This is since he (i.e. Ibn Katheer) has interpreted the Qur’aan using the Qur’aan first, then by using the Prophetic Sunnah, then with the statements of the Salaf, and finally by using the requisites of Arabic, the language in which it was revealed. So it is a precise and reliable tafseer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">tafseer of Al-Baghawee</span></strong> and the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">tafseer of Ibn Jareer At-Tabaree</span></strong>, which is a comprehensive and all-inclusive tafseer. These tafseer books are trustworthy. There is also the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>tafseer of Shaikh ‘Abdur-Rahmaan As-Sa’adee</strong></span>, which is an excellent tafseer using simple expressions which contain tremendous knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the remaining tafseer books, they are good in some aspects, however they have errors in them, especially in matters of Creed. It is not proper for anyone to read these types of tafseer books except for the person that is proficient in knowledge to the point that he is able to take the good from it and avoid its errors. But as for the beginner, he is not able to do this, so he must take from the tafseer books that do not contain dangers and errors, such as the Tafseer of Ibn Katheer, the Tafseer of Al-Baghawee and the Tafseer of Al-Haafidh Ibn Jareer. All of these books of tafseer are valuable and excellent, all praise be to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is your advice to the youth concerning the simplest way to memorize the Book of Allaah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur’aan is simple and easy to memorize. Allaah says: <b>“And We have indeed made the Qur’aan easy to understand and remember, so is there anyone who will remember it?”</b> [Surah Al-Qamar: 17]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The problem lies in a person’s determination and the truthfulness of his intention. So if a person has true determination and a strong interest in the Qur’aan, Allaah will facilitate and make easy his memorization of it. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also some other things one could do to help in memorizing the Qur’aan such as allotting a specific suitable time every day for attending classes with one who teaches the Qur’aan in the masjid. All praise be to Allaah, the teachers today are many. You will not find a neighborhood except that amongst them there lives one who teaches the Qur’aan. This is a great opportunity that didn’t exist in previous times. So a person should choose anyone of the many gatherings or anyone of the many teachers present today and constantly attend these gatherings/sittings with a teacher daily until he completes the Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should also constantly repeat over and over again what you recite, until it becomes firmly established in your heart and mind. You must also act upon (what you learn from) the Book of Allaah, for that is the greatest means of learning the Qur’aan. Allaah says: <b>“So be dutiful to Allaah and Allaah will teach you. And Allaah is the All-Knower of everything.” </b>[Surah Al-Baqarah: 282]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Need for the Sunnah in order to Understand the Qur’aan, and Examples for that:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“The male and the female thief – cut off their hands”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 38] is a good example of this, for the word <strong>“thief”</strong> mentioned in it, is absolute, as is the case with the word “hand.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verbal Sunnah explains the first of these two (words) and restricts it to mean just the thief that steals a quarter of a dinaar. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“There is no cutting off of the hand except in (cases where one steals) a quarter of a dinaar and more.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم explained the second (word) with his action or with the action of his Companions and his approving of that. This is since they would cut the hand of the thief off from the wrist, as is well known from the books of Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verbal Sunnah also explains the <strong>“hand”</strong> that is mentioned in the verse concerning Tayammum:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Then wipe your faces and hands”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 43, Surah Al-Maa’idah: 6] in that it can also refer to the palm.<span style="line-height:1.5;">This is based on the Prophet’s saying: </span><span style="line-height:1.5;color:#000000;"><strong>“Tayammum is a tap (i.e. wipe) of the face and hands.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Ahmad, Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others from the narration of ‘Ammaar bin Yaasir radhi Allaahu anhu] </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are some other verses from the Qur’aan that cannot be understood correctly, according to what Allaah intended, unless by way of the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“It is those who believe and mix not their Faith with dhulm (wrong) – for them (only) there is security and they are the guided ones.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions of Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم understood the phrase <strong>“with dhulm (wrong)”</strong> according to its general sense, which includes every wrong, even if it be small. This is why they had difficulty understanding the verse and so they said: “O Messenger of Allaah! Which one of us doesn’t mix their Faith with wrong?” So the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“It doesn’t mean that. It only means Shirk (here). Didn’t you hear Luqmaan say:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Verily Shirk is a great wrong?’</strong></span> [Surah Luqmaan: 13]”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Allaah’s says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And when you travel in the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten your prayer, if you fear that the disbelievers may attack you.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 101]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The literal wording of this verse necessitates that shortening the prayer while on a journey can only be done on the condition when one is in the state of fear. This is why some of the Companions asked Allaah’s Messenger: “So then why do we shorten the prayer when we are in a state of security?” He صلى الله عليه وسلم replied: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“This is a charity that Allaah has expended to you, so take His charity.”</strong> </span>[Reported by Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Forbidden to you (for food) are: al-maytatah (dead animals), blood, the flesh of swine…”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the verbal Sunnah explains that deceased locusts and fish, as well as liver and spleen (types) of blood are lawful. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Two types of deceased animals and two types of blood have been made lawful for us: locusts and sea fish [meaning all types of fish], and the liver and the spleen.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Reported by Al- Bayhaqee and others in marfoo’ and mawqoof form. The chain of the mawqoof narration is authentic and it takes on the ruling of being marfoo’ since it cannot be stated based on one’s mere opinion.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Say (O Muhammad): ‘I find not in that which has been inspired to me anything forbidden to be eaten by one who wishes to eat it, unless it be maytah (a dead animal) or blood poured forth (by slaughtering), or the flesh of swine (pork), for that surely is impure, or impious (unlawful) meat (of an animal) which is slaughtered as a sacrifice for other than Allaah…’”</span></strong> [Surah Al-An&#8217;aam: 145]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Sunnah came and forbade other things that haven’t been mentioned in this ayah, such as the Prophet’s صلى الله عليه وسلم saying: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Every predatory animal that has fangs and every bird that has claws is unlawful (for eating).”</span></strong> There are also other ahaadeeth on this subject that forbid other animals, such as what the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said on the Day of Khaybar: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Verily Allaah and His Messenger forbid you from (eating) domesticated donkeys, for they are impure.”</span></strong> [Reported by Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Say (O Muhammad): ‘Who has forbidden the adornment with clothes given by Allaah, which He has produced for his slaves, and the good (lawful) things from provision?’”</strong></span> [Surah Al-A&#8217;raaf: 32]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But the Sunnah explains that there are certain types of adornments that are forbidden. It is authentically reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم went out one day to meet his Companions holding silk in one hand and gold in the other, and said:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “These two things are unlawful for the males of my ummah, (but) lawful for the females.”</strong></span> [Reported by Al-Haakim who authenticated it] The ahaadeeth bearing this same understanding are many, well known and can be found in the two Saheeh collections as well as other collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many more examples like these (above) that are known to the people who have knowledge of Hadeeth and Fiqh. So from what has been stated previously, it should become clear to us, O brothers, the importance of the Sunnah in deriving Islamic laws. For indeed if we look back again at the examples I mentioned before, not to mention those that I didn’t mention, we will have certainty that there is no way to understand the noble Qur’aan, unless we understand it along with the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the first example,</strong> the Companions understood the word <strong>“dhulm”</strong> mentioned in the ayah according to its literal meaning. This was even though they, may Allaah be pleased with them, were as Ibn Mas’ood said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The best of this ummah, possessing the most pious of hearts, profound in learning and the least of constraints.”</strong></span> But in spite of this, they erred with regard to understanding that. So if it were not for the Prophet refuting their error and guiding them to what was correct with regard to the meaning of “dhulm” – that it in fact meant Shirk here – we would have followed them upon their error. However, Allaah, Mighty and Majestic, saved us from that due to the grace of the Prophet’s guidance and Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And in the second example:</strong> if it weren’t for the afore-mentioned hadeeth, we would have remained in doubt, to say the least, regarding shortening the prayer while on a journey in the state of security. That is to say if we wouldn’t have already taken the view of making being in the state of fear a condition, as is literally stated in the ayah. This is also just what the Companions themselves understood (about the ayah) until they saw the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم shorten his prayer, and they shortened their prayer along with him, while they were in a state of security.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the third example:</strong> If it weren’t for the hadeeth, we would have been forbidden from foods that were made lawful for us, such as (dead) locusts and fish, and liver and spleen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In the fourth example</strong>, if it weren’t for the hadeeth, which mentions some things (not mentioned in the ayah), we would have made lawful what Allaah had made forbidden through the tongue of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, such as predatory (fanged) animals and birds with claws.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The same goes for the fifth example,</strong> if it weren’t for the ahaadeeth reported in that regard, we would have made lawful that which Allaah made unlawful upon the tongue of the Prophet, such as silk and gold. This is why some of the Salaf used to say: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Sunnah judges upon the Book (i.e. Qur’aan).”</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3]</strong> <strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There are some who say that if a hadeeth contradicts an ayah in the Qur’aan, it should be rejected no matter what level of authenticity it has. Then they use as an example the hadeeth: <strong>“Indeed the deceased person will be punished (in the grave) due to the crying of his family for him.”</strong>[10] They use the statement of ‘Aa’ishah in which she used Allaah’s saying to refute this hadeeth:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">وَلَا تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى</span></strong><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</strong> [Surah Faatir: 18]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">How do we respond to those who say this?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[3] Answer</strong>: Rejecting this hadeeth falls under the issues related to rejecting the Sunnah by way of the Qur’aan. So this shows the deviation of this way of thinking.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the response to this hadeeth – and I am referring here particularly to those who adhere to the hadeeth of ‘Aa’ishah, then it is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>:<strong> From a hadeeth standpoint:</strong> There is no way to reject this hadeeth from a hadeeth standpoint due to two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It has been reported through an authentic chain of narration from Ibn ‘Umar radhi Allaahu anhu.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Ibn ‘Umar radhi Allaahu anhu is not alone in reporting it, rather he was followed in that by ‘Umar bin Al- Khattaab radhi Allaahu anhu. Furthermore, he and his son are not alone in reporting it either, for they were also followed in that by Al-Mugheerah bin Shu’bah radhi Allaahu anhu. This is what comes to my mind at this time since the reports of all three of these Companions can be found in the two Saheeh Collections.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if a person were to conduct an exclusive research on this hadeeth, he would find other paths of narration for it. These three ahaadeeth all have authentic chains of narration so they cannot be rejected just based on the claim that they “contradict” the noble Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: <strong>From a tafseer standpoint:</strong> This is since the scholars have explained this hadeeth in two ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. This hadeeth only applies to a deceased person who knew during the course of his life that his family would commit oppositions to the Religion after his death and did not advise them. Nor he did direct them to not cry over him since this crying would serve as a means for his being punished in the grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The usage of the word <strong>“the”</strong> when referring to the <strong>“deceased person”</strong> is not allencompassing and inclusive. Meaning: The hadeeth does not mean that every deceased person will be punished due to the crying of his family members. Rather, the word “the” is for a specific designation, meaning it refers to only those who do not advise others to not commit what opposes the Religion after his death. So this is the type of person who will be punished by the crying of his family over him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the one who takes charge of advising his family and directing them with religious guidelines such as to not wail over him and to not commit the offenses that are done ,particularly in this era, then such a person will not be punished. But if he does not direct and advise (his family), he will be punished.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the detailed breakdown that we are required to understand from the first explanation, in accordance to the interpretation of many well known and famous scholars such as An-Nawawee and others. So when we come to comprehend this detailed breakdown, it becomes clear that there is in fact no contradiction between this hadeeth and Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">وَلاَ تَزِرُ وَازِرَةٌ وِزْرَ أُخْرَى</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-An’aam: 164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A contradiction only becomes apparent if the word <strong>“the”</strong> in the word <strong>“the deceased person”</strong> is understood to be all-inclusive, meaning that it encompasses everyone who dies. This is where the hadeeth becomes obscure and contradicts the noble ayah in the Qur’aan. But if we comprehend the meaning of the hadeeth according to what was mentioned before, there would be no more contradictions or obscurities since we would understand that the one who is being punished (in the grave) is only like that because he failed to advise and direct his family members (before his death). This is the first manner in which this hadeeth has been interpreted in order to repel this so-called “contradiction.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. A second interpretation has been mentioned by Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah, may Allaah have mercy on him, in some of his writings. And it is that the punishment here does not refer to the punishment in the grave or the punishment in the Hereafter but rather, that it only refers to pain and sorrow. Meaning: When a deceased person hears the crying of his family for him, he will feel bad and sorrowful for their grief over him. This is what Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said. If it is correct, it would eradicate the root of the misconception.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, I say: Such an explanation goes against two facts, which is why we can only rely on the first explanation of this hadeeth:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First Fact:</strong> The report from Al-Mugheerah bin Shu’abah radhi Allaahu anhu that I indicated previously has an addition to it that clarifies that the punishment here does not refer to just pain and sorrow, but rather that it refers to actual punishment, i.e. punishment in the Hellfire, unless Allaah forgives him. This is clearly stated in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّ اللّهَ لاَ يَغْفِرُ أَن يُشْرَكَ بِهِ وَيَغْفِرُ مَا دُونَ ذَلِكَ لِمَن يَشَاء</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him (in worship), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Al-Mugheerah radhi Allaahu anhu it states: <strong>“Indeed, the deceased person will be punished due to the crying of his family over him on the Day of Judgement.”</strong> So this clearly states that the deceased will be punished due to his family crying over him on the Day of Judgement and not in his grave, which is what Ibn Taimiyyah explained as meaning pain and sorrow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second Fact:</strong> When a person dies, he does not feel anything that goes on around him whether good or bad, as indicated by evidences in the Qur’aan and Sunnah, except in certain cases, which have been mentioned in some ahaadeeth either as a rule for every deceased person or for some only whom Allaah enables to hear some things that will cause them pain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So firstly there is the hadeeth reported by Al-Bukhaaree in his Saheeh from Anas bin Maalik radhi Allaahu anhu in which he narrated that the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, when a servant (of Allaah) is placed in his grave, and his companions depart from him – at the point where he can still hear their footsteps – two angels come to him.” </strong>[11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This authentic hadeeth affirms a special type of hearing that a deceased person will have at the time he is buried and the people are walking away from him. Meaning: At the time that the two angels come to sit by him, his soul returns to his body and in this state of being, he is able to hear the footsteps (of his loved ones walking away).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the hadeeth does not mean on the outset that this deceased person and all deceased people will have their souls returned to them and that they will remain with the ability to hear the footsteps of the people passing by the graves up until the day that they will be resurrected. No.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a specific circumstance and a special type of hearing on the part of the deceased since his soul has returned to him. So if we were to go by the interpretation of Ibn Taimiyyah at this point, we would be forced to expand the senses of the deceased person to include everything that goes on around him whether at the time he is being transferred to his grave before his burial or after he is placed in his grave – meaning that he can hear his living family members crying over him. This requires a textual proof, which is missing. This is first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Secondly</strong>, some texts from the Qur’aan and the authentic Sunnah indicate that the deceased cannot hear. This is a huge topic and requires an in-depth discussion. However I will mention one hadeeth by which I will close the answer to this question. And it is the statement of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah has angels that roam throughout earth who convey to me the greetings (of Salaam) on behalf of my ummah.” </strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by <strong>“roam”</strong> is that they frequent gatherings. So every time a Muslim sends Salaat (praises) on the Prophet, there is an assigned angel that conveys this greeting from that Muslim to the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم. So if the deceased could hear, the one with the most right from those deceased to hear would be our Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم due to Allaah’s favoring him and particularizing him with special qualities and attributes over all of the prophets, messengers, and rest of mankind. So if anyone had the ability to hear, it would surely be the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه وسلم. And furthermore, if the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم were able to hear anything after his death, he would hear the Salaat (praises) of his ummah) on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So here we come to understand the error, or the deviation, of those who ask assistance – not from the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم – but rather from those less than him, whether messengers, prophets or righteous people. This is since if they were to ask assistance from the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, he would not hear them as is clearly stated in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِنَّ الَّذِينَ تَدْعُونَ مِن دُونِ اللّهِ عِبَادٌ أَمْثَالُكُمْ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And those whom you call besides Allaah are servants (of Allaah) just like you.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 194]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">إِن تَدْعُوهُمْ لَا يَسْمَعُوا دُعَاءآُمْ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“If you supplicate to them, they cannot hear your supplication.”</strong></span> [Surah Faatir: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, after they die, the deceased cannot hear unless there is some text that applies to a particular situation – as I mentioned before – such as the deceased hearing the footsteps. This concludes the answer to this question.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>[5] Question</strong>: Allaah informs us about Himself saying:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;">وَمَكَرُواْ وَمَكَرَ اللّهُ وَاللّهُ خَيْرُ الْمَاآِرِينَ</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And they plotted and Allaah too plotted. And Allaah is the best of plotters.”</strong> </span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">[Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 54]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Perhaps the minds of some people may limit the understanding of this ayah to just its apparent meaning. And maybe we are not in need of explaining it. But how is it that Allaah is the best of plotters?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[5] Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This question is easy by the Grace of Allaah. This is since we are able to understand that plotting is not always necessarily characterized with being evil nor is it always necessarily characterized with being good. So perhaps a disbeliever may plot against a Muslim however this Muslim is bright and clever and not heedless and stupid. So he is aware of the plots of his disbelieving opponent and thus deals with him in retaliation to his plot. This is such that the end result is that this Muslim through his good plotting compels the disbeliever’s evil plot to backfire on his own self. So can it be said that when this Muslim plotted against the disbeliever, he engaged in an illegal affair? No one says this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is easy to comprehend this fact from the statement of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم: <strong>“War is deception.” [</strong>14] What can be said about deception is exactly the same that can be said about plotting. A Muslim deceiving his Muslim brother is forbidden. However, if a Muslim deceives a disbeliever who is an enemy to Allaah and an enemy to His Messenger, this is not forbidden. On the contrary, it is obligatory. The same goes for a Muslim plotting against a disbeliever who intends to plot against him, such that this Muslim reverses the plot of this disbeliever. This is a good form of plotting. This is a human being and that is a human being. But what do we say with respect to the Lord of all that exists, the All-Able, the All-Knowing, the All-Wise?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He invalidates the plots of all the plotters. This is why Allaah says: <strong>“And Allaah is the best of plotters.”</strong> So when Allaah describes Himself with this description, our attention shuld be directed to the fact that plotting – even on the part of humans – is not always negative. This is since Allaah says: <strong>“The best of plotters.”</strong> So there is plotting that is good and plotting that is bad. So whoever plots for a good reason should not be condemned. And Allaah, Mighty and Majestic, is as He says, the <strong>“best of plotters.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In brief, I say: Whatever suppositions may come to your mind, Allaah is contrary to that. So if a person imagines something that is not befitting to Allaah, then he should know right away that he is wrong. Hence this ayah contains praise for Allaah, so there is nothing in it that is impermissible to ascribe to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Knowledge of Arabic is not sufficient for understanding the Qur’aan:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what has been stated previously, it becomes clear that there is no way for anyone, even if he be a scholar of the Arabic Language and its disciplines, to understand the noble Qur’aan, without seeking assistance in that from the Prophet’s Sunnah in speech and action. This is since he will never be more knowledgeable of the language than the Companions of the Prophet, those who the Qur’aan was revealed to in their language. And (at that time) the language was not blemished with the errors of the non-Arabs and the slang of the common people, but in spite of that, they still erred in understanding these previously mentioned ayaat, when they relied on their knowledge of the language only.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So based on this, it is obvious that <strong>whenever a person is knowledgeable of the Sunnah, he will be more likely to understand the Qur’aan and extract rulings from it, than someone who is ignorant about it</strong>. So how about the one who doesn’t rely on it or reference it at all? This is why from the principles that have been agreed upon by the people of knowledge is: to interpret the Qur’aan with the Qur’aan and the Sunnah,1 and then the sayings of the Companions, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From this, we become aware of the misguidance of the scholars of rhetoric, past and present, and their opposition to the Salaf, in their Creed, not to mention their rulings. And it is their remoteness from the Sunnah and their knowledge of it, and their making their intellects and desires as judges for themselves with regard to the verses concerning Allaah’s Attributes. What is better than what has been stated in Sharh Al- ‘Aqeedah At-Tahaawiyyah [of Ibn Abil-‘Izz Al-Hanafee] (pg. 212, 4th Edition):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“How can someone who didn’t learn from the Book and the Sunnah, but rather just learned it from the views of so and so, speak about the fundaments of the Religion! And if he claims that he is taking it from the Book of Allaah, then he is not taking the interpretation of the Book of Allaah from the ahaadeeth of the Messenger. He doesn’t look into it (i.e. the Sunnah), nor does he look at what the Companions or those who succeeded them in goodness said, which has been conveyed to us by way of reliable narrators chosen by the critics (i.e. hadeeth scholars). For indeed, they did not convey the arrangement of the Qur’aan only, but rather they conveyed the arrangement as well as the meanings. They would not learn the Qur’aan like the children do (today), rather they would learn it along with its meanings. And whoever does not follow their path, then he is speaking based on his opinion. And whoever speaks from his opinion, and from what he thinks Allaah’s Religion is, not getting that from the Book, he is in fact sinning (!), even if he may be correct. Whereas whoever takes from the Book and the Sunnah, he is rewarded even if he errs. However, if he is correct, his reward is multiplied.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said (pg. 217):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“So it is an obligation to completely submit to the Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم, follow his orders, and meet his reports with acceptance and firm belief, without contradicting that by false notions that we consider “reasonable” or that constitute a misconception and doubt. Or that we put before it the views of men and the rubbish held in their minds. So we must single the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم out with regard to making him the judge, submitting to him, obeying him and complying with him, just as we single out the One who sent him in worship, humility, submissiveness, repentance and reliance (to Him).”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>In summary:</strong> It is an obligation upon all of the Muslims to not differentiate between the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, with regard to the obligation of accepting both of them together and establishing Laws based on both of them. Indeed this is the guarantee that will prevent them from drifting to the right and the left, and from returning to deviation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم clearly stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I have left two things for you, which you will never go astray so long as you adhere to them: The Book of Allaah and my Sunnah. These two will never separate from one another until they return to the Fountain.” </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Maalik and Al-Haakim with a sound chain of narration]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] We do not say as is the custom amongst many of the people of knowledge: <strong>“We interpret the Qur’aan by the Qur’aan if there is no trace of it in the Sunnah, then we interpret it by the Sunnah.”</strong> This is due to what we will explain later on in the end of this treatise, when speaking about the (weak) hadeeth of Mu’aadh bin Jabal radhi Allaahu anhu.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some of the Takfeeris make takfeer of themselves (i.e. declare themselves disbelievers). One of the brothers who was in Afghanistan informed me that he sat next to one of them one time while this Takfeeri was busy making takfeer (of people). Then all of a sudden that Takfeeri called him, so he said: What do you want?” So he (the Takfeeri) said: “I have committed kufr (disbelief)!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: Yes, they make takfeer on themselves and they make takfeer on one another. I would like for my brothers in Islaam to refer to the book: “<strong>Al-Farq bainalFiraq</strong>” and the book “<strong>Al-Milal wan-Nihal</strong>” of ash-Shahrastaanee, as well as “<strong>AlFasl</strong>” of Ibn Hazm. So perhaps four or five of them may sit in one gathering and they will not get up from that meeting except that one of them has made takfeer of another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">There can be found a group of these Takfeeris in ‘Aden in the central Mosque. They have entered the masjid recently. How should we deal with them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Answer</strong></span>: It is obligatory to warn the people about them because if you present them with the opportunity, they will shed blood and make lawful that which is prohibited, as the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم informed us they would do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The hadeeth of Umm Salamah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) reported by Muslim: “There will come upon you leaders of whom you will approve of (the good they do) but reject (the bad). So whoever rejects (their bad deeds), he is absolved from blame. And whoever hates (their bad deeds), he is (also) saved. However, whoever is pleased with them and follows them (i.e. bad deeds), (then he is destroyed).” They (the Sahaabah) said: “Shall we fight against them?” He said: “No, so long as they establish the prayer amongst you.” Isn’t this hadeeth a refutation against them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: Yes, I have not mentioned several ayaat and ahaadeeth (during this discussion), such as the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah bin As-Saamit (radhi Allaahu anhu), who reported that the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever bears witness that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah; that ‘Eesaa is the slave and messenger of Allaah, His word, which He placed in Maryam, and a spirit from Him; and that Paradise is true and the Hellfire is true, Allaah will admit him into Paradise, regardless of what actions he has.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth and those similar to it prove that it is not permissible to fight against Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The lowest level of Islaam is not persisting upon committing sins. So if you persist upon committing a sin, then you are a disbeliever. How would you reply to this claim?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: If someone persists on committing a sin, there is no proof that indicates that he is a disbeliever, unless he is persisting upon committing disbelief. As for him persisting upon continuously committing a sin, then this person is guilty of committing a major sin. And Allaah praises the righteous people, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَلَمْ یُصِرُّواْ عَلَى مَا فَعَلُواْ وَهُمْ یَعْلَمُونَ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“And they do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know.”</span><br />
[Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 135]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this person is sinning if he persists in his evil. But as for this action taking him to the level of disbelief, then where is the evidence for this??</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for us to make takfeer of the Jamaa’ah at-Takfeer (i.e. declare them to be disbelievers)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: No, we do not declare them to be disbelievers, for the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said: “Whoever says to his brother: ‘O Kaafir’, then it falls back on one of them. If he is as he said he is (then it falls on him), and if not then it returns back to him.” So we do not say that they are disbelievers. ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib said about the Khawaarij: “Flee from kufr (disbelief).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we consider them to be innovators and misguided, more astray that the donkey of their people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible to wage war against the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: We should not wage war agsint them unless they inititate it against us and we feel that they will present a danger to Islaam and the Muslims. So in that case, we should do what ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib did. Otherwise, the core foundation with regard to the Muslim is that his blood (i.e. life) is sacred, and it is not permissible to wage war against them, unless they initiate first by fighting against the Muslims or it is feared that they will bring harm to the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Jamaa’at at-Takfeer use as evidence the argument that the proof was established upon mankind with Allaah’s statement:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">وَإِذْ أَخَذَ رَبُّكَ مِن بَنِي آدَمَ مِن ظُهُورِهِمْ ذُرِّیَّتَهُمْ وَأَشْهَدَهُمْ عَلَى أَنفُسِهِمْ أَلَسْتَ بِرَبِّكُمْ</span><br />
<span style="color:#993300;">قَالُواْ بَلَى شَهِدْنَا أَن تَقُولُواْ یَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ إِنَّا آُنَّا عَنْ هَذَا غَافِلِينَ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And remember when your Lord brought forth from the Children of Aadam from their loins, their seed and made them testily as to themselves, saying: ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said: ‘Yes, we testify’ lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: ‘Verily we were unaware of this.’” [Surah Al-A’raaf: 172]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And they deem Ibn ‘Abbaas’ interpretation (tafseer) of Allaah’s statement:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">وَمَن لَّمْ یَحْكُم بِمَا أَنزَلَ اللّهُ فَأُوْلَـئِكَ هُمُ الْكَافِرُونَ</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And whoever doesn’t rule by what Allaah has revealed, then they are the disbelievers” [5] in which he said: “It is a (minor) disbelief less than (major) disbelief” to be a weak narration.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: As for using this ayah as evidence, it states that Allaah has taken a covenant from the Children of Aadam, however there is no mention in it that there is not left any excuses for them. the proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَمَا آُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولاً<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“And We never punish until We have sent a messenger (to forewarn).”</span> [Surah AlIsraa: 15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another proof is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">وَمَا آَانَ اللّهُ لِيُضِلَّ قَوْمًا بَعْدَ إِذْ هَدَاهُمْ حَتَّى یُبَيِّنَ لَهُم مَّا یَتَّقُونَ<br />
<span style="color:#008000;">“And Allaah will never lead a people astray after He has guided them until He (first) makes clear to them what they should avoid.”</span> [Surah At-Tawbah: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the Saheeh, from the narration of Hudhaifah radhi Allaahu anhu, the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم informed us that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There was a man who when death approached him asked his children: ‘What kind of a father was I to you?’ They replied: ‘The best father.’ So he said: ‘If I order you to do something, would you do it?’ They said: ‘Yes.’ He said: ‘When I die, burn my body and scatter my ashes (throughout the land and sea), for I swear by Allaah, if Allaah is able to get a hold of me, He will surely punish me with a severe torment, the likes of which no other creature in the universe will face.’ So when he died his children did what he asked. So Allaah commanded the land and the sea to gather his remains, until he brought the man forth and Allaah said to him: ‘What caused you to do what you did?’ He replied: ‘My fear of you.’ So Allaah said to him: “I have indeed forgiven you.’” This is proof that this individual was excused due to his ignorance. He doubted Allaah’s Ability. We don’t say that the word qadira here holds the meaning of: to restrain. So its meaning is not: “If Allaah restrains me.” This is since according to the context of the hadeeth, the appropriate meaning is that it refers to Allaah’s Ability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also the hadeeth of Hudhaifah radhi Allaahu anhu, in which he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is imminent that a time will come upon the people in which one will not know what fasting or prayer is.” So it was said: “What then will remain with them, O Hudhaifah?” He replied: “The testification that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allaah.” It was said: “And what benefit will this testification be for them?” He said: “It will take them out from the Hellfire.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there are many proofs in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah that indicate that one is excused due to ignorance. One of these proofs is the hadeeth reported by Abu Hurairah radhi Allaahu anhu and Al-Aswad bin Saree’ in Musnad Ahmad concerning how the people of Fitrah (innate inclination) will be tested:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“On the Day of Judgement, three types of people will present their arguments to Allaah. One of them will say: ‘I was deaf and could not hear.’ Another will say: ‘I was simple-minded and didn’t have any intellect.’ And the third will present his argument. So Allaah will bring forth a strip from the Hellfire and say to them: ‘Enter it.’ So if they enter it, it will be cool and safe on them. And if they do not enter it, He will say to them: ‘Now you have disobeyed Me. And you would have been the most disobedient to My messengers.’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Jamaa’at at-Takfeer is a deviant group of people. So we advise our brothers in AlBaydaa and Ibb and other places to beware of them and to regard them as misguided individuals who are far away from the Religion. And they should consider them as a danger to Islaam and the Muslims. So they serve as an instrument for everyone that wishes to attack the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, we advise them to repent to Allaah, and to turn back to the people of knowledge. And if they remain upon their misguidance and meet Allaah holding these deviant beliefs, they will regret it, and Allaah is the One who we ask for assistance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Question</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Who is the one who has the ability to make takfeer (declare someone a disbeliever)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>: The scholars are the ones who are capable of placing rulings upon an individual – i.e. if he is either a Muslim or a disbeliever, unless of course if he is a Christian or a Jew or a Communist. Then in this case it is known to the Muslims that such people are disbelievers. There can be found a group that is called Jamaa’at atTakfeer, which is present in Egypt, Sudan and Yemen. This group declares Muslims to be disbelievers due to sins (they commit). And we have made several refutations against them. They feel restrained and pressed back by Da’wah but not by prison and terrorism. However, by calling to the Book and the Sunnah their misguidance can be exposed. The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever says to his brother: ‘O Kaafir’, then it falls back on one of them. If he is as he said he is (then it falls on him), and if not then it returns back to him.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible for a Muslim to declare other Muslims to be disbelievers.[6]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, there is great and profound wisdom behind this Sunnah – i.e. the Sunnah of praying in an open area of land (i.e. the musallaa). And it is that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Muslims will have two days out of the year where all the people of every city can gather together – whether men, women or children – and turn towards Allaah with their hearts in unity, praying behind one Imaam, making the takbeer and the tahleel and supplicating to Allaah sincerely together, as if they were united upon the heart of one man, happy and joyous about the blessing Allaah has bestowed on them. So the ‘Eid will truly be an occasion of celebration for them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم ordered the women to go out to pray ‘Eid along with the people, and he did not make an exception for any of them. This is even to the point that he made no excuses for those women who did not have a garment by which they could veil themselves when coming out, as instead he commanded them to borrow garments from other women. And this is even to the point that he صلى الله عليه وسلم commanded those women who had a reason that prevented them from praying (i.e. menses) to go out to the musallaa, so that they may “witness the good and the supplication of the Muslims.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم, and then his Khaleefahs (successors) after him, and the delegated leaders in the cities would lead the people in prayer. Then they would give them a sermon saying that which would admonish them. And they would teach them what would be of benefit to them in this world and in the Hereafter. And they would order them to give in charity in that gathering. So the rich person would show affection towards the poor person. And the poor would find joy in what Allaah has given them from His Bounty during this blessed assembly, which Allaah’s Mercy and Contentment descends upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is only proper for the Muslims to respond to following the Sunnah of their Prophet and reviving the rites of their Religion, which is the point of their resolution and success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O you who believe! Respond to Allaah and to the Messenger when He calls you to that which will revive you.”</span></strong> [Surah Al-Anfaal: 24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaikh Waliyullaah Ad-Dihlawee said in Hujjatullaah-il-Baalighah under the heading “The Two ‘Eids” (2/30-32):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The foundation with regard to them is that every nation has a day in which they beautify themselves and go out from their city with their adornment. This is a custom, which no group amongst the Arabs and non-Arabs have stopped practicing. When the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم came to Madeenah, he found that the people had two days in which they would go out and enjoy themselves, so he said: ‘Allaah has replaced these two days with something that is better than them – the Day of Adhaa and the Day of Fitr.’ [20] It was said that these two (prior) days of celebration were: <strong>An-Nayrooz</strong> and <strong>Al-Mahrajaan</strong>. These two days were only replaced because there is no ‘Eid for a group of people except that the reason for its existence is to elevate the rites of a Religion or to comply with the founders of a particular way or something that resembles that. So the Prophet feared that if he were to leave them with their custom, there would remain this elevating of the rites of Jaahiliyyah (i.e. the Days of Ignorance) or the propagating of the (false) ways of the ancestors. So he صلى الله عليه وسلم replaced them with two days in which there was found an elevating of the rites of the pure and upright Religion (of Islaam). And along with adorning oneself for the occasion, he صلى الله عليه وسلم included the remembrance of Allaah as well as various acts of obedience, so that the gathering of the Muslims won’t just be for pure play and enjoyment, and so that no gathering from them will be void of raising Allaah’s Word.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of these two days is ‘Eid-ul-Fitr, the day when they end their fasting and give a certain type of their Zakaat. So they experience this ‘natural joy’ that is caused by their withdrawing from conditions that were difficult upon them (i.e. the fast). And the poor person experiences joy at taking his charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ‘intellectual joy’ they experience is due to the delight of knowing that Allaah has blessed them with the ability to complete what He made obligatory upon them (i.e. the fast)…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is the day when Ibraaheem (intended to) sacrifice his son Ismaa’eel, may Allaah be pleased with both of them. But Allaah blessed them both by replacing him with the great sacrifice (i.e. a ram). This is since on this day, one can be reminded and take heed of the condition of the ancestors of this noble and upright religion, by sacrificing one’s soul and wealth in obeying Allaah, and having firm patience. In this, there is a similarity to those performing Hajj, where one tries to emulate them and longs to be in the state they are in. This is why it is legislated to make the Takbeer in it, which is found in Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘And so that you may magnify Allaah (by making Takbeer) for having guided you and so that you may be grateful.’</strong></span> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 185; Surah Al-Hajj: 37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means: Give thanks to Him for granting you the ability to fast. This is why performing the sacrifice and saying the takbeer out loud were legislated on the Days of Minaa. And this is why it is recommended for those who intend to offer the sacrifice to abandon shaving (the body hair). [21] And this is also why the Prayer and the Khutbah (sermon) were prescribed – so that no part of their gathering could be void of the remembrance of Allaah and the elevating of the rites of the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another objective from the objectives of the Pure Legislation is included in this, which is that: Every nation must have some presentation, in which its people gather together during it to display their strength and to show their numbers. This is why it is recommended for everyone to go out (to the musallaa) – even the children, the women, the young girls and the menstruating women. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>However, they (i.e. menstruating women) must not join the musallaa (i.e. the prayer) but rather witness the supplication of the Muslims.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is also why the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم would vary in the roads he took when going and coming from the musallaa, so that the people in each of the roads would see the strength of the Muslims. And since the origin of ‘Eid was to decorate and adorn oneself, it is recommended to wear one’s best garment, to enjoy oneself (taqlees), [22] to take different routes when going and coming and to go out to the musallaa.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">[End Quote]</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] I say: Ahmad and others reported it with an authentic chain of narration. I have referenced it in as-Saheehah (no.2021).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] I say: He is indicating the Prophet’s statement: “<strong>When the Hilaal (crescent) for Dhul-Hijjah is sighted and one of you wants to offer a sacrifice, then he must refrain from cutting his hair and nails</strong>.” And in one narration: “<strong>…then let him not cut any part of his hair or nails until he offers the sacrifice.</strong>” [See Mukhtasar Saheeh Muslim (no. 1251) and others] I say: It is apparent from the hadeeth that anyone who is determined to perform the sacrifice is obligated not to cut his hair and nails until he offers the sacrifice. So this type of cutting mentioned above is forbidden. Imaam Ahmad and others held this view. So let those who are tested with shaving their beards take note of this, for indeed, there are three sinful matters in their shaving of their beards for the day of ‘Eid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: The shaving itself, for it is a feminine trait, an imitation of the disbelievers, and an alteration of Allaah’s creation, as I have explained in my book “Adaab az-Zafaaf fis-Sunnah al-Mutahharah (Sixth Edition, pg. 118).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Adorning oneself for the day of ‘Eid by disobeying Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: What is derived from this hadeeth of the forbiddance of cutting the hair for the one who intends to offer the sacrifice. In reality, there are very few people that are saved from committing this (sin), even some of the people of knowledge (do it)! We ask Allaah to protect us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] Shaikh Ad-Dihlawee said in his footnote: “Taqlees (Enjoying oneself) means beating the duff and playing when the kings arrive, in order to welcome them.” I say: He is indicating the hadeeth that has been reported by Ibn Maajah (1/391) and others with two chains of narration. In one of them is Shareek, who is Ibn ‘Abdillaah Al-Qaadee – he had bad memory. And in the other chain is found Abu Ishaaq, who is As-Subay’ee – he would mix up his narrations. At-Tahaawee weakened it in his Mushkil-ul-Athaar (2/209-210) based on two angles, so refer to it if you wish.</p>

<p>AUTHOR: Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad ash-Shihhee<br />
SOURCE: His book “Al-Wasaayah as-Saniyyah Lit-Taa’ibeena ilaas-Salafiyyah” (pg. 34-39)<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Advice: Seeking Knowledge is the Foundation for the Correctness of your Repentance</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So knowledge is the foundation for the correctness of your repentance. This is due to two reasons:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: For the most part, the misconceptions (you had prior to your repentance) will remain attached to your heart and your mind. So if you do not correct it with beneficial knowledge, you will find yourself accompanied by these misconceptions in your statements, actions and circumstances. Rather, you will find them mixed into your Da’wah (calling to the Way of Allaah), as is the condition of many of those who have leaped from (just) making their repentance to (being active in) the field of Da’wah. So they have begun calling to the Salafee Da’wah, however this call is mixed with the Ikhwaanee misconceptions of gathering people together (regardless of Creed) or the Qutubee misconceptions of making takfeer (declaring Muslims disbelievers) or the Surooree misconceptions of partisanship (hizbiyyah)! So the image displayed is Salafiyyah, but the taste and the smell derived from it is something else!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, their call turns into a Salafiyyah, which consists of particular standards that can have their roots traced back to the misconceptions they had propr to their repentance, which still accompany them and which they have not yet corrected. So you find this person calling to leadership in Da’wah (i.e. that there should be one leader for organizing all the Da’wah in a land).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that one rejects some of the principles of the Salafee Da’wah, claiming that they cause the hearts to be hardened! Or that they cause the brotherly ties to be broken! And this one agrees with the Qutubee ideologies!</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And that one calls to Hizbiyyah (partisanship)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And this one carries ideas of instigation and provocation (of the masses)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">And that one pitches the tent for gathering the people together (regardless of differences)!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">All of this is done using the name of Salafiyyah, so to Allaah we turn for help! Verily to Allaah we belong and to Him we will return.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Or perhaps you are carried away by the strong current of a misconception, such that your path and road towards repenting to Salafiyyah has changed course. So now you have become confused on this road or you begin calling to it, thinking that it is the truth when it is in fact misguidance!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many games do these individuals who claim to have knowledge and stand for Salafiyyah play with the youth who seek to repent to Allaah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is due to nothing else except for their lack of seeking knowledge and their lack of asking questions from the people of knowledge from Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa’ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, O repentant brother, may Allaah grant you success, you must seek beneficial knowledge, because it is that which will correct your repentance and set your path straight. With knowledge, you will free yourself from the misconceptions and the dangers, and you will save yourself from the hunting nets and snares, by the Will and Permission of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the evidences that indicate the virtue of knowledge and those who possess it, then they are many and well known. I will mention from them, for the purpose of reminding:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah bears witness that there is none that has the right to be worshipped but He. And so do the angels, and those having knowledge. (He is always) maintaining His creation with Justice. None has the right to be worshipped but He, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise</strong></span>.” [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is only those who have knowledge amongst His slaves that fear Allaah</strong></span>.” [Surah Faatir: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Allaah will raise in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been given knowledge.</span></strong>” [Surah Al-Mujaadilah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah’s saying, reminding of the blessing He bestowed on His Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) due to what He sent down to him from the Book (Qur’aan) and the Hikmah (Sunnah) and protecting him from people misleading him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Had not the Grace of Allaah and His Mercy been upon you (O Muhammad), a party of them would certainly have made a decision to mislead you, but (in fact) they mislead none except their own selves, and no harm can they do to you in the least. Allaah has sent down to you the Book (Qur&#8217;aan) and the Hikmah (Sunnah), and taught you that which you knew not. And Ever Great is the Grace of Allaah unto you.</strong></span>” [Surah An-Nisaa: 113]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, O repentant brother, when you come to know the importance and virtue of knowledge, and the danger of neglecting it, then know that the first thing you should start with from the various branches of knowledge is:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Definition of the Ikhwaan Al-Muslimoon:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are the followers of <strong>Hasan Al-Bannaa</strong>. There are several points to be noted about their methodology, the most important of which are the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. They show a <strong>lack of importance to Tawheed Al-‘Ibaadah</strong> [1], which is the most important matter in Islaam, since the Islaam of an individual is not valid without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. They remain silent and concede to the people in their performance of major Shirk, supplication to other than Allaah, performance of tawaaf around graves, making oaths to the dead in the graves, sacrificing in their names and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. The founder of this methodology was a <strong>Sufi</strong>. He had a connection with Sufism to the point that he gave bay’ah (oath of allegiance) to ‘Abdul-Wahhaab Al-Khusaafee upon (following) his Khusaafee Shadh-lee order.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. The presence of innovations amongst them and their worshipping Allaah through them – even to the point that the founder of this methodology acknowledged that the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would attend their gatherings of dhikr and that he (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would forgive what past sins they had committed, as is found in his saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>“May Allaah bless the one who upon light in which he appeared<br />
To the worlds, and so he surpassed the sun and the moon<br />
This habeeb (i.e. Muhammad) along with his beloved has gathered<br />
And pardoned everyone in what sins they did in the past.”</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. They call to <strong>establishing the Khilaafah</strong> and this is an innovation because the Messengers and their followers were not entrusted with anything except to call to Tawheed. Allaah says: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>“And We have indeed sent to every nation a messenger, (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah and avoid the taaghoot (false deities).’”</b></span>[Surah An-Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. They have a <strong>lack of Walaa and Baraa</strong> (loyalty and disavowment) or a weak form of it. This is made clear in their call to bring closeness between the Sunnis and the Shee’ah. And their founder was quoted as saying: “We will cooperate with one another in what we agree on and pardon one another in what we disagree on.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. <strong>They hate and despise the people of Tawheed</strong> and those who adhere to the Salafee Way. This is made clear in their talk concerning the Saudi state, which is founded upon Tawheed and which teaches Tawheed in its schools, institutes and universities. And it was made clear in their killing of Jameel Ar-Rahmaan Al-Afghaanee just because he called to Tawheed and because he had schools in which he would teach Tawheed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. <strong>They pursue the mistakes of the leaders</strong> and expose their faults – whether true or false – spreading them amongst the youth in order to make the leaders appear hateful to them and so that they can fill their hearts with contempt against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. They hold detestable <strong>partisanship to the party</strong> they ascribe themselves to. So they show friendship based on this party and they show enmity based on this party.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. They give their <strong>oath of allegiance to work for the Ikhwaani Manhaj</strong> according to the ten conditions that the founder has set forth. And there are other issues of concern, which perhaps can be dealt with at a later time.</p>
<p><b><span style="color:#808080;">Footnotes</span>:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] <b>Translator’s Note:</b> This is the category of Tawheed related to the Oneness of Allaah in the worship that is performed to Him, i.e. that we worship only Allaah and no one else.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The definition of the people who adhere and ascribe to this methodology:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Suroorees are a group of people or a sect that ascribe themselves to <strong>Muhammad Suroor Zayn-ul-‘Aabideen</strong>. They have some aspects of the Sunnah and some aspects of Bid’ah (innovation) in them. The most important characteristics that can be noted from them are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <strong>They attack the rulers and speak about them in a manner that results in evil, corruption and danger</strong>. It appears that they declare the leaders to be disbelievers, but this can only be understood by way of their circumstances and actions and cannot be picked up from their words. This is since the path they take is the path of the Khawaarij or close to it, knowing that the religious texts state the obligation of hearing and obeying the rulers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And our rulers in this land (of Saudi Arabia) are Muslims – all praise be to Allaah. They use Allaah’s Legislation for judging in their court systems and they establish the prescribed punishments (hudood). So declaring them to be disbelievers or talking about them in a manner that leads to revolting and rebelling against them is considered a great form of causing corruption. Due to this, we must warn against those who adhere to this methodology or rid ourselves from them, especially since they have attacked the scholars of this land by reviling them, making slanderous remarks against them and accusing them of betraying the Deen. This matter indicates what they are behind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. <strong>They call to Jihaad, but they do not intend by it the Jihaad against the disbelievers.</strong> Rather it seems like they intend by it to change the leaders, knowing that we cannot rid the leaders of their errors. And we do not claim that they are infallible however we say: It is obligatory to obey them and to advise them in a private manner because they are Muslims. And the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) forbade us from rebelling against the leader unless the one rebelling sees clear disbelief upon him by which he will have a proof from Allaah in the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. <strong>They claim that the scholars in this land do not understand the current affairs</strong>. And they can be refuted by the fact that the Muftees and the judges do not issue a fatwa in a single issue nor do they judge in a single matter except after coming to know its state of affairs, which encompasses it, such as the cause, the conditions for the ruling and its effects. So whoever claims that these scholars and judges do not understand the current affairs then he has wronged himself and spoken what is not permissible for him to say. As for knowing the plans and schemes of the enemies and so on, then this falls under the jurisdiction of each country’s army.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Below are some examples taken from your Gospels [11] that confirm and support what Muhammad came with from the Qur’aan and his teachings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the seventh verse of Chapter 4 of the Gospel of Mathew, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Jesus said to him: ‘Again it is written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.’”</strong></span> [Matthew 4:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. In this same chapter, there occurs a story about Jesus and the Devil, in which the Devil ordered Jesus to prostrate to him. So the Messiah Jesus responded to him, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Be gone Satan, for it is written: &#8216;You shall worship (prostrate only to) the Lord your God and Him only shall you serve (i.e. worship).’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what all the messengers came with and it is the argument that Jesus used against the Devil. So this clearly proves that all of the prophets including Jesus and Muhammad came to establish that God was One and that He was the Lord and only One deserving of being worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Jesus relied on the previously revealed books (from God) as proof, which state that God is the only Lord and that He is the only One who has the right to be worshipped and prostrated to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, Allaah revealed to (Prophet) Muhammad: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And We indeed sent to every nation a messenger (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah alone and avoid the false deities.’ So amongst them were those whom Allaah guided and amongst them were those whose misguidance was justified.”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also revealed to him: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to him: ‘There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped in truth, except Me, so worship Me alone.’”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 23:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these statements that were revealed to Muhammad are in complete conformity with what Jesus stated in his reply to the Devil. It is also in conformity with what Jesus said when calling the Tribe of Israel:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is the Straight Path.”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 19:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it agrees with what he will say on the Day of Judgement when his Lord will ask him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O Jesus, son of Mary, did you tell the people: ‘Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allaah?’ He will reply: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right to say. If I had said such a thing, You would have surely known about it. You know what is in my inner self though I do not know what is in Your Self. Truly, only You are the All-Knowing of all that is hidden. I did not tell them anything except for what You commanded me to tell them, (which was): Worship Allaah, my Lord and your Lord. And I served as a witness for them for as long as I was with them. But when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them, and You are a Witness to all things.’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:116-117]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. In Chapter 11 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 25, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“At that time Jesus declared: ‘I thank thee, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that Thou hast hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes (infants).’”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Jesus was one of God’s servants and messengers. He acknowledged the right of his Lord who created him and bestowed His blessings on him, and therefore turned to Him, in thanks and affirmation that He alone was the Lord of the heaven and earth. This is since He is the One who created these two creations (the heaven and the earth), as well as everything inside them, in between them and whatever lies below the ground. No one else had any part in this – neither Jesus or anyone else – nor can anyone rival Him in that matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. In Chapter 14 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 23, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And after he had dismissed the crowds, he (Jesus) went up on the mountain by himself to pray.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prayer is one of the greatest acts of worship that can be performed to God, and no one engages in it except for a lowly servant who stands in need of the mercy of his Lord and Creator. This is as Allaah says in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O mankind! It is you who stand in need of Allaah, whereas Allaah is Rich (free of all needs), Most Praiseworthy.”</span> </strong>[Qur’aan 35:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“The Messiah (Jesus) will never be too proud to reject being a servant of God, nor the angels who are the ones close (to Him). And whoever is too proud and rejects worshipping Him, then He will gather them all together unto Himself.”</strong> </span>[Qur’aan 4:172]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Jesus was a servant of God, and he was not nor will he ever be too proud to worship Him. This is his condition and the condition of all of the prophets and angels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. In Chapter 26 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 39, it states that the Messiah (Jesus):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“fell on his face and prayed, ‘My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as Thou wilt.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in this text, there is proof that Jesus was a servant (worshipper) of God who had no control over repelling harm from himself or bringing benefit to himself. And there is evidence in this text that he sought refuge in God during times of hardship, seeking His assistance and humbling himself before Him, in order to remove the harm and danger that was approaching him. So he fell prostrate with his face on the ground, seeking nearness to Him, lowering himself before Him, showing his need for Him and expressing the belief that no one has the ability to repel harm except Him. This is the state of all of the messengers, not to mention all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. In Chapter 21 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 46, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“But when they tried to arrest him, they feared the multitudes, since they held him to be a prophet.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is proof in this verse that the masses of people who believed in God and in Jesus were monotheists with pure and sincere faith, and that they believed that Jesus was a messenger and a prophet. This proves that their prophet, Jesus, had taught them this and cultivated them to believe in that. So they did not used to believe that he was God or the son of God, since he would not teach the people these things.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. In Chapter 23 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 10, it states that Jesus said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Neither be called masters, for you, even the Messiah, has One master.”</span> </strong>[12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This text resembles the Qur’anic text in which Allaah informs us that His messenger Jesus told the Tribe of Israel: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And verily, Allaah is my Lord and your Lord.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 3:51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah is the Lord of Jesus, as well as his Master, Nurturer and Owner. He is the Lord, Master and Owner of all mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslim scholar, Taqee-ud-Deen al-Hilaalee, pointed out in his treatise “Clear Evidences” that: Some translators have distorted this text, but that the English translation was saved from this corruption.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. In Chapter 17 of the Gospel of John, verse 3, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And this is the eternal life – that they know Thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This text confirms that which all of the messengers came with, which was that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and it confirms that Jesus was a messenger of God. This was during his time, and every nation had its own time and messenger, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to him: ‘There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped in truth, except Me, so worship Me alone.’”</span> </strong>[Qur’aan 21:25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And We indeed sent to every nation a messenger (saying to his people): ‘Worship Allaah alone and avoid the false deities.’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 16:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. In Chapter 12 of the Gospel of Mark, verses 28-30, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he (Jesus) answered them well, asked him, ‘Which commandment is the first of all?’ Jesus answered, ‘The first is: Hear, O Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is One. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.&#8217;”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the first commandment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in verse 32 of the same chapter, it states that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“The scribe said to him, ‘You are right, teacher. You have truly said that He is One, and there is no other but He.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then in verse 34 of the same chapter, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“And when Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, ‘You are not far from the kingdom of God.’”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This first commandment mentioned by Jesus is the same commandment that Allaah prescribed to all of His messengers, including Jesus – and this was the commandment that the messengers passed on to their nations:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“He has ordained for you the same religion that He ordained for Noah and which We revealed to you (O Muhammad) and ordained for Abraham, Moses and Jesus – that you should establish the Religion and make no divisions in it. Intolerable for the polytheists is that which you call them to.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 42:13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The religion that God ordained for them was the pure monotheistic Faith, which is represented in the statement: “There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah.” He ordered all of his messengers to call to this, and it is that which the polytheists found difficult to accept and for which reason they fought against God’s messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the same thing that Abraham and Jacob, also known as Israel, commanded the people with, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And remember when Abraham and (his son) Ishmael were raising the foundations of the House (Ka’bah at Makkah), saying: ‘Our Lord! Accept this from us. Verily, You are the All-Hearer, the All-Knower. Our Lord! Make us submissive unto You, and of our offspring, a nation submissive unto You. And show us how to perform the ceremonies required during the pilgrimage (to the Ka’bah), and accept our repentance. Truly, You are the One who accepts repentance, the Most Merciful. Our Lord! Send amongst them a messenger of their own (i.e. Muhammad), who shall recite unto them Your verses and teach them the Book and the Wisdom (Prophetic Teachings), and purify them. Verily, You are the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.’ And who turns away from the religion of Abraham except for he who fools himself? Truly, We chose him in this world and in the Hereafter, he will be among the righteous. When his Lord said to him: ‘Submit yourself’, he said: ‘I have submitted myself (as a Muslim) to the Lord of all that exists.’ And this (submission to Allaah) was enjoined by Abraham upon his sons, and also by Jacob, saying: ‘O my sons! Allaah has chosen for you the (true) religion, so do not die except while you are Muslims (i.e. submitting to the Will of your Creator).’ Or were you witnesses when death approached Jacob? – When he said to his sons: ‘What will you worship after me?’ They said: ‘We shall worship your God, the God of your forefathers – Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac – One God and to Him we submit (as Muslims).’”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 2:127-133]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is truly a tremendous religion, in which they submitted their will to the Lord of all that exists, turned to Him in repentance and sought refuge in Him to make their offspring an offspring that submit themselves to God. And they invoked Him to send a messenger from amongst them to them who would recite His verses unto them, teach them the Book and the Wisdom and purify them – the purification and wisdom that would keep them far away from polytheism, foolishness and misguidance. And Allaah rules here that whoever turns away from this religion, which is pure monotheism, only fools himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point derived from this is that the call of all of the prophets was in harmony in that they were calls to Monotheism and to Submission (to God) and that there was no deity that had the right to be worshipped except Allaah. They called their nations to this and counseled those who came after them from their offspring to abide by this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second point we want to focus on here, was the counsel of Israel, who was also known as Jacob. The text of the Bible in this regard is in conformity with the text from the Qur’aan in that the Biblical text indicates we should have love for God. This is also part of Islaam. In fact, the Religion of Islaam also consists of many aspects and great deeds apart from love (for the Creator).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Look at how Jesus responded and what his tremendous counsel was. And look at the faith of the scribe who had asked the question looking for an answer to benefit from, and his statement: “<strong>You are right Teacher. You have truly said that He is One, and there is no other but He.</strong>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And look at how the Messiah responded to him, saying <strong>“You are not far from the kingdom of God.”</strong> This, and Allaah knows best, is a promise from him that he will be in Paradise, and it indicates that anyone who doesn’t believe in the Oneness of God and that He alone should be worshipped will not be allowed entry into Paradise. This is similar to what Allaah says in the Qur’aan, relaying to us what Jesus said to the Tribe of Israel:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Worship Allaah, who is my Lord and your Lord. Verily, whoever ascribes partners to Allaah in worship, Allaah will surely make Paradise forbidden for him and his final abode will be the Hellfire. And the wrongdoers will not have any supporters (in Hell).”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Note: According to the language of the Torah and the Gospels, every righteous and dutiful follower of God is called a son of God, so Jesus was not particularized with this expression of “son of God.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. In Chapter 5 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 9, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. And in verse 45 of Chapter 5 of the Gospel of Matthew, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“So that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. In verse 4 of the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 5, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. In Chapter 6 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 1, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">“Beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. In Chapter 23 of the Gospel of Matthew, verse 9, it states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven.”</strong></span> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses show that use of the terms “father” and “son” to refer to the connection between the Lord and His servant was a practice established in the Bible for all people, so the Messiah, Jesus, was not specifically characterized with this apart from others. [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps all of this was from the behavior of some of the Jews and Christians, but God knows best. This is since Allaah says in the Qur’aan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Jews and the Christians say: ‘We are the children of God and His beloved ones.’ Say: ‘Why then does He punish you for your sins?’ Nay, you are but human beings from those He has created. He forgives whom He wills and He punishes whom He wills. And to Allaah belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. And to Him is the final return.”</span></strong> [Qur’aan 5:18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Any fair and balanced person with sound intellect will realize that the Qur’anic texts we mentioned contain in them a tribute, honor, warm reception and high praise for Jesus. And they confirm that he was a prophet and a messenger, and that he was one of the greatest messengers who carried the banner of Monotheism, called mankind to this Monotheistic Faith, which means making all worship purely for God alone, fought against polytheism, and warned those who adhere to it (polytheism) that they would reside eternally in the Hellfire – what an evil destination!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These verses from the Qur’aan also show how God absolved Jesus and his mother from the slander that the Jews accused them of, how He raised the status of Jesus and his mother and made the statements of the Jews against him and his mother to be considered as disbelief and immense slander.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the texts of the Qur’aan and the Bible are in conformity with the fact that Jesus was a servant and messenger of God. This is a perfect state that no one can attain except for the great messengers amongst whom was Jesus. The teachings of Prophet Muhammad also professed the same beliefs and the Muslims believed in all of this. So what then is wrong with Islaam and the Muslims? There is nothing wrong with it at all, in the eyes of those with sound intellects and impartiality. Rather, the wrong is against God Himself, since the terrible statement (that Jesus is the son of God), due to which the heavens are ready to tear apart, the earth split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins is the opposite of what is indicated in the Qur’aan, the teachings of Prophet Muhammad and what the Muslims adhere to, not to mention what the monotheistic texts still preserved in the Bible indicate.</p>

It should be noted that currently there are many translations of the Gospels (New Testament) in the English Language. The average person can view the various translations and notice gross changes/alterations in the interpretation and translation of many verses of the Bible, not to mention some being left out completely. This is a further proof that the Bible has been distorted and altered as confirmed by God in His Final Revelation, the Qur’aan, which He guaranteed to protect and preserve in its original form. Allaah says: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Verily, We sent down the Reminder (the Qur’aan) and We will surely preserve it (from corruption).”</strong></span> [Qur’aan 15:9] The likes of this promise and guarantee from God was not made for His previous revelations, hence the obvious and noticeable contradictions in the present-day versions of these revealed Books of God – the Torah and the Gospels.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Translator’s Note: The use of the relationship of Father and Son to refer to the connection between God and His righteous servants is not just limited to the New testament of the Bible, rather, there can be found proof for it in the Old Testament as well:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair; and they took to wife such of them as they chose.”</span> [Genesis 6:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“The Nephilim were on the earth in those days, and also afterward, when the sons of God came in to the daughters of men, and they bore children to them.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of men, he fixed the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God.”</span> [Deuteronomy 32:8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan also came among them.”</span> [Job 1:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?”</span> [Job 38:7]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Translator’s Note:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Further evidence from the New Testament that confirms this point that the use of the relationship between Father and Son as a substitute for the relationship between God and His servant is as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“For they cannot die any more, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.”</span> [Luke 20:36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.”</span> [Romans 8: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God.”</span> [John 1:12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“And not for the nation only, but to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.”</span> [John 11:52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“It is the Spirit himself bearing witness with our spirit that we are children of God.”</span> [Romans 8:16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“…because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God.”</span> [Romans 8:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“That you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world.”</span> [Philippians 2:15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“See what love the Father has given us – that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.”</span> [1 John 3:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> “By this it may be seen who are the children of God, and who are the children of the Devil, Whoever does not do right is not of God, nor he who does not love his brother.”</span> [1 John 3:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">“By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandment.”</span> [1 John 5:2]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, the example of Jesus in the sight of Allaah is like the example of Adam – He created him from dust and then said to him ‘Be’ and he was. This is the truth from your Lord, so do not be from those who doubt. So whoever disputes with you concerning him (i.e. Jesus) after all this knowledge (about him) has come to you, say: ‘Come, let us summon our children and your children, our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves and then invoke God to send His curses on those of us who is lying.’ Verily, this is the true story (about Jesus). And there is no God that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. And indeed Allaah is the All-Mighty, All-Wise.”</strong> [Qur’aan 3:59-62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This great example is a decisive proof that cancels out all the claims of the Christians. This is because if it is not possible or correct according to sound minds, religious doctrines, and innate natures to claim that Adam, whom God created from dust with His Hands and breathed into him his soul, is God or the son of God or part of a divine trinity, then it is for all the more reason that such cannot be claimed for Jesus. This is since the creation of Adam was more remarkable and amazing than that of Jesus, as he was created from dust and dust is not part of the human race.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, Jesus was created from a woman, who is part of the human race, and she carried him in her womb in the same manner that woman carry children, and gave birth to him in the same manner that women give birth to children. So this is from the greatest of proofs that invalidate the false claims and absurd misconceptions of the Christians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As a matter of fact, the angels were created from light without any fathers or mothers, and the Devil was created from fire without any parents. So this is something more remarkable and indicative of the great Ability of God, the Creator, Molder and Originator of the heavens and earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the creation of Eve from the rib of Adam, without any mother, was more miraculous than the creation of Jesus, who was conceived, carried in the womb of a woman and given birth to just as normal women give birth to children. So there does not remain any connection for the Christians according to every person possessing intellect, religion and fairness. But in spite of all this, Jesus, in the eyes of Islaam and the Muslims is far more superior than Adam and many of the other prophets and messengers, according to the Qur’aan and the teachings of Prophet Muhammad. This is since Jesus is one of the five messengers possessing strong will and determination, according to Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So after all this has been said, what is it that will change between the Christians and Islaam, which is the true religion of God and the religion of Jesus and all of the prophets? Won’t they realize that the greatest form of misguidance and disbelief is to claim that God has a wife and a child, since this is the biggest insult and debasement that can be leveled against God, Lord of all that exists? And the greatest denial of Jesus is to disbelieve in the true message that he brought, such as by saying that he is the son of God, etc., even though he clearly stated from the very first day that he was a slave of God who gave him Revelation, made him a prophet, blessed him wherever he was and entrusted him with prayer and charity. These are characteristics that apply to a created being that is raised and nurtured and in need of his Lord, submitting himself to His Majesty and obedient to His commands.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">O Brothers, know that the Muslim ummah is divided into three groups with respect to Allaah’s Pre-Decree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First Group:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They went <strong>overboard</strong> in their affirmation of Allaah’s Pre-Decree, denying that the human being has any ability or choice in the matter. They hold that “<strong>A person has no ability or choice – he is controlled and has no free will, just like a tree when it is blown by the wind</strong>.” They do not distinguish between a person’s action that occur as a result of his choice and an action of his that occurs without him choosing so. No doubt, these people are astray, because what is known from the Religion by necessity, and from the intellect and customs, is that a human being knows the difference between an action he chooses to do and an action he is forced into doing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Group:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They went to <strong>extremes in their affirmation of a person’s ability and choice</strong>, such that they negated Allaah having any part in Willing or Choosing or Creating what action a person does. And they claimed that a person is independently responsible for producing his action. This is such that a group amongst them went too far, saying: “<strong>Allaah does not know what actions His servants will do until after it occurs from them</strong>.” These people have also gone to extremes and shown great radicalism in affirming a human being’s ability and choice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Third Group:</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the ones who truly believe, and so Allaah has guided them concerning that which is disagreed upon from the truth. They are Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. They have treaded the moderate path and the middle course, which is based on religious and logical proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they say: The actions that Allaah introduces into existence are divided into two types:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: The actions from Allaah that He causes to occur in His Creation. No one has any choice in regard to these actions, and they are such as when rain descends, when the earth produces vegetation, when life or death occurs, when health or sickness befalls and so on and so forth – from the many things that can be observed occurring within the creation. Without doubt, no one has any part in choosing or willing for these things to transpire, but rather it is only Allaah who wills that to happen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: The actions that the creation, i.e. all of the various types of creatures that possess a willingness, do. These actions occur as a result their choosing and wanting to do them, since Allaah gave them the ability to do that, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“To whoever amongst you wills to go straight.”</strong> [Surah At-Takweer: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Among you is he who desires the worldly life and among you is he who desires the Hereafter.”</strong> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 152]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So whoever wishes, then let him believe, and whoever wishes then let him disbelieve.”</strong> [Surah Al-Kahf: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A human being knows the difference between what occurs from him as a result of his own free will and what occurs from him as a result of being compelled and forced. So for example, when a human being climbs a ladder to get to the roof of a house, he ascends the ladder out of his own free will, and while knowing that he freely chose to do so. But when he trips and falls down from the roof, he knows that he did not choose to do that. So he can tell the difference between these two actions – that he freely chose to do the former, while he was compelled to do the latter. Every human being knows this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, when a person is stricken with a sickness in which his urine constantly flows out, this urine comes out from him without his desiring or choosing that. But when he is in a healthy state and free from this sickness, the urine comes out from him when he wills and chooses. So he knows the difference between this and that. No one can deny the difference between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the same goes with everything else that occurs to a person – he can tell the difference between what occurs due to his free will and what occurs due to his being coerced and forced. As a matter of fact, due to Allaah’s Mercy there are some actions a person may do on his own free will, yet not be held accountable for any of them, as is the case with a person when he sleeps or forgets. In the story of the people of the Cave, Allaah tells us:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And you would have thought them to be awake whereas they were asleep. And We turned them on their right and on their left sides.”</strong> [Surah Al-Kahf: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were the ones who turned around in their sleep, yet Allaah ascribes the action to Himself. This is because when a person sleeps, he has no choice or free will in his actions, and he will not be held accountable for actions done in this state, so the act is attributed to Allaah. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>“Whoever forgets while fasting, and eats or drinks, then he should complete his fast because it was only Allaah who fed him and gave him to drink.”</strong> [2] So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) attributed this act of feeding and quenching thirst to Allaah, because the action occurred from the individual without him being aware of it, so it is as if it happened without him choosing to do it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of us know the difference between when a person experiences pain or joy within himself at times without choosing so, and not knowing the reason why and between him experiencing these pains or these joys as a result of an act that he did himself. This matter, all praise be to Allaah is clear and there is no confusion over it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers: If we were to take the view of the first group (i.e. the Jabariyyah) who went to extremes in affirming the Divine Pre-Decree, the Religion would be invalidated from its very foundation. This is since the belief that a person has no choice or free will in his actions necessitates that he not be praised for a praiseworthy act or that he be blamed for a blameworthy act, since in reality they were not done by his choice or free will. So then this would mean that Allaah, may He be far removed from it, is oppressing those who sin when He punishes and recompenses them for their acts because He has punished them for something they had no free choice or free will in! This no doubt clearly contradicts the Qur’aan. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And his companion (angel) will say: ‘Here is (his record) ready with me!’ (Allaah will say to the angels): ‘Both of you, throw into the Hellfire every stubborn disbeliever, hinderer of good, transgressor, doubter, he who set up another god with Allaah. So both of you cast him into the Severe Torment.’ His (devil) companion will say: ‘Our Lord! I did not push him to transgress, but rather it was he himself who was in error, far astray. Allaah will say: ‘Do not dispute in front of Me, I had already sent the threat to you in advance. The Word (Ordainment) that comes from Me cannot be changed, and I am not unjust to the slaves.’”</strong> [Surah Qaaf: 23-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah clarifies that this punishment is not oppression from Him, but rather that it is complete justice since He had previously given them a warning and clarified to them the various paths and explained the truth and falsehood to them, but they chose for themselves the path of falsehood. So there didn’t remain any proof for them before Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if we were to take this false view, it would invalidate Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Messengers, bearing glad tidings and warning in order that mankind would not have any argument (i.e. proof) against Allaah after the (coming of) Messengers.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah denies that mankind should have any excuses after the sending of Messengers because the proof has been established against them with that. So if the Divine PreDecree was an excuse for them, this excuse would be infinite even after the advent of the messengers since Allaah’s Pre-Decree did not cease and will not cease to exist before and after the sending of messengers. So therefore, this view is invalidated by the religious texts, and it is invalidated by reality, as we have explained in the previous examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who hold the second view, then the religious texts and reality also refute them since the texts clearly state that a person’s will is subject to Allaah’s Will:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“To whoever amongst you wills to go straight. However, you cannot will unless Allaah, Lord of the Universe, wills.”</strong> [Surah At-Takweer: 28-29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And your Lord creates whatever He wills and chooses.”</strong> [Surah Al-Qasas: 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> “And Allaah calls (you) to the Abode of Peace, and guides whomever He wills to the Straight Path.”</strong> [Surah Yoonus: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who hold this view (i.e. the Qadariyyah) are in reality invalidating one of the aspects of Allaah’s Lordship, and they are also claiming that there can be found in Allaah’s dominion that which Allaah did not will or create, when in fact Allaah wills everything, creates everything and has pre-decreed everything. They also contradict that which is known by necessity, which is that everything that is created belongs to Allaah, their essence as well as their attributes, there being no distinction between the attribute and the essence. Therefore, everything belongs to Allaah so it is not possible for there to be anything in His dominion that He did not desire. So what path should a person take and what is his solution if Allaah has pre-decreed that He go astray and not be guided?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We say: The answer to this is that Allaah only guides those who deserve to be guided, and He leads astray only those who deserve to be led astray. Allaah says:<strong> “So when they turned away, Allaah turned their hearts away.”</strong> [Surah As-Saff: 5] And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So because they breached their covenant, We cursed them and made their hearts grow hard. They change the words from their (right) places and have abandoned a good part of the Message that was sent to them.”</strong> [Surah AlMaa’idah: 13] So Allaah clarified that what caused the person to go astray was himself. A person, as we have explained previously, doesn’t know what Allaah has pre-decreed for him since he doesn’t know what has been pre-decreed until after it occurs. So he doesn’t know if Allaah has decreed for him to be astray or guided. So if this is the case, how can he take the path of misguidance, then use as an excuse the argument that this is what Allaah willed for him? Wouldn’t it be more befitting for him to tread the path of guidance and then say that Allah has guided me to the Straight Path?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it right for him to be a Jabaree, i.e. claim that he is forced, when he is misguided, and a Qadaree, i.e. that Allaah has no part in his deeds, when he obeys?! Never! II does not befit a person to claim that he was forced when he finds himself upon misguidance and sin. So when he goes astray and disobeys Allaah, he says: “This is something that has been written and pre-decreed for me, and I am not able to remove myself from what Allaah has ordained for me.” Yet when he does good deeds and Allaah grants him obedience and guidance, he claims that this came solely from himself, saying: “I attained this by myself.” So he becomes a Qadaree when it comes to guidance and a Jabaree when it comes to disobedience. This is not possible ever. So in reality, a person has ability and will. The door to guidance is not any more hidden than the door to sustenance and the door to seeking knowledge. A person, as is well known to everybody, has pre-decreed for him whatever he has from sustenance. But yet in spite of this, he strives for the means of sustenance in his country and outside of it, on the right and on the left. He doesn’t just sit at home and say: “Provision has been pre-decreed for me and it will come to me.” On the contrary, he strives for the means of sustenance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Yet sustenance itself goes hand and hand with actions/works, as has been authentically reported on the Prophet, in the narration of Ibn Mas’ood, who said that he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:<strong> “Verily, the creation of each of you is brought together in his mother’s womb for forty days in the form of a seed. Then he becomes a clot of blood for the same amount of time, then a morsel of flesh for the same amount of time. Then an angel is sent to him and commanded with four things: to record his sustenance, his lifespan, his actions, and whether he will be miserable or happy.”</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this sustenance is written just as the good and evil actions are written. So how is it that you can go here and there, traversing land and sea, seeking the sustenance of the world and yet you don’t perform any righteous deed seeking the sustenance of the Hereafter or the success of Paradise? Indeed, these two aspects are one and the same. There is no difference between the two of them. So likewise, you strive for your sustenance and you strive for your livelihood and to prolong your lifespan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But when you become ill with a sickness, you travel through all the regions of the world looking for a skilled doctor who will cure your sickness. This is even though whatever has been pre-decreed for you as your lifespan will come to be and it will not increase or decrease. Yet you do not rely on this and say: “I will remain sick and bedridden at home, and if Allaah has decreed that my lifespan will be prolonged, then it will be prolonged.” Rather, we will find you striving with all of your might and energy to find a doctor whom you regard will be the best one at whose hands Allaah will ordain your recovery. So why don’t you do acts for the Hereafter and righteous deeds the same way you do acts for this worldly life?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We stated previously that: The Divine Pre-Ordainment is a hidden secret, you have no way of finding out about it. So right now, you are between two paths – a path that will take you to salvation and success, and a path that will take you to destruction and regret. So right now, you are standing between these two paths with a free choice. There is no one in front of you preventing you from taking the right path or the left path. If you wish, you can go here, and if you wish, you can go there. So how can you take the left path and say: “This has been pre-decreed for me!” Isn’t it more befitting for you to take the right path and say: “This has been pre-decreed for me?!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you want to go on a journey to some other country and before you lies two roads, one of which is paved, short and safe, while the other is unpaved, long and dangerous, we would find you choosing the short, paved and safe road and not the other one. So this figurative road is similar to it and doesn’t differ from it at all. However, it is the souls and desires that sometimes govern and take over the mind. The believer must take over and control his desires. And when his mind judges, the mind, according to its correct meaning, should prevent a person from what harms it and lead it to what benefits and pleases it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With this it becomes clear that people have a free choice when it comes to their actions, and that they are not coerced. And just as he has a free choice in the acts of his worldly affairs, if he wills he will put out this product or make that his business, then likewise he has a free choice with regard to the affairs of the Hereafter. In fact, the paths of the Hereafter are clearer by far than the paths of this worldly life, because the One who clarifies the paths of the Hereafter is Allaah, in His Book and upon the tongue of His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). So the paths of the Hereafter are clearer and more lucid than the paths of the worldly life. But in spite of this, people still tread the paths of the worldly life, which have no guaranteed results and abandon the paths of the Hereafter, whose results are guaranteed and known since they are affirmed by Allaah’s promise, and Allaah does not break His promises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having said this, we say that Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah affirm all of this and make it their Creed and Belief that: A person acts on his own free will and says what he wants. However, his desire and choosing are subject to Allaah’s Will and Desire. Furthermore, Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah believe that Allaah’s Will is subject to His Wisdom, and that it is not a pure and absolute Will, but rather a will that is dependent on His Wisdom. This is because one of Allaah’s Names is Al-Hakeem (The MostWise), and the Most-Wise is the One who judges matters precisely realistically and religiously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And based on His Wisdom, He decrees guidance for the one who desires it and for the one whom He knows wants the truth and whose heart is upon steadfastness. And He decrees misguidance for the one who is not like this – the one who when Islaam is presented to him, his heart becomes constricted as if he were being forced to ascend to the sky. So Allaah’s Wisdom refuses to let this person be from among the guided, unless Allaah renews his determination for him and changes his desire to another desire. And Allaah is Able to do all things. However, Allaah’s Wisdom insists that the causes be closely linked to the effects.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Fudail (rahimahullaah) said: “<strong>The believer conceals (the sin of his brother) and advises (him), while the evildoer disgraces and condemns (him)</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what Al-Fudail has mentioned as being from the signs of advising and condemning &#8211; and it is that advising is linked to secrecy while condemning is linked to publicizing.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It used to be said: <strong>“Whosoever commands his brother (towards doing good) at the head of a gathering, then he has condemned him.”</strong> Or it is something with this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaf used to hate that commanding good and forbidding evil be done in this manner. Instead, they loved that it be done privately between the one commanding and the one being commanded, for indeed, this is from the signs of sincere advice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since it is not the goal of the one who is advising to spread and publicize the faults of the person he is advising, rather his goal is only to put an end to the evil that he has fallen into.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for spreading and exposing someone&#8217;s faults, then that is from the things that Allaah and His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم have forbidden. Allaah, may He be Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, those who love that the evil and indecent actions of those who believe should be propagated (and spread), they will have a painful torment in this world and the Hereafter. And Allaah knows and you know not. And had it not been for the grace of Allaah and His mercy on you, (Allaah would have hastened the punishment on you) and that Allaah is full of kindness, Most Merciful.”</strong> [Surah An-Noor: 19-20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ahaadeeth concerning the virtue of keeping the faults of others secret are many.[27] Some of the scholars would say to those who were commanding towards good:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Strive hard to conceal the faults of the sinners, for indeed, exposing their faults shows a weakness in Islaam. The thing that deserves the most to be concealed is one’s faults.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is for this reason that spreading someone’s evil and indecent actions is linked to condemning. And they are both from the affairs of the evildoer, since it is not the goal of the evildoer to put an end to the fault nor that the believer avoids that fault or defect. Rather his only goal is to spread and publicize the defects found in his believing brother, and to destroy his honor. So he initiates that and repeats it. And his intention is to belittle his believing brother by exposing his defects and bad qualities to the people so that some harm can fall upon him in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for the person that is sincerely advising, his aim in doing that (advising) is to eradicate the faults found in his believing brother and to help him avoid it. This is what Allaah the Most High, has described His Messenger صلى الله عليه وسلم with, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any harm or difficulty. He is anxious over you (to rid you of faults and sin), for the believers he is full of pity, kind and merciful.”</strong> [Surah At-Tawbah: 128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He described his صلى الله عليه وسلم Companions with that, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. And those who are with him (i.e. his Companions) are severe with the disbelievers and merciful towards one another.”</strong> [Surah Al-Fath: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He described the believers with the characteristics of patience and mutual advising of one another towards mercy and compassion. [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">But what drives the evildoer to propagate (his brother’s) evil and to disgrace him is force and harshness, his love for abusing his believing brother, and (his desire) to inflict some harm upon him</span>. These are the characteristics of the Devil – the one who beautifies disbelief, sin and disobedience to the children of Aadam so that due to it they may become amongst the dwellers of the Hellfire, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, the Devil is an enemy for you, so take him as an enemy. Verily, he only calls his party (of followers) to be from amongst the dwellers of the Hellfire.”</strong> [Surah Faatir: 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says, after telling us the story of Iblees (the Devil) when he was with the prophet of Allaah, Aadam, and the evil plot that he unleashed on him, such that it brought him to be cast out from Paradise:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O Children of Aadam! Let not the Devil deceive you, as he got your parents out of Paradise, stripping them of their garments, to show them their private parts.”</strong> [Surah Al-A’araaf: 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what a difference there is between one whose intention it is to advise (naseehah) and one whose intention it is to disgrace (fadeehah)! And no one confuses one of these with the other, except someone who does not possess sound intellect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[27] See Fath-ul-Baaree (5/97) and Saheeh Muslim (4/1996)</span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"> [28] As is found in Allaah’s saying: “Then he became from among those who believed and recommended one another towards patience and recommended one another towards compassion.” [Surah Al-Balad. 17]</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The Fourth Provision: The Caller must adorn himself with noble characteristics</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Caller must adorn himself with noble characteristics, such that the effect of knowledge reflects in his beliefs, his worship, his attitude, and all of his procedures, so that he can properly play the role of a Caller to Allaah. But as for him being in opposition to this, then his da’wah will fail. And if he does succeed, then his success will be minimal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So it is upon the Caller to abide by that which he is calling to from acts of worship or daily interactions or manners or methodology, so that his da’wah may be accepted and so that he won’t be from those who will be the first to be thrown into the Hellfire.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers: Indeed if we look at our conditions we will find in reality that we may call to something that we don’t implement ourselves. And this no doubt is a big defect, O Allaah, unless we deny ourselves from looking at what is better since for every place there is a saying. This is since a noble thing may be considered noble due to a number of things that make it superior. This is why the Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would call to some characteristics, but at times he would preoccupy himself with things more important than them. At times he would fast to the point that it would be said that he wouldn’t stop fasting. And at times he would eat and drink to the point that it would be said that he would not fast.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brothers! I would like every Caller to abide by the characteristics that befit the Caller, so that he can be a true Caller and so that his statements can be closer to being accepted.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Sixth Provision : The Caller’s heart must be open towards the one who opposes him</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Caller’s heart must be open towards the one who opposes him, especially if he knows that his opponent has a good intention and that he only opposes him in things that require that the proof be established to him. People must be flexible in these matters and not allow these differences to incite hatred and enmity. This is except for a man that opposes and stubbornly rejects, such that the truth is explained to him but yet he continues to persist upon his falsehood Such an individual must be dealt with according to how he deserves to be treated, such as calling people away from him and warning the people from him. This is since his enmity has manifested itself, such that the truth was made clear to him, yet he did not act on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, there are some <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>subsidiary issues</strong></span>, which the people differ on. In reality, these are from the matters that Allaah allowed His servants to differ in. I mean issues that are not from the fundamental ones, which can cause a person that opposes in them to be considered a disbeliever. Rather, these (subsidiary) issues are from those that Allaah has permitted differing in for His servants, and for which He made the error committed in that regard to be allowable. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>“When the (legal) judge makes a judgement, exerting himself (Ijtihaad), and he attains the truth, then he gets two rewards. And if he errs then he gets one reward.”</strong> So the Mujtahid does not leave from the fold of being rewarded at all – either he gets two rewards for being correct or one reward for being wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you don’t like others opposing you, then likewise, those same other people don’t like for others to oppose them. So just as you want people to accept your view (on an issue), then likewise, those who oppose you want the people to take their views also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reference point during these times of dispute is what Allaah has explained in His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whatever you differ in, then its final decision is with Allaah. Such is Allaah, my Lord, in whom I put my trust, and to Him I turn in repentance.”</strong> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger, and those in authority amongst you. And if you differ in anything, then return it to Allaah and the Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everyone that is in disagreement and dispute with one another must return to these sources: The Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger. And it is not lawful for anyone to turn away from the words of Allaah and His Messenger in favor of someone else’s words, regardless of who he may be. So if the truth becomes manifest to you, it is an obligation upon you to throw the view of the one who opposes it against the wall. And you must not turn towards that individual, regardless of what position he holds in knowledge and religion. This is since humans make errors, whereas the words of Allaah and His Messenger are free from errors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">It saddens me to hear that there are some people that look hard into seeking the truth and arriving at it, but in spite of this we find them divided. Each one of them has a particular name and a particular description. And this in reality is a mistake</span></strong>. <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Allaah’s religion is one and the ummah of Islaam is one.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And indeed this ummah (nation) of yours is one ummah. And I am your Lord so be dutiful to Me.”</strong> [Surah Al-Mu’minoon: 52]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah said to His Prophet Muhammad;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, those who split up their Religion and became sects, you have nothing to do with them in the least. Their affair is only with Allaah. Then He will inform them of what they used to do.”</strong> [Surah Al-An’aam: 159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nooh, and that which We have revealed to you (O Muhammad), and that which We ordained for Ibraaheem, Moosaa and ‘Eesaa saying: You should establish the religion and make no divisions in it. Intolerable to the polytheists is that which you call them to. Allaah chooses for Himself whom He wills, and guides unto Himself those who turn to Him in repentance and obedience.”</strong> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if these are Allaah’s instructions to us, then what is obligatory upon us is to accept these instructions, and gather together upon putting forth an issue and discussing it with one another, in order to bring about rectification not in order to criticize or take revenge. For indeed, any person that debates with someone else intending to give victory to his view and to debase his opponent’s view, or intending to critique and not to correct, then for the most part, they will come out with a result that is not pleasing to Allaah and His Messenger. So it is obligatory on us, in matters such as these, to be one ummah (nation).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I am not saying that no one errs – everyone either makes mistakes or is correct. Rather, I am talking about the way to correct this error. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The way to correct this error is not by me talking about him behind his back and accusing him. Rather, the way to correct this error is to gather with him and discuss it with him</span>. So if it becomes clear after this that this man will persist on his rejection of the truth, and that he will continue to remain upon the falsehood that he is on, then at this point I have the excuse and the right, rather I am obligated to expose his error, and to warn the people about his error. And this way, the affairs will be rectified. As for splitting up and creating parties, then no one is pleased with this except for someone that is an enemy to Islaam and the Muslims.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allaah to unite our hearts upon obedience to Him, and that He make us from those who seek judgement from Allaah and His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). And we ask Allaah to make our intentions sincere and that He clarify to us what is obscure from his Sharee’ah. Verily, He is the Most Magnanimous, Most Generous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, Lord of the worlds, and may the peace and blessings be on our Prophet Muhammad, his family and all his Companions</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Third Provision: Wisdom</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Caller must invite to Allaah with wisdom. And how bitter is wisdom upon the one who doesn’t have it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Da’wah (the Call) to Allaah must occur with (1) wisdom, then with (2) fair admonition, then with (3) debating in the best of manners against someone that is not oppressive, then with (4) debating in not the best of manners against someone that is oppressive. So there are four levels.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Call to the Way of your Lord with wisdom and fair admonition. And debate them in a way that is better. Verily, your Lord knows best who has gone astray from His path and He knows best those who are guided.”</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And do not debate with the People of the Scripture (i.e. the Jews and the Christians) except in a manner that is best – except for those who are oppressive amongst them, and say (to them): ‘We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you. Our God and your God is One, and to Him we have submitted.’”</strong> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 46]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Wisdom means: Treating affairs with accuracy and precision, rather it means placing matters in their due place. It is not from wisdom to rush things and expect people to change from the condition they are in to the condition that the Companions were upon overnight. And whoever expects this then he has a foolish mind, and he is far removed from wisdom. This is because the wisdom of Allaah is not like this.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What proves this is that Allaah sent the Qur’aan down to Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah, in stages so that it may become firm and settled in the souls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The prayer</strong> was made obligatory during the Mi’raaj, three years before the Hijrah. Some say it was a year and a half, and some hold that it was five. There is differing amongst the scholars about this. But in spite of this it was not made obligatory in the manner that it is performed today. When the prayer was first made obligatory, it used to be two rak’ahs for Dhuhr, ‘Asr, ‘Ishaa and Fajr. And the Maghrib prayer used to be three rak’aat, so that it could be the Witr (odd-number) for the day. But after the Hijrah and after the Prophet had spent thirteen years in Makkah, the prayer of the resident was increased, and so it became four rak’aat for Dhuhr, ‘Asr and ‘Ishaa. And Fajr remained the way it was (i.e. two rak’aat) because the recitation of the Qur’aan is prolonged in it. And Maghrib stayed the same because it was the Witr of the day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, <strong>Zakaat</strong> was made obligatory in the second year after Hijrah. Or (some say) it was made obligatory in Makkah, but that it was not assigned its final estimate in terms of its dividend and obligation. And the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) did not send out envoys to collect the Zakaat until the ninth year after Hijrah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the development of Zakaat progressed in three stages:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. In Makkah: “But pay its due (i.e. Zakaat) on the day of its harvest.” [Surah Al-An’aam: 141] However, its obligation was not clarified nor the amount that was mandated to give for that obligation. This matter was left entrusted to the people.<br />
2. In the second year after Hijrah, Zakaat was clarified with its rightful dividends.<br />
3. And in the ninth year after Hijrah, the Prophet started to send envoys to the people of yields and profits to collect Zakaat from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So look at the careful consideration that was given to the conditions of the people with regard to Allaah’s legislation. And He is the best of judges.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for fasting, as there was a stage-by-stage development with regard to its legislation. What was first made obligatory, was that a person had a choice between fasting or feeding a needy person. Then fasting was prescribed specifically, and feeding needy people was only allowed for those who weren’t able to fast for numerous consecutive days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Therefore I say that wisdom denounces that the world change over in one night. There must be endurance and tolerance. Accept from your brother whom you are calling what he has from truth for today, and proceed with him step by step until he is able to eventually free himself from falsehood. And this is so that you may see that people are not of equal standing. So there is a difference between one is ignorant and one who stubbornly rejects.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps it is proper that I now mention some examples of the Da’wah of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First Example:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Bedouin man once entered the masjid, while the Prophet was sitting down with his Companions. The Bedouin man then urinated in one area of the masjid, so the people reprimanded him, meaning they scolded him angrily using harsh words. However, the Prophet, who was the one whom Allaah gave wisdom, forbade them from this. So when the man had finished urinating, the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) ordered that a bucket of water be thrown over his urine. So the harm was removed and Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) called the Bedouin to him, saying to him: “<strong>Indeed it is not proper to have any harmful object or filth in these masaajid. They are only for prayer and the reciting of the Qur’aan</strong>.” Or it is as he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said. So the Bedouin’s heart opened up to this kind treatment. This is why I have seen some of the scholars quote this Bedouin man as saying: “<strong>O Allaah, have mercy on me and Muhammad and do not have mercy on anyone else besides us</strong>.” This was because the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) treated him in such an excellent manner. But as for the Companions, they rushed to remove this evil act, without having properly weighed the condition of this man, who was (obviously) ignorant. [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Example:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One time Mu’awiyah bin Al-Hakam, may Allaah be pleased with him, came while the Prophet was leading the people in prayer. So one man sneezed and said: “AlHamdulillaah.” <span style="color:#808080;">(<strong>Note</strong>:) If one of you sneezes while in prayer then he should say AlHamdulillaah, regardless of whether he is in the standing position or the bowing position or in prostration</span>. This man (in prayer) said “Al-Hamdulillaah, so Mu’awiyah responded: “YarhamukAllaah.” But this is considered speaking and it invalidates the prayer. So the people began to stare and look at him. So Mu’awiyah said: “May my mother be bereaved of me.” This means for the mother to be lost. This is a statement that is said but for which it’s meaning is not intended. Then Mu’awiyah continued to pray. After he finished praying, the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) called him. Mu’awiyah said: “By Allaah, I did not see a teacher better at instructing than him.” May Allaah send His peace and blessings on him. He said: “By Allaah, he was not harsh with me nor did he scold me, he only said: ‘Speaking to people is not correct while in the prayer. It is only for tasbeeh (saying SubhaanAllaah), takbeer (saying Allaahu Akbar) and reciting of the Qur’aan.’” Or it is as he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) even said it to Mu’aadh bin Jabal when he told him: “Shall I not inform you of what controls all of that?” He (i.e. Mu’aadh) said: “Of course O Messenger of Allaah.” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Restrain this on yourself.” And he took hold of his tongue, saying: “Restrain this.” So Mu’aadh said: “Will we be held accountable for what we say with it?” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “May your mother be bereaved of you O Mu’aadh. What else will cause the people to be dragged on their faces – or he said on their noses – into the Hellfire except for the harvests of their tongues.” Look at the da’wah that is beloved to the souls, which people accept and by which the hearts become open.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We derive from the Fiqh point of benefits of this hadeeth that: Whoever speaks while in prayer, while not knowing that speaking invalidates the prayer, his prayer is still valid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Third Example:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man came to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and said: “O Messenger of Allaah, I am ruined!” So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) asked: “And what caused you to be ruined?” He said: “<strong>I had intercourse with my wife during Ramadaan while I was fasting</strong>.” So the Messenger of Allaah ordered him to free a slave, but he said: “I cannot find one (i.e. unable).” Then he commanded him to fast two consecutive months, but he said; “I am not able to.” Then he commanded him to feed sixty needy people, but he said: “I am not able to.” At this the man sat down. So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) brought some dates to him saying: “Take this and give it away in charity.” But the man became desirous of the Prophet’s generosity, which was the greatness of kindness shown towards creation. This was since the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was indeed the most generous of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the man said: “Am I to give this to someone poorer than myself O Messenger of Allaah? By Allaah there is no family poorer than mine between the two lava plains of Madeenah?” At this, the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) laughed to the point that his molar teeth became visible. This was because this man had come in fear, saying: “I am ruined” but yet he left successful. So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) then said: “Feed your family with it.” So the man left peaceful, prosperous</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and joyful with this religion of Islaam and with this ease from the first Caller to this religion of Islaam, may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him. [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth Example:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Let us now look at how the Prophet dealt with one who had committed a sin. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) once saw a man that had a gold ring on his finger. So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) seized the ring from him with his noble hand and threw it on the ground. And he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Would any of you intentionally tale a coal of fire and place it on his hand?” So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) did not treat him the way he treated the people in the first examples. Rather, he snatched it from his hand and threw it at the floor. So when the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) left, it was said to the man: “Take your ring and benefit from it (i.e. by selling it).” The man said: “By Allaah, I will never take a ring that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) threw away.” [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaahu Akbar! This was the magnificent way the Companions would execute the Commandments of Allaah and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So what is important is that the Caller to Allaah must invite with wisdom, because the one who is ignorant is not like the one who has knowledge. And the one who rejects is not like the one who readily accepts. So for every place there is a saying and for every position there is a condition.</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing we must understand is that defaming these chosen and unique individuals is equal to defaming the Religion itself, since it was none other than them who passed the Religion down to those who came after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we already mentioned the words of Abu Zur&#8217;ah, in which he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The only ones who brought this Qur&#8217;aan and Sunan (plural of Sunnah) to us are the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. (So) they only wish to disparage and demolish our witnesses so that they can nullify the Book and the Sunnah, whereas they are more deserving of being disparaged for they are the heretics (zanaadiqah).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This refers to those who seek to belittle any of the Companions. It implies that the one who defames them does not harm them in the least but rather he only benefits them, based on afore-mentioned hadeeth of the &#8220;<strong>bankrupt person</strong>.&#8221; The one who defames them only causes harm to himself. So whoever finds in his heart love for them and a lack of hatred for them, and withholds his tongue from mentioning anything but good about them, then he should praise Allaah for this blessing. And He should ask Allaah to keep him firm upon this guidance. And whoever holds any hatred for them in his heart and his tongue is loose in mentioning them with that which does not befit them, then he must fear Allaah and desist from these crimes. And he must repent to Allaah while the door of repentance remains open in front of him, before he regrets it at a time when regrets will be of no benefit.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Lord do not cause our hearts to go astray after having guided us and grant us mercy from Yourself, indeed You are the One who grants all requests.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Faith. And put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord, You are indeed full of kindness, most Merciful.&#8221;</strong></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is a unanimous agreement amongst Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah that it is an obligation to stick to the <strong>Jamaa&#8217;ah </strong>[1] and that it is forbidden to break away from it, and that sticking to it is a virtue while separating oneself away from it is a vice.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Many evidences from the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, reaching the level of tawaatur, have been reported concerning this, and likewise there are many narrations from the Salaf with this regard. Allaah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;And hold onto the Rope of Allaah, all of you together, and be not divided&#8230;&#8221;</b></span> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 103]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abee Haatim [2] said: &#8220;My father narrated to me saying: &#8216;Amr Ibn &#8216;Alee As-Sairafee informed me, saying: &#8216;Abdu Rabbihi Ibn Baariq Al-Hanafee &#8211; and he praised him with good &#8211; narrated to me, saying: Simaak Ibn Al-Waleed Al-Hanafee narrated to me that he met Ibn &#8216;Abbaas in Madeenah and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;What do you say about a ruler who governs us, yet oppresses and abuses us, shall we not prevent him?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: &#8216;No, obey him, O Hanafee.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: &#8216;O Hanafee, the Jamaa&#8217;ah, the Jamaa&#8217;ah! Indeed, the nations that came before you were only destroyed because of their splitting up. Did you not hear Allaah say: <b>&#8216;And hold onto the Rope of Allaah, all of you together, and be not divided&#8230;'&#8221;</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Atiyyah said in his Tafseer:[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The expressions of the scholars of Tafseer have varied with regard to the meaning of this (part of the) ayah <b>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah.&#8217;</b> So Ibn Mas&#8217;ood said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;"><strong>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah is the Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8217; </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas Ibn Maalik narrated that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;Indeed, the tribe of Israa&#8217;eel split up into seventy-one sects. And my ummah (nation) will split up into seventy-two sects &#8211; all of them will be in the Hellfire except one.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it was said to him: &#8216;O Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم), which is this (saved) one?&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) clenched his fist and said: <b>&#8216;The Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he recited the ayah: <b>&#8216;And hold onto the Rope of Allaah, all of you together.&#8217;</b>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ood said in one of his khutbahs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;All of you together, adhere to obedience (of Allaah) and the Jamaa&#8217;ah, for indeed it is the Rope of Allaah that He has commanded us with.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qataadah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah that He commanded us to hold onto is the Qur&#8217;aan.&#8217;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Suddee said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8216;The Rope of Allaah refers to the Book of Allaah.&#8217;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ood and Ad-Dahhaak also said this. And other things have been said, all of which are similar to what has been mentioned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word <b><i>jamee&#8217;an</i></b> (all of you together) is connected to the command &#8216;Itasimoo (Hold onto), so the meaning becomes: <b>&#8216;Be united upon your mutual holding of it (the Rope of Allaah).&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;And be not divided&#8217;</b> refers to the kind of division that leads to not uniting for Jihaad and for protecting the Religion and the Word of Allaah. This is the dividing that comes from tribulations (fitan) and dividing in matters of Creed.&#8221; [End of Ibn &#8216;Atiyyah&#8217;s words, rahimahullaah]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say that their differing on the tafseer of the part of the verse: <b>&#8220;Rope of Allaah&#8221;</b> is a differing indicating variety in meaning, not a contradiction in meaning, as has been indicated here by Ibn &#8216;Atiyyah, Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Barr and other muhaqqiqeen. And his interpreting it to be the Book of Allaah combines all of the mentioned statements (of the Salaf). [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qurtubee mentioned in his Tafseer[6] the opinion of those who say that the <b>&#8220;Rope of Allaah&#8221;</b> means the Qur&#8217;aan and the opinion of those who say it means the Jamaa&#8217;ah. Then he said: &#8220;The intended meanings are all close and similar for indeed Allaah commands unity and forbids division. This is since division is destruction while the Jamaa&#8217;ah is salvation.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The <b>&#8216;Rope of Allaah&#8217;</b> has been interpreted as Allaah&#8217;s Book (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan), His Religion, Islaam, Sincerity, His Command, His covenant, Obedience to Him and as the Jamaa&#8217;ah. All of these sayings have been stated by the Companions and those who followed them in goodness until the Day of Judgement. And all of it is correct, for the Qur&#8217;aan commands towards the Religion of Islaam &#8211; and this is Allaah&#8217;s Command, His covenant and obedience to Him. And adhering to it <i>jamee&#8217;an</i> (in a unified group) can only be done with the Jamaa&#8217;ah. And the Religion of Islaam in reality is Sincerity to Allaah.&#8221; [7]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By this, it is understood that their sayings (i.e. of the Salaf) in their interpretation of <b>&#8220;The Rope of Allaah&#8221;</b> are not contradictory of one another but rather each saying compliments the other such that Allaah&#8217;s intended meaning becomes clear.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Jareer At-Tabaree reported in his Tafseer [8] that Qataadah said concerning the ayah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;And do not be divided &#8211; and remember Allaah&#8217;s blessing on you.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Verily, Allaah hates that you be divided &#8211; and He forbade you from it. And He loves that you hear and obey and (stick to) the Jamaa&#8217;ah. So love for yourselves what Allaah loves for you &#8211; if you are able. And there is no might except by (the leave of) Allaah.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">Allaah (subhanaha wa ta&#8217;aala) said: </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext" style="color:#008000;"><span class="bodytext"><b>&#8220;Those who were given the Scriptures did not differ except out of mutual jealousy and hatred (bagyan) after knowledge had come to them.&#8221; </b></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">Informing that their differing arose after the coming of knowledge that made clear to them as to what they should steer clear of &#8211; for indeed Allaah does not let a people become misguided after He guided them except after telling them what they should steer clear of. And informing that they differed only due to the reason of <strong>mutual jealousy and hatred</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Bagy</strong></span> means to exceed the proper bounds as was indicated by Ibn Umar (in his commentary to the verse): &#8216;arrogance and jealousy&#8217; &#8211; this arising due to differing ijtihaads that were not based upon knowledge. What is not meant by al-Bagy is the permissible difference that arises between the scholars for al-Bagy is either the neglect or omission of the truth, or exceeding the proper bounds. <strong><span style="color:#808000;">Exceeding the proper bounds either by leaving an obligatory action or by performing a forbidden action and it is known that splitting and disunity is the outcome of this</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this lies in what He said about the People of the Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">And from those who call themselves Christians, We took their covenant but they abandoned (or forgot) a portion of the Message that was sent to them. So we planted enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection</span>.&#8221;</b> (5:14)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>So He informed us that in their forgetting/abandoning a portion of the Message &#8211; meaning leaving a portion of that which they were commanded with &#8211; lay the reason for their enmity and hatred.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is occurring amongst the adherents of our religion and it can be found amongst the various parties that differ with regards to their principles and many subsidiary matters &#8211; found amongst the scholars and the worshippers &#8211; to the point that one finds a resemblance to the two nations about whom one says about the other: <b>&#8216;They are upon nothing.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is like what we find amongst the legal jurists who stick to the outward actions of the religion, and those that take to the path of tasawwuf  who stick to the inward actions of the religion for each one of these negates the path of the other and claims that they are not from the People of the Religion, or they oppose the other in a way of opposing of those who do not consider the other to be part of the religion. There occurs between them enmity and hatred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because Allaah has ordered that the heart be purified just as He has ordered that the body be purified. Both these aspects of purification are from the religion that Allaah has commanded and made obligatory. Allaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Allaah does not want to place you in difficulty, but He wants to purify you and to complete His Favour on you that you may be thankful.&#8221;</b></span> (5:6 &#8211; the verse pertaining to wudu)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;In it (the mosque) are men who love to purify themselves and Allah loves those who purify themselves.&#8221;</b></span> (9:108)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Indeed Allaah Loves those who turn to Him in repentance and He loves those who purify themselves.&#8221;</b> </span>(2:222)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Take charity from their wealth in order to purify and sanctify them.&#8221;</b></span> (9:103)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;They are the ones whose hearts Allaah does not wish to purify.&#8221;</b></span> (5:41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Indeed the polytheists are impure and filthy&#8221;</b> </span>(9:28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we find that the concern of many of the legal jurists and the worshipper is only the purification of the body, and he goes beyond the requirement of the sharee&#8217;ah with respect to his concern and action. And he leaves what he has been commanded and recommended with respect to the purification of the heart, and he does not understand purification except in this bodily aspect. And we find that the concern of many of the sufis is the purification of the heart only, to the extent that he will go beyond the requirement of the Sharee&#8217;ah with respect to his concern and action. And he leaves what he has been commanded and recommended with respect to the purification of the body.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the first group go to the extreme of wasting water and considering to be impure that which is not impure, and staying away from that which has not been legislated to stay away from, this despite their hearts containing different shades of jealousy, arrogance and hatred towards their brothers. In this there is a clear resemblance to the Jews.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other group goes to the extreme of negligence, they go to great extents to safeguard the heart to the point that they consider ignorance of that which is obligatory to know &#8211; such as the evil from which it is obligatory to steer clear of &#8211; from those things that safeguard the heart (from actually desiring that evil). In this they do not differentiate between safeguarding the heart from desiring evil, and safeguarding the heart through its knowing the evil and its knowing that with which it has been commanded. Then alongside this negligence and ignorance they do not preserve themselves from the impure things and therefore establish the obligatory purification in the way of the Christians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So enmity has occurred between these two groups due to their leaving a portion of what they have been commanded with, and due to their <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>bagy</strong> </span>&#8211; which is to exceed the correct bounds, either by ignoring or omitting the truth, or by enmity and oppression. Bagy sometimes occurs amongst some people, or sometimes with regards to the rights of Allaah &#8211; both of these are implied. This is why He said: <b>&#8220;out of mutual jealousy and hatred&#8221;</b> for each group was displaying bagy to the other by not acknowledging the others right and not refraining from showing enmity to the other. Allaah said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Nor were the People of the Book divided until the clear proof came to them.&#8221;</b></span> (98:4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Mankind was one nation and Allaah sent Messengers as bringers of glad-tidings and warners. And He revealed with them the Book in truth so that they may judge amongst mankind in that which they differed. And only those to whom it was given differed concerning it after clear proofs came to them through hatred, one to another.&#8221;</b></span> (2:213)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;Indeed those who divide their religion into sects, you have no concern in them in the least.&#8221;</b></span> (6:159)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;(Always) turning in repentance to Him, and be afraid an dutiful to Him: and establish the prayers and do not be of the polytheists &#8211; of those who split up their religion and became sects, each sect rejoicing in that which is with it.&#8221;</b></span> (30:31-32)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because each party of the polytheists used to worship whatsoever god their desires dictated as Allaah said: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;What you call the polytheists to is hard upon them.&#8221;</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;O Messengers! Eat of the goodly things and do righteous deeds. Indeed I am Well-Acquainted with what you do. And Verily! This, your religion, is one religion and I am your Lord, so keep your duty to Me. But they have broken their religion into sects, each group rejoicing in what it has.&#8221;</b></span> (23:51-52)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it becomes clear <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the way of unity is by means of gathering all of the religion, and acting upon it in its entirety &#8211;</strong></span> that is worshipping Allaah Alone without any partners as He ordered, inwardly and outwardly.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The way to disunity is by leaving a portion of that which the servant has been commanded with, and by al-bagy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The result of unity is:</strong> the Mercy and Pleasure of Allaah, His sending salaah upon the servants, and happiness in this world and in the hereafter, and white faces (on the Day of Judgement).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The result of disunity is:</strong> the Punishment of Allaah, His Curse, and black faces, and the Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) declaring himself free of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is one of the proofs that consensus is a definitive proof, for when they unite then they are all obeying Allaah in this and have Mercy showered on them. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And there cannot be obedience to Allaah and His Mercy by way of an action that He has not commanded, in either belief, saying or action</strong></span>. For if there were to be a saying or action upon which they agreed that had not been commanded by Allaah, then this would not be obedience to Allaah and neither would it be a means of His Mercy. Abu Bakr al-Azeez depended upon this proof in the beginning of his &#8216;at-Tanbeeh.&#8217;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>A Clarification of the Death of Shaikh Muqbil Ibn Haadee Al-Waadi’ee</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah and may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on the one who was sent as a mercy and guidance, and on his Companions and family. To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: <b>“<span style="color:#008000;">Every soul shall taste death</span>.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: <b>“<span style="color:#008000;">Every one on it (the earth) will perish, and the Face of your Lord will remain, possessing glory and honor</span>.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this, we console ourselves and all the Muslims, in general, and Ahl-us-Sunnah in particular, upon news of the death of the Supporter of the Sunnah and the Subduer of Innovations and Partisanship, the Muhaddith of the world during his time, the Shaikh, the ‘Allaamah, Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Muqbil Ibn Haadee Ibn Muqbil Al-Waadi’ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His death occurred while he was in the city of <strong>Jeddah</strong> at 8:30 pm on Sunday night, the 2nd of Jumaadaa Al-Oolaa <strong>1422H</strong>. He was close to <strong>seventy years</strong> of age at the time of his death, which came as a result of a liver disease that he was suffering from for more than seven years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Janaazah (funeral) prayer was held in <strong>Masjid Al-Haraam</strong> after the Fajr Prayer on Sunday (morning), and he was buried in the <strong>Al-‘Adl graveyard in Makkah</strong> next to the two noble shaikhs, ‘Abdul-‘Azeez Ibn Baaz and Muhamamd Ibn Saalih Al-‘Uthaimeen, may Allaah have mercy on all of them. This was in accordance with his final request, which he made while on his sickbed in Germany.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we ask Allaah to forgive him and to raise his status to the level of those who guide. Indeed to Allaah we belong and indeed to Him we will return. And there is no might nor power except by the Will of Allaah, the Most High, Most Great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah gave him the joy and satisfaction during his life of seeing the effects of his da’wah (call), which were witnessed and felt. But the enemies of the da’wah should not feel happy at news of his death, for he has left behind for them that which will grieve and displease them, such as his scholarly students, his precious books, his widely distributed tapes and his pure methodology, which had no obscurities in it. So he enjoyed the bounties that Allaah bestowed on him. Likewise, he established the foundation for the lofty palace and strong fortress of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we hope from Allaah that He cause his reward to remain continuous as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>“Whoever calls towards an act of guidance, he will have the same reward as those who follow him (in that act of guidance), and that will not detract anything from their good deeds.”</b></span> Reported in Saheeh Muslim from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurairah (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: The Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <span style="color:#008000;"><b>“When the Son of Aadam dies, his good deeds come to an end except three: a continuously recurring charity, knowledge from which benefit is derived, and a righteous child that supplicates for him.”</b> </span>Reported by Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, spent his whole life in <strong>(seeking) knowledge, teaching, writing and calling to Allaah</strong>. This is such that the flatlands and the mountain areas became filled with his students, his books and his tapes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even in his last days, he still was still being asked religious questions on Hadeeth, Fiqh, Shawaahid and ‘Iraab. He was stricken with unconsciousness and then when he recovered and awoke, he was asked questions. From his last words were those that he uttered when he phoned us during his sickness while in Germany. And we asked about the hadeeth of Anas (radhi Allaahu anhu): <b>“O Hayy (Living), O Qayyoom (Eternal), By your mercy we ask for your help.”</b> – “Did you mention it in (your book) As-Saheeh Al-Musnad with this wording?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At this point we cannot forget to give the good tidings to all of our Muslim brothers that this educational center (in Dammaaj) will continue, <i>inshAllaah</i>, as it was during the life of our Shaikh, may Allaah have mercy on him. So the classes are active and continuing and the affairs are going according to the plans of our Shaikh, by Allaah’s granting that for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh had some final requests for his students, loved ones and brothers from Ahl-us-Sunnah in his handwriting, which will be distributed in these blessed pages, by Allaah’s permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is so that our brothers across the various Islaamic lands and those who constantly ask about the future of this center can be at rest and tranquility. So we say: Be calm for the matters are going according to the best way, and the da’wah is preserved from our Lord. So pay no mind to those who spread false rumors and reports. And Allaah is sufficient for us and He is the best of guardians.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">This was a three part question asked over Paltalk. The first two questions were about du&#8217;aa and and so they were left out and consequently the tape recording was edited and abridged to pertinent part only. The recording is not clear in some parts, which we have highlighted in the text with [&#8230;].</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Question:</b> The youth would like your advice O Shaikh, on what our obligation is with regard to what is occurring currently in Palestine. May Allaah reward you! As-Salaam ‘Alaikum wa Rahmatullaahi wa Barakaatuh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Answer:</b> Wa ‘Alaika as-Salaam wa Rahmatullaahi wa Barakaatuh…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for your third question, which is on directing the youth, or advising the youth concerning what is occurring in Palestine, then (we say that) Allaah knows that our hearts have become broken (over the current situation). However, we do not let our passions overtake us, rather we let the Sunnah direct us. And the Sunnah in this regard is to return the matter to those people who are capable of producing solutions and conclusions (<i>Ahlul Halli wal-‘Aqd</i>) – the leaders and rulers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible for every Tom, Dick and Harry to speak his mind, because this falls into provoking and instigating turmoil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Firstly, I will mention the legislated principle that has been stated in the Noble Qur’aan, which is: <b>“And when a matter concerning (public) fear or security comes to them, they spread it (out to the people). But if they had only returned it back to the Messenger and to those in authority among them, those who derive (the correct understanding) among them would have made (the matter) known (upon its correct understanding).”</b> [Surah An-Nisaa: 83]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Secondly, I warn the Muslim youth, specifically, and all the Muslims, generally, to not oppose this principle by instead accepting the call of these foolish speakers, who send messages asking for certain things which they have no right over, such as boycotting the purchase of American products, for example. Or they send letters over the commercial lines or by fax saying: “Give your support, Give your support!”…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these people are assuming a responsibility that they have no authority over. And furthermore, we, all praise be to Allaah, in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and in the Gulf states and other neighboring states, as well as the Arab lands, are being ruled by Muslims from among us. We do not claim that they are infallible or that they are free from error. However, they are Muslims and there are scholars around them. And they have advisors from the scholars, judges, ministers, and those who have experience in law and politics.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is not permissible to follow other than them, the command is solely for them…</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I advise you to seek refuge in Allaah, by making supplication (for them) – that He alleviate their suffering and relieve them from their distress. And ask that He solve their dilemma and grant them victory over the Jews in the state of the Tribe of Isra’eel, as well as those who join sides with them, from the disbelievers and polytheists. This is the advice in brief and Allaah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext">l praise is for Allaah with much praises and blessings, as our Lord loves and is pleased with and as is required for attaining the honor of His most Sublime Face.[1] And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be upon our teacher Muhammad, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, his family and his companions.</span>Imaam Muslim reported in his Saheeh from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said:<b>“Islaam began as something strange and it will return to being strange as it began. So Toobaa [2] is for the strangers.”</b> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad and Ibn Maajah have also reported this hadeeth on the authority of Ibn Mas’ood, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, with the addition at the end of it:<b>“It was said: ‘O Messenger of Allaah, and who are the strangers?’</b> He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>‘The Nuzaa’ (those who extract themselves) from their families and close relatives.’</b>” [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr Al-Aajuree also transmitted it and in his report there occurs: <b>&#8220;It was said: ‘Who are they, O Messenger of Allaah?’</b> He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>‘Those who rectify (themselves/others) when the people have become corrupt.’”</b> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others have transmitted it with the following words, in which he, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;They are those who flee from trials (fitan) for the sake of their Religion.&#8221;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At-Tirmidhee reported it from the hadeeth of Katheer Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Al-Maznee on the authority of his father who reported from his grandfather that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;Verily, this Religion began as something strange. And it will go back to being something strange. So Toobaa is for the strangers – those who rectify what the people have corrupted after me of my Sunnah.&#8221;</b> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has also been transmitted by At-Tabaraanee from the hadeeth of Jaabir, radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa, on the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>. And in the hadeeth there occurs:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8220;It was said: &#8216;And who are they, O Messenger of Allaah?&#8217; He said: &#8216;They are those who rectify and make corrections when the people have become corrupted.&#8221;</b> [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (At-Tabaraanee) also reported it from the hadeeth of Sahl Ibn Sa&#8217;ad, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, with a similar wording.[8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ahmad also transmitted it from the hadeeth of Sa’ad Ibn Abee Waqqaas, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>, on the authority of the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>. And it is stated in the hadeeth: <b>“So Toobaa on that day will be for the strangers – when the people have become corrupt.”</b> [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration transmitted by Imaam Ahmad and At-Tabaraanee from the hadeeth of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Amr, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>, the Prophet,<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>“Toobaa is for the strangers.”</b> It was said: “And who are the strangers? He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said:<b>“A righteous people surrounded by people abounding in much evil. Those who disobey them are more numerous than those who obey them.”</b> [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it has been reported on ‘Abdullaah Ibn ‘Amr, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa</i>, in marfoo’ and mawqoof [11] form in this hadeeth, that: “It was said: ‘Who are the strangers?’ He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>‘They are the ones who flee for the sake of their Religion. Allaah, may He be Exalted, will send them with ‘Eesaa Bin Maryam’”</b> [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning his, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, statement: <b>“Islaam began as something strange”</b>, then it is referring to the people before his advent, who were upon widespread deviance. This is as the Prophet, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said: <b>“Indeed Allaah looked at the people of the earth and hated them, both Arabs and non-Arabs, except for some remnants that were from the People of the Book.”</b> [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the Prophet was sent forth and began calling towards Islaam, his call was not answered at first instance except by a few from each tribe. And those that did accept his call feared from their tribes and families lest they should be subjected to extreme punishment. And they would suffer while being patient with that for sake of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to their weakness, the (first) Muslims would be frightened by every opposing force and they would flee for the sake of their Religion to far-off lands as was shown when they migrated twice &#8211; to the land of Abysinnia, and then when they migrated to Madeenah. And there was from among them, he who was tortured for the sake of Allaah and he who was killed. <b>So those who entered into the fold of Islaam, back in those days – they were the strangers.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Islaam spread after the Hijrah to Madeenah and its followers became victorious over every group. After that, the people entered into the Religion of Allaah in multitudes. And Allaah perfected the Religion for them and completed His favor upon them. Then the Messenger of Allaah died, and the Muslims were upon the utmost level due to their firm adherence to their Religion. They were powerful and dominant. And they continued to be upon this condition during the times of Abu Bakr and ‘Umar (during their Khilaafah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaytaan (Devil) unleashed his evil plot upon the Muslims and discord fell between them. And the trials of <b>Doubts</b> (<i>Ash-Shubuhaat</i>) and<b>Desires</b> (<i>Ash-Shahawaat</i>) became widespread. These two evils did not stop increasing at all until the plan of Shaytaan was established and the majority of the creation obeyed him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So from among them were those who entered into obedience to him by way of the evil of Doubts (<i>Ash-Shubuhaat</i>). And from among them, were those who fell into the evil of Desires (<i>Ash-Shahawaat</i>). And from among them, were those who combined between them both. All of that was from what the Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, had warned us would occur.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>As for the evil of Doubts:</b><br />
Then it has been reported on the Prophet through many paths of narration that his ummah would divide into more than seventy sects. This is based on the differing found in the reports concerning the exact number with which they will exceed the number seventy. And it is reported on him, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, that all of these groups will be in the Hellfire, except for one group – and it is that (group) which adheres to what he and his companions were upon (during their time). [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>And as for the evil of Desires:</b><br />
It is reported in Saheeh Muslim on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Amr, radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa, that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said:<b>“When the treasures of the Persians and the Romans are opened for you, how will your people be?”</b> ‘Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn ‘Awf,<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, said: “We will say what Allaah has ordered us (to say).”[15] He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>“Or other than that. You will compete against each other, then you will envy one another, then you will turn your backs on one another.”</b> [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree on the authority of &#8216;Amr Ibn &#8216;Awf, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, the Prophet, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, said: <b>“I swear by Allaah! It is not poverty that I fear for you. Rather, what I fear the most for you is that the pleasures of this world will be presented to you as they were presented to those before you. And you will compete against each other for it, as they competed against each other. And it will destroy you, just as it destroyed them.”</b> [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in the two Saheeh collections on the authority of &#8216;Uqbah Ibn &#8216;Aamir, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>, a hadeeth from the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, with a similar meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when the treasures of Kissra (Chosroes) were opened for ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab, he began to weep and said: <b>“Indeed this (treasure) did not open upon a people ever, except that Allaah placed discord between them.”</b> [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet used to fear these two evils (of Doubts and Desires) for his ummah as has been reported in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad on the authority of Abu Barzah that the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>“Indeed, I only fear for you the desires of transgression found in your stomachs and your private parts and the calamities (fitan) that lead people astray.&#8221;</b> And in another narration there occurs: <b>&#8220;&#8230;and the desires (hawaa) that lead people astray.&#8221;</b> [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when a majority of the people fell victim to either or both of these evils, they began to cut off ties with one another and they began to hate one another. This only came after them having been brothers, loving and supporting one another. Indeed the evil of <b>Desires</b> became something common and accepted amongst a majority of the creatures. And it tested people by way of the worldly life and its pleasures. So that became the goal of the people’s striving. They sought after it and became pleased with it. They became angry due to it and they hated for its sake and loved for its sake. Because of this, they would sever family relations and spill blood unlawfully. And for this purpose, they committed disobedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the evil of <b>Doubts</b> and vain desires that lead astray, then it was because of this that the Muslims divided and became sects, some groups declaring others as disbelievers. Thus, they became enemies, divided into groups and parties. This only happened after having been brothers. Their hearts were united upon the heart of one man. So not one of all these sects is saved, except for the one saved sect (<i>Al-Firqat-un-Naajiyah</i>). And they are the ones mentioned in the saying of the Prophet, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>“There will not cease to be a group from my ummah triumphant upon the truth. Those who oppose them will not be able to harm them, nor will those who abandon them, until Allaah’s order comes about (Day of Judgment) and they are in that state.”</b>[20]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They will be the strangers – the ones who have been mentioned in the previous ahaadeeth – during the Last Days. They are the ones who will correct others when the people have become corrupt. They are those who will rectify what the people have corrupted of the Sunnah. They are the ones who will flee from affliction for the sake of their Religion. They are the ones who will extract themselves from their close relatives (for Allaah’s sake).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is because they are so few that you will not find any among them in an entire tribe (family), except one or two. In some tribes, you will not find any of them, just as it was when the first people entered into Islaam. This is the way the majority of the scholars have explained this hadeeth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="Footnotes">[1] What is meant here is the attainment of Paradise in which the people who are granted it will be able to see the Face of Allaah, as has been stated in various texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] It is said that Toobaa means something good. Allaah mentions this word in Surat-ur-Ra’ad of His Final Revelation: <b>“Those who believe and do righteous deeds, Toobaa is for them and a pleasant destination.”</b> According to Ibn Katheer’s Tafseer (Abridged 1/281), Ibraaheem An-Nakha’ee (rahimahullaah), the great Taabi’ee, said it means “good is for them.” Qataadah said: “When a man says Toobaa for you it means you have attained something good. ‘Ikrimah and Mujaahid said that Toobaa means Paradise. And it is also said that Toobaa refers to a tree in Paradise which the Prophet, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, spoke of when he said: <b>“Verily, there is a tree in Paradise under the shadow of which a rider can travel for a hundred years without being able to cover (it’s distance) completely.”</b> [Saheeh Muslim] This is what seems to be indicated in the above hadeeth, due to another hadeeth reported on the Prophet, in which he said: <b>“Toobaa is a tree in Paradise. Its (shade’s) distance (in traveling) is one hundred years. And the garments of the inhabitants of Paradise will be extracted from its branches.”</b> Imaam Al-Albaanee graded it hasan in his Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah (no. 1985).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Saheeh Muslim (1/130): See Sharh Saheeh Muslim of Imaam An-Nawawee (2/175-176)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 3988), Sunan At-Tirmidhee (5/18) and he said it was authentic, Musnad Ahmad (5/296). It has also been recorded by Al-Khattaabee in his <i>Ghareeb-ul-Hadeeth</i> (1/175). Shaikh Al-Albaanee declared it weak (<i>da&#8217;eef</i>) in his collection <i>Al-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah</i> (no. 1273)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[5] This hadeeth is also reported by Ahmad and At-Tabaraanee and it is saheeh as has been stated by Shaikh Saleem Al-Hilaalee in his book <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 1). However the hadeeth with a different wording from the hadeeth of &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn Sanah is weak. See <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[6] This hadeeth was reported by At-Tirmidhee in his Sunan (5/18) and he said it was saheeh. It was also reported by Ibn &#8216;Adiyy in <i>Al-Kaamil</i> (6/2080), At-Tabaraanee in <i>Al-Kabeer</i>(17/16), Abu Nu&#8217;aim in <i>Al-Hilyah</i> (2/10) and Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee in Al-Jaami&#8217; (1/112) as well as others. In his checking to the book <i>Al-&#8216;Itisaam</i> of Imaam Ash-Shaatibee (1/22), Shaikh Saleem Al-Hilaalee said concerning At-Tirmidhee&#8217;s authentication of this hadeeth: &#8220;This is from the hadeeth that he, may Allaah have mercy on him, has overlooked. For indeed, Katheer (Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah) is very weak. Rather, Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee accused him of being a liar! And he described him with that (lying) as being one of his main supports, as occurs in<i>Manaaqib-ush-Shaafi&#8217;ee</i> of Al-Bayhaqee (1/547-548). This is a criticism (<i>jarh</i>) that reaches the highest level of severity. Thus his hadeeth are to be disregarded completely.&#8221; Therefore, the hadeeth is da&#8217;eef jiddan (very weak) as is stated in <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 13) and <i>Da’eef Al-Jaami’-us-Sagheer</i> (no. 1441)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[7] This hadeeth has been reported by At-Tahaawee in <i>Mushkil-ul-Aathaar</i> (1/298), Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee in Sharh Usool &#8216;Itiqaad Ahl-is-Sunnah (2/112), and Al-Bayhaqee in <i>Az-Zuhd-ul-Kabeer</i> (200). Al-Haythamee attributed it to At-Tabaraanee in his book <i>Majma&#8217;-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id</i> (7/278), saying: &#8220;In its chain is &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Saalih, the scribe of Laith, and he is weak. However, he has been declared reliable.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] At-Tabaraanee reported this hadeeth in his <i>Kabeer</i> (6/164) and his <i>Sagheer</i> (1/104). Al-Haythamee said in <i>Majma’-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id</i> (7/278): &#8220;Its narrators are all of the standards of the Saheeh (collections), except Bakr Ibn Saleem, for he is reliable. Saleem Al-Hilaalee said in his checking of <i>Al-&#8216;Itisaam</i> (1/18): &#8220;Bakr Ibn Saleem is weak. However, he is used as a support during cases when hadeeth need to be backed up and supported. Al-Haafidh (Ibn Hajr) said in <i>At-Taqreeb</i>: &#8216;He is acceptable&#8217; meaning when a hadeeth needs to be supported. And if this is not the case, then he is layyin.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] This hadeeth is recorded by Imaam Ahmad, Al-Bazaar and Abu Ya’laa. Al-Haythamee said in <i>Majma’-uz-Zawaa’id</i> (7/277): &#8220;Its narrators are the narrators of the standard of the Saheeh (collections).&#8221; Saleem Al-Hilaalee declared it saheeh in his <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Al-Haythamee (rahimahullaah) said in Majma’-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id (7/278): &#8220;In its chain is Ibn Lahee&#8217;ah and there is weakness in him.&#8221; The hadeeth can be found in the Musnad of Imaam Ahmad (2/177). It is authentic due to its many paths of narration. Imaam Al-Albaanee authenticated it in Saheeh Al-Jaami&#8217;-us-Sagheer (no. 3291)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] A marfoo&#8217; hadeeth is a statement that has been reported by a companion, yet &#8220;raised&#8221; to the level of being a saying of the Prophet. A mawqoof hadeeth is a statement that is reported by a companion and &#8220;stopped&#8221;, meaning it ends up being only his statement, as opposed to being raised to a saying of the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] This hadeeth has been narrated by Imaam Ahmad in mawqoof form, and by his son ‘Abdullaah in marfoo’ form. It can be found in <i>Az-Zuhd</i> (77149). The hadeeth is <i>da&#8217;eef</i> as has been clarified by Shaikh Saleem Al-Hilaalee in his book <i>Toobaa Lil-Ghurabaa</i> (no. 3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Saheeh Muslim (Eng.): vol. 4, no. 6853. What is meant by the remnants of the People of the Book are those who stuck to their religion upon truth without changing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] This hadeeth has been reported from a number of different routes. Perhaps the one most similar to what the Shaikh (Ibn Rajab) is paraphrasing here is that which has been reported by At-Tabaraanee in his <i>Mu&#8217;jam-us-Sagheer</i> (no. 724), in which the Prophet said: <b>&#8220;This ummah will split into seventy-three sects, all of which will be in the Hellfire, except for one.&#8221;</b> They asked: <b>&#8220;And which is that sect?&#8221;</b> He, <i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;(The ones that adhere to) That which I and my Companions are upon today.&#8221;</b> In another narration on the authority of Anas Ibn Maalik, radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa, the Prophet,<i> sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>, said: <b>&#8220;Every one of them will be in the Hellfire, except one and it is the Jamaa&#8217;ah.&#8221;</b> And in another narration on the authority of Abu Sufyaan, <i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>: <b>&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah, sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam, stood amongst us one day and said: &#8216;Indeed those before you from the People of the Book divided into seventy-two groups. And, indeed, this group (Muslims) will divide into seventy-three. Seventy-two groups will be in the Fire and one of them will be in Paradise. And it is the Jamaa&#8217;ah.’&#8221; </b>This latter hadeeth was reported by Ahmad, Al-Haakim, Abu Dawood and others. Al-Haakim authenticated it and Adh-Dhahabee agreed. At-Tirmidhee (no. 2641) also reported a similar hadeeth to it and graded it saheeh. Imaam Al-Albaanee listed all its paths of narrations and different wordings in his <i>Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah</i> (no. 204) and clarified that it is an authentic hadeeth without any doubt about its authenticity. In summary, the hadeeth and its additions are hasan due to its various paths of narrations, which serve as supporting evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] He means by this: We will praise Him, thank Him and ask Him for an increase in His Bounty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] Saheeh Muslim (no. 2962) and Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 3996)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree (Eng.): vol. 5, no. 351</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] Refer to <i>Al-Bidaayah-wan-Nihaayah</i> (7/70) of Ibn Katheer for an account of the event. It is recorded in his book under the section of the Battle of Jaloolaa&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] Imaam Ahmad (4/423) and others reported this hadeeth. Al-Manaawee said that it had a good chain in his book <i>Al-Jaami’-ul-Azhar</i> (1/146). Al-Albaanee graded it saheeh in his checking of <i>At-Targheeb wat-Tarheeb</i> (no. 49)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree (4/252), Saheeh Muslim (no. 170), Sunan At-Tirmidhee (4/504), and Sunan Ibn Maajah (no. 3952)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="dropcap">
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>From his book Al-Amr Bi-Luzoom Al-Jamaa&#8217;ah wa Imaamihim (pg. 114-117)</em></span><br />
<span style="color:#808080;"><em>Translator : isma&#8217;eel alarcon</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext">Allaah says: <b>&#8220;O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion. Verily, some (forms of) suspicion is sinful.&#8221; </b>[Surah Al-Hujuraat: 12]</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the two Saheeh collections (of Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim), Abu Hurairah (radhi Allaahu anhu) reported that Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) said: <b>&#8220;Beware of suspicion, for indeed suspicion is the most false type of speech.&#8221; </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, holding bad thoughts for the Muslim leaders in their administrative actions and the decisions that they make is truly a door to evil, which leads the one who engages in it to fall into matters forbidden in the Religion. And it&#8217;s harm can spread to the general masses of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when the door to holding bad thoughts about the actions enforced by the Muslim leaders is opened and each person begins to express his thoughts about these actions, the people fall into the suspicion that is condemned in the Religion. And each person is brought into the talk of that which doesn&#8217;t concern him and liking the he said/she said (gossip) which is forbidden in the Religion. And those who have no say in matters or bear any position of responsibility (with respect to leadership) will begin to voice themselves. All of this has a harmful effect upon the people collectively, for it is one of the ways of the Devil in causing catastrophes and warranting rebellion against the leaders.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever leads to an evil consequence must be prevented even if it is something that is allowed (<i>mubaah</i>). So how much more so when the thing that leads to it is forbidden (in itself) and when the thing being led to is the source of evil?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abdil-Lateef</strong> and <strong>Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Abdil-&#8216;Azeez Al-&#8216;Anqaree</strong> said in a letter written [1] by them to the people during the time of the fitnah of the Ikhwaan against the king &#8216;Abdul &#8216;Azeez, may Allaah have mercy on him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;From the things that the Devil causes to enter into some of the practicing Muslims is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Accusing the Muslim scholars of flattering and kissing up (to the leaders), suspicious thoughts (about them), and not taking (knowledge) from them. This is all a cause for one&#8217;s being prevented from beneficial knowledge.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another thing that the Devil puts into them is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Holding bad thoughts for the leader and failing to obey him. Indeed, this is from the greatest types of sins and it is from the ways of the people of Jaahiliyyah, those who did not hold hearing and obeying (the leader) as being part of the Religion. Rather, each of one of them followed his own opinion.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidences from the Book and the Sunnah clearly demonstrate the obligation of hearing and obeying the (Muslim) leader in times of hardship and times of ease and in things that one likes and things that one hates. This is such that he (saws) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;Hear and obey (the leader), even if he takes your money and whips your back.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is forbidden to disobey him and oppose him in his authority, in his relations, in his agreements and in his treaties, for he is a representative of the Muslims and looking out for what is in their best interests. And his looking out for them is better than their looking out for their own selves. This is since through his leadership, the order of the Religion remains established and the unity of the Muslims remains in tact.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is especially the case since Allaah has blessed you with a leader whose authority is that of religious authority. [2] And he has guided the masses of his subjects from the Muslims, especially the practicing ones amongst them, by being kind to them and building masaajid for them and sending out callers (du&#8217;aat) to them and overlooking their errors and acts of ignorance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this existing in the last portion of these times is from the greatest bounties that Allaah has bestowed to the people of this (Arab) peninsula.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is an obligation upon them to be thankful for this bounty and to consider it. And they should support him and be loyal to him inwardly and outwardly. So it is not permissible for anyone to betray him, nor to carry out some matter except with his permission.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whoever betrays him with treason then he has strove to sow the seeds of dissension amongst the Muslims against him, and he has split away from the Jamaa&#8217;ah (main body of Muslims). The Prophet (saws) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>&#8216;Whoever disobeys the Ameer (leader) has disobeyed me. And whoever disobeys me has disobeyed Allaah.&#8217;</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is intended by the word Ameer in this hadeeth is the person whom Allaah has given authority over the affairs of the Muslims, and he is the greater Imaam.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="bodytext"><span class="bodytext"><b>This is how the People of Desires, from the Hizbees and Qutubees show respect for the Scholars…rather this is how they show respect for the House of Allaah!</b></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh Saalih As-Suhaymee and Shaikh Abdur-Razaaq, may Allaah preserve them, undertook a visit to the area of Qaseem, particularly the city of Buraydah (in Saudi Arabia), some years ago to give a lectures there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But they were met by some people of desires – especially from the Qutubees and Hizbees in the audience who did not want to listen to the Remembrance of Allaah nor to the Call to Tawheed and the following of the correct Manhaj.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To hear what happened to the Shaikhs and how the ignorant people dealt with them, listen to the recording, and follow with the summarization below.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The program begins with the chair of the conference introducing the topic of the lecture, which was a talk on the hadeeth: <b>“The Religion is Sincerity.”</b> He began with the Shaikh on the right who was Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razaaq, the son of ‘Abdul-Muhsin al-‘Abbaad, may Allaah preserve them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Shaikh began with Khutbat ul-Haajah, but was not even halfway through it when commotion broke out at the hands of some deviants amongst the followers of vain desires, who started shouting and screaming. But this was quelled and the Shaikh continued by making du’aa that Allaah grant the Muslims Paradise and that He make them people who fear Allaah and act righteously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the commotion continued for a while, but finally the Shaikh began the lecture and the microphone was passed onto Shaikh Saalih As-Suhaymee who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“To whoever came to this masjid and saw fit to do these kinds of actions, which Allaah is not pleased with, will they not fear Allaah? Whoever wants to listen then let him come and whoever wants to leave then let him leave.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razaaq began the lecture and began explaining the hadeeth of <b>“The Religion is Sincerity (Naseeha).”</b> And he stressed the point that what they came to the masjid for was to seek to get closer to Allaah by way of listening and benefiting by the hadeeth of Allaah’s Messenger. And he narrated to them a story about Allaah’s Messenger and Mu’awiyah, which showed that gathering in the masjid is for the purpose of getting closer to Allaah. So this is what they were there for – to worship Allaah and not cause commotion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he began by saying what he will talk about in the lecture – the foundation of sincerity and faith in Allaah. So he discussed the definition of Eemaan and went on to mention the three categories of Tawheed, but noise could still be heard in the background from the troublemakers</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razaaq finished and the mic was given to Shaikh Saalih As-Suhaymee who addressed the troublemakers and asked them if Allaah was pleased with the actions they were doing, at which they again turned violent. And commotion broke loose again, with Shaikh Saalih commanding them to fear Allaah. And the situation got worse with the mob storming the podium and in the midst of all that the Shuyookh were making du’aa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the course of this violent attack, they trampled over the mushafs (copies of Qur’aan) and broke Shaikh Saalih As-Suhaymee’s walking cane, since he is blind and needs it to walk!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But Allaah protected the two Shaikhs from the evil of these people of desires and misguidance! And all of this was just because the Shaikhs stick to the truth and call to the Salafee Manhaj while opposing and refuting the deviants.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So we advise the brothers to listen to the recording so that they can see for themselves the condition of these people, who fight against the Salafee Scholars and hate the Salafee Da’wah, only because they have no other recourse since their da’wah is dead and they are void of any proofs and evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we cannot forget also what happened to Shaikh Muhammad Amaan Al-Jaamee, may Allaah have mercy on him, who was attacked while giving a lecture in the Masjid of Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Al-‘Ubaylaan years ago.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Access the recording and follow with brief summarization below:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">While the Shaikh was in the masjid answering questions, he responded to one question, which consisted of several parts. The first part asked as to the reason why the Muslims are divided into groups, parties and sects. So the Shaikh responded by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The reason is well known – it is something that is going on now, which is the presence of those who incite the people upon political agitation and the presence of those who distribute them into groups. Rather, it is due to these newly invented groups. The groups that are present in the arena nowadays, I consider them to be innovated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since before this state (of Saudi Arabia) was established, you did not find all of these groups – there was only One Group. The Saudi Society was only one Jamaa’ah (group) – the Jamaa’ah of the Muslims. There was no other group to be found besides it. <b>So the presence of all these groups (nowadays) and the efforts these groups expend in calling the people to their manhaj is the cause for them being divided and split up</b>…”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then one man from the audience began to criticize the Shaikh’s response about the jamaa’aat (groups) and commotion broke loose, with a mob shouting and screaming. And all the while the Shaikh was trying to calm the mob down, seeking refuge in Allaah, but they did not listen to him. Even to the point that the Call for Prayer was proclaimed and they did not listen to that! Rather, the prayer was started and commotion and screaming could still be heard from those who wished to cause fitnah and disrespect the house of Allaah, may Allaah guide these individuals.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of all of the scholars who have followed the Way of the Salaf, in that they were faced with the opposition of the deviants – even to the point where their opposition was violent, as was the case with Imaam Abu Shaamah, <i>rahimahullaah</i>, the great scholar of the 7th Century, who wrote a tremendous book [<b>Al-Bid’i wal-Hawaadith</b>] refuting the present day innovations of his time, as he was beaten to the point that he never fully recovered from his injuries and eventually died later from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to protect our scholars and to grant them a long lifespan for benefiting the ummah, Amaeen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">A <strong>Sahaabee</strong> (Companion) is anyone that met the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) while believing in him, and dying upon that condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Companions (<strong>Sahaabah</strong>) of the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) are the best from all those that accompanied the prophets, due to the statement of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam): “The best of people are my Companions.” [1] Al-Bukhaaree and others have reported this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best among the Sahaabah are the <strong>Muhaajiroon</strong> (those who performed the migration from Makkah to Madeenah), due to their combining between migrating and giving support (in Allaah&#8217;s Cause). Then after them, are the <strong>Ansaar</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best among the Muhaajiroon are the <strong>four righteous Khaleefahs</strong>: Abu Bakr, ‘Umar, ‘Uthmaan and ‘Alee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Abu Bakr</strong> &#8211; He is &#8220;<strong>As-Siddeeq</strong>&#8221; ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Aamir from the Tribe of Taym bin Marrah bin Ka’ab. He was the first male to believe in the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). He was his companion in the migration (Hijrah) and his deputy during times of prayer and Hajj. He was his Khaleefah (designated successor) for his nation. Five of those who were given the glad tidings of Paradise accepted Islaam through his hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are ‘Uthmaan, Az-Zubair, Talha, ‘Abd-ur-Rahmaan bin ‘Awf and Sa’ad bin Abee Waqqaas. He died in Jumaadal-Al-Akhirah, in the 13th year of Hijrah, when he was 63 years old. The above five along with Abu Bakr, ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib and Zayd bin Haarithah form the eight that were the first of people to accept Islaam. Ibn Ishaaq stated this and what he meant by it, was that they were the first from amongst the males, after (the advent of) the Message.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Umar</strong> &#8211; He is Abu Hafs &#8220;<strong>Al-Faarooq</strong>&#8221; ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab from the tribe of ‘Adiyy bin Ka’ab bin Lu’aa. He accepted Islaam in the sixth year after the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was sent, after nearly forty men and eleven women (had accepted Islaam). The Muslims were overjoyed by that occasion and Islaam spread in Makkah afterward. Abu Bakr entrusted him with the leadership of the Muslim nation, and so he rose to the hardship of the Khilaafah in the best manner. This was until he was killed and died as a martyr in Dhul-Hijjah of the year 23H, at the age of 63.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Uthmaan</strong> &#8211; He is Abu ‘Abdillaah &#8220;<strong>Dhun-Noorain</strong>&#8221; ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan from the tribe of Umayyah bin ‘Abd-ish-Shams bin ‘Abd Manaaf. He accepted Islaam after the Prophet’s entrance into Daar-ul-Arqam. He was a rich and generous man. He was given the Khilaafah after &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), due to the agreement of the members of the governing body. He remained Khaleefah until he was killed and martyred in Dhul-Hijjah in the year 35H. He was 90 years old at the time of his death, according to one of several opinions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘<strong>Alee</strong> &#8211; He is Abul-Hasan ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib. The name of Abu Taalib was ‘Abd Manaaf bin ‘Abd-il-Muttallib. He was the first from the youth to accept Islaam. The Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) gave him the banner on the Day of Khaibar and Allaah granted victory at his hands. He was given the Khilaafah after the murder of &#8216;Uthmaan. Thus, he became the Khaleefah, governing until he was killed himself, and martyred in the month of Ramadaan in the 40H, at the age of 63.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best of these four is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar, then ‘Uthmaan, then ‘Alee. This is based on the report of Ibn ‘Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu): “We used to make preference between the people during the time of the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam). So we preferred Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab, then ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan.” This was reported by Al-Bukhaaree.[2] It is also based on (the hadeeth) in Abu Dawood: “We used to say, while the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was alive: The best of the Prophet’s ummah after him, is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar, then ‘Uthmaan.” At-Tabaraanee added to this in his report: “The Prophet would hear that and he would not oppose it.” I did not find the wording that the author mentions, in which there is the addition of ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib. [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most deserving from them of the Khilaafah, after the Prophet, was Abu Bakr (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). This is since he was the best of them and foremost to them in accepting Islaam. Also, the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) preferred him to lead the prayer. Furthermore, the Sahaabah agreed upon his superiority and upon giving him the oath of allegiance (bay’ah). And it is not befitting for Allaah to unite them in agreement upon an error. Then ‘Umar, since he was the best of the Sahaabah after Abu Bakr and because Abu Bakr entrusted the Khilaafah to him. Then ‘Uthmaan, due to his merits and due to his election by the Majlis Ash-Shooraa (governing body). They are the ones mentioned in this verse from a poem:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“’Alee, &#8216;Uthmaan, Sa&#8217;ad and Talha.<br />
Zubair and Dhu &#8216;Awf &#8212; members of the governing body.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then comes &#8216;Alee, due to his merits and the consensus of the Muslims of his time upon it. These four are the rightly guided Khaleefahs, whom the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said concerning them: “Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Khaleefahs after me. Bite onto it (the Sunnah) with your molar teeth.” And he (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: “The Khilaafah after me will endure for thirty years.” Ahmad, Abu Dawood and At-Tirmidhee reported this hadeeth and Al-Albaanee said that its chain of narration was hasan. Thus, the last part of it, was the Khilaafah of &#8216;Alee. This is as the author has stated and it is as if he places the Khilaafah of Al-Hasan subordinate to his father&#8217;s or just doesn&#8217;t acknowledge it (i.e. Al-Hasan&#8217;s Khilaafah) at all, due to his yielding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khilaafah of Abu Bakr (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) endured for two years, three months and nine nights, from the 13th of Rabee&#8217;-ul-Awwal 11H to the 22nd of Jumaadal-Akhirah 13H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khilaafah of &#8216;Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) lasted ten years, six months and three days, from the 23rd of Jumaadal-Akhirah 13H to the 26th of Dhul-Hijjah 23H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khilaafah of &#8216;Uthmaan (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) lasted twelve years minus 12 days, from the month of Muharram 24H to the 18th of Dhul-Hijjah 35H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Khilaafah of &#8216;Alee (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) lasted four years and nine months from the 19th of Dhul-Hijjah 35H to the 19th of Ramadaan 40H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Combined, the Khilaafah of these four (Companions) lasted twenty-nine years, six months and four days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereafter, <strong>Al-Hasan bin &#8216;Alee</strong> (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) was given the oath of allegiance on the day that his father, &#8216;Alee died. Then, in the month of Rabee&#8217;-ul-Awwal 41H, the command was given to Mu&#8217;awiyah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and due to that, the signs which the Prophet (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) spoke of in his statement: “The Khilaafah after me will endure for thirty years” and his statement: “Indeed, this son of mine is a Sayyid (noble) and perhaps it will be that Allaah will bring peace between two large parties (i.e. that of Al-Hasan and Mu&#8217;awiyah) through him”[4] came to pass.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Hasan</strong> was the grandson of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and the fruit of his offspring. He was the Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen(Commander of the Believers), son of the Ameer-ul-Mu’mineen &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib. He was born on the 15th of Ramadaan in the third year after Hijrah. He died while in Madeenah and was buried in the graveyard Al-Baqee&#8217; in Rabee-ul-Awwal 50H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Husayn</strong> was the grandson of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and the fruit of his offspring. He was the son of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib. He was born in Sha&#8217;baan in the fourth year after Hijrah and was killed at Karbala on the tenth of Muharram 61H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>FOOTNOTES</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of the Virtues of the Companions of the Prophet (no. 3651) and Saheeh Muslim: Book of the Virtues of the Companions (no. 2533) from the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). It is also reported on the authority of ‘Imraan bin Husayn (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) in Al-Bukhaaree (no. 2561, 3650, 6438 &amp; 6695) and Muslim (no. 2535). Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) also reported it in Muslim (no. 534) as well as others. Furthermore, this is a mutawaatir hadeeth. Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr stated the correctness of it being mutawaatir in the introduction to his Al-Isaabah.[2] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of the Virtues of the Companions (no. 3655). And in another wording found in Al-Bukhaaree (no. 3697), it states: “During the lifetime of the Prophet, we used to not put anyone equal to Abu Bakr, then (the same was with) ‘Umar, then (the same was with) ‘Uthmaan. Then we left the (remaining) Companions of the Prophet alone, not distinguishing between any of them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Isnaaduhu Saheeh: This is an authentic hadeeth reported by Abu Dawood (4628), At-Tirmidhee (3707) and Ibn Abee ‘Aasim in As-Sunnah (1190). Its chain of narration (isnaad) is authentic as has been stated by Al-Albaanee in his checking to As-Sunnah (2/567). As for the addition that Shaikh Ibn Al-‘Uthaimeen has mentioned, which is found in At-Tabaraanee, which is: “The Prophet would hear that and he would not oppose it”, then it is an authentic addition, which is established in many paths of narration found in Ibn Abee ‘Aasim (1194, 1195, 1196 &amp; 1197), Ahmad (2/14) and others with authentic chains. Refer to the checking of Ibn Abee ‘Aasim’s As-Sunnah (2/568-569) as well as Fath-ul-Baaree (7/16-17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of Peace Making (no. 2704) from the hadeeth of Abu Bakrah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the story that contains admonition and reflection in it, then it is that which is reported in the biography of &#8216;<strong>Ubayd bin &#8216;Ameer Al-Makkee</strong> in the &#8220;Thiqaat&#8221; of Al-&#8216;Ijlee, who said: &#8220;There used to be a beautiful woman in Makkah who was married. One day she looked at herself in the mirror and said to her husband: &#8216;Do you think there is anyone that can look at this face and not be enticed by it?&#8217; He said: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So she enquired: &#8216;Who?&#8217; He said: &#8221;Ubayd bin &#8216;Ameer.&#8217; So she said: &#8216;Grant me permission so that I may go entice him.&#8217; He said: &#8216;I give you permission.&#8217; So she went to see him and asked him for a fatwa (religious verdict). So he went with her to a part of Al-Masjid AlHaraam and sat in privacy with her. Then she uncovered her face, so that it looked like half of a moon. So he said to her: &#8216;O slave of Allaah, fear Allaah!'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author of Al-Hilyah mentioned this story from &#8220;<strong>Ath-Thiqaat</strong>&#8221; of Al-&#8216;Ijlee in his biography of &#8216;Ubayd bin &#8216;Ameer Al-Makkee. <strong>Al-Albaanee</strong> also mentioned it in his book on Hijaab using it as a proof for the niqaab (face-veil).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point of benefit that we can derive from this great noble scholar&#8217;s rebuking of that woman when she uncovered her face in front of him is that: The Taabi&#8217;een used to hold that a woman uncovering herself by unveiling her face in front of male strangers was a serious crime, which needed to be changed and great efforts needed to be made to terminate it. In fact, the matter should be this way, for indeed a person that looks at a woman&#8217;s face and hands, i.e. a woman he is prohibited from looking at, is enjoying the area of the body with the greatest temptation and the most severe in danger.</p>

It is obligatory on the seller to make these defects clear to the seller and to let him know about them. But if he fails to inform him about them, then this is from deception and swindling, which Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) forbade in his saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">The two persons conducting a business transaction are in a state of goodness for as long as they do not separate from one another. So if they are both honest and open with one another, they are blessed in their transaction. But if they lie and conceal (the truth) from one another, the blessing of their transaction is wiped out.</span>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory upon us, O servants of Allaah, to be sincere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “The Religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity, the religion is sincerity.” They (the Companions) said: “To who O Messenger of Allaah?” He said: “To Allaah, to His Book, to His Messenger, to the Muslim leaders and the Muslim general masses.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim must be sincere. What is meant when one is sincere towards something is that he is free or absolved from certain things. So being sincere means being free from cheating (for example).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">One time the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) passed by a person selling some food in the marketplace who had his food in a pile. So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) put his noble hand inside the pile of food and found some wet portions in the bottom of the pile. So he said: “What is this O owner of the food?” He said: “The sky has affected it” – meaning the rain has damaged some of it. So Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Then won’t you make it visible so that the people can see it? Whoever cheats us (i.e. swindles Muslims) is not from us.”</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This hadeeth is considered one of the fundamental principles in conducting business transactions between the Muslims. <strong>So it is not permissible for a Muslim to conceal the defects</strong>. If his merchandise has a defect then he must make it visible so that the buyer sees it and is aware of it, and so that he could acquire the item for a price that is appropriate for this defect. He must not acquire the item for the price it would be if it were flawless, for then the seller would be deceiving, cheating, fooling and swindling, based on the saying of Allaah’s Messenger: “Then won’t you make it visible so that the people can see it? Whoever cheats us is not from us.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So O servants of Allaah! How much of swindling do you see in these days? How many times do you see people placing the defective items in the bottom of the containers and cases while placing the good items on the top – whether vegetables or food items? They purposely put the defective item in the bottom while putting the flawless item on the top. This is trickery, which is done intentionally. We ask Allaah to pardon and forgive us and you, and that He make our rizq (sustenance) Halaal and that He make our earnings Halaal. And we ask Him to provide us from His vast Bounty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah suffice us with what You have made Halaal over that which You made Haraam, and (suffice us) with Your Bounty over that of others besides You. And forgive us, have mercy on us and accept our repentance. Verily, You are the One who accepts Repentance, the Bestower of Mercy. And may the peace and blessings of Allaah be on Allaah’s Messenger.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that it is required upon everyone that commits a sin to rush towards repenting from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Repentance with regard to the <strong>rights of Allaah</strong> must meet three conditions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1. One must stop committing that sin immediately,</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>2. He must feel remorse and sorrow for having done it, and</strong></span><br /><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>3. He must resolve to not return to committing that sin again.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Repentance with regard to the <strong>rights of humans</strong> must meet these same three conditions (listed above), as well as a fourth one, which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">4. Taking back any oppression that was inflicted on someone or asking for his forgiveness or absolvment from that.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory on a person who has committed backbiting to seek repentance according to these four conditions, because backbiting involves the rights of people, so he must seek the forgiveness of the person he has backbitten.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it sufficient for one to just say: &#8220;I have backbit you, so please absolve me from (this) sin&#8221; or must he inform him also of what he said about him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are two views on this according to the Shaafi&#8217;ee scholars:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First:</strong> His clarifying what he said (when backbiting) is a condition. So if he is absolved without informing him of what he said, the pardon is not valid, just as if he were to absolve him from (stealing) unidentifiable money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Second:</strong> His informing him (of what he said) is not a condition, because this is something that one will not be able to tolerate and thus forgive. So his knowing (exactly what was said) is not a condition, contrary to the example of the (stolen) money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first opinion is the strongest, since people have the ability to grant forgiveness for certain types of backbiting but not other types.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if the one who has been backbitten is either dead or absent, then one is excused from seeking to be absolved from it. However, the scholars say: He should supplicate much for that person and ask forgiveness for him, as well as do many good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that it is preferable for the one who has been backbitten to absolve the backbiter from his sin, but it is not an obligation on him to do so. This is because it is giving away and forfeiting one’s right, so the choice is his. However, it is strongly recommended (muta’akkidah) for him to absolve him so that his Muslim brother can be free from the harm of this sin and so that he can be successful in receiving Allaah’s great reward of Forgiveness and Love. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Those who repress their anger and pardon people. Verily, Allaah loves the good doers.”</span> [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 134]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proper way he should take in making himself allow the pardoning is by reminding himself that: “This matter has already happened and there is no way to remove it now. So it is not right for me to make him miss his chance of getting reward and absolving my Muslim brother.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And verily, whosoever shows patience and forgives (others), that is truly from the things recommended by Allaah.”</span> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Show forgiveness!”</span> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 199]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ayaat similar to what we mentioned above are many. And in the authentic hadeeth, the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> “And Allaah remains in the assistance of (His) servant so long as the servant remains in the assistance of his (fellow) brother.”</span> [Saheeh – Reported by Muslim (2699)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;<em>Whosoever is sought to be pleased, yet is not pleased is a devil</em>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people of the past would recite:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It was said to me: Such and such person has spoken badly of you And when a youth sets out to humiliate, it is a shame So I said: He has come to us and issued an excuse The blood-money (i.e. recompense) for a sin – to us – is the apology.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So what we have mentioned here concerning the encouragement for one to absolve and forgive a person from backbiting is what is correct. As for what has been reported on Sa&#8217;eed bin Al-Musayyib that he said: “I will not forgive the one who has oppressed me” and on Ibn Sireen that he said: “I will not forbid it on him and then make it allowable for him, because Allaah has made backbiting forbidden on him and I will never make permissible what Allaah has made forbidden” then it is either unauthentic or erroneous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since a person that pardons someone is not making something forbidden permissible. Rather, he is only forfeiting a right that is established for him. The texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah indicate clearly that it is recommended to forgive and forfeit one’s rights, which are specific to this case. Or perhaps Ibn Sireen&#8217;s words can be taken to mean: “I will never permit myself to be backbitten.” This would be correct, for indeed if a person says: “I seek my honor back from the one who backbitten me”, he is not allowing for it to be done. Rather, he is forbidding everyone from backbiting him, just as he forbids others from being backbitten.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the hadeeth: “Are you not able to be like Abu Damdam – when he would go out from his home, he would say: ‘I am giving my honor away in charity for the people.’” Meaning: I will not seek justice from those who oppress me whether in this world or the Hereafter. This is useful in removing a transgression that existed before the absolvement, but as for what occurs after it, there must be a new absolvement made after that. And with Allaah lies the success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">We are obligated to have Faith in everything that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) informed us about and in what has been authentically attributed to him through reports, whether we witnessed it or it was hidden from us. We know that it is a reality and the truth. This is the same with regard to whether we comprehend it or we do not comprehend it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not go beyond the outer actuality (i.e. literalness) of its meaning, such as the hadeeth concerning the <strong>Israa and the Mi&#8217;raaj</strong>.[20] It occurred while the Prophet was awake and not in a dream, for indeed the Quraish denied it and considered it something incredible. And they did not used to deny dreams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of that, is when the <strong>angel of death approached Moosaa</strong> in order to take his soul. He (Moosaa) struck him and gouged his eye, so he returned to his Lord who gave him his eye back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of that: are the signs of the Hour, such as the emergence of the <strong>Dajjaal</strong>, the <strong>descent of &#8216;Eesaa</strong> bin Maryam, who will then kill him, the coming out of <strong>Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj</strong>, the emergence of the <strong>Beast</strong>, the <strong>rising of the sun from the west</strong>, and all that is related to this from what has been authentically reported. [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <strong>punishment and pleasure of the grave</strong> are true. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would seek refuge from it (the punishment) and he commanded that it be done in every prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The trial of the grave is true. The questioning of Munkar and Nakeer is true. The resurrection after death is true, and that will occur when Israafeel blows on the trumpet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And behold from the graves they will come out quickly to their Lord.”</span> [Surah YaaSeen (36): 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mankind will be gathered on the Day of Judgement, barefoot, naked, uncircumcised, and having nothing with them (i.e. possessions). They will stop at the final place of standing, until our Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) intercedes for them and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, Blessed and Exalted, reckons with them (i.e. judges them). The <strong>Balances</strong> will be set up, the <strong>records</strong> will be distributed and the pages containing the deeds of each individual will be dispersed into the right hands and the left hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Then as for him who will be given his record in his right hand, he surely, will receive an easy reckoning. And will return back to his family in joy! But whoever is given his record behind his back (or in his left hand), he will invoke (for his) destruction. And he shall enter a blazing Fire and made to taste it’s burning flames.”</span> [Surah Al-Inshiqaaq (84): 7-12]</p>
<p>The <strong>Balance (Al-Meezaan)</strong> has two scales and a tongue, with which it will weigh the deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Then those whose Balances (of good deeds) are heavy, they are the successful. And those whose Balances (of good deeds) are light, they are those who lose their own selves, in Hell will they abide.”</span> [Surah Al-Mu&#8217;minoon (23): 102103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) will have the <strong>Fountain (AlHawd)</strong> on the Day of Judgement. Its water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. Its drinking vessels are as numerous as the stars in the sky. Whosoever drinks a serving from it, will never thirst again after that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Bridge</strong> is true. The righteous ones will cross it and the evil ones will fall from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) <strong>will intercede</strong> for the members of his ummah who have entered the Hellfire due to their major sins. Thus they will be extracted from it due to his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) interceding (for them), but only after having been set ablaze and burned to ashes and charcoal. Then they will enter Paradise due to his intercession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There will also be interceding done by the rest of the prophets, believers and angels. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him.”</span> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa (21): 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intercession of the interceders will be of no avail to the disbelievers. <strong>Paradise and the Hellfire</strong> are two creations that will not cease to exist. Paradise is the abode of the close friends of Allaah, while the Hellfire is the place of punishment for His enemies. The inhabitants of Paradise will abide therein (i.e. Paradise) forever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, the sinful evildoers will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. (Their torment) will not be lightened for them, and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.”</span> [Surah Az-Zukhruf (43): 74-75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Death</strong> will be brought in the form of a sturdy ram and slaughtered between Paradise and Hellfire. Then it will be said: <span style="color:#008000;">“O inhabitants of Paradise! Eternity for you and no (more) death! And O inhabitants of Hellfire! Eternity for you and no (more) death!”</span> [22]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Know that in the same way that backbiting is forbidden for the one who speaks it, it is likewise forbidden for the one who listens to it and approves of it</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is obligatory on the one who hears an individual embarking on committing the prohibited form of backbiting, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>to forbid him</strong></span> from doing it as long as he does not fear any open harm resulting from that. But if he does fear (harm) from that, then he is obligated to <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>reject the backbiting with his heart</strong></span> and to <strong><span style="color:#993300;">detach himself</span></strong> from that gathering if he is able to do so. If he has the ability to reject it with his tongue or to cut the backbiting off by changing the topic, then that becomes required of him. And if he does not do that, then he has committed an act of disobedience (i.e. sinned).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If he is forced to stay in that gathering in which backbiting is taking place, and he fears from forbidding it, or he forbids it but it is not accepted from him and he cannot find a way to separate himself from them, then he is <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>prohibited from listening</strong></span> and paying attention to the backbiting. Instead, his way out should be by <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>making remembrance of Allaah (dhikr)</strong></span> with both his tongue and heart or just his heart. Or he should <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>think about something else</strong></span> in order to preoccupy himself from having to listen to it. After having done this, his hearing it without listening or paying attention to it will not harm him, while he is in this mentioned state. If he is able, after this, to withdraw from them and they are still backbiting, then separating oneself is an obligation. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And when you see those who engage in false conversations about Our verses by mocking at them, then turn away from them until they engage in a different topic of speech. But if the Devil causes you to forget, then after remembering, do not sit in the company of those people who are the wrong-doers.”</span> [Surah AlAn’aam: 68]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been reported that <strong>Ibraaheem bin Adham</strong> was once invited to a waleemah (wedding feast), so he attended it and found people there who were mentioning a man that didn’t come, saying: &#8220;He is truly lazy.&#8221; So Ibraaheem said: &#8220;I brought this upon myself, such that I attended a place in which people are backbiting one another.&#8221; So he left from there and did not eat for three days. What has been recited of poetry with regard to this is:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">“And restrain your ears from hearing vile speech<br />
Just as you restrain your tongue from speaking it<br />
Because when you listen to this vile speech<br />
You are a partner to the one saying it, so reflect.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What Should One Do When He Hears His Shaikh, Friend Or Someone Else Being Backbitten?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that it is upon the one who hears a Muslim being backbitten to oppose it and prevent the one doing the backbiting. If he is not able to prevent him with his speech, then he should stop him with his hand. If he is neither able to do so with his hand or with his tongue, then he should get up and leave that gathering. And if he hears his teacher (shaikh) being backbitten – or anyone else who has a right over him, or if the person (being backbitten) is from the people of righteousness and nobility, then his concern with what we have mentioned above should be greater.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>THE SECOND FOUNDATION:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by the “knowledge” that is mentioned in the ayaat and the ahaadeeth is knowledge of the Religion. As for the universal, physical and material sciences, then these are all a collective obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These sciences fall under Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">“And prepare against them all you can of power, including steeds of war…”</span> [Surah Al- Anfaal: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also fall under the principle: “There is no harming (of oneself) or harming others.” And they fall under the principle: “That which is necessary for the fulfilment of an obligation becomes itself obligatory.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This principle consists of the following matters:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. The statement: “<strong>This is obligatory for every Muslim or student of knowledge to know</strong>” cannot be applied unrestrictedly to any of the types of knowledge except for the Islamic sciences. An example of this is what is known nowadays as “<strong>Knowledge of Current Affairs</strong>”, which focuses on following reports and information from newspapers and magazines, and which some people say is: “An obligatory form of knowledge that every student of knowledge is required to learn!”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. The type of knowledge that the Salaf praised and which they intended by their statements is nothing else but <strong>knowledge of the Religion</strong>. This is the knowledge that was intended in statements such as that of Mu’aadh (radhi Allaahu anhu), when he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Learn knowledge, for indeed learning it for the sake of Allaah is awe (of Him), seeking it is worship, studying it is glorification (of Allaah), researching it is Jihaad, teaching it to those unaware of it is charity, and giving it out to one’s family builds ties. It is a friend in privacy, a companion in solitude, a guide in times of ease, an aide in times of difficulty, a counselor to the friends (of Allaah), a close-relative to the strangers, and a lighthouse for the path to Paradise.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Allaah raises people by way of it, thus making them noble leaders, emulated chiefs in matters of good, and guides to goodness whose footsteps are followed and whose deeds are highly regarded</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So therefore, from the things that this principle entails is that: The knowledge that Allaah, His Messenger and the predecessors, such as the Sahaabah and the Taabi’een have praised is nothing else but knowledge of the Religion. As for all of the other forms of knowledge, they were not the ones intended in the praise for “knowledge” found in these ayaat, ahaadeeth and statements of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So knowledge of medicine, engineering, chemistry, and physics is not what was intended in the ayaat and ahaadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Once we come to understand this, we must ask: “What is the ruling on learning these other sciences?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: It falls under the <strong>collective obligations</strong>, Acquiring knowledge of these sciences falls under (the principle): “That which is necessary for the fulfillment of an obligation becomes itself obligatory.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Acquiring knowledge of these sciences falls under the statement of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">And prepare against them all you can of power, including steeds of war…</span>” [Surah Al- Anfaal: 60]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the ruling on these sciences. If some people take on the responsibility of learning them, the obligation becomes removed from everyone else.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under the requisites of this principle is what I mentioned to you previously – that it cannot be unrestrictedly stated that these sciences or their likes are obligatory for every Muslim to know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So for all the more reason, <strong><span style="color:#333300;">it is incorrect to unrestrictedly say that the knowledge of that which is associated with newspapers and magazines is from the “knowledge” that every student is obliged to learn</span></strong>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Posted from al-ibaanah e-Book – <a title="Guarding the Tongue : Imaam an-Nawawee" href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/08/guardingtongueimamnawawi/">Guarding the Tongue : Imaam an-Nawawee</a> </em><br />
<em><a href="http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/08/guardingtongueimamnawawi">http://salaf-us-saalih.com/2014/01/08/guardingtongueimamnawawi</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that although backbiting is forbidden, it becomes permissible under certain circumstances when done for a beneficial reason. That which makes it allowable is a valid and legitimate goal, which cannot be achieved except by doing it (i.e. the backbiting). These goals can be broken down into six categories:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>1. Oppression</strong></span> &#8211; It is permissible for the one who is oppressed to complain about his situation to the ruler or the judge or anyone else who holds authority or has the ability to grant him justice against his oppressor. He should say: &#8220;Such and such person wronged me&#8221; and &#8220;he did such thing to me&#8221;, and &#8220;he coerced me in this manner&#8221; and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>2. Seeking assistance in changing an evil and returning a sinner back to what is correct</strong></span> &#8211; One should say to the individual whom he expects has the ability to put an end to the evil: &#8220;Such and such person did this, so prevent him&#8221; or something to that effect. His objective should be to look for a way to ultimately put an end to the evil. If he does not intend this as his goal, then it is forbidden (for him to mention it).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>3. Seeking a fatwa (religious ruling)</strong></span> &#8211; One should do this by saying to the muftee (scholar capable of issuing a fatwa): &#8220;My father&#8221; or &#8220;my brother&#8221; or &#8220;such and such person wronged me in this way.&#8221; &#8220;Does he have the right to do so?&#8221; &#8220;How shall I go about putting an end to it and obtain my right while repelling oppression from myself?&#8221; and so on. Likewise, one may say: &#8220;My wife did such and such to me&#8221; or &#8220;my husband did such and such a thing&#8221; and so on. This is permissible due to the necessity for it, however, to be more cautious, it is better for one to say: &#8220;What do you say about a man who has done such and such thing?&#8221; or &#8220;concerning a husband&#8221; or &#8220;concerning a wife who did such and such&#8221; (without saying “my”), etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By doing this, the goal is achieved without having to resort to specifying anyone. However, specifying an individual by name is permissible (in this circumstance), based on the hadeeth of Hind (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa), which we shall mention later, by the Will of Allaah, in which she told Allaah’s Messenger: &#8220;Indeed, Abu Sufyaan (her husband) is a stingy man.&#8221; And the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم did not forbid her from saying this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>4. Warning and Advising the Muslims against Evil</strong></span> &#8211; There are several perspectives to this, of which one is: Declaring someone unreliable in the field of narrating hadeeth and giving testimony. This is permissible to do, according to the Ijmaa&#8217; (consensus of the Muslim scholars). Rather, it becomes obligatory due to the need for it. Another case is when an individual desires to enter into a relationship with another person either through marriage, business, the consignment of property, the consigning of something to him or any other of the daily affairs. It is obligatory on you to mention to that individual what you know about the person he wants to get involved with, with the intention of advising him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If your objective can be achieved by simply saying: &#8220;It is not good for you to engage with him in business transactions” or “in a relationship through marriage&#8221; or by saying: &#8220;You should not do this&#8221; or anything similar to that, then adding more to this, such as by mentioning his bad characteristics is not permissible. And if the objective cannot be reached, except by specifically explaining that person’s condition to him, then you may mention that to him in detail. Another case is when you see someone buying a product from an individual who is known for stealing or fornicating or drinking or other than these. It is then upon you to inform the buyer of this, on the count that he is not knowledgeable of it already. And this case is not specified to this example only. Rather, it also applies to when you have knowledge that the commodity that is being traded is defective. It is then obligatory upon you to clarify this matter to the buyer, if he is not aware of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another case is when you see a student going to an innovator or a deviant, seeking to attain knowledge from him, and you fear that it may affect the student. In that situation, you must advise him about the state of that innovator, on the condition that your intention only be for the sake of advising. And this is something in which regard many people fall into error, for perhaps the person speaking may do this (advising) because he is jealous (of the person he is warning against). Or perhaps the Devil may deceive him about this matter, causing him to believe that what he is doing is advising and showing compassion, so he believes this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One last case is when a person has some leadership role, which he does not fulfill properly either because he is not fit for it or because he is a sinner or neglectful, etc. So in this case, one must mention this to those who have general leadership over this person, so that he can be removed and someone fit can be put in charge. Or those who have charge over him can know this about him so that they can deal with him accordingly and not be deceived by him, and so that they can make the right efforts to encourage him to be upright or to replace him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>5. When one openly exposes his acts of evil or his innovation</strong></span> &#8211; An example of this is when someone has openly exposed his consumption of alcohol, or his illegal confiscation of people’s money and raising of their taxes unjustly and his usurping command wrongfully. It is thus permissible for one to talk about what that individual has made public. But it is forbidden to mention any of his other defects, unless they fall under one of the categories in which we have mentioned that backbiting is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>6. Defining someone</strong> </span>&#8211; If someone is known to the people by his nickname, such as “the bleary eyed one”, “the one who limps”, “the deaf guy”, “the blind guy”, “crosseyed”, “flat-nosed”, and other than that, then it is permissible to particularize him as such, with the aim of identifying him. However, it is forbidden to apply that to him, when one’s intention is to degrade him. If he can be identified with another (more appropriate) type of name, then that is more preferable. These are the six cases in which the scholars have stated that backbiting is permissible, if it is done in accordance to the guidelines we mentioned above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidences for the permissibility of backbiting can be found in authentic and well-known ahaadeeth. Furthermore, there is an agreement of the scholars concerning the allowance of backbiting in these six cases.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Saheehs of Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim that &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;A man sought permission of the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم to enter (his house), so he said: &#8216;Permit him to enter, and what an evil brother to (his) relatives he is.'&#8221;</span> [26] Al-Bukhaaree uses this hadeeth as evidence for the permissibility of backbiting the people of mischief and doubts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu) narrated: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم divided a portion (of war booty amongst the people), so a man from the Ansaar said: &#8216;I swear by Allaah, Muhammad did not intend the face of Allaah by this (i.e. he was not fair).&#8217; So I went to Allaah’s Messenger and informed him of this. His face changed (i.e. he became mad) and said: &#8216;May Allaah have mercy on Moosaa. He was indeed abused with greater than this, but he was patient.'&#8221;</span> [27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In some of the reports of the hadeeth, Ibn Mas&#8217;ood said: &#8220;I said: I will not raise another hadeeth to him again, after this.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Bukhaaree uses this hadeeth as proof that a person is allowed to inform his brother of what is being said about him. &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) reported that Allaah’s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم once said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;I do not think that this person and that person know anything at all about our Religion.&#8221;</span> [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Laith bin Sa’ad, one of the narrators of the hadeeth&#8217;s chain said: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;They were two individuals from among the hypocrites (at his time).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zayd bin Arqam (radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu) reported: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We set out on a journey with the Prophet and the people suffered great difficulty (due to a lack of provisions). So &#8216;Abdullaah bin Ubay [29] said to his companions: &#8216;Don&#8217;t spend on those who are with Allaah&#8217;s Messenger so that they may disperse and go away from him.&#8217; He said: &#8216;If we return to Madeenah, surely, the more honorable will expel the lowly ones from it. So I went to the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم and informed him of that. He sent for &#8216;Abdullaah bin Ubay and asked him, but &#8216;Abdullaah bin Ubay swore that he did not say so. So the people said: &#8216;Zayd told a lie to Allaah&#8217;s Messenger.&#8217; And what they said distressed me very much. Later Allaah revealed the confirmation of my statement in His saying; ‘When the hypocrites come to you&#8230;’ [Surah Al-Munafiqeen]”</span> [30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also there is the hadeeth of Hind (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa), the wife of Abu Sufyaan, in which she said to the Prophet: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Indeed, Abu Sufyaan is a stingy man.</span>&#8221; [31] And also the hadeeth of Faatimah Bint Qays (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa), when the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said to her (with regard to her accepting marriage proposals from two suitors): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">As for Mu&#8217;awiyah, then he is utterly poor. And as for Abu Jahm, then he does not cease to remove the stick from his shoulder (i.e. he beats his wives).</span>&#8221; [32]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, may He be Blessed and Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-3-38.png" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;This is the time when Zakariya invoked his Lord, saying: <strong>&#8216;O my Lord! Grant me from You, a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocations.</strong>&#8216;&#8221;</span> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says quoting Zakariya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-19-5.png" alt="" width="437" height="37" /><br />
<img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-19-6.png" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<strong>And verily, I fear my relatives after me, since my wife is barren. So give me from Yourself a walee (righteous worshipper) who will inherit me and inherit the posterity of Ya&#8217;qoob. And make him, my Lord, one with whom You are well-pleased.</strong>”</span> [Surah Maryam: 5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ash-Shanqeetee said in Adwaa-ul-Bayaan:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Allaah&#8217;s statement in this noble verse: &#8216;So give me from Yourself a walee&#8217; – what is meant by the word walee here is a son specifically and not any other type of walee (righteous person). This is based on proof found in Allaah&#8217;s saying while relating the same story: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;This is the time when Zakariya invoked his Lord, saying: &#8216;O my Lord! Grant me from You, a good offspring. You are indeed the All-Hearer of invocation.</span>&#8221; [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 38]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah also indicates that what is meant (by the word walee, i.e. righteous person) here is a child by His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-21-89.png" alt="" width="484" height="41" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And remember Zakariya when he cried to his Lord: &#8216;O my Lord, leave me not single! You are the best of the inheritors.&#8221;&#8217;</span> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 89] &#8216;Leave me not single&#8217; means: &#8216;Alone and without a child.&#8217;”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[End of Ash-Shanqeetee&#8217;s words] [Adwaa-ul-Bayaan (3/365)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is for this reason that from amongst the supplications of the believers – &#8220;those from whom We shall accept the best of their deeds and overlook their evil deeds, they shall be among the dwellers of Paradise – a promise of truth, which they have been promised” – is that which Allaah has mentioned:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><img class=" aligncenter" src="https://noblequraan.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/quran-ayah-46-15.png" alt="" width="466" height="105" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;My Lord! Grant me the power and ability that I may be grateful for Your Favour which You have bestowed upon me and upon my parents, and that I may do righteous good deeds, such as please You, and make my offspring good. Truly, I have turned to You in repentance, and truly I am one of the Muslims.”</span> [Surah Al-Ahqaaf: 15]</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Their Attributes and Characteristics</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First Characteristic:</strong></span> They are young in age. [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 5057) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Second Characteristic:</strong></span> They have foolish minds &#8211; i.e. intellects. [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 5057) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Third Characteristic:</strong></span> They speak with the best speech amongst creation. [Al- Bukhaaree (no. 5057) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> Their Eemaan does not go past their throats. [Al- Bukhaaree (no. 5057) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> They come out from the Religion just as an arrow comes out from the hunted game. Then they do not return back to it. [Muslim (no. 2496) from the hadeeth of Abu Dharr (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one narration: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">They shoot out from the Religion just as an arrow shoots out from the hunted game</span>.&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 5058) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another report it states: &#8220;They shoot out from Islaam&#8230;&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 5057) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Sixth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They have a weakness when it comes to understanding the Religion of Allaah. This is why it has been reported that &#8220;They recite the Qur&#8217;aan but it does not surpass&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2456)] &#8220;&#8230;or go past their throats.&#8221; [Al- Bukhaaree (no. 5058) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, it states: &#8220;&#8230;their pharynxes (hulooq).&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2455) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;&#8230;their pharynxes {halaaqeehim).&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2469) from Abu Dharr (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;&#8230;their collar bones (taraaqeehim).&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 6934) from Sahl bin Haneef (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;They will make their tongues eloquent with the Qur&#8217;aan.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 937) from Abu Bakrah (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;They will recite the Qur&#8217;aan with their tongues but it will not go past their collar bones.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2470) from Sahl bin Haneef (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration: &#8220;They will hold it (i.e. the recitation) to be for them, when it is against them.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 916) from &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration, it states: &#8220;They will think&#8230;&#8221; instead of &#8220;They will hold&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2467) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, he صلى الله عليه و سلم said: &#8220;They will call to the Book of Allaah, but they will have nothing to do with Allaah.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 941) from Abu Zaid Al-Ansaaree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration of the hadeeth, the Khawaarij and what they undergo when reciting the Qur&#8217;aan was mentioned to Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhi Allaahu anhu), so he said: &#8220;They are not as extreme in their striving as the Jews and the Christians were, but yet they went astray.&#8221; [Ash- Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 27-28)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration, Ibn &#8216;Abbaas said: &#8220;They believe in His clear verses, but go astray concerning His unclear verses 10 &#8211; No one knows their hidden meanings except Allaah. And as for those firmly rooted in knowledge, they say: &#8216;We believe in it.'&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: &#8220;They are in a confused and drunken state. They are neither Jews nor Christians nor Magians, so that they may be excused.&#8221; [Ash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 28)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Seventh Characteristic:</strong> </span>They are excessive in performing acts of worship, as occurs in the hadeeth in which the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم spoke to his Companions about them, saying: &#8220;Your prayer is nothing as compared to their prayer. Your fasting is nothing as compared to their fasting. And your reciting the Qur&#8217;aan is nothing as compared to their reciting.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2467) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration of this hadeeth, it states: &#8220;You will look down at your prayer as compared to their prayer&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2455) from Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration: &#8220;&#8230;(and you will look down) at your deeds as compared to their deeds.&#8221; [Sharh Usool &#8216;Itiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah (8/1231)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Eighth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They are the worst of creation and creatures. [Muslim (no. 2469) from the hadeeth of Abu Dharr (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu &#8216;Abdillaah Ahmad bin Hanbal (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;The Khawaarij are an evil people. I don&#8217;t know of any people on the earth that are worse than them.&#8221; [As-Sunnah of Abu Bakr Al-Khallaal (no. 110)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Ninth Characteristic:</span></strong> Their distinguishing attribute is that they shave their heads. [Muslim (no. 2457) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another narration of the hadeeth, it states: &#8220;At-Tasbeet.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 4765) from Anas bin Maalik radhi Allaahu anhu ]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tasbeet means: Removing the short hair.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Tenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They will kill the people of Faith and leave alone the worshippers of idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, it states: &#8220;They will kill the people of Islaam&#8230;&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2451) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Eleventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They will become so deeply absorbed (i.e. ta&#8217;ammuq) in the Religion [11] to the point that they will leave from it. [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 930) from &#8216;Abdullaah bin &#8216;Amr (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twelfth Characteristic:</strong></span> They disparage their rulers and claim them to be upon misguidance, as &#8216;Abdullaah bin Dhil-Khuwaisrah did with the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They call the people to the Book of Allaah but have nothing to do with it. [12] [Abu Dawood (no. 4765) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al- Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) and Anas bin Maalik (radhi Allaahu anhu)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fourteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They do not believe that the people of knowledge and virtue hold a special position. This was why they perceived that they were more knowledgeable than &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib, Ibn &#8216;Abbaas and the rest of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with all of them. [Al-Khawaarij Awwalul-Firaq fee Taareekh-il- Islaam (pg. 38)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What is meant by ta&#8217;ammuq is: Relying and using as proof that which the religious texts do not substantiate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They go to extremes in worship. So they perform acts of worship to the extent that those who see them become amazed with them and they become amazed with themselves. 13 [As-Sunnah of Ibn Abee &#8216;Aasim (no. 945) from the hadeeth of Anas bin Maalik (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;And I have not seen a people that are stricter in their exertion (of worship) than them. Their hands are like the calluses of camels and their foreheads are marked due to the traces of prostration.&#8221; [Majma&#8217;-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id (6/240)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="more-34135"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Sixteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhi Allaahu anhu) held them to be the worst of creation. He (radhi Allaahu anhu) said about them: &#8220;They took ayaat that were revealed concerning the disbelievers and applied them to the believers.&#8221; Al-Bukhaaree reported this narration under the &#8220;Chapter: Killing the Khawaarij and Heretics after establishing the proof against them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: &#8220;And Allaah will never lead a people astray after He has guided them until He makes clear to them what they should be avoiding.&#8221; [Surah At-Tawbah: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Seventeenth Characteristic:</strong></span> They will set out (to fight) against the best group amongst people.&#8221; [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 6933)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Eighteenth Characteristic:</strong></span> Allaah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And among them are some who accuse you (O Muhammad) in the matter of the (distribution of) alms&#8230;&#8221; [Surah At- Tawbah: 58] was revealed concerning &#8216;Abdullaah bin Dhil-Khuwaisirah At-Tameemee, the founding father of the Khawaarij. [Al-Bukhaaree (no. 6933) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Nineteenth Characteristic:</strong> </span>Their prayer does not go past their throats. [Muslim (no. 2467) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The Twentieth Characteristic:</span></strong> There is a great reward for he who kills them. &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;If the army that encounters them knew what was ordained for them upon the tongue of their prophet, they would only rely on that action.&#8221; [Abu Dawood (no. 4768)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In one narration, it reads: &#8220;Whoever fights them has more right to Allaah than them.&#8221; [Abu Dawood (no. 4765) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) and Anas bin Maalik (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration, it states: &#8220;Toobaa is for he who kills them and is killed by them.&#8221; [Abu Dawood (no. 4765) from Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) and Ahmad (no. 19172) from &#8216;Abdullaah bin Abee Awfaa (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Umaamah (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;They are the worst of those who are killed under the surface of the sky. And the best of those who are killed is he who is killed at their hands.&#8221; And (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;These individuals were Muslims but became disbelievers.&#8221; [Ibn Maajah (no. 176)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-First Characteristic:</strong></span> They shed unlawful blood &#8211; whether their own by way of suicide or others by transgressing against them by way of murder. [Muslim (no. 246) from the hadeeth of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> As &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu) said: &#8220;They will speak the truth with their tongues, but it will not go past this from them.&#8221; &#8211; And he pointed to his throat. &#8220;They are from the most despised of Allaah&#8217;s creation to Him.&#8221; He (radhi Allaahu anhu) said this when they told him: &#8220;There is no rule except for that of Allaah&#8217;s.&#8221; [Muslim (no. 2468) from the statement of &#8216;Alee bin Abee Taalib (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> They are the first ones who split away from the unified body of Muslims and declared them to be disbelievers due to (their committing of) sins. [Majmoo&#8217;-ul-Fataawaa of Shaikh-ul-lslaam Ibn Taimiyyah (3/349 and 7/279)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> They beautify their speech but produce vile actions &#8211; after mentioning the differing and division in the ummah. [Abu Dawood (no. 4765) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> Every time a new generation springs forth from them, it gets cut off (i.e. from the Jamaa&#8217;ah). [Ibn Maajah (no. 174) from Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong></span> There will emerge from amidst them the Dajjaal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a narration it states: &#8220;&#8230;from their treachery&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in one manuscript: &#8220;&#8230;from their ranks&#8230;&#8221; And that refers to a great army. [Ibn Maajah (no. 174) from the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They are from those in whose hearts is a deviation, as has been interpreted from the saying of Allaah: &#8220;But as for those in whose hearts there is a deviation, they follow what is unclear thereof&#8230;&#8221; [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 7] and His saying: &#8220;On the Day when some faces will be brightened and some faces will be darkened&#8230;&#8221; [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan: 106] that the ones who are intended by these verses were the Khawaarij. [Ahmad (no. 22313) from Abu Umaamah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Eighth Characteristic:</strong></span> They declare a Muslim to be a disbeliever due to every sin. And they say: &#8220;The leave the fold of Eemaan and enter into disbelief.&#8221; [Sharh al-&#8216;Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah (pg. 298) with the verification of Ahmad Shaakir]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Twenty-Ninth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They hold that the Muslims who commit major sins will reside eternally in the Hellfire. [Sharh al-&#8216;Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah (pg. 360) with the verification of Ahmad Shaakir]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirtieth Characteristic:</strong></span> They hold it as an obligatory duty to rebel against the leader if he opposes the Sunnah. [Al-Milal wan-Nihal (1/115)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-First Characteristic:</strong></span> They are the worst of people in deriving rules based on analogy. [14] [Al-Milal wan-Nihal (1/1 16)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> They deem the subjects disbelievers &#8211; those absent as well as those present &#8211; if their leader commits disbelief. This is done by the Baihasiyyah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij. [Al-Milal wan-Nihal (1/126)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> They declare those who don&#8217;t agree with their views to be disbelievers, and they consider their blood lawful for shedding. The also permit the killing of the women and children that oppose them. This is done by the Azaariqah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij. [Lawaami&#8217;-ul-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah (1/86)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> They hold that Faith (Eemaan) is: Knowledge of Allaah and of what the Messenger of Allaah صلى الله عليه و سلم came with. So whoever commits something that he is not sure of as to whether it is lawful or unlawful, he is a disbeliever, since he was obligated to have researched into the matter. This is done by the Baihasiyyah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij. [Lawaami&#8217;-ul-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah (1/87)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> They hold that it is obligatory to fight against the ruler alone as well as whoever is pleased with his rule. As for those who reject the ruler, then it is not permissible to fight against them unless they support the ruler, attack the beliefs of the Khawaarij or serve as guides for the ruler. 15 This is done by the &#8216;Ujaaradah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong> </span>They say: &#8220;Every sin that a person commits makes him a disbeliever, since he is ignorant of Allaah. This is done by the Makramiyyah al- Munshaqqah from the Tha&#8217;alabiyyah &#8211; one of the sects of the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> There will be from among them those who will be with the Dajjaal during the Last Days. It was said to &#8216;Alee radhi Allaahu anhu: &#8220;All praise be to Allaah who rescued the servants from them.&#8221; He replied: &#8220;Nay. I swear by the One in whose Hand my soul is, there are still some of them that remain in the loins of men and verily, there are those amongst them who will be with the Dajjaal. [Lawaami&#8217;-ul-Anwaar al-Bahiyyah (1/86)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Eighth Characteristic:</strong></span> They do not respect the sanctity of places or times, as occurred with the Qaraamitah and those who came after them until this very day of ours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Thirty-Ninth Characteristic:</strong></span> They do not hold that an oppressive ruler has the right to leadership. [Maqaalaat al-lslaamiyeen (1/204)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fortieth Characteristic:</strong></span> They cling onto the apparent meanings of the Qur&#8217;aanic texts. Even though they don&#8217;t intend to oppose it, however, they understand from it that which the texts do not indicate. Due to this, they have claimed that the prophets committed major and minor sins based on Allaah&#8217;s statement: &#8220;Verily, We have given you a manifest victory &#8211; So that Allaah may forgive you of your past and future sins.&#8221; [Surah Al-Fat&#8217;h: 1-2] So according to them, the Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم may commit disbelief then repent. [Al-Khawaarij &#8211; &#8216;Aqeedatan wa Fikran wa Filasufatan (pg. 54)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-First Characteristic:</strong></span> They reject the Sunnah if there is not some explicit text in the Qur&#8217;aan that supports it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaikh-ul-lslaam Ibn Taimiyyah (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;They do not take anything from the Sunnah except for that which can be interpreted in its general sense, not including those texts that contradict what is apparently stated in the Qur&#8217;aan, according to them. So they do not believe in stoning the fornicator nor do they believe that there is a minimum (stolen) amount, which constitutes stealing.&#8221; [Majmoo&#8217;-ul-Fataawaa (13/48)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> They lie in wait on the roads for the purpose of attacking the passers-by and spilling their blood without any justification from Allaah. [Al-Mustadrak of Al-Haakim (2/153) and Majma&#8217;-uz-Zawaa&#8217;id (6/236) from the speech of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah (radhi Allaahu anhu)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> Not one of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger صلى الله عليه و سلم could be found amongst them (i.e. to support them). [Al-Mustadrak of Al-Haakim (2/150)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> There are many amongst them that differ with one another. This is why they have divided into so many sects, some of which set out to fight against the other and at times, some of which deliver speeches against the other. Allaah spoke truthfully when He said: &#8220;If it (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) were from other than Allaah, you would have found many differences in it.&#8221; [Surah An-Nisaa: 82] [Al- Khawaarij- Aqeedatan wa Fikran wa Filasufatan (pg. 54)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> They are the dogs of the inhabitants of Hell. [Sharh &#8216;Itiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah (8/1232)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong></span> They outwardly manifest the attributes of calling to good and forbidding evil, redirecting the religious texts concerning that towards disputing with the rulers, rebelling against them and fighting against those who oppose them. [Ash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 22) and Al-Khawaarij Awwalul-Firaq fee Taareekh-il-lslaam (P9- 37)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They speak using the speech and words of the people of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin al-Husayn (rahimahullaah) said: &#8220;It is not befitting for one who sees the tireless efforts of a Khaarijee that has rebelled against a ruler &#8211; whether just or tyrannical &#8211; thus setting out against him, rallying a group against him, unsheathing swords and deeming it lawful to fight against Muslims &#8211; it is not befitting for him to be deceived by such a person&#8217;s recitation of the Qur&#8217;aan nor by the length of his standing in prayer, nor by his perseverance in fasting, nor by his good words concerning knowledge, so long as he holds the views of the Khawaarij.&#8221; [Ash-Sharee&#8217;ah (pg. 28)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Eighth Characteristic:</strong></span> They permit oppression against the Prophet M- [Al- Bukhaaree (no. 6933) from the hadeeth of Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree (radhi Allaahu anhu) and Majmoo&#8217;-ul- Fataawaa of Ibn Taimiyyah (19/73)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Forty-Ninth Characteristic:</strong></span> They use as evidence verses from the Qur&#8217;aan that deal with the wa&#8217;eed (Allaah&#8217;s threat of punishment) while abandoning the verses concerning the wa&#8217;ad (Allaah&#8217;s promise for forgiveness). [Al-Khawaarij Awwalul-Firaq fee Taareekh-il-lslaam (pg. 38)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fiftieth Characteristic:</strong></span> They are hasty in applying rulings. [Al-Khawaarij Awwalul- Firaq fee Taareekh-il-lslaam (pg. 146)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-First Characteristic:</strong></span> They make rulings and accusations against the hearts. This includes issuing rulings on one&#8217;s decisions and notions. [Al-Khawaarij Awwalul- Firaq fee Taareekh-il-lslaam (pg. 147)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Second Characteristic:</strong></span> Among them is he who has doubts concerning the well-established historical events. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 133)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Third Characteristic:</strong></span> They call to illiteracy and they make war against education, claiming that it is not possible to combine between the religious sciences and the practical secular sciences. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 134)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Fourth Characteristic:</strong></span> They call to splitting away from the Muslim community. So they boycott the schools, institutes, universities, government positions and residing with Muslims. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 137)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Fifth Characteristic:</strong></span> From among them is he who believes that a person who holds that the consensus (Ijmaa&#8217;) of the scholars is proof is a disbeliever. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 143)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Sixth Characteristic:</strong></span> Among them is he who disparages the Companions and rejects their statements. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 144)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Seventh Characteristic:</strong></span> They oppose those scholars that make blind- following permissible for the common person and the beginner student, claiming that blind-following (taqleed) is a cause for disbelief and the destruction of the nation of Islaam. [Diraasatun &#8216;an-il-Firaq wa Taareekh-ul-Muslimeen (pg. 146-147)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The Fifty-Eighth Characteristic:</strong></span> They kill themselves in suicide operations basing that on false arguments.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] This is a characteristic that is common with all innovators, since they go astray with regard to Allaah&#8217;s unclear verses. They do not try to combine between the clear and unclear verses, as those firmly-grounded in knowledge do.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[11] What is meant by ta&#8217;ammuq is: Relying and using as proof that which the religious texts do not substantiate</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[12] Meaning: They will seek to use evidences from the Book of Allaah but err in their manner of deriving the basis of proof from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] Being amazed with oneself is one of the causes that lead the people of innovation astray. And it is one of the pathways that the Devil uses to enter into the affairs of worshippers, Mujaahideen and ascetics, so long as they do not adhere to the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] I say: This is with respect to the later ones among them. As for the initial Khawaarij, then they rarely performed analytical deduction. Rather, they would apply their poor understanding to the religious texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] How similar does tonight resemble last night, for everyone that warns against their ways is accused (by them) as regards his Religion. They deem it permissible to fight against the police and security officers who are the cause for maintaining peace and safety.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Shaikh-ul-lslaam Ibn Taimiyyah said in his book AI-&#8216;Aqeedat-ul-Waasitiyyah:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Among the Principles of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah is maintaining pure hearts and tongues towards the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم), as Allaah has described them in His saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;And those who come after them say: &#8216;Our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Faith. And put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord, You are indeed full of kindness, most Merciful.&#8217;</span> [Surah Al-Hashr: 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And (from their principles is) obedience to the Prophet with regard to his (صلى الله عليه و سلم) saying: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8216;Do not revile my Companions! For by the One whose Hand my soul is in, if one of you were to give away the size of mount Uhud in gold for charity, it would not equal a mudd of one of them nor even half of it.&#8217;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They accept what is stated in the Qur&#8217;aan, the Sunnah and the Consensus concerning their (the Companion&#8217;s) virtues and high status. And they give preference to those who spent their wealth and fought (in the Way of Allaah) before the Victory, which refers to the Treaty of al-Hudaibiyah, over those who gave their wealth and fought after it. They give precedence to the Muhaajireen over the Ansaar. And they believe that Allaah said to the people who fought in (the Battle of) Badr &#8211; who numbered over three hundred people: <strong>&#8216;Do whatever you wish, for I have already forgiven you.&#8217;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they believe that no one who pledged their allegiance to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) under the tree will enter the Hellfire, as the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) informed us. In fact, Allaah was pleased with them and they were pleased with Him. And they were more than one thousand four hundred people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They designate to Paradise whoever the Messenger of Allaah testified will be in Paradise, such as the Ten (Companions), Thaabit bin Qays bin Shammas and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They confirm what has been reported in tawaatur form on the Commander of the Believers, &#8216;Alee Ibn Abee Taalib and others that: The best of this ummah after its Prophet are Abu Bakr; then &#8216;Umar. Then they place &#8216;Uthmaan third and &#8216;Alee fourth, may Allaah be pleased with all of them. This is as is indicated in the athaar (reports from the Sahaabah) and as was unanimously agreed upon that &#8216;Uthmaan had precedence (over &#8216;Alee) for being pledged allegiance to (for the Khilaafah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of this, after unanimously agreeing to the precedence of Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar, some of Ahl-us-Sunnah have disagreed with regard to &#8216;Uthmaan and &#8216;Alee as to which of them is better. So a group of them gave precedence to &#8216;Uthmaan and then remained silent, and placed &#8216;Alee as the fourth. And another group gave precedence to &#8216;Alee. And yet another group remained neutral. But the affair of Al-us-Sunnah settled upon giving precedence to &#8216;Uthmaan and then &#8216;Alee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regardless, this issue of &#8216;Uthmaan and &#8216;Alee is not from the principles by which the one who disagrees concerning it becomes misguided (and deviant), according to the majority of the (scholars of) Ahl-us-Sunnah. Rather, the issue in which the one who opposes becomes misguided is the issue of the Khilaafah &#8211; and it is that they (must) believe that the Khaleefah after Allaah&#8217;s Messenger was Abu Bakr, then &#8216;Umar, then &#8216;Uthmaan, then &#8216;Alee. And whoever attacks the Khilaafah of any one of them, then he is more astray than the donkey of his people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then he mentioned that they have love and affection for the Members of the Household of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and that they preserve the Will (final requests) of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger concerning them. And that they have affection for the Wives of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, the Mothers of the Believers and believe that they will be his wives in the Hereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Then he said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;They absolve themselves from the way of the Rawaafid &#8211; those who hate the Companions and revile them &#8211; and from the way of the Nawaasib &#8211; those who abuse the Members of the (Prophet&#8217;s) Household &#8211; through speech or action. And they refrain from (delving into) the disputes that occurred between the Companions. And they say: These narrations that have been reported concerning their faults have in them some that are false, some that have had things added to them, some that have had parts omitted from them, and some that have been changed from their original state. As for those narrations that are authentic (concerning their faults), then they (the Companions) are excused (and forgiven) &#8211; either they made Ijtihaad and were correct or they made Ijtihaad and were wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, they do not believe that each of the Companions is infallible and free from committing major or minor sins. Rather, they are capable of committing sins in general, however, they possess from precedence and virtues that which necessitates that they be forgiven for whatever (sins) they commit &#8211; if they did commit any. This is even to the point that they will be forgiven for evil deeds the likes of which those who come after them will not be forgiven for. This is because they possess good deeds that wipe out the evil deeds, the likes of which will not be for those after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is established from the saying of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) that they are the best of generations and that if one of them were to give a mudd (of gold) in charity it would be better than if someone who came after them were to give the whole of Mount Uhud in gold. And if it was the case that one of them committed a sin, then either he repented from it or he performed some good deed that wiped it out. Or he will be forgiven for it due to the virtue of his precedence or because of the intercession of Muhammad H, of which the Companions have the most right among people of receiving. Or perhaps he was tested by some affliction in this world, by which it was expiated from him. So if this is with respect to the sins that were actualized (by them), then what about the matters in which they did Ijtihaad? If they were correct they will have two rewards and if they were incorrect they will have just one reward and their error will be forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the amount of (bad) deeds committed by some of them, that is forsaken yet forgiven, is tiny in comparison to their virtues and good qualities, such as their belief in Allaah and His Messenger, their Jihaad for His Cause, their performance of Hijrah, their support (of the Religion), as well as their beneficial knowledge and good deeds. And whoever studies the history of the &#8216;people&#8217; (i.e. the Sahaabah) with knowledge and insight, and studies the merits that Allaah bestowed unto them, he will come to know with full certainty that they are the best of creation after the prophets. There was not nor will there be anyone like them. They are the safwah (chosen elite) from all the generations of this nation (of Muslims), which is itself the best and most honorable of all nations with Allaah.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever disputes and differences that occurred between (some of) them, that can be authentically confirmed, we hold that they were Mujtahideen in that regard &#8211; either they were correct and will receive one reward for their Ijtihaad and one reward for being correct, or they were wrong and will receive just one reward for their Ijtihaad while their error will be forgiven. They were not infallible since they were human beings. At times they were correct and at times they erred. But how much more were they correct as compared to others being correct, and how fewer were their errors as compared to the errors of others? And on top of this, they will receive Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of Ahl-us-Sunnah are filled with a clarification of this pure and radiant Creed concerning these elite people, who were chosen amongst mankind to accompany the best of mankind H. May Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this is the statement of At-Tahaawee in his (book on the) Creed of Ahl- us-Sunnah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;We love the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. But we do not go to extremes in our love for anyone amongst them, nor do we absolve ourselves from any of them. And we hate anyone that hates them or anyone that talks about them in a bad way. And we do not mention them except with good. Loving them is Deen (Religion), Eemaan (Faith) and Ihsaan (Goodness) and hating them is Kufr (Disbelief), Nifaaq (hypocrisy) and Tughyaan (transgression).&#8221;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ibn Abee Zayd Al-Qayrawaanee</strong> said in the introduction to his famous ar-Risaalah, in which he explains the Creed of Ahl-us-Sunnah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The best of generations is the one that saw the Messenger of Allaah. And the best of the Companions are the (four) rightly guided Khaleefahs &#8211; Abu Bakr, then &#8216;Umar, then &#8216;Uthmaan, then &#8216;Alee, may Allaah be pleased with them all. None of the Companions should be mentioned except in the best of manners. <strong>We believe in refraining from (speaking about) the differences that occurred between them</strong>. And that they are the most deserving of people of having excuses made for them and (that) they are to be thought of in the best way.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</strong> said in his book as-Sunnah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And from the Sunnah is mentioning the good qualities of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger &#8211; all of them &#8211; and to refrain from (speaking about) what disputes occurred between them. So whoever reviles the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger or (just) one of them, then he is an innovator, a Raafidee. Loving them is a Sunnah and making du&#8217;aa (supplication) for them is a means of getting close to Allaah (taqarrub). Following them is a means and taking from their example is a virtue&#8230;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is not permissible for anyone to mention any of their faults. Nor can anyone disparage any of them. So whoever does that, then the authority (sultan) is obligated to reprimand him and punish him. And he is not to pardon him, but rather must punish him and then request him to repent. So if he repents, he should accept it from him. And if he doesn&#8217;t repent, he should reinitiate the punishment upon him and lock him in prison for good until he repents and recants (from his false belief).&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imaam Abu &#8216;Uthmaan As-Saaboonee</strong> said in his book Aqeedat-us-Salaf wa Ashaab-il- Hadeeth:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And they held it an obligation to refrain from (speaking about) the differences that occurred between the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and to purify the tongues from mentioning anything that consists of a blemish on them or a degradation of them. And they held it an obligation to ask Allaah to grant mercy to all of them and to show friendship to all of them.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Know that having bad thoughts about someone is forbidden just like having bad speech about him</strong>. So just as it is forbidden for you to speak to others about the defects of a person, it is likewise forbidden for you to speak to yourself about that and to hold bad thoughts for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe, avoid much (types) of suspicion. Verily some (forms) of suspicion is a sin.</span>” [Surah Al-Hujuraat: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Abu Hurairah (radhi Allaahu anhu) reported that Allaah’s Messenger (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Beware of suspicion, for indeed suspicion is the most untruthful form of speech.&#8221;</span> [39]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The ahaadeeth with this same understanding I have mentioned here are many. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>What the backbiting of the heart means, is: When the heart has firm conviction and holds bad thoughts about someone. But as for the notions that occasionally display in one&#8217;s mind or when one talks to himself, then as long as these thoughts do not remain established and continuous in him, it is excused according to the consensus of the scholars</strong></span>. This is since he has no choice in the matter as to stop it from occurring nor can he find any way to liberate himself from it when it does occur. This is the understanding of what has been authentically established (in the texts).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: <span style="color:#008000;">“Indeed, Allaah has permitted for my ummah that which their souls whisper to them, so long as they do not speak it out (audibly) or act upon it.”</span> [40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars say: “<strong>This refers to the notions that form in one&#8217;s mind, but do not become settled or established there</strong>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they said: “This is regardless if the notion consists of backbiting, disbelief or so on (i.e. it is pardoned, so long as it does not settle). So (for example) whoever&#8217;s mind becomes flooded with thoughts of disbelief, but they are only thoughts, without him intending to have them carried out, and he then rids himself of these thoughts right after they occur, he is not a disbeliever nor is there any sin on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have already stated previously, in the chapter on the (internal) whisperings, the authentic hadeeth, in which the Companions said:<span style="color:#008000;"> &#8220;O Messenger of Allaah! Some of us find things in our thoughts that are too tremendous to speak of.&#8221; So he (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;That is the confirmation of Faith.&#8221;</span> [41]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this goes for the other reports we have mentioned in that chapter that bear the same understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reason for these thoughts being excused is due to what we have stated previously that these thoughts are impossible to prevent. Rather, one is only able to prevent those thoughts from becoming settled and established in one’s mind. This is why the heart’s being resolute and determined on these thoughts is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So whenever these thoughts, which consist of backbiting or any other sin, present themselves in your mind, it is an obligation on you to repel them, turn away from them and mention some excuse or explanation that will change what seems apparent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We stated previously that if someone is presented with a notion of bad thoughts for another person, he should cut off those bad thoughts. But this is unless there is some (religiously) legislated benefit that leads to thinking (about that person) in this manner. So if such a reason exists, holding these thoughts about his deficiencies is permissible, as well as warning against them, as can be seen in the jarh (criticism) of certain witnesses, narrators and others we have mentioned in the Chapter on “What Type of Backbiting is Permissible.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[39] Saheeh – Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (10/484 of al-Fath) and Muslim (2563)<br />
[40] Saheeh – Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (5/160 of al-Fath) and Muslim (127 and 202)<br />
[41] Saheeh – Reported by Muslim (132); Translator’s Note: This hadeeth shows the Companions’ zeal and enthusiasm in commanding themselves with good and forbidding themselves from evil, such that they would even fight against the evil notions that passed through their minds. But as it is impossible to prevent such thoughts from occurring every now and then, they asked the Prophet (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) about this. His response to them meant that their trying to repel these thoughts showed their strong Eemaan (Faith) and love for good.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The Following is posted from the E-Book : &#8220;<a title="Selected Examples from the Characteristics of the Extremist Khawaarij – Aadil bin ‘Alee Al-Furaydaan" href="https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/30/selected-examples-from-the-characteristics-of-the-extremist-khawaarij-aadil-bin-alee-al-furaydaan/">Selected Examples from the Characteristics of the Extremist Khawaarij</a>&#8221; &#8211; by&nbsp;Aadil bin ‘Alee Al-Furaydaan ,Read and Reviewed by The Noble Scholars Saalih Al-Fawzaan &amp; Muhammad Al-Khumayyis</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Definition of the Khawaarij and a Warning against Them:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word Khawaarij is the plural of Khaarijee, and that refers to a person that removes himself from the obedience of the true ruler, outwardly proclaims opposition to him and incites the people against him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Guideline for Identifying a Khaarijee:</strong> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) outwardly proclaims rebellion against the Muslim rulers or</p>
<p>(2) holds Muslims to be disbelievers due to major sins, apart from Shirk, or</p>
<p>(3) justifies the views of the Khawaarij and considers it permissible to shed the blood of Muslims in the name of Jihaad in the Way of Allaah and in the name of changing an evil,</p></blockquote>
<p>then these are all factors for identifying the Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Their Origin:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the martyrdom of the Muslim Khaleefah, ‘Umar bin Al-Khattaab رضي الله عنه, the door to fitnah was broken, as is mentioned in the hadeeth. Then with the murder of the third Khaleefah, ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan رضي الله عنه in 35H, due to a conspiracy from Ibn Saba’ and those who were deluded by him, the fitnah (strife) was re-established – and we continue to see its evil effects up to this very day of ours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Naturally, ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib رضي الله عنه was given the oath of allegiance as the next Khaleefah after him, and so most of the Muslims gave their pledge of allegiance to him. However, Mu’aawiyah رضي الله عنه and those who were with him from the inhabitants of Syria did not give in to that, citing the reason for that as being the obligation of quickly bringing to justice those responsible for the murder of ‘Uthmaan bin ‘Affaan رضي الله عنه. ‘Alee would tell Mu’aawiyah: “Enter into that which the people have entered into (of allegiance). And leave me to judge them. I will judge them with the truth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, ‘Aa’ishah, Talhah and Az-Zubair رضي الله عنه&nbsp;set out for Basrah upset and seeking justice for the blood of ‘Uthmaan رضي الله عنه.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee رضي الله عنه tried to convince ‘Aa’ishah, Talhah and Az-Zubair of the pressing importance of first declaring allegiance to the ruler and then to seek retribution for the murder of ‘Uthmaan رضي الله عنه. The matter finally became resolved in their mutual agreement to that. However, on the following day, the callers to mischief mobilized their forces and began skirmishes and clashes on both sides. So the peace-makers from both groups thought that the other group had deceived the other, and fighting broke out. The battle that ensued, which later came to be known as the <strong>Battle of the Camel</strong>, ended with the death of Talhah, Az-Zubair and ten-thousand members from each group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After this, ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib رضي الله عنه set out to fight against Mu’aawiyah رضي الله عنه and the inhabitants of Syria. This is since he had called them to give the allegiance, however, Mu’aawiyah رضي الله عنه refused to give it, claiming that they must first avenge the murder of ‘Uthmaan رضي الله عنه. ‘Alee took this action of Mu’aawiyah as a rebellion against the religious rulership. So there occurred (between the army of the two of them) the <strong>battle of Siffeen</strong>. When ‘Alee and those with him were close to achieving victory, the army of Mu’aawiyah placed copies of the mus-haf high over the tips of their spears and appealed to the Book of Allaah for judgement…’Alee considered this to be a trick on their part, but he was coerced to accept the decision (for peace between the two fighting parties) on the part of some members of his army, especially the Qur’aanic reciters, out of their concern for the Religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the heels of this legislative decision (between the two factions), there appeared amongst the ranks of ‘Alee’s army some who opposed this decision. This opposition eventually ended up in their disobedience to the ruler and their rebelling against him. Rather, it even led them to declare ‘Alee رضي الله عنه a disbeliever as well as anyone that agreed with his decision. And they raised high their slogan: “There is no rule except for that of Allaah’s.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee رضي الله عنه tried to reconcile with them by presenting them with arguments and proofs, and some of them returned back due to Ibn ‘Abbaas رضي الله عنه debating with them. So when the advice was not accepted by the remaining individuals that persisted in their rejection and fanaticism, ‘Alee mobilized against them and fought them. [4] This was known as the <strong>battle of Nahrawaan</strong>. ‘Alee رضي الله عنه was able to annihilate all of them except for a small portion among them that escaped to other lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After ‘Alee was murdered at the hands of some members from the Khawaarij, the danger of the Khawaarij increased. The scattered remnants of their army joined forces and spread their poison to the youth of the ummah to the point that they took on the shape of a force within the Islamic state that threatened its security and the security of the unified body of Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This group did not cease attacking the Muslims from that time until now, as the Prophet صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم informed us. And they give themselves misleading names, when in reality they are just extensions of the first Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this current time, there have appeared many groups [5] that have adopted the ways and methods of the Khawaarij, and they have accepted many of their ideas and principles. [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] This is one of the beneficial additions from Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan.<br />
[4] So ‘Alee رضي الله عنه did not fight them first, rather, it was only until they first shed innocent blood and commenced fighting with him.<br />
[5] Such as the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer wal-Hijrah, the Jamaa’ah Tawaqquf wa Tabayyun and other groups.<br />
[6] Such as deeming it permissible to shed unlawful blood and take unlawful wealth under the pretense of Takfeer. This refers to the rebellious and military groups..</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>The following is posted from : <strong><a title="Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf – Ahmad Ash-Shihhee" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/10/01/magnificent-points-of-advice-for-those-who-have-turned-to-the-way-of-the-salaf-ahmad-ash-shihhee/">Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf </a></strong>– Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad Ash-Shihhee. This book was read to Allaamaah Rabee’ al-Madkhalee who gave some good instructions regarding it.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>The First Advice: Praise and Thank Allaah for Granting you this Blessing</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is since it is indeed a tremendous blessing, which Allaah bestows on whom He wills from His servants. So act well in showing thanks for it and in using it. And remember:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">How many people are there that are submerged in misconceptions? One misconception drives him to the east while another drives him to the west – he doesn’t know how to free himself from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And how many people are there that are immersed in vain desires, being imprisoned by them and not knowing when he will be set free?</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So give thanks to Allaah, O repentant one, and know that this blessing comes from Allaah alone. You had no will or might in the matter, except due to Allaah, the Most Kind, the All Aware.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was the One who was kind to you and guided you and did not cause you to die while you were immersed in misconceptions and vain desires. So to Him belongs the Praise in this world and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He was the One who directed you and facilitated for you the way to those who directed you towards the methodology of the Salaf as-Saalih. So how numerous are the blessings He has bestowed upon you and me. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“And if you were to count the blessings of Allaah, you would never be able to account for all of them.”</span></strong> [Surah Ibraaheem: 34]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So beware, beware, O my brother who has repented, of falling into self-amazement and self-delusion, or of considering yourself above Allaah’s blessing. Allaah says:<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> “You were the same before, until Allaah bestowed His blessing on you.”</strong></span> [Surah An-Nisaa: 94]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And beware, beware of ridiculing or mocking others, such as those who are afflicted with that which Allaah freed you from. Instead, praise Allaah that He saved you and did not test you with what He is testing them. And when you see one of these people who are afflicted (with misconceptions and vain desires) say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“All praise be to Allaah who saved me from what you are being afflicted by and who blessed me over many of those whom He created.”</span></strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Show compassion for them and be merciful to them. And present to them what Allaah has given you from good and guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And know, may Allaah grant you success, that you must follow the means that will ensure the correctness of your repentance with seriousness, eagerness, honesty and sincerity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#808080;">[4] Reported by At-Tirmidhee in his Jaami&#8217; from the narration of Abu Hurairah, radyAllaahu &#8216;anhu. In its chain of narration is found ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Umar al-&#8216;Umaree, who is weak. However, the hadeeth has supporting witnesses (from other narrations), which strengthen it to the grade of “hasan, due to other narrations.</span></em></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is posted from : <strong><a title="Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf – Ahmad Ash-Shihhee" href="https://abdurrahmanorg.wordpress.com/2014/10/01/magnificent-points-of-advice-for-those-who-have-turned-to-the-way-of-the-salaf-ahmad-ash-shihhee/">Magnificent Points of Advice for those who have turned to the Way of the Salaf </a></strong>– Abu ‘Abdillaah Ahmad bin Muhammad Ash-Shihhee. This book was read to Allaamaah Rabee&#8217; al-Madkhalee who gave some good instructions regarding it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Fourth Advice: Do not take Knowledge except from one who is known to be upon the Sunnah</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Muhammad bin Sireen (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<span style="color:#008000;">Verily, this knowledge is Religion. So look into (i.e. investigate) whom you take your Religion from</span>.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he said: <span style="color:#008000;">“They (the Sahaabah) did not used to ask concerning the isnaad (chain of narration), but when the fitnah occurred, they began saying: ‘Name your men for us.&#8217; So the People of the Sunnah would be looked to and so their hadeeth would be accepted. And the People of Innovation would be looked to and so their hadeeth would not be accepted.&#8221;</span> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when one of these repentant individuals neglects these principles and guidelines, he becomes an open target for these misconceptions and he becomes a play object for many of those who (falsely) ascribe themselves to knowledge and Salafiyyah. So all it takes is for a person to claim knowledge or manifest his connection to the scholars from Ahlus-Sunnah, and you will find the repentant youth flocking around him, without thoroughly examining the reality of his condition and without looking into his history (i.e. background). But When he sees that his followers have become many and those who love him have become engrossed with him, he begins to reveal what he was concealing and what (way) he really inclined to. So now you see him calling to (holding) leadership in the field of Da&#8217;wah and pitching a tent for gathering everyone (i.e. regardless of beliefs). Or you see him doing other things that are in opposition to the principles of Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the point where the repentant individuals begin to become confused and divided into two or even three categories &#8211; those who agree, those who are against and those who are neutral. This confusion only comes about due to two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: The repentant individual&#8217;s lack of devoting attention to beneficial knowledge, especially knowledge of the Fundamentals of Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jamaa&#8217;ah, since Knowledge protects the one who has it from deviations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Did you not see how knowledge protected Abu Bakrah (rady Alllaahu &#8216;anhu) in the Campaign of the Camel (Jamal),[9] when the people put the Mother of the Believers, ‘Aa&#8217;ishah (rady Allaahu &#8216;anhaa) forth (for the campaign). So what protected Abu Bakrah (rady Allaahu anhu) was a hadeeth he heard from Allaah&#8217;s Messenger, who said when news reached him of the death of Kisraa and the appointment of his daughter (as the leader): “A people that leave their affairs to be governed by a woman will never prosper.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So When the fitnah occurred, Abu Bakrah remembered this hadeeth and it protected him from that, such that he said: “Allaah protected me with something that I heard from the Messenger of Allaah When Kisraa died. He (sallAllaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said: Who did they put to succeed her?&#8217; They said: &#8216;Her daughter.&#8217; So he (sall Allaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8216;A people that leave their affairs to be governed by a woman Will never prosper.&#8217; So when &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah approached, i.e. Basrah, I remembered the statement of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger and so Allaah protected me by it.&#8221; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: A lack or returning to the People Of Knowledge, Since the most deserving to be asked are the People of Knowledge and their students from Ahlus-Sunnah wal- Jamaa&#8217;ah, those who have knowledge of this individual whom the people seek to study under. so this person Should be enquired into:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is he from the Salafee students of knowledge or not?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And did he undergo valid educational studies, Such that he has the right to be sought knowledge from or no?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">SO if the answer is in the negative, then the issue comes to an end, all praise be to Allaah. And if the answer is positive, then he can be Studied under and benefited from, but without going to extremes in that matter. Rather, he should be given his due place and status.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an important point, which is: Differentiating between the enlightened Scholars, those Who are referred to in issues related to knowledge and current events, such as the two Imaams, Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee and ‘AbduI-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin Baaz (rahimahumaAllaa) and those enlightened scholars Who remained after them, such as the Mashaayikh, Muhammad bin Saalih Al-‘Uthaymeen, Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee, our Shaikh, Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee and others who are at their level amongst the people Of knowledge and fatwaa from AhlusSunnah waI-Jamaa&#8217;ah. So these individuals have their own level and position&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And between the prominent students of knowledge, whose knowIedge is known and whose following of the Sunnah is apparent by way of their books and the commendations of the scholars for them. SO these individuals also have their own level and position&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And between those who are less than them, from the students of knowledge, Whose Salafiyyah is Known and Whose ability to teach is recognized.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[8] These last two narrations were reported by Imaam Muslim in his Introduction to his Saheeh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[9] Translator&#8217;s Note: The Campaign of the Camel occurred after the murder of Uthmaan, radyAlllaahu &#8216;anhu. when there was much turmoil amongst the Muslims. ‘Alee bin Abee Taalib radullaahu &#8216;anhu was given the bav&#8217;ah (oath of allegiance) as the succeeding Khaleefih and he decided to wait for the turmoil to simmer down before seeking revenge from the assassin of ‘Uthmaan. So the Muslims Were divided into those who were With him on this decision and those Who wanted justice for his murder right away. A group was formed to go and voice their case to ‘Alee and they rallied several of the Sahaabah including ‘Aa‘isha radhi Allaahu &#8216;anhaa‘ So she participated in the campaign riding on a camel (hence the name Jamal). When the parties at Basrah, a peaceful agreement was decided, yet due to some misunderstanding and confusion battle broke out and many lives were lost. And Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[10] Reported by Al-Bukhaaree (7099), An-Nasaa‘ee (5403) and At-Tirmidhee (2365), and the wording mentioned here belongs to him.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">So O you human being, who stands in need and who was created for a tremendous matter, you for whom the Hellfire and the Gardens of Bliss were created, if you devote your attention to the <strong>musical instruments</strong> with your ears; and you <strong>look at what Allaah forbade</strong> with your eyes; and you <strong>eat doubtful matters</strong> with your mouth, allowing them to enter your stomach; and you are pleased with yourself <strong>dancing and swaying</strong>; and you waste all of your precious time engaged in these despicable acts; and you throw away your life, which has no value, in trying to attain these condemnable things; and you busy your body, which was created for worship, with that which Allaah forbade for His servants; and you <strong>sit in the gathering of the people of falsehood</strong>; and you perform the acts of the sinners and the ignorant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You will come to know, when the cover has been lifted, and the Command (of Allaah) comes to pass, what will befall you from regret on the Day when you see the positions of those who have preceded (you) and the reward of those who did good deeds. While you will be with those who were left behind, the squanderers, and you will be counted as being in the company of the people of falsehood, the neglectful. You have stopped proceeding, the pains have befallen you, and your regrets have become tremendous. For on that Day, the one who cries will not be shown mercy, nor will the one who complains be listened to. Nor will the one who regrets be comforted. Nor will anyone be saved from the Torment of Allaah except for he who is granted mercy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allaah awaken you and us from the sleep of heedlessness, and may He enable you and us to perform what He created us for (i.e. worship), by His mercy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the statement of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Islaam began as something strange and will return to being strange, as it began</strong>&#8220;,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Imaam Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee</strong></span> (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;As for this, then it does not mean that Islaam will go away, but rather it means that the Ahl-us-Sunnah [21] will go away, up to the point that there will not remain in a land, any from them except one person.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on this understanding, there can be found in the statements of the Salaf much praise for the Sunnah and their describing it as being strange, and describing its adherents and followers as being few.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Hasan Al-Basree (rahimahullaah)</strong> </span>used to say to his companions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Oh Ahl-us-Sunnah! Be gentle with one another and may Allaah have mercy on you. For indeed, you are from amongst the fewest of people.&#8221; [22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Yoonus Ibn &#8216;Ubayd (rahimahullaah)</strong></span> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There is not a thing more stranger than the Sunnah. And what is more stranger than it, is the one who knows it.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Sufyaan Ath-Thawree (rahimahullaah)</strong></span> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Treat the Ahl-us-Sunnah kindly, for verily, they are strangers.&#8221; [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The understanding of the term &#8220;Sunnah&#8221; to these scholars, was the way of the Prophet &#8211; that which he and his companions were upon &#8211; free from <strong>Doubts (Ash-Shubuhaat)</strong> and <strong>Desires (Ash-Shahawaat)</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, Al-Fudayl Ibn Tyaad (rahimahullaah) used to say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Ahl-us-Sunnah is he who knows what is entering his stomach from the halaal&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is because the consumption of halaal is from the greatest aspects of the Sunnah, which the Prophet and his companions were upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then it remained the custom of the majority of the later scholars, from the scholars of hadeeth and other fields, that the Sunnah consisted of what was free from Doubts in regards to Creed. This was especially the case with issues such as the belief in Allaah, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Last Day, and other issues such as Al-Qadar (Divine Pre-Ordainment) and the merits of the Sahaabah. They compiled literary works concerning this knowledge and named them books of &#8220;Sunnah&#8221;. This knowledge was only labeled with the name &#8220;Sunnah&#8221;, because its significance was tremendous and all those who opposed it were on the brink of destruction.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the complete Sunnah, then it is the path that is free and safe from Doubts and Desires, as has been stated by Al-Hasan, Yoonus Ibn &#8216;Ubayd, Sufyaan, Al-Fudayl and others besides them. Due to this, its adherents are described as strange because of their small number and rarity in the Last Days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why it has been mentioned in some of the previously stated reports that they are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> &#8220;A righteous people surrounded by people abounding in much evil. Those who disobey them are greater in number than those who obey them.&#8221;</strong> [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this is an indication of the smallness of their amount in number and in the amount of those who answer and accept their call. We also are made aware of the greatness in number of those who oppose them and disobey them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why it is reported in numerous ahaadeeth, praise for the one who sticks firmly to his Religion during the Last Days. And that he who does so will be like one who holds tightly onto hot pieces of coal. <strong>And that the one who acts upon it, will receive fifty times the reward more than those before him</strong>. [25] This is because he will not find any supporters in doing good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>These strangers are of two categories</strong>: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of them are those <strong>who rectify themselves</strong> when the people have become corrupt.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second category contains those <strong>who rectify what the people have corrupted of the Sunnah</strong>. And this (latter one) is the most highest and virtuous of the two categories.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] What is meant by the term Ahl-us-Sunnah are all the Muslims who strictly follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Muhammad. They learn it, act upon it, enforce it and teach it to others. They consist of the scholars, their students and those that follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] This report was recorded by Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee. Badr Al-Badr indicated its weakness in his notes to Kashf-ul- Kurbah. However, a similar narration to this one has been recorded by Ad-Daarimee (1/72) and its wording is: &#8220;For verily, Ahl-us-Sunnah are the least of people in number who have preceded, and they are the least of people in number who remain.&#8221; This narration is authentic. See Dr. Nasr Al-&#8216;Aql&#8217;s book Maflioom Ahl-is- Sunnati wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah (pg. 84)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] This narration was recorded by Al-Laalikaa&#8217;ee in his Sharh Usool &#8216;Itiqaad Ahl-is-Sunnah (1/64) and it was mentioned from him by Ibn Al-Jawzee in Talbees Iblees. Dr. Nasr Al-&#8216;Aql mentioned it in his book Mafhoom Ahl-is-Sunnati wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah (pg. 85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24] Musnad Ahmad (2/177) and its checking has been stated previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25] This saying is based on the following hadeeth of the Prophet: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Verily, after you there will come times requiring patience. (In those days) the one who holds fast to that which you are upon will have the reward of fifty amongst you. He will receive the reward of fifty (i.e. the one holding onto the way of the companions in later times)</strong></span>.&#8221; Reported by Al-Marwazee in As-Sunnah (no. 35), At-Tabaraanee in Al-Kabeer (17/117), Abu Dawood in his Sunan (no. 3441), At-Tirmidhee (no. 3057), who declared it saheeh, and Ibn Maajah (no. 4014). Imaam Al-Albaanee authenticated it in As-Saheehah (no. 494)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth: An Upright Heart</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The heart is the container where knowledge is stored. If the container is firm, it will store and protect what is placed in it, and if the container is damaged, it will lose what is placed in it.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه و سلم)&nbsp;made the heart the foundation of everything, as he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily, there is a morsel of flesh in the body that if it is correct, the entire body will be correct, and if it is corrupt, the entire body will be corrupt. Indeed, it is the heart.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An upright heart comes about through <strong>awareness of Allaah and knowledge of His Names, Attributes and Actions</strong>. It also comes about by way of <strong>reflecting on His signs and creations</strong>, and by <strong>pondering on the Qur&#8217;aan</strong>. An upright heart also comes about due to one constantly <strong>prostrating (in prayer)</strong> and frequently observing the <strong>night prayer</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should also avoid the things that corrupt and sicken the heart, since if these things are present in the heart, it will not be able to carry the knowledge. And even if the heart does carry it, it will not be understood, as Allaah says about the hypocrites &#8211; those with diseased hearts:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">They have heart with which they do not comprehend.</span>&#8221; [Surah Al-Araaf: 179]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The diseases of the heart are of two types: <strong>Desires</strong> and <strong>Doubts</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Desires are such as love for this worldly life and its pleasures and being preoccupied with that; love for unlawful images; listening to unlawful things such as musical voices and instruments; and looking at the forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Doubts are such as corrupt beliefs; innovated actions; and ascribing to innovated ideological movements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some other diseases of the heart that also serve as obstacles before knowledge are: jealousy, spite and pride.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some other things that corrupt the heart are: excessive sleep, excessive speech and excessive eating.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, one should avoid these diseases and corruptors in order to rectify the heart and make it upright.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[The madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessnessThe madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa'ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessness.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessnessThe madh-hab of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessness. It is moderateness amidst the extremist fanatics who elevate the esteemed ones amongst them to a level that is only befitting for Allaah or for His messengers and moderateness amidst the heedless and harsh ones who belittle and revile them. So they are in the middle between those who are excessive and those who fall short &#8211; they love all of them and put each one of them in the due place that they deserve, with fairness and justice. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So they do not elevate them to a level they don&#8217;t deserve, nor do they belittle them, taking away what they are worthy of</strong></span>. Their tongues are moist with mentioning them only in good, according to what is befitting for them. And their hearts are filled with love for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatever disputes and differences that occurred between (some of) them, that can be authentically confirmed, we hold that they were Mujtahideen in that regard &#8211; either they were correct and will receive one reward for their Ijtihaad and one reward for being correct, or they were wrong and will receive just one reward for their Ijtihaad while their error will be forgiven. They were not infallible since they were human beings. At times they were correct and at times they erred. But how much more were they correct as compared to others being correct, and how fewer were their errors as compared to the errors of others? And on top of this, they will receive Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The books of Ahl-us-Sunnah are filled with a clarification of this pure and radiant Creed concerning these elite people, who were chosen amongst mankind to accompany the best of mankind (صلى الله عليه و سلم). May Allaah be pleased with them all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An example of this is the statement of <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>At-Tahaawee</strong> </span>in his (book on the) Creed of Ahl- us-Sunnah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;We love the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. But we do not go to extremes in our love for anyone amongst them, nor do we absolve ourselves from any of them. And we hate anyone that hates them or anyone that talks about them in a bad way. And we do not mention them except with good. Loving them is Deen (Religion), Eemaan (Faith) and Ihsaan (Goodness) and hating them is Kufr (Disbelief), Nifaaq (hypocrisy) and Tughyaan (transgression).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Imaam Ahmad bin Hanbal</strong></span> said in his book as-Sunnah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And from the Sunnah is mentioning the good qualities of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger &#8211; all of them &#8211; and to refrain from (speaking about) what disputes occurred between them. <strong>So whoever reviles the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger or (just) one of them, then he is an innovator, a Raafidee</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#339966;"><strong>Loving them is a Sunnah and making du&#8217;aa (supplication) for them is a means of getting close to Allaah (taqarrub). Following them is a means and taking from their example is a virtue&#8230;</strong></span>&#8220;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger are trustworthy based on Allaah&#8217;s testifying that for them and because of His praise for them and the praise of His Messenger (صلى الله عليه و سلم) for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>An-Nawawee said in at-Taqreeb</strong></span>, which As-Suyootee explained in his Tadreeb-ur-Raawee:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;All of the Companions are trustworthy &#8211; those who were involved in the afflictions (fitan) and other than them &#8211; according to the consensus of the scholars.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr</strong></span> said in al-lsaabah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Ahl-us-Sunnah have unanimously agreed that all of them (the Sahaabah) are trustworthy and no one opposed this except some deviants amongst the innovators.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why there is no harm in not knowing a Companion in a chain of narration. So if a Taabi&#8217;ee says: &#8220;On the authority of a man who accompanied the Prophet&#8230;&#8221; this does not affect the report. This is because not knowing the Companions (in the chain) causes no harm since they are all trustworthy.</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee</strong></span> said in his book al-Kifaayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Every hadeeth that has a chain of narration that is connected between the one who reported it and the Prophet is not to be acted upon until first having affirmed the trustworthiness and reliability of all the narrators (in the chain). It is an obligation to investigate all of their conditions, except for the Sahaabee (Companion) who raises it (or attributes the hadeeth) to the Prophet. This is because the trustworthiness of the Companions is established and well known based on Allaah&#8217;s affirming that for them, His informing us of their pure state and His preference of them in the texts of the Qur&#8217;aan&#8230;&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he (rahimahullaah) went on to list some ayaat and ahaadeeth concerning their virtues and said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And even if Allaah or His Messenger had not mentioned anything about them from what we just stated now (of their virtues), the condition they were upon of having made Hijrah, fought in Jihaad, of having offered their support, sacrificed their lives and wealth, experienced the killings of their parents and children, of mutually advising for the Religion and having strong Faith and unshakeable certainty, (all of this) would be enough to prove their trustworthiness and enough for one to have firm faith in their honesty and integrity. And it would necessitate the understanding that they are the best from those who receive testimony and approval as to their trustworthiness and reliability from all of the people that will come after them forever and ever.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[8] Question: </b>Noble Shaikh, what is the ruling on one who recites the Qur’aan whilst not having wudoo, regardless of whether he recites from memory or from the <i>mus-haf?</i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>[8] Answer: </b>It is permissible for a person to recite the Qur’aan without having wudoo if he recites from his memory. This is since nothing prevented the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) from reciting the Qur’aan <span style="color:#993300;">except for <i>Janaabah</i></span> (sexual impurity). He (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) would recite the Qur’aan whilst in a state of wudoo and without it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <i>mus-haf</i>, it is not permissible for someone who has broken his wudoo to touch it, regardless of whether it is the minor form of impurity or the major form. Allaah says: <b>“No one touches it except for the pure.”</b> [Surah Al-Waaqi’ah: 79] This means: “Those who are pure and free from impurities, uncleanness and Shirk.” Also in the hadeeth, the Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) wrote a letter to his vice-regent ‘Amr bin Hazm in which he instructed him: <b>“No one should touch the mus-haf except for the purified.” </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also the view that has been unanimously agreed upon by the four Imaams – that it is not permissible for one in the state of impurity – whether major or minor state – to touch the <i>mus-haf </i>except from behind a covering, such as when the <i>mus-haf</i> is in a box or a bag or if one touches it using one’s garment or sleeve as a barrier.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) has forbidden us from certain types of business transactions due to what they contain from sinful means of earning and what is found in them from dangers to mankind and the taking of wealth unjustly. From these types of prohibited transactions are:</p>
<p><strong>When the buying and selling keeps one preoccupied from performing worship</strong> , i.e. they take away from the time of the worship, such as when a person is busy buying and selling and holds back from praying in congregation in the masjid, to the point that he misses it or misses part of it. This is forbidden. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, when the prayer is called for on the Day of Jumu’ah, then rush to the Remembrance of Allaah and leave off the trading (commerce). That is better for you if you did but know. So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty and remember Allaah much in order that you may be successful.”</span> </em>[Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 9-10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says in another ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“O you who believe! Do not let you wealth or your children divert you from the Remembrance of Allaah. And whoever does that, then such are the losers.” </em></span>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Take note of Allaah’s saying: <strong>“…then such are the losers.” </strong>He rules upon them that they are losers even though they may be wealthy, having amassed hoards of money even if they may have many children.This is because their wealth and their children cannot replace what they missed out on from the Remembrance of Allaah. So even if they gain a profit or earn income in this world, they will still be losers in every sense of the word. They can only be profiting in reality if they combine between these two good things. If they were to combine between the seeking of sustenance and the worship of Allaah, by buying and selling when it is time for buying and selling and attending the prayer when it is time for prayer, then they would have combined between the good of this life and the good of the Hereafter. And they would have acted on Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"> “So seek your provision from Allaah and worship Him (alone)”</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em> “So when the prayer is finished then spread throughout the land and seek from Allaah’s Bounty.”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, commerce is of two types – <strong>the commerce of the worldly life and the commerce of the next life (Hereafter)</strong>. The commerce of this life is with wealth and with earnings while the commerce of the next life is with righteous actions. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe, shall I not direct you to a trade (i.e. commerce) that will save you from a painful punishment? Believe in Allaah and His Messenger and strive hard and fight in the Cause of Allaah with your wealth and your lives. That will be better for you, if you but knew! (If you do so), He will forgive you your sins and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow and pleasant dwellings in the gardens of ‘Adan (i.e. Paradise). That is indeed the great success. And He will also give you another (blessing), which you will love – help from Allaah and a near victory. So give glad tidings to the believers.”</span></em><strong><em> </em></strong>[Surah As-Saff: 10-13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the immense commerce, which is profitable. So if the permissible commerce of this worldly life is attached to it, it becomes good upon good. But if a person limits his commerce to solely that of this worldly life while abandoning the commerce of the Hereafter, he becomes a loser, as Allaah says: <strong>“…then such are the losers.”</strong>[Surah Al-Munaafiqoon: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, if a person were to turn his attention to performing worship and establishing the prayer, and if were to remember Allaah much, by doing what Allaah commanded him to do, Allaah would surely open the doors of sustenance for him. As a matter of fact, the prayer is a means for attaining sustenance (<em>rizq</em>), as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“And command your family with prayer and be patient in offering them. We are not asking you to provide Us with sustenance (rizq). (Rather), We will provide for you and the good end is for those who have Taqwaa.” </em></span>[Surah TaHa: 132]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the prayer, which some people claim takes time away from them seeking after the <em>rizq </em>(sustenance) and from buying and selling, is in fact the opposite of what they claim. It opens for them the door of provision, comfort and blessing. This is because the sustenance (<em>rizq</em>) is in the Hand of Allaah. So if you were to turn your attention towards remembering Him and worshipping Him, He would facilitate and open the door of sustenance for you. <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>“And Allaah is the best of Providers.” </strong></span>[Surah Al-Jumu’ah: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says, describing the worship of the believers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“In houses (masaajid), which Allaah has ordered to be raised, and in which His name is mentioned. He is glorified therein during the mornings and the evenings. (They are) Men whom neither business nor commerce diverts them away from the Remembrance of Allaah, nor from performing the Prayer or giving the Zakaat. They fear a day when the hearts and the eyes will be overturned out of fear (of the horrors of the Day of Judgement).”</span> </em>[Surah An-Noor: 36-37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In explanation of this ayah, some of the Salaf said: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“They (the Sahaabah) would buy and sell, but when one of them heard the mua’dhin calling to prayer, and the scale was still in his hand, he would drop the scale and head out for the prayer.”</strong></span> So as stated before, the point is that if the buying and selling preoccupies you from performing your prayer, then this commerce is forbidden and futile. And the money earned from it is Haraam (unlawful) and filthy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">The Book of Knowledge Of the Imaam, the Haafidh: Abu Khaithama Zuhair Ibn Harb An-Nasaa’ee</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Checking and Notes by:Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Translation by:isma’eel alarcon &#8211; al-ibaanah.com</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>INTRODUCTION TO THE BOOK</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is for Allaah and may His peace and blessings be on the Final Messenger, his family and those who follow him in goodness until the Day of Judgement. To Proceed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are pleased to present this, our seventh E-Book, entitled: “<strong>The Book of Knowledge</strong>” &#8211; a complete translation of the classical work “<strong>Kitaab-ul-‘Ilm</strong>” of Imaam Abu Khaithama An-Nasaa’ee (rahimahullaah). This treatise is comprised of a collection of ahaadeeth (sayings of the Prophet) and athaar (sayings of the Salaf) on the subject of Islaamic Knowledge. By reading the various narrations, it is hoped that the reader will benefit and reflect on the merits and virtues of seeking, acquiring and teaching knowledge. The treatise also provides a first-hand look on how the Salaf’s attitude was with respect to knowledge – how they sought it, how they learned it and how they taught it to others. There are several narrations, also, that give us a description of the characteristics of some of the Salaf, their knowledge and their virtues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, this treatise is of the utmost importance, as it provides the reader with an account of the Salaf &#8211; those whom we are obligated to follow and take their example. And it deals with one of the most important topics in Islaam, which is Knowledge, since knowledge is the foundation that is required before doing all sayings and actions. Al-Haafidh Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Barr said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;The scholars have unanimously agreed that there is from knowledge that which is a specified obligation upon every individual with respect to himself (fard ‘ayn) and that which is a collective obligation (fard kifaayah) – if someone rises to fulfill it, its obligation becomes withdrawn from the remaining people of that area.&#8221;</strong></span> [3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Qudaamah said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;As for knowledge of the Religion, all of it is praiseworthy. It is divided into <em>usool</em> (fundamental issues), <em>furoo</em>&#8216; (subsidiary issues), <em>muqaddimaat</em> (introductory knowledge) and <em>mutammimaat</em> (complementary knowledge). The usool consist of the Book of Allaah, the Sunnah of the Prophet, the consensus of the Muslim scholars and the narrations of the Sahaabah. The furoo’ consist of what is understood from these fundamental sources from the meanings that are perceived by the intellect, such that what is understood from it is something other than the written wording.”</strong></span> [4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The treatise has been verified by the great scholar of our time, Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen AlAlbaanee. He has provided gradings for many of the narrations as well as notes and commentaries that give an explanation for some of these narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah that He make this present E-Book a source of benefit for its readers and a source of guidance for those who act upon what is in it.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy<br />
And my success is due to none but Allaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaikh, the Imaam, the &#8216;Aalim (scholar), the Zaahid (ascetic) &#8216;Izz-ud-Deen Abul-Hasan &#8216;Alee Ibn Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Kareem Al-Juzree – may Allaah support him – informed us in the month of Ramadaan of the year 614H in the city of Mausil (In northern &#8216;Iraq) from the home of his brother, saying: The Shaikh, the Imaam, the &#8216;Aalim Majd-ud-Deen Abul-Faraj Yahyaa Ibn Mahmood Ibn Sa&#8217;ad Al-Asfahaanee informed us, saying: The Shaikh, the Imaam Abul-Fath Isma&#8217;eel Ibn Al-Fadl Ibn Ahmad Ibn Al-Akh-sheed As-Sarraaj informed us in the year 518H and in the year 522H, saying: Shaikh Abu Taahir Muhammad Ibn Ahmad Ibn &#8216;Abd-ir-Raheem informed us, saying: Abu Hafs &#8216;Umar Ibn Ibraaheem Al-Kitaanee Al-Muqree informed us, saying: Abul-Qaasim &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Muhammad &#8216;Abdul-&#8216; Azeez Al-Baghawee informed us that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Abu Khaithama Zuhair Ibn Harb narrated to us, saying: Wakee&#8217; reported to us, saying: Al-A&#8217;amash reported to us from Tameem Ibn Salamah from Abu &#8216;Ubaidah that he said: ‘Abdullaah [Ibn Mas’ood] (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Aspire to become a scholar or a student of knowledge, and do not aspire to become anything other than that.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Ishaaq Ibn Sulaimaan Ar-Raazee stated: I heard Handhala report from ‘Awn Ibn ‘Abdillaah that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“I said to ‘Umar Bin ‘Abd-il-‘Azeez: ‘It was said (to me): If you are able to be a scholar, then be a scholar. And if you are not able to do so, then be a student of knowledge. And if you are not able to be a student of knowledge, then love them. And if you can’t love them, then do not hate them.’ </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So ‘Umar said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">‘SubhaanAllaah! (Glory be to Allaah!) Allaah has indeed made a way out for this person.’”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Jareer reported to us from Al-A&#8217;amash from Tameem Ibn Salamah from Abu &#8216;Ubaidah that he said: ‘Abdullaah [Ibn Mas&#8217;ood] (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Whosoever Allaah intends to do good for, He gives him understanding of the Religion.”</strong></span> [5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Mu&#8217;awiyah Ibn &#8216;Amr reported to us, saying that Zaa&#8217;idah reported from Al-A&#8217;amash from Tameem Ibn Salamah from Abu &#8216;Ubaidah on the authority of ‘Abdullaah [Ibn Mas&#8217;ood] that he (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“O people, learn! Then whoever learns, must act (upon what he knows).”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Sufyaan Ibn &#8216;Uyainah reported to us on the authority of &#8216;Aasim Ibn Abee An-Najood on Zur Ibn Hubaish that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“I went to Safwaan Ibn ‘Assaal Al-Muraadee, so he said: ‘What did you come for?’ I said: ‘In search of knowledge.’ So he said: ‘Verily, the angels lower their wings for the seeker of knowledge, out of contentment for what he seeks.’”</span></strong> [6]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Abu Khaithama reported to us, saying: Muhammad Ibn Khaazim reported to us, saying: Al-A&#8217;amash reported to us from Shimr from Sa&#8217;eed Ibn Jubair on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbaas (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Indeed, every creature, even the fish in the sea, asks forgiveness for the one who educates people about the good (i.e. Islaam).” [7]</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn Mahdee reported to us, saying Bishr Ibn Mansoor reported to us from Thawr from ‘Abd-ul-‘Azeez Ibn Adh-Dhibyaan that he said: &#8216;Eesaa Ibn Maryam said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>‘Whosoever learns, then knows, then acts, then this is considered something grand in the kingdom of the heavens.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying Muhammad Ibn Khaazim reported to us, saying: Al-A&#8217;amash reported to us from Shaqeeq from ‘Abdullaah [Ibn Mas&#8217;ood] (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Learn, for indeed none of you knows when he will be needed by the people.”</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Mu&#8217;aadh Ibn Mu&#8217;aadh reported to us, saying: Ibn &#8216;Awn reported to us from Al-Ahnaf that he said: ‘Umar [Ibn Al-Khattaab] (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Acquire understanding (of the Religion) before you are given positions of authority (for then it will be too late).”</strong> </span>[8]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Muhammad Ibn Khaazim reported to us, saying: Al- A&#8217;amash reported to us from Shaqeeq from ‘Abdullaah [Ibn Mas&#8217;ood] (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“By Allaah, any individual that issues a ruling (fatwa) to the people for every matter they ask him of, is truly insane.” </span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Al-A&#8217;amash (one of the narrators) said: “Al-Hakam said to me:</p>
<p>‘Had I heard this hadeeth from you yesterday, I would not have issued fataawaa (on that day) for much of the instances in which I did issue fataawaa.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Muhammad Ibn Khaazim reported to us, saying: Al- A&#8217;amash reported to us from Rajaa Al-Ansaaree from &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn Bishr Al-Azraq that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Two men entered from the gates of Kinda while Abu Mas&#8217;ood Al-Ansaaree was sitting in a gathering. One of the two men said: &#8216;Is there any man here that can judge between us?&#8217; A man from the gathering said: &#8216;I can.&#8217; So Abu Mas&#8217;ood grabbed a handful of pebbles and struck him with it. Then he said to him: &#8216;Indeed, it used to be hated that one would rush to give a ruling.'&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Muhammad Ibn Khaazim reported to us, saying: Al- A&#8217;amash reported to us from Saalih Ibn Khibaab from Husayn Ibn &#8216;Uqbah that Salmaan (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Knowledge that is not spoken of is like a treasure that is not spent.”</span></strong> [9]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Jareer reported to us from Al-A&#8217;amash who said: It has reached me that Mutarrif Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Ibn Ash-Shikheer said:</p>
<blockquote>

He did not leave behind him anyone equal to him. And what is remarkable is that he preferred Ibn Jubair over himself. I will inform you about that. Indeed he was born to a family with much knowledge in their household, so he took hold of that understanding. Then he sat with us and memorized the best of our hadeeth (and combined that) with the understanding of the members of his household. So who can equal himself to him?'&#8221;</span></strong></p>

I did not leave from Egypt until I thought that there was no knowledge within it except that I had heard it. Then I went to Al-Madeenah. And I did not leave from there until I thought that there was no knowledge within it, except that I had heard it. Then I met Ash-Sha&#8217;bee and I did not see the likes of him (before).

When I lifted my head, he (Salmaan) said: ‘O brother of the tribe of ‘Abas! Go back and drink again.’ So I sat down and drank again even though I did not want to do so, yet I hated to disobey him. Then he said to me: ‘How much do you estimate to have deducted from it (the river)?’ So I said: ‘May Allaah have mercy on you! Is it possible that my drinking can deduct anything from it?

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8216;O people, fear Allaah! Whoever amongst you knows something then let him speak concerning what he has knowledge of. And whoever does not know then let him say, Allaah knows best. For indeed it is the best form of knowledge for one of you to say, concerning things he has no knowledge of: Allaah knows best. Verily Allaah has said to His Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam): &#8216;Say: I do not ask you for any reward for this (Qur&#8217;aan), nor am I from the pretenders.&#8217; [Surat-un-Nisaa: 86]&#8221;</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I heard a shaikh (and then I described him, so they said that he was Abu Damurah) [68] say: &#8216;I saw Hamaad writing in the presence of Ibraaheem who was wearing a garment from Anbijaan and saying: &#8216;By Allaah, we do not desire the worldly life by this (garment).'&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">152. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Wakee&#8217; reported to us, saying: Al-Hakam Ibn ‘Atiyyah reported to us, saying: (Muhammad) Ibn Sireen said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“They used to hold the opinion that the Children of Israa’eel were only misguided because of the writings that were passed down to them.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">153. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Wakee&#8217; reported to us from Talha Ibn Yahyaa on the authority of Abu Burdah that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I wrote a book on the authority of my father from what he disclosed to me (i.e. he compiled a book from hadeeth reported to him by his father). So he called for a wash basin, placed my books in it and washed them (i.e. erased what was in them).&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">154. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Wakee&#8217; reported to us from &#8216;Imraan Ibn Hudair69 from Abu Mujliz on the authority of Basheer Ibn Naheek that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;I recorded a collection (of hadeeth) from Abu Hurairah. Then when I desired to part from him, I said &#8216;O Abu Hurairah! I recorded a book (of hadeeth) from you, so shall I narrate them on your authority.&#8217; He said: &#8216;Yes, narrate on my authority.'&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">155. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Jareer reported to us from Mugheerah from Ibraaheem that he said: ‘Abdullaah (Ibn Mas&#8217;ood) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Indeed, you will never cease to be upon good so long as the knowledge remains with the elders. For when the knowledge is with the youth, the one who is older in age while reject learning from the youth out of pride.”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">156. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Al-Fadl Ibn Dukeen reported to us, saying: Al-A&#8217;amash reported to us from Ibraaheem on the authority of ‘Alqamah that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“Whatever I heard as a youth, it is as if I am looking at it written on a piece or a sheet of paper (right now).”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">157. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan Ibn Mahdee reported to us from &#8216;Abdul-&#8216; Azeez Ibn Abee Rawwaad on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Ubaid70 that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Knowledge is the goal of the believer. Every time he attains some aspect from it, he embraces and takes hold of it, and (then) seeks after another goal.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">158. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Jareer reported to us from Mansoor from Ibraaheem (An- Nakha’ee) that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;They (the Salaf) used to hate that people would walk behind them.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">159. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Jareer reported to us from Mansoor from Ibraaheem (An- Nakha&#8217;ee) that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“They (the Sahaabah) would gather together and remind one another of knowledge and goodness. Then they would depart and separate from one another. And they would not ask forgiveness for one another (upon departing) nor would they say: ‘O such and such person, make du’aa (supplication) for me.’” [71]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">160. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan reported to us from Sufyaan from Mansoor from Ibraaheem (An-Nakha&#8217;ee) that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“They (the Sahaabah) would hate the recording (of hadeeth) [as opposed to memorizing].”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">161. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Jareer reported to us from Mansoor on the authority of Ibraaheem that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“There is no harm in recording the first portions of the hadeeth (atraaf).”</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">162. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Al-Hasan Ibn Moosaa reported to us, saying: Ibn Lahee&#8217;ah reported to us, saying: Darraaj reported to us from Ibn Hajeerah on the authority of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) that he said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;The example of one who has acquired knowledge and does not speak about it, is like the example of a man whom Allaah has given wealth, yet he does not spend from it.&#8221; [72]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">163. Abu Khaithama narrated to us, saying: Jareer reported to us from Mugheerah from Ibraaheem on the authority of &#8216;Alqamah, that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Search for the mentioning of the hadeeth before it disappears.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">*This completes the ahaadeeth of Abu Khaithama, all praise be to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">164. Abu Hafs Ibraaheem Al-Kitaanee Al-Muqree [73] narrated to you, saying: &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Muhammad Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez Al-Baghawee reported to us, saying: Muhammad Khalf Ibn Hushaim Al-Bazaar reported to us from Mansoor Ibn Abee Mazaahim and Muhammad Ibn Sulaimaan Al-Asadee that they said: Maalik Ibn Anas reported to us from Az-Zuhree on the authority of Anas (radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa) that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) entered Makkah while wearing a helmet on his head. When he took it off, it was said to him: ‘It is Ibn Khatal74 and he is hanging from one of the curtains of the Ka’bah.’ So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: ‘Kill him.’” [75]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">165. &#8216;Abdullaah [Al-Baghawee] narrated to us, saying: Abu Nasr At-Tamaar76 reported to us, saying: Hamaad Ibn Salamah reported to us from Qataadah on the authority of Anas (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;The Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to say: &#8216;O Allaah, indeed I seek refuge in you from a knowledge that does not benefit, a deed that is not risen (to You; i.e. not accepted), a heart that does not fear and a statement (supplication) that is not heard.'&#8221;</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">166. &#8216;Abdullaah [Al-Baghawee] narrated to us, saying: &#8216;Abd-ul-A&#8217;alaa Ibn Hamaad An-Nursee reported to us, saying: Hamaad Ibn Salamah reported to us from Abu &#8216;Aasim Ibn Bahdala from Abu Saalih on the authority of ‘Aa’ishah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) that she said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">“The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to go out to observe the Fajr prayer, while his head (i.e. hair) would still be dripping from (having bathed due to) sexual intercourse, and not a wet dream. Then he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would observe the fast” [77]</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">167. &#8216;Abdullaah [Al-Baghawee] narrated to us, saying: Suraij Ibn Yoonus reported to us, saying: Hushaim reported to us, saying: Humayd reported to us from Anas [Ibn Maalik] (radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;When the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) observed the funeral prayer (janaazah), he would say the takbeer (Allaahu Akbar) four times.&#8221;</span></strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">**This completes the ahaadeeth, all praise be to Allaah. And may the peace and blessings be upon His Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and his entire family.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Footnotes</span></strong>:</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 This report is authentically attributed to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim transmitted it from Mu&#8217;awiyah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 This hadeeth is found in Sunan At-Tirmidhee and other collections, and he (At-Tirmidhee) authenticated it. Some of the reporters stop it as being the saying of a companion only, while others raise it to a saying of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). It takes the ruling of marfoo&#8217; (raised to a saying of the Prophet) without a doubt. This is because such a statement is not being said according to ones opinion and view, as has been stated by Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Barr in Jaami&#8217; Bayaan-ul-&#8216;Ilmi wa Fadlihi (1/32-33).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 This report is authentically attributed to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). At-Tabaraanee transmitted it in Al-Awsat from the hadeeth of Jaabir (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and At-Tirmidhee from the hadeeth of Abu Umaamah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and he said it was saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 Translator’s Note: This advice is to acquire knowledge before taking a position of leadership, for when someone is in that position, it becomes difficult to seek knowledge due to the time and effort that is required for that position. And also, when one is in a position of leadership, no doubt, he will need to have knowledge in order to make the right decisions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9 The chain of this narration is jayyid (good). It is also established in marfoo&#8217; form. Ahmad and At-Tabaraanee reported it from two paths on the authority of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). The author (Abu Khaithama) has transmitted one of these two, as shall come later under number 162. Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-Barr also reported it from the hadeeth of Ibn &#8216;Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10 This statement is established in marfoo&#8217; form as a saying of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). At- Tabaraanee reported it on the authority of Ibn &#8216;Umar and Hudhaifah (radyAllaahu ‘anhum). Al-Mundhiree declared its chain to be hasan. Al-Haakim reported it from Sa&#8217;ad Ibn Abee Waqqaas (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and he as well as Adh-Dhahabee authenticated it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11 Its chain of narration is jayyid (good) in mawqoof form (i.e. saying of a Companion). It is also authentically attributed to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). Muslim and others have transmitted it and it will occur later in this book under number 25.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12 Ad-Dareer is the nickname of Muhammad Ibn Khaazim, Abu Mu&#8217;awiyah. Muslim has transmitted this hadeeth from this path of narrators (18/71-72) in marfoo&#8217; form. Then he reported it from different paths on the authority of Al-A&#8217;amash.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13 Its chain of narration is munqata&#8217; (broken), for Yahyaa Ibn Ja&#8217;ada never met &#8216;Umar Ibn Al-Khattaab. In fact it is even held that he never met Ibn Mas&#8217;ood, and he died ten years after that of &#8216;Umar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You must know that there was an old dispute amongst the Salaf with regard to recording the prophetic hadeeth. Among them were those who forbade it and among them were those who allowed it. There will follow in this book, many narrations regarding both of these sides. Then the matter settled in favor of the permissibility of writing down the hadeeth – rather in favor of its obligation. And this was based on the Prophet&#8217;s command mentioned in more than one hadeeth, such as his saying: &#8220;Write for Abu Shaah.” Al-Bukhaaree reported this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the matters that are well known is that it is the hadeeth that contains the explanation for the general aspects of the Qur&#8217;aan as well as the detailed aspects of its rulings. And if it were not for the hadeeth, we would have no way of knowing how to perform the prayer, observe the fast, as well as fulfill the other pillars and acts of worship, upon the way that Allaah intended for us. And whatever is essential for an obligatory matter to be fulfilled, becomes itself obligatory. Indeed a people from this era have gone astray for they believe that the Qur&#8217;aan is sufficient for them over the hadeeth. This is in spite of Allaah&#8217;s saying: &#8220;And we revealed to you the Reminder so that it could explain to the people what was already revealed to them (from before).&#8221; [Suratun- Nahl: 44] Thus, Allaah informs us that there is something that is explained, which is the Qur&#8217;aan, and something that is explaining, which is the Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and his hadeeth. Furthermore, his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) saying in the authentic and famous hadeeth: &#8220;Indeed I was given the Qur&#8217;aan and something equal to it&#8221; confirms this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14 This refers to the letters that the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) used to write to some individuals and to certain tribes. Refer to Zaad al-Ma&#8217;aad (1/30). This narration on Ibn &#8216;Abbaas (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) has an authentic chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15 He is &#8216;Uqbah Ibn &#8216;Aamir and he traveled to see Maslama Ibn Mukhallid, who was in charge of Egypt (at that time) as occurs in the Musnad (4/104).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16 Its chain of narration is saheeh (authentic). Muslim has transmitted it in his Saheeh (2/95).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17 Surat-un-Nisaa: 37</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18 He is Ibn Abee Saleem and he is da&#8217;eef (weak).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19 Meaning: One sentence, regardless of whether it comes from the Book or the Sunnah. The following is stated in An-Nihaayah: “What is meant by the word ayah in the Qur&#8217;aan is a collection of letters and words. This is derived from the people’s saying: ‘The people left with their ayaat’, meaning they went out with all their possessions not leaving anything behind. The word ayah in any other context means a sign.” Some said in explaining this hadeeth: &#8220;It means a sign, either a gesture or a conveyance.&#8221; This means that if the thing that is being conveyed occurs in the form of an action or a gesture, with the hand or the finger, then indeed it is to convey it in the same way in order to preserve the Sharee&#8217;ah. The hadeeth has a saheeh chain of narration. Al-Bukhaaree reported it through another path on the authority of Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20 Its chain of narration is saheeh from Masrooq. And he is Ibn Al-Ajda&#8217;, a Taabi&#8217;ee (Second generation of Muslims), a Faqeeh (scholar capable of issuing rulings), an &#8216;Aabid (devout worshipper). He died in the year 62H. And he has been mentioned previously in another chain that connects to him under number 15.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21 He is Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). And the chain of narration to him is saheeh upon the standards of the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim). Al-Haakim transmitted it (3/537) from another path on Al-A&#8217;amash without the saying: &#8220;The best interpreter…&#8221; and he (rahimahullaah) authenticated it based on both of their standards. Adh-Dhahabee agreed with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22 Its chain of narration is munqata&#8217; (broken) because Saalim Ibn Abee Al-Ja&#8217;ad never met Abu Ad-Dardaa (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). It has also been reported on his authority through another path of narrators in marfoo&#8217; form. However, its chain is da&#8217;eef (weak), also.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23 It is a saheeh hadeeth. Its narrators are all reliable for they are narrators of the standards of the two Shaikhs (Al- Bukhaaree and Muslim). Ahmad and Ibn Maajah have reported this from Wakee&#8217; connected to him (Ibn Umm Lubaid), while Al-Haakim and Ahmad have reported it from the path of narration of &#8216;Amr Ibn Murrah: &#8220;I heard Saalim Ibn Abee Al-Ja&#8217;ad say&#8221; on his (Ibn Umm Lubaid) authority. Al-Haakim authenticated it and mentioned that there were two other paths of narration to them, the first of which is on the authority of &#8216;Awf Ibn Maalik (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) and has been reported by Al-Khateeb Al-Baghdaadee in his book Al-Iqtidaa (no. 90). The other has been reported on the authority of Abu Ad-Dardaa (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). Adh-Dhahabee declared the chains of both of these to be saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24 The chain of this narration is saheeh. Ibraaheem here refers to Ibn Yazeed An-Nakha&#8217;ee. Although he never met &#8216;Abdullaah, who is Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), it is still authentically reported on him that he said: &#8220;If I narrate a hadeeth to you on the authority of a man on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah, then that means that I heard it (from that person). And if I say, &#8216;Abdullaah said…&#8217; (without mentioning the narrator), then it is from someone reporting on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25 He is Abu Zur&#8217;ah Ibn &#8216;Amr Ibn Jareer Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Al-Bajlee Al-Koofee. There is a difference of opinion concerning his name. He was a Taabi&#8217;ee (Second generation of Muslims), reliable and the compilers of the six collections rely on his narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">26 Its chain of narration in mawqoof form (stopped at level of being the saying of a companion and not of the Prophet) upon &#8216;Ubaid Ibn &#8216;Umair is saheeh. Al-Bazaar and At-Tabaraanee have also reported it from the hadeeth of Ibn Mas&#8217;ood in marfoo&#8217; form (raised to a saying of the Prophet), with a chain of narration in which there is no defect, according to Al-Mundhiree.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: Later, it became apparent to me that there is, in fact, a defect in it. Adh-Dhahabee has testified to it, as I have explained in Al-Ahaadeeth Ad-Da&#8217;eefah (no. 5032).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">27 The chain of narration is authentic. &#8216;Abdullaah here refers to Ibn Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">28 Its chain of narration is saheeh (authentic), as well as the one that comes after it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">29 Its chain is saheeh and Mas&#8217;ood Ibn Maalik is Abu Razeen Al-Asadee, a Taabi&#8217;ee who was reliable and<br />
trustworthy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">30 He is Ibn Abee Saleem and he is da&#8217;eef (weak) as has been stated previously.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">31 He is Al-Hasan Al-Basree, the righteous Taabi&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">32 Translator’s Note: A Mujtahid is a scholar that has reached high levels of knowledge such that he is able to form opinions and issue fataawaa (rulings), without basing it on the scholars before him. They can determine rulings for issues that have no clear mention in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">33 Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">34 Its chain is saheeh, just like the one before it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">35 Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim). They have both transmitted it on the authority of (Imaam) Maalik and it is found in Al-Muwatta (2/56/34) within a hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">36 This refers to the non-Arabs. The chain of narration is according to the standards of Muslim. However, it is in mawqoof form. It has been reported in marfoo’ form from three different paths on the authority of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) without mentioning the Tribe of Farrookh and with the wording: “&#8230;a group of people from Persia would surely grasp it.” These reports have been transmitted by Abu Nu’aim in Akhbaar Asbahaan (1/5) but they all have defects in them. One of them is found in (the Saheeh of) Ibn Hibbaan (no. 2309). And what is authentic is what occurs with the wording: “If Eemaan (Faith) were clinging from the sky, there would be some people from Persia who would surely grasp it.” Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim have reported this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">37 His name is Dhakwaan As-Samaan Az-Ziyaat Al-Madanee. He was the guardian of Juwairiyah Bint Al-Ahmas Al-Ghatfaanee. And he was the father of Suhayl, the one mentioned in the previous chain of narrators. Abu Saalih died in the year 101H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">38 The hadeeth here is mawqoof and in its chain is Laith Ibn Abee Saleem who is da&#8217;eef (weak). Others have reported it from &#8216;Adiyy Ibn &#8216;Adiyy in marfoo&#8217; form. Ibn &#8216;Asaakir (10/28/2) reported it as well as Al-Khateeb Al- Baghdaadee in Iqtidaa-ul-&#8216;Ilm (no. 2). It has a supporting evidence (in a hadeeth reported) on the authority of Abu Burzah in marfoo&#8217; form. At-Tirmidhee reported this one and authenticated it. Ad-Daarimee also reported it as well as Abu Ya&#8217;laa in his Musnad (2/353) with an authentic chain of narration. Also, Al-Khateeb reported this in his book Iqtidaa-ul-&#8216;Ilm under (no. 1).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">39 The original source of this hadeeth is in mawqoof form and not marfoo&#8217;. Some people have mentioned it on the authority of Ka&#8217;ab Al-Ahbaar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), saying that it is found in the Torah. And some liars and weak reporters have raised it to the level of being a saying of Abu Ad-Dardaa and Jaabir (radyAllaahu ‘anhum). See Al- Laalee Al-Masnoo&#8217;ah of As-Suyootee and Silsilat-ul-Ahaadeeth Ad-Da&#8217;eefah (no. 2750).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">40 Know that there is not found in this description of the Muhaajireen, and likewise this description of the Ansaar, any reviling or derogation of them, as many of the contemporary writers that slander Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) without due right claim. This goes as well for those who interpret his sayings in a way contrary to what he intended. Indeed, doing an action in addition to seeking the halaal is from the Way of Allaah, as has been reported authentically in some ahaadeeth. And Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) was aware of this, for he was one of the reporters. Thus, he made excuses for them in regard to that matter for (their lack) of memorizing hadeeth the way he was able to memorize. Al-Haakim (3/511-512) reported from Talha Ibn &#8216;Ubaidillaah, one of the ten who were given the glad tidings of Paradise, and one of the Muhaajireen and first Muslims, that he (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said concerning the Muhaajireen and Abu Hurairah something similar to this hadeeth: &#8220;By Allaah, I have no doubt that Abu Hurairah heard from the Messenger of Allaah, that which we did not hear and he learned that which we did not learn. Verily, we were rich people, in possession of houses and large families. We used to go and stay with the Prophet until the end of the day, then we used to go back. And Abu Hurairah was a poor person. He had no money nor family nor children. His hand was only where the Prophet&#8217;s hand was. And he used to stay over wherever he resided. And we have no doubt that he learned what we didn&#8217;t learn and that he heard what we didn&#8217;t hear. And no one among us accuses him.&#8221; Al- Haakim authenticated it and Al-Haafidh mentioned a supporting evidence for it in Fath-ul-Baaree (1/191).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the hadeeth has an authentic chain of narration, according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. Muslim transmitted it through the same path of narrators as the author (Abu Khaithama) and he and Al-Bukhaaree have both transmitted it through other paths on the authority of Sufyaan. And with this chain, Ahmad (2/240) also reported it. Furthermore, he (2/274), Al-Bukhaaree and others reported it through other paths of narration on the authority of Az-Zuhree. Muslim reported it from Az-Zuhree on the authority of Sa&#8217;eed Ibn Al-Musayyib and Abu Salamah Ibn &#8216;Abd-ir-Rahmaan that Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said: &#8220;Indeed, you…&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">41 He is Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Al-Qaadee. There is speculation concerning his memory, however Zuhair Ibn Mu&#8217;awiyah followed him and he is reliable. Due to this, At-Tirmidhee authenticated the hadeeth. It is reported in Al- Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah under no. 330.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">42 This is an authentic hadeeth. Its chain is in mursal form (meaning stopped at the level of being a saying of a Taabi&#8217;ee). However Al-Haakim (4/279-280) has reported it from the path of: &#8220;Umayyah Ibn Khallid from Sulaimaan Ibn Al-Mugheerah on the authority of Thaabit on &#8216;Amr Ibn Shu&#8217;ayb on his father on the authority of &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn &#8216;Amr who reported it on the Messenger of Allaah. And he (Al-Haakim) authenticated it based on the standards of Muslim, and Adh-Dhahabee agreed. It is only this hadeeth that is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43 Translator’s Note: This means that if you can convey the meaning of a hadeeth, as opposed to quoting it, then there is no harm, in that, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44 Surat-ul-Baqarah: 159</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45 I say: Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. Al-Bukhaaree (1/42) has transmitted it from the path of Al-A&#8217;araj on Abu Hurairah t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">43 Translator’s Note: This means that if you can convey the meaning of a hadeeth, as opposed to quoting it, then there is no harm, in that, and Allaah knows best.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">44 Surat-ul-Baqarah: 159</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">45 I say: Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. Al-Bukhaaree (1/42) has transmitted it from the path of Al-A&#8217;araj on Abu Hurairah t.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">46 This narration in mawqoof form (saying of a companion only) has an authentic chain. Its narrators are all narrators of the category of the two Saheeh collections, except for &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Yazeed As-Sahbaanee. However, he is trustworthy and his biography occurs in Al-Jarh wat-Ta&#8217;deel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">47 He is Ibn &#8216;Amr As-Salmaanee. He was a Taabi&#8217;ee, reliable and trustworthy. The one who reports from him, Abu Zaid Al-Muraadee, is Nu&#8217;maan Ibn Qais. Ibn Abee Haatim wrote a biography for him (4/1/446) and reported his reliability from the sayings of Ibn Ma&#8217;een and others. Sufyaan Ath-Thawree reported this narration on his authority also and added to the end of it that he (&#8216;Ubaidah) said: &#8220;Indeed I fear that a people will succeed after it (i.e. his books) and not give it its due place.&#8221; Ad-Daarimee (1/121) reported it as well as Al-Khateeb in Taqyeed-ul-&#8216;Ilm (pg. 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">48 I say: Its chain is munqata&#8217; (broken). This is because Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah, who is Abu &#8216;Ubaidah Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Ibn Mas&#8217;ood did not hear from his father. Therefore, it is cut short to being a saying of Ibn ‘Abdillaah. And it is authentic on Ibn Mas&#8217;ood in marfoo&#8217; form (saying of the Prophet r). At-Tirmidhee reported it and authenticated it, as did Ibn Hibbaan in his Saheeh. And it has been mentioned from other Companions apart from him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">49 Its chain is saheeh in mawqoof form. It is also reported from the path of Isma&#8217;eel Ibn Mujaalid on &#8216;Abd-ul-Malik Ibn &#8216;Umair in marfoo&#8217; form (saying of the Prophet r). And it has a supporting witness from the path of Mu&#8217;awiyah t. I have spoken about it in Al-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">50 Its chain of narration is saheeh in mawqoof form. And it is authentic in marfoo&#8217; form from different paths on the authority of Abu Hurairah. Al-Bukhaaree, Muslim and others have transmitted it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">51 He is &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Al-Muthnaa Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah Ibn Anas. He was honest yet made many mistakes. This hadeeth has been reported in marfoo&#8217; form as a saying of the Prophet, and it is not authentic. Later, I encountered many paths of narration for the hadeeth reported in marfoo&#8217; form, such that it directs towards the fact that it is saheeh. I have clarified this in Al-Ahaadeeth As-Saheehah (no. 2026).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">52 Its chain is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs and they have both reported it. One of the paths of narration reported by Muslim is the same one used by the author (Abu Khaithama) here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">53 Its chain is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs and they have both transmitted it. Some of its paths of narration are found in Saheeh Muslim on the authority of the author (Abu Khaithama).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">54 He is Al-Haitham Ibn Habeeb, Abu Al-Haitham As-Sairafee. And he is reliable as are the rest of the narrators in this chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">55 His name is &#8216;Amr Ibn &#8216;Abdillaah As-Subai&#8217;ee. He is reliable, but used to commit tadless and mix (confuse) his narrations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">56 His name is &#8216;Abdullaah and he is reliable, from the narrators of the category of the two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim). This goes the same for the rest of the narrators of the chain. However there is a break in the chain. Taawoos on the authority of &#8216;Umar is in mursal form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">57 This means that there is no one who is able to narrate a hadeeth without there occurring an addition or a subtraction to it. So it is upon one to exert himself and to not fall short with regard to memory and precision. Hence, &#8220;Allaah does not burden a soul with more than it can handle.&#8221; The chain of the narration is saheeh. And Gheelaan is Ibn Jareer Al-Ma&#8217;oolee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">58 This is a well-known city in Yemen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">59 Its chain is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. Abu &#8216;Abd-ir-Rahmaan is &#8216;Abdullaah Ibn Habeeb As-Sulamee. He was a Taabi&#8217;ee, reciter of the Qur&#8217;aan, reliable and trustworthy. The name of Abu Hiseen is &#8216;Uthmaan Ibn &#8216;Aasim Al-Asadee. He was also reliable and trustworthy. He died in the year 127H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">60 The chain of this narration is jayyid (good). And it shows the praiseworthy manners of Ibn &#8216;Abbaas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">61 He is Ibn Abee Sulaymaan Al-Koofee, the Faqeeh. The Ibraaheem that is mentioned here is Ibn Yazeed An- Nakha&#8217;ee. The name of Ibn &#8216;Awn is &#8216;Abdullaah, and he was a famous Faqeeh (Scholar of Fiqh). All of them are reliable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">62 This is how it was written originally contrary to the format that has been used beforehand and afterwards. The author repeats the same hadeeth again under no. 161, which will come later. And what is meant by the word atraaf, and Allaah knows best, is the first portions of hadeeth (i.e. the first words of a hadeeth), which they used to write out and by which they would remember the ahaadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">63 He is Al-Qarqisaanee, and he was honest yet committed many errors. In spite of this a group of people followed him (in narration) according to Ad-Daarimee (1/122), Al-Khateeb in Taqyeed-ul-&#8216;Ilm (pg. 42) and others. The chain of narration is saheeh when attributed to Abu Hurairah. And Abu Katheer is As-Suhaymee Al-Yamaanee Al-A&#8217;amaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">64 He is Ibn Abee Saleem and he is da&#8217;eef (weak) as has been stated several times previously. However, he is not alone in his narration of this hadeeth. Rather it has supporting evidences which Al-Haakim and Adh-Dhahabee have authenticated. We have discussed this hadeeth in detail in our commentary to it in Mishkaat-ul-Masaabeeh (no. 260). I will further add to it here, saying: Ad-Daarimee (1/96) reported this hadeeth from another path on the authority of Laith in mawqoof form.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">65 In mawqoof form (saying of a companion only), this narration is da&#8217;eef. It is authentic in marfoo&#8217; form from the path of &#8216;Ataa on Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu). At-Tirmidhee, Ibn Hibbaan, Al-Haakim and Adh-Dhahabee have authenticated it. See (my book) Tah-dheer-ul-Masaajid (pg. 4)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">66 His name is Al-Hasan Ibn &#8216;Uqbah Al-Muraadee. Ibn Ma&#8217;een declared him to be reliable and Abu Haatim said of him: &#8220;He was a shaikh, his hadeeth were written down.&#8221; The chain of narration linked to Ash-Sha&#8217;bee is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">67 He (&#8216;Ilbaa) is Ibn Ahmar Al-Yushkaree Al-Basree and he was a Taabi&#8217;ee of trustworthy and reliable status. Likewise, the rest of the narrators of the chain are all reliable. So it is saheeh, if &#8216;Ilbaa heard it from &#8216;Alee, because there is no report mentioned from him on his authority.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">68 I do not know who this Abu Damurah is. As for Hamaad, then he is Ibn Abee Salmaan, the Faqeeh. And Ibraaheem here refers to Ibn Yazeed An-Nakha&#8217;ee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">69 He is reliable, as are the rest of the narrators of the chain. Thus it is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">70 He is Abu Haashim Al-Makkee, a Taabi&#8217;ee that is reliable. The chain of narration linked to him is saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">71 Ibraaheem, and he is (ibn Yazeed) An-Nakha&#8217;ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, means by this that it was not from the actions of the Sahaabah to supplicate for one another after the end of a class or a study session. Therefore, this is an innovation. Another thing similar to it is when the teacher (shaikh) walks ahead of his students and they walk behind him. This is because this action is from that which leads to fitnah and amazement with oneself, as is indicated in the narration mentioned before this one. And both of them (i.e. this narration and the one before it) have authentic chains of narration on the authority of Ibraaheem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">72 This is a hasan hadeeth. Even though Ibn Lahee&#8217;ah and Darraaj are both weak, it has another path on the authority of Abu Hurairah as well as a supporting evidence on the authority of Ibn &#8216;Umar in marfoo&#8217; form. And it is mentioned through another path on the authority of Salmaan in mawqoof form, as has been stated previously by the author under number 12.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">73 Translator’s Note: He is one of the narrator’s in the chain of narration of the book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">74 Translator’s Note: He was a man who had accepted Islaam, but who later apostated. When he was given the task of collecting Zakaat with another Companion from the Ansaar, he killed him during the journey, apostated, and seeked shelter in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">75 This hadeeth has an authentic chain of narration, and it is found in Al-Muwatta, and on his (Maalik&#8217;s) authority in the Saheehs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">76 He is &#8216;Abd-ul-Malik Ibn &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez Al-Qushairee An-Nasaa&#8217;ee. He is reliable and from the narrators of Muslim. This goes the same for the rest of the narrators of this chain, thus it is authentic according to his (Muslim&#8217;s) standards. It has been transmitted by Ahmad (3/192 &amp; 225) through other paths on the authority of Hamaad. And it is also in (3/283) and in An-Nasaa&#8217;ee (2/316) from the path of Hafs on Anas. It is also found in Saheeh Muslim (8/72) from the hadeeth of Zayd Ibn Arqam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">77 Its chain of narration is hasan and the hadeeth is authentic. The two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) have transmitted it through another path on the authority of &#8216;Aa&#8217;ishah, may Allaah be pleased with her.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">78 Its chain of narration is saheeh according to the standards of the two Shaikhs. And they have both transmitted it through other paths of narration on the authority of Anas without the mention of his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;…for indeed each of you…&#8221;. There is a supporting evidence for this addition (to the hadeeth) in the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) in marfoo&#8217; form which is found in Saheeh Muslim (7/65) and Ahmad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">79 His name is Muhammad Ibn Ja&#8217;far Ibn Ziyaad and he is reliable. However, his shaikh, Sa&#8217;eed Ibn Maisira, is accused (of weakness). Regardless the hadeeth is saheeh. The two Shaikhs (Al-Bukhaaree and Muslim) as well as others have transmitted it from the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu), with different wordings and additions to it. I have gathered and checked all of them in my book Ahkaam-ul-Janaa&#8217;iz wa Bid&#8217;ihaa and it has been published by Al-Maktab-ul-Islaamee.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUTHOR: Shaikh Rabee&#8217; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Excerpt from the forthcoming Al-Ibaanah Publication &#8220;The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups&#8221;, may Allaah facilitate it!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a chapter from the book <b>“<i>Manhaj Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah fee Naqd-ir-Rijaal wal-Kutubi wat-Tawaa’if</i>”</b> (The Methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in Criticizing Individuals, Books and Groups) written by Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee. This book has been highly praised and recommended by the scholars, and has become a classical work in its own time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee clarifies the correct methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah with regard to criticizing, explaining its foundations and principles and relying on the various statements of the Salaf (predecessors) to support his points. The book is primarily geared towards refuting a false concept that has crept into the Muslims’ ideologies and slogans in recent times, which is the principle of Muwaazanah. This principle dictates that when someone criticizes a person, book or group, he is obligated to also mention the good qualities of that person, book or group along with his criticism. By doing this one would be creating a balance and thus applying “fairness”, hence the term Muwaazanah, which means to make a balance, which in this case means a balance between the good and the bad aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this specific chapter of the book, Shaikh Rabee’ brings many quotes from the Salaf showing that it was from their methodology to warn against innovators and their books without requiring themselves to mention their positive aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Al-Jawzee said: ‘Abul-Wafaa ‘Alee bin ‘Aqeel, the Fiqh scholar, said: ‘Our Shaikh Abul-Fadl Al-Hamdhaanee said: The innovators in Islaam and those who fabricate <i>ahaadeeth </i>are worse than the disbelievers. This is since the disbelievers attempt to corrupt the Religion from the outside, whereas these individuals attempt to corrupt it from the inside. They take the likeness of the inhabitants of a land, who strive to corrupt its condition (from the inside), while the disbelievers take the likeness of raiders laying siege to the land from the outside. So it is the ones on the inside who open the doors of the land’s surrounding barrier (and let the besiegers in). These types (of people) are more dangerous to Islaam than those who don&#8217;t ascribe themselves to it.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say: Today, the opponents of the Sunnah and Tawheed are capitalizing on the pamphlets and cassettes of some individuals that ascribe themselves to the Sunnah and Tawheed, which defame the true scholars and callers of the Sunnah and Tawheed. Rather, what is worse in terms of danger and affliction is that these pamphlets and tapes have influenced many of the children of Tawheed and Sunnah, so that now they launch their arrows of disparagement and oppressive accusations towards the scholars of Tawheed and Sunnah, those who carry their banner and those who defend their sanctity. What is worse than this in terms of misfortune and grief, is that they attach themselves and join forces with the people of innovation and misguidance in their campaign of launching poisonous missiles at them, which the enemies of the Sunnah and Tawheed have been preparing as the ultimate attack to finish off the last remnants of the Sunnah and Tawheed.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ibn Al-Qayyim said: ‘The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) once saw a book in the hand of ‘Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) that he had transcribed from the Torah, and which caused him to be amazed at how much it conformed to the Qur’aan. So the face of the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) became very angry to the point that ‘Umar went over to a fire and threw it in.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So how would it be if the Messenger of Allaah (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) saw what was written after him from the books that oppose and contradict what is in the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah?! And we ask Allaah to aid us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (<i>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</i>) commanded everyone that recorded anything from him apart from the Qur’aan to erase what they had written down. However, afterward, he allowed his Sunnah to be written, but did not grant permission for anything besides that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all of these books that contain opposition in them to the Sunnah, have no permission to be written. Rather, they only have permission to be erased and destroyed, for there is not anything more harmful to the ummah than these books. The Companions (of the Prophet) burned all the copies of the <i>mus-haf </i>that contradicted the <i>mus-haf </i>of ‘Uthmaan (<i>radyAllaahu ‘anhu</i>) out of fear that differing would spread amongst the ummah. So how would it be if they were to see the books of today that cause disunity and division amongst the ummah…!?’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is the rightly guided methodology, which all of the Salafee youth are obligated to know – it is the methodology indicated in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah, and which the best of this ummah – its scholars of Hadeeth and Fiqh &#8211; followed. One of the conditions for implementing this methodology is that the one criticizing must do that for the sake of Allaah and out of sincerity to Allaah and His Book and in order to preserve Allaah’s Religion and what it encompasses from beliefs, laws and acts of worship.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the severely unfortunate matters is that the people of falsehood and innovation have succeeded in deceiving many of the smart and intelligent students of knowledge, not to mention others, by making them believe that it is not permissible to talk about (i.e. criticize) those active in the field of Da’wah (calling). They mean by this, those who call to innovation and misguidance! By doing this, they intend to broaden the field (of Da’wah) so that they can spread their destructive deceptions! And they hope that with this they will be able to put an end to the Call to Tawheed, Sunnah and the Methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the offshoots of this deceitful way of thinking are those conditions that some of the children of Tawheed have put forth, such as: When criticizing the people of innovation – or those whom they label “callers” – one is obligated to mention their good qualities alongside their bad qualities&#8230;”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of the classical treatise of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab <b><i>“Masaa’il-ul-Jaahiliyyah”</i></b><i></i> (Aspects of the Days of Ignorance), which is a list of 128 points &#8211; each point representing one aspect of belief or practice that the people of the Days of Ignorance were upon, which Islaam came to oppose. The source used for this translation can be found on sahab.org.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The original Arabic text of the treatise is included within this translation so as to make this e-book a comprehensive reference guide and an easily-accessible study guide. Footnotes were added by the translator in order to clarify and provide evidence for some of the points that the author mentioned but didn’t provide proof or an explanation for. In recent times, this treatise has been explained by Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan in several lectures. These lectures were recorded and transcribed and put into a book.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The subject matter of this treatise is one of great importance, for the aspects of the Days of Ignorance have not ceased to be acted upon till this very day. And the people that call towards these misguided beliefs and practices of the Days of Ignorance are many, such as innovators and people of desire. So it is important for the Muslim to learn what the People of the Days of Ignorance were upon in terms of beliefs, actions and practices, so that he may avoid that, since Islaam came to oppose these aspects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b> “These are the aspects that the people of the Days of Ignorance – both the people of the Book and the non-People of the Book – were upon, which the Messenger of Allaah opposed. They are from the matters that every Muslim is required to possess knowledge of. This is since with (understanding) one side of the opposite, the goodness of the other side of the opposite can be made apparent. And it is by (making apparent the) opposite of something that matters become clarified. The most important of these aspects (of the Days of Ignorance) and most severe in terms of danger was the absence of faith (Eemaan) in the heart, for what the Messenger of Allaah came with. And if approval for what the people of the Days of Ignorance were upon is further added to this (absence of faith), then the total ruin is achieved, as Allaah says: <b>‘And those who believe in the falsehood while disbelieving in Allaah, it is they who are the losers.’</b> [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 52]”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>[3]</b> They held the acts of opposing the figure of authority and failing to comply with him as being something virtuous. And they saw the acts of hearing and obeying as being humiliating and degrading. So Allaah&#8217;s Messenger opposed them and commanded that patience be observed when facing the oppression of the rulers. And he commanded with hearing and obeying them, as well as advising (them). And he spoke extensively in regards to that and he constantly brought it up and repeated it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>[5]</b> From their greatest principles was that they were deceived by (following) the majority, using that as a proof against the correctness of a matter. And they also used as evidence for declaring the falsehood of something, the fact that it was strange and that its adherents were few. So Allaah prescribed the opposite of that and He clarified this in many places of the Qur&#8217;aan.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>[23]</b> They were deluded by the life of this world. So they perceived Allaah’s bestowal of worldly material (on someone), as an indication of He was pleased (with that person), as He says: <b>‘And they say: We are abundant in wealth and in children. And (because of that) we are not going to be punished.’</b> [Surah Saba’: 35]”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translated transcription of a lecture delivered by Imaam Al-Albaanee (<i>rahimahullaah</i>) that was recorded and distributed under the title <b><i>“Hadhihi Da’watunaa”</i></b><i></i> (This is Our Call). The present translation was translated directly from the Arabic audio.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this lecture, Imaam Al-Albaanee explains the basis of the Salafee Manhaj, which is following the way, understanding and practical application of the Salaf, who were namely the first three generations of Muslims: The Sahaabah, Taabi’een and Atbaa’ at-Taabi’een. They are the ones referred to in the Prophet’s saying: <b>“The best of mankind is my generation, then those that come after them, then those that come after them.”</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the basis that distinguishes the true call to Islaam from all other false and erroneous calls, regardless if they claim to be “upon the Qur’aan and the Sunnah.” Al-Albaanee goes into depth discussing this fact, that one cannot truly understand and apply the Qur’aan and Sunnah unless he follows the understanding and application of the Salaf. We ask Allaah to accept this effort and benefit the Muslims with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So here we have given the answer from the ayah and the two hadeeth, we just mentioned. Follow the way of the Believers! The way of those believers from present times? The answer is no, we mean the Believers from the past &#8211; the first era &#8211; the era of the Companions &#8211; the Salaf As-Saalih (pious predecessors). These are the people whom we should take as our example and as the ones whom we follow. And there is absolutely no one equal to them on the face of the earth. Therefore, the essence of our call is based on three pillars &#8211; on the (1) Qur&#8217;aan, the (2) Sunnah and (3) Following the Salaf As-Saalih (pious predecessors).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So everyone claims to follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, and how often have we heard this kind of talk from the youth who are in confusion, when they say: ‘Ya akhee, these people claim to follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and those people claim to follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.’ So what is the clear and decisive distinction? It is the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah and the Methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih. So whoever follows the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah without following the Salaf As-Saalih, he in fact has not followed the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah, rather he has only followed his intellect, if not his desire.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“After making clear this important condition of &#8220;upon the methodology of the Salaf As-Saalih&#8221;, I must give you some examples. In the past, the Muslims split up into many sects. You hear about the Mu&#8217;tazilah, you hear about the Murji&#8217;ah, you hear about the Khawaarij, you hear about the Zaidiyyah, not to mention the Shi&#8217;a and the Raafidah and so on. There is no one amongst these groups, no matter how deep in misguidance they are, that does not share the same saying as the rest of the Muslims, which is that: &#8220;We are on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.&#8221; No one amongst them says: &#8220;We don’t follow the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah.&#8221; And if one of them were to say that, he would completely leave the fold of Islaam. So then why did they split up so long as all of them rely on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah &#8211; and I bear witness that they do rely on the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah for support. But how is this relying done? It is done without relying on the third foundation, which is what the Salaf As-Saalih were upon.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Zayn-ud-Deen Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a complete translation of the classical treatise <b><i>“Al-Farq baynan-Naseeha wat-Ta’yeer”</i></b><i></i>[The Difference between Advising and Condemning] of Imaam Ibn Rajab Al-Hanbalee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this translation was the Daar ‘Ammaar publication.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Imaam Ibn Rajab discusses some of the manners and etiquettes of differing amongst Ahlus-Sunnah, explaining the distinction between advising and condemning. This is since these two things are often confused for one another. So the author goes into depth explaining the characteristics of sincere advice and condemnation. This treatise also lays down some guidelines for Ahlus-Sunnah in their criticisms and refutations. It should be noted, as the author states, that this treatise only applies to Ahlus-Sunnah, and as for the innovators and people of desires, then these guidelines do not apply to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In recent times, Shaikh Rabee’ Al-Madkhalee has provided an explanation for some of the important points covered in this book in a two-part lecture which was later transcribed and can be downloaded for free from his website <a href="http://www.rabee.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabee.net</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Therefore, refuting weak (erroneous) opinions and clarifying the truth with regard to what opposes it, based upon sound evidences, is not from what these scholars detested. Rather, it was from that which they loved and for which they commended and praised those who did it. So it does not enter into the realm of backbiting at all. But suppose there is someone that hates to have his error, which contradicts the Sunnah, exposed. In this case, there is no consideration given to his hatred for that, because hating to manifest the truth &#8211; if it is in opposition to the opinion of a man &#8211; is not from those matters that are praiseworthy. Rather it is an obligation on the Muslim to love that the truth be made manifest and that the Muslims (in general) are aware of it, regardless of whether it is in conformity or in opposition to his (personal) view.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Therefore, these characteristics are the characteristics of the Jews and the hypocrites. And it is that someone outwardly displays a saying or an action, while presenting an image in which he appears to be upon good. Yet his intention in doing that is to accomplish an evil goal. So he is praised for what good he has made manifest outwardly, while accomplishing by it, the evil goal he has kept hidden inwardly. And he basks in the praise he receives for that which he has outwardly portrayed as being good, which is in fact evil on the inside, and he is happy that his evil hidden objective has been achieved. So his benefit is perfected for him and his scheme is carried out effectively by this deception!!”</p>

<p><strong>About the Book: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small booklet titled <strong>Zaad ad-Daa&#8217;iyah IlaaAllaah (Provisions for the Caller to Allaah)</strong> by Imam Muhammad bin Saalih Al-Uthaimeen, may Allaah have mercy on him. The original source for this booklet was a lecture he gave that was later transcribed and printed. This booklet can be downloaded for free on-line at the Imaam&#8217;s website <a href="http://www.binothaimeen.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.binothaimeen.com</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this book, Imaam Ibn Uthaimeen expounds on six characteristics that everyone who takes on the task of da&#8217;wah must have. These characteristics are provisions that every Caller must equip and prepare himself with before embarking on dawah. Therefore we stress that this treatise be taken as a required reading for all those who are involved in da&#8217;wah activities, especially in the English speaking lands of the West.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to make this e-book a beneficial source of knowledge and a reminder to our brothers and sisters who are active in calling to Allaah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh &#8216;Abdul-Muhsin bin Hamad Al-&#8216;Abbaad<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah.Com<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small treatise entitled <b>“<i>’Aqeedatu Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah fis-Sahaabat-il-Kiraam</i>”</b> (The Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah concerning the Companions) written by Shaikh ‘Abdul-Muhsin Al-‘Abbaad. The source for this treatise was an article the Shaikh wrote for the Islamic University of Madeenah Newsletter (Issue 2 of their fourth year) Shawaal 1391H. This article was distributed together with a transcribed lecture from the Shaikh entitled “Sending Salaat on the Prophet” in a booklet published by the Islamic University of Madeenah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this brief presentation, Shaikh Al-‘Abbaad, one of the senior scholars and a Muhaddith in Saudi Arabia, may Allaah preserve him, outlines the proper belief a Muslim should have with regard to the Companions, and that is of moderateness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Muslim should not go to either extreme of being fanatical towards individuals amongst the Companions or being lenient and heedless about the rights they deserve. Rather, it is upon the believer, the adherent of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, to have love and respect for all of them, as well as to acknowledge their virtues and refrain from mentioning their errors and mishaps. The Shaikh presents the material in a concise but educational manner, quoting numerous ayaat, ahaadeeth and statements of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The <i>madh-hab</i> of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jamaa&#8217;ah concerning the Companions is that of moderateness between the two ends of extremism and heedlessness. It is moderateness amidst the extremist fanatics who elevate the esteemed ones amongst them to a level that is only befitting for Allaah or for His messengers and moderateness amidst the heedless and harsh ones who belittle and revile them. So they are in the middle between those who are excessive and those who fall short &#8211; they love all of them and put each one of them in the due place that they deserve, with fairness and justice. So they do not elevate them to a level they don’t deserve, nor do they belittle them, taking away what they are worthy of. Their tongues are moist with mentioning them only in good, according to what is befitting for them. And their hearts are filled with love for them.“</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;And whatever disputes and differences that occurred between (some of) them, that can be authentically confirmed, we hold that they were Mujtahideen in that regard – either they were correct and will receive one reward for their Ijtihaad and one reward for being correct, or they were wrong and will receive just one reward for their Ijtihaad while their error will be forgiven. They were not infallible since they were human beings. At times they were correct and at times they erred. But how much more were they correct as compared to others being correct, and how fewer were their errors as compared to the errors of others? And on top of this, they will receive Allaah&#8217;s forgiveness and contentment.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;These are five examples from the sayings of the Salaf As-Saalih (righteous predecessors), which demonstrate what we are obligated to believe in with respect to the best of creation after the Prophets and Messengers. One thing we must understand is that defaming these chosen and unique individuals is equal to defaming the Religion itself, since it was none other than them who passed the Religion down to those who came after them. And we already mentioned the words of Abu Zur&#8217;ah, in which he said: &#8216;The only ones who brought this Qur&#8217;aan and Sunan (plural of Sunnah) to us are the Companions of Allaah&#8217;s Messenger. (So) they only wish to disparage and demolish our witnesses so that they can nullify the Book and the Sunnah, whereas they are more deserving of being disparaged for they are the heretics (<i>zanaadiqah</i>).'&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AUTHOR: Imaam &#8216;Abdul-&#8216;Azeez bin &#8216;Abdillaah bin Baaz<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p><strong>About the Book:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a short yet highly beneficial treatise from Imam Ibn Baaz called <strong>Al Aqeedat-us-Saheehah wa maa Yudaaduhaa</strong> (<strong>The Correct Belief and what Opposes It</strong>). The Arabic source for this translation can be found on Imaam Ibn Baaz&#8217;s web site at <a href="http://www.binbaz.org.sa" rel="nofollow">http://www.binbaz.org.sa</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">In this treatise, Imaam Ibn Baaz. may Allaah have mercy on him, outlines the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah with regard to Eemaan (Faith), Tawheed, Worship, and Allaah&#8217;s Names and Attributes in a concise and informative manner. He divides his discussion into six sections basing iron the six pillars of Eemaan (Faith), which are: Belief in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and Divine Pre-Decree. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">At the end of the treatise, the Imaam presents ten of the most significant things that nullify and invalidate a person&#8217;s Islaam, basing that on the famous treatise of Imaam Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdul-Wahhaab known as The Nullifiers of Islaam.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise is an excellent resource for new and beginning Muslims to learn about the fundamentals of their Religion in a brief and simple manner. It is for this reason that we chose this essay, hoping that it may be of benefit to those whom it reaches.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<a href="https://abdurrahman.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/the-correct-belief-and-what-opposes-it-the-nullifies-of-islaam-bin-baaz-al-ibaanah-com.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Download the PDF eBook</strong></a>]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>The Full content of the Book below :</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">INTRODUCTION</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, the Bestower of Mercy. All praise is for Allaah alone, and may the peace and blessings be upon the one after whom there is no messenger, as well as his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">To Proceed:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since having the correct belief is the foundation and basis of the Religion of Islaam, I felt that it should be the topic of this lecture.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well known from the religious texts of the Qur’aan and the Sunnah that a person’s statements and actions are only considered valid and acceptable (by Allaah) if they are produced as a result of having the correct belief. So if one’s beliefs are not correct, he invalidates whatever statements and actions branch out from it, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And whoever rejects Faith (Eemaan), then he has nullified his good deeds, and in the Hereafter, he will be from among the losers.”</strong> [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And it has been revealed to you (O Muhammad) and to those before you that: If you mix partners in worship with Allaah, your good deeds will surely be cancelled out, and you will indeed be from the losers.”</strong> [Surah Az-Zumar: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verses (from the Qur’aan) bearing this same meaning are many. The clear Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His trustworthy messenger, may the best of his Lord’s peace and blessings be on him, indicate that the Correct Belief can be summed up in:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah, His Angels, His (revealed) Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and the Divine Pre-Decree, the good and the bad of it. So these six things form the foundations of the Correct Belief, with which Allaah sent down His mighty Book, and with which Allaah sent His messenger, Muhammad, peace and blessings be on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything that one is obligated to have faith in from the matters of the Unseen, as well as everything that Allaah and His Messenger have informed of branch out from these six foundations. The proofs for these six foundations in the Qur’aan and the Sunnah are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among them is the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Righteousness (Birr) is not that you turn your faces towards the east and the west (in prayer), but rather righteousness is (for) the one who believes in Allaah, the Last Day, the Angels, the Books and the Prophets.”</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 177]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and so do the believers – all of them believe in Allaah, His Angels. His Books and His Messengers. (And they say): We make no distinctions between any of His Messengers.”</strong> [Surah AlBaqarah: 285]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O you who believe! Believe in Allaah and His Messenger and the Book that was revealed to His Prophet and the Scripture that was revealed in the past (before him). And whoever disbelieves in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers and the Last Day has gone far astray.”</strong> [Surah An-Nisaa: 136]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Don’t you know that Allaah knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth? Verily, it is all (written) in the Book (Preserved Tablet). Verily, that is easy for Allaah.”</strong> [Surah AlHajj: 70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the authentic ahaadeeth that indicate these foundations, then they are many. Amongst them is the famous authentic hadeeth reported by Muslim in his Saheeh in which ‘Umar bin AlKhattaab (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) narrated that (the angel) Jibreel asked the Prophet about Eemaan (Faith). So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) replied to him: <strong>“Eemaan (Faith) is to believe in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day, and to believe in Divine pre-Decree, the good of it and the bad of it.”</strong> This hadeeth was transmitted by AlBukhaaree and Muslim from Abu Hurairah (radyAllaahu ‘anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the six foundations from which everything a Muslim is obligated to believe in originates, whether it be with respect to Allaah, the Day of Judgement, and anything else from the Unseen (Ghaib).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>FIRST: FAITH IN ALLAAH</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah entails: Believing that He is the only true God that has the right to be worshipped apart from everyone else, due to His being the Creator of the servants (i.e. humans/jinn), the One who is kind to them, the Grantor of their sustenance, the All-Knower of their inner and outer actions, the One who is All-Able to reward those who obey Him and punish those who disobey Him. Allaah created these two species (the Jinn and mankind) for the purpose of this worship, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And I did not create the Jinn and mankind except to worship Me. I do not seek any provision from them nor that they should feed Me. Verily, Allaah is the All-Provider, Owner of Power, Most Strong.”</strong> [Surah Adh-Dhaariyaat: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O you who believe! Worship your Lord who created you and those before you in order that you may gain Taqwaa (fear and dutifulness to Allaah). He is the One who made the earth a resting place for you and the sky as a canopy, and sent down water (i.e. rain) from the sky and brought forth therewith fruits as a provision for you. So do not set up rivals with Allaah while you know (that only He is to be worshipped).”</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent Messengers and revealed Scriptures to clarify this truth and call to it and to warn from what opposes it, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And we have indeed sent to every nation a Messenger (saying): Worship Allaah alone and avoid the false deities.”</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And We did not send any messenger before you except that We revealed to Him: No one has the right to be worshipped but I, so worship Me.”</strong> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“(This is) a Book, the Verses whereof are perfected and then explained in detail from One (Allaah) who is All-Wise and Well-Acquainted (with all things): (Saying) worship none but Allaah. Verily, I (Muhammad) am unto you from Him a warner and a bringer of glad tidings.”</strong> [Surah Hood: 1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reality (meaning) of this worship is to: Single Allaah out in everything that the servants worship Him with, such as supplication, fear, hope, prayer, fasting, sacrificing, making oaths and all the other types of worship with full submission, whilst fearing (His Punishment) and hoping (for His reward), having complete love for Him, and humbling oneself to His Grandness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A large part of the noble Qur’aan was revealed concerning this great principle (i.e. worship), such as Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;So worship Allaah, making the worship sincerely for Him alone. Verily, to Allaah belongs the pure (sincere) religion (i.e. worship).”</strong> [Surah Az-Zumar: 2-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Israa: 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So call upon Allaah, making your worship purely for Him alone, even though the disbelievers may hate it.”</strong> (Surah Ghaafir: 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the two Saheeh collections, Mu’aadh reported that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>“The right Allaah has over His servants is that they worship Him alone and not ascribe any partners to Him.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Having Faith in Allaah also entails believing in everything that He has ordered and made obligatory upon His servants, such as the five outer pillars of Islaam, which are:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Testifying that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah<br />
2. Establishing the Prayer<br />
3. Giving the Zakaat<br />
4. Fasting in Ramadaan, and<br />
5. Making the pilgrimage (Hajj) to the Sacred House of Allaah, for those who are able to perform it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This goes as well for the other obligations that have come with the pure legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most important and greatest of these (five) pillars is: Testifying that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Testifying that there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah requires that worship be performed purely for Allaah alone, and negates it from everyone else besides Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is intended by the statement Laa Ilaaha IllaaAllaah, for it’s meaning is: There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Allaah. So everything that is worshipped besides Allaah, such as a human being or an angel or a Jinn or anything else, then they are worshipped wrongfully. The One who is worshipped truthfully is Allaah alone, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;That is because Allaah, He is the Truth (only true God), and what they invoke on besides Him is falsehood.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hajj: 62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have explained previously that Allaah created the two species (Jinn and mankind) for the purpose of this great principle, and that He commanded them with it, sent His messengers because of it and revealed His Books for it. So think about this and reflect on it much so that it could become clear to you what a majority of the Muslims have fallen into from manifest ignorance of this fundamental principle such that they worship others along with Allaah and direct His sole rights to other than Him, may Allaah aid us!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah also entails: Believing that Allaah created all that exists and manages and administers all of their affairs, through His Knowledge and Ability, as He wills. And it entails believing that He is the Owner of this world and the Hereafter, and the Lord of all of the worlds, there being no Creator besides Him or Lord like Him. He sent Messengers and revealed Scriptures to rectify the servants and to call them to that which contains their salvation and success in the current life as well as the Hereafter. And it entails believing that He has no partner in all of that, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Allaah is the Creator of everything, and He is the Guardian of all affairs.&#8221;</strong> [Surah AzZumar: 62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Indeed your Lord is Allaah, Who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then rose over the Throne (in a manner that befits His Majesty). He covers the night with the day, seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun, the moon, and the stars, (all) are subjected to His Command. Surely, to Him belongs the Creation and the Command. Blessed be Allaah, Lord of all that exists.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah also entails: Believing in Allaah’s Perfect Names and Attributes, which have been mentioned in His mighty Book and authentically reported on His trustworthy Messenger, without distorting their meanings (tahreef), denying them (ta’teel), describing their manner (takyeef) or making similarities to them (tamtheel). Rather, they must be left in the manner they were reported without describing how they are, whilst believing in the great meanings they carry, which are descriptions of Allaah. It is obligatory to describe Him with them (i.e. these Names and Attributes) in a manner that befits Him without allowing for His creation to resemble Him in any of His Attributes, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“There is nothing like Him in comparison and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.”</strong> [Surah Ash-Shooraa: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“So do not put forth similarities to Allaah. Verily, Allaah knows and you know not.&#8221;</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 74]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Creed and Belief of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger and those who succeeded them upon goodness. And this is what Imaam AbulHasan Al-Ash’aree, may Allaah have mercy on him, reported in his book “Al-Maqaalaat ‘an As’haab-il-Hadeeth wa Ahlis-Sunnah”, as did other scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awzaa’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “Az-Zuhree and Mak’hool were asked about the verses regarding Allaah’s Attributes, so they replied: ‘Leave them as they have been reported.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Waleed bin Muslim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “Maalik, Al-Awzaa’ee, Al-Layth bin Sa’ad, and Sufyaan Ath-Thawree were asked about the texts that were reported concerning Allaah’s Attributes, so they all said: ‘Leave them as they have been reported without describing how (they are).’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Awzaa’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “We used to say, while the Taabi’oon (Successors of the Companions) were present and abundant, that Allaah is above His Throne and that we believe in what has been stated in the Sunnah regarding His Attributes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Rabee’ah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan, the teacher of Maalik, was asked about Allaah’s rising over His Throne, he replied: “The Rising is not (something) unknown and how it is done is incomprehensible. From Allaah is the Message and upon the Messenger is to openly convey it, and upon us is to believe in it.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And when Imaam Maalik was asked about it, he said: “The Rising is well known, how it is done is unknown, believing in it is an obligation and asking concerning it is an innovation.” Then he said to the questioner: “I do not consider you to be anything but an evil man.” And he put someone in charge of him and he was cast out, Something with the same meaning was also reported on the Mother of the Believers, Umm Salamah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Abu ‘Abdir-Rahmaan ‘Abdullaah bin Al-Mubaarak, may Allaah have mercy on him, said: “We know our Lord as being above His heavens and over His Throne, apart from His creation.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statements of the Imaams regarding this subject are many and cannot all be quoted in this small treatise. Whoever wants to come across many of these narrations should refer to what the scholars of the Sunnah wrote regarding this topic, such as the book “As-Sunnah” of Imaam ‘Abdullaah, son of Imaam Ahmad, the book “At-Tawheed” of the noble Imaam, Muhammad bin Khuzaimah, the book “As-Sunnah” of Abul-Qaasim Al-Laalikaa’ee At-Tabaree, the book “AsSunnah” of Abu Bakr Ibn Abee ‘Aasim, as well as the response that Shaikh-ul-Islaam Ibn Taimiyyah wrote to the people of Hamaa (i.e. ‘Aqeedah Hamawiyyah), which is a tremendous response containing many benefits. In this treatise, he, may Allaah have mercy on him, explains the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah and quotes many of their statements, as well as religious and intellectual evidences for the authenticity of what Ahlus-Sunnah believes and the falseness of what their opponents believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes for his distinguished treatise “At-Tadmuriyyah”, for in it he goes into depth clarifying the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah based on their textual and logical proofs, and refuting the opponents with arguments that manifest the truth and invalidate the falsehood for anyone amongst the people of knowledge who examines it with a pure intention and a genuine desire for learning the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone that opposes Ahlus-Sunnah in what they believe regarding the subject of Allaah’s Names and Attributes no doubt will fall into opposing the textual and logical evidences while having clear contradictions in everything that he affirms and negates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But as for Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, then they affirm for Allaah what He has affirmed for Himself (from Names and Attributes) in His noble Book or what His Messenger Muhammad has affirmed for Him in his authentic Sunnah without tamtheel (i.e. resembling them to someone else’s names and attributes). And they negate and remove Him from resembling His creation in any way, in such a manner that is free from ta’teel (i.e. denying the Names and Attributes). So they have been saved from contradictions, while acting upon all of the proofs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of Allaah with regard to he who accepts the truth that the Messengers were sent with, expends all of his efforts in that, and sincerely asks Allaah to grant him the truth and make the correct view apparent to him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Nay, We fling the truth against falsehood, so it destroys it, and behold, it is vanished.”</strong> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And no example or similitude do they bring to you (in order to find fault in you or the Qur’aan), except that We reveal to you the truth (against that similitude) and the best explanation (thereof).&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Furqaan: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his famous Tafseer, while speaking about the statement of Allaah: <strong>“Indeed your Lord is Allaah, who created the heavens and the earth in six days, then rose over the Throne”</strong> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 54], Al-Haafidh Ibn Katheer, may Allaah have mercy on him, stated some excellent words on this subject, which we would like to quote here due to their great benefit:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“People have many views with regard to this subject and this is not the place to go into that. But rather, with regard to this topic, (I say that) we traverse the way of the pious predecessors: Maalik, Al-Awzaa’ee, Ath-Thawree, Al-Layth bin Sa’ad, Ash-Shaafi’ee, Ahmad, Ishaaq bin Raahawayh, and other Muslim Imaams from the past and present…” – which is to leave them as they have been reported without describing their manner (takyeef), making resemblances to them (tashbeeh), and denying them completely (ta’teel).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the thoughts that present themselves to the minds of those who give Allaah’s Attributes similitudes is negated from Allaah, for indeed nothing can resemble Allaah from His creation. There is nothing like Him in comparison and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. Rather, the matter is as the Imaams have stated, amongst whom was Na’eem bin Hamaad Al-Khuzaa’ee, the teacher of Al-Bukhaaree, who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Whoever likens Allaah to His creation has committed disbelief. And whoever denies what Allaah has described Himself with has committed disbelief. There is no tashbeeh (likening to the creation’s attributes) in what Allaah and His Messenger have described Him with. So whoever affirms for Allaah what has been stated in the clear verses and authentic reports, in the manner that befits Allaah’s majesty, while negating all deficiencies from Him, has embarked on the path of guidance.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">SECOND: FAITH IN THE ANGELS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This entails believing in them generally and specifically. Therefore, the Muslim must believe that Allaah has angels, which He created to obey Him. And He described them as being honorable servants who do not precede Him in speech and act on His Command.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He knows what is before them and what is after them, and they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him.”</strong> [Surah Al-Anbiyaa: 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are of many types, amongst them are those who are entrusted to hold the Throne, and amongst them are those who guard Paradise and Hell. And amongst them are those who are entrusted to record the deeds of people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Specifically, we must believe in those angels that Allaah and His Messenger have mentioned by name, such as Jibreel, Mikaa’eel, Maalik, the gatekeeper of Hell, and Israafeel, the angel in charge of blowing the Trumpet. He (Israafeel) has been mentioned in several authentic ahaadeeth. It is authentically reported in the Saheeh that ‘Aa’ishah (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) narrated that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “<strong>The angels were created from light, and the Jinn were created from a smokeless flame of fire. And Aadam was created from what has already been described to you</strong>.” [1] Reported by Muslim in his Saheeh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">THIRD: FAITH IN THE REVEALED BOOKS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must believe generally that Allaah revealed books to His prophets and messengers in order to explain His right and to call to it, as Allaah states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Indeed, We have sent Our messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Book and the Balance in order that mankind may establish justice.”</strong> [Surah Al-Hadeed: 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Mankind was once one nation (upon polytheism) so Allaah sent prophets bearing good news and warning, and with them He sent down the Book in truth to judge between people in matters wherein they differed.”</strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 213]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And we must believe, in specific and detailed terms, those books that Allaah has mentioned by name, such as the Torah (Tawraat), the Gospel (Injeel), the Psalms (Zaboor) and the Qur’aan. The noble Qur’aan is the best amongst them and the final revelation. And it is that which supercedes all of them and confirms them. And it is the Book that all of the (Muslim) nation is obligated to follow and to judge by, along with what is authentically reported in the Sunnah from Allaah’s Messenger. This is since Allaah sent His Messenger, Muhammad, as a messenger to everyone from the two species (i.e. Jinn and mankind), and He revealed this Book to him so that he could judge them by it. He also made it a cure for the hearts, a source of explanation for everything, and a guide and a mercy to the believers. This is as Allaah states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And this (Qur’aan) is a blessed Book, which We have revealed, so follow it and be dutiful (to Allaah) so that you can receive (His) mercy.”</strong> [Surah Al-An’aam: 155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And We revealed to you (O Muhammad) the Book (i.e. the Qur’aan) as an explanation for everything, a guide and a mercy and glad tidings for the Muslims.”</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 89]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Say (Muhammad): O mankind! Verily, I am the Messenger of Allaah sent to all of you (by) the One to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. No one has the right to be worshipped except Him. It is He who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allaah and His Messenger, the unlettered prophet (i.e. cannot read or write), who believes in Allaah and His revelations, and follow him so that you may be guided.”</strong> [Surah Al-A’raaf: 158]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The verses bearing this meaning are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">FOURTH: FAITH IN THE MESSENGERS</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One must believe in the messengers both in general and in detail. This means, he must believe that Allaah sent to His servants messengers from among them, bringing glad tidings (of Paradise) and warning (of the Hellfire) and calling them to the truth. So whoever answered their call, achieved success and whoever opposed them, failed and will regret.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last and most virtuous of them is our prophet, Muhammad the son of ‘Abdullaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And We have indeed sent a messenger to every nation, (saying to them): ‘Worship Allaah and stay away from the false deities.’”</strong> [Surah An-Nahl: 36]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Messengers as bearers of good news and warners – In order that mankind should have no excuse (i.e. proof) against Allaah after the (coming of) Messengers.”</strong> [Surah AnNisaa: 165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but rather he is the Messenger of Allaah and the Seal (last) of the Prophets.”</strong> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the prophets whom Allaah named or for whom it is authentically reported that Allaah’s Messenger mentioned by name, we must believe in him according to the detailed and specific manner, such as Nooh (Noah), Hood, Saalih, Ibraaheem (Abraham) and so on, may Allaah bestow the best and purest of His peace and blessings on them and on our Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>FIFTH: FAITH IN THE LAST DAY</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having faith in the Last Day, then it entails believing in everything that Allaah and His Messenger have informed of concerning what will occur after death, such as the trial of the grave, and the punishment or pleasure that will occur in it. It also includes what will happen on the Day of Judgement such as grief and severities, the placing of the Bridge and the Balance, the accounting (of deeds) and their recompense, and the distribution of the records of deeds to the people. There will be those who will receive their book of deeds on their right hands and those who will receive their book of deeds on their left hands or from behind their backs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also entails believing in the Fountain, which will be given to our Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), and believing in Paradise and Hell, and (believing) that the believers will see their Lord and that He will talk to them, as well as whatever else has been mentioned in the noble Qur’aan and the authentic Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So one is obligated to believe and have faith in all of this, in the manner in which Allaah and His Messenger have explained to us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>SIXTH: FAITH IN THE DIVINE PRE-DECREE</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for having faith in Allaah’s Divine Pre-Decree, then this entails believing in four things: First: That Allaah already knows what has occurred and what will occur. And He knows the conditions of His servants, and He knows their provisions, their life spans, their deeds and other affairs of their lives. Nothing of this remains hidden to Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily Allaah is knowledgeable of everything.”</strong> [Surah Al-Mujaadilah: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;That you may know that Allaah has power over all things, and that Allaah encompasses everything with His Knowledge.&#8221;</strong> [Surah At-Talaaq: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: That Allaah has recorded everything that He has pre-decreed and ordained to occur, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“We know that which the earth takes of them (i.e. their dead bodies), and with Us is a Book preserved.”</strong> [Surah Qaaf: 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And all things We have recorded in a Clear Book.&#8221;</strong> [Surah YaaSeen: 12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Know you not that Allaah knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth? Verily, it is all in a Book (Preserved Tablet). Surely that is easy for Allaah.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Hajj: 70]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: Believing that what He wills is put into effect and carried out. So whatever He wills comes to be and whatever He doesn’t will, will not come to pass. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily, Allaah does what He wills.”</strong> [Surah Al-Hajj: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Verily His Command is that when He desires something, He says to it: ‘Be&#8217;, and it is.”</strong> [Surah YaaSeen: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And you cannot will unless it be that Allaah Wills, Lord of all that exists.”</strong> [Surah AtTakweer: 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: Believing that He created everything that exists, there being no Creator besides Him and no Lord other than Him, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah is the Creator of everything, and He is the Guardian of all affairs.&#8221;</strong> [Surah AzZumar: 62]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“O mankind! Remember Allaah’s Favor upon you! Is there a creator besides Allaah that provides for you from the heaven and the earth? There is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Him, so how can you turn away (from Him)?” [Surah Faatir: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So having Faith in the Divine Pre-Decree entails believing in these four things, according to Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, contrary to those amongst the innovators who reject some of the above.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under Faith in Allaah is: Believing that Faith (Eemaan) is speech and action, which increases with obedience (i.e. good deeds) and decreases with disobedience (i.e. sins), and that it is not permissible to declare anyone among the Muslims a disbeliever due to any sin, besides Shirk and disbelief, whether it be fornication, stealing, dealing in interest, drinking intoxicants, disobeying the parents or any of the other major sins, so long as one does not deem these sins to be permissible. This is based on Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be ascribed to Him (Shirk), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.” [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is also based on what has been authentically reported in the numerous ahaadeeth from the Prophet that: “Allaah will extract from the Hellfire whoever has in his heart an atom’s weight of Faith.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Faith in Allaah also entails loving for the sake of Allaah and hating for the sake of Allaah, as well as making allegiance for the sake of Allaah and making enmity for the sake of Allaah. So the believer loves and befriends the believers, and he hates and has enmity towards the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the head of the believers of this ummah are: the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam). So Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah love and befriend them and believe that they are the best of people after the prophets, due to the Prophet’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The best of generations is my generation, then those that come after them, then those that come after them.” [Its authenticity is agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they hold that the best among the Companions was Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq, then ‘Umar AlFaarooq, then ‘Uthmaan Dhun-Noorain, then ‘Alee Al-Murtadaa, may Allaah be pleased with all of them. And after them (in excellence) comes the remaining ten Companions who were given the glad tidings of Paradise, then the rest of the Companions, may Allaah be pleased with all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they refrain from whatever disputes occurred between the Companions, believing that they were Mujtahideen in that regard, therefore whoever amongst them was correct got two rewards whereas whoever was wrong got one reward. And they love the members of the household of Allaah’s Messenger who believed in him, thus showing allegiance to them. And they show allegiance to the wives of Allaah’s Messenger, the Mothers of the Believers, and are pleased with all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they free themselves from the way of the Rawaafid (Raafidees), who hate and revile the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger and who go to extremes with regard to the members of the Prophet’s Household, raising them above the status Allaah gave them. And likewise they free themselves from the way of the Nawaasib (Naasibees) who disparage the members of the Prophet’s Household with words and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything that we mentioned in this brief treatise regarding the Correct Belief, that Allaah sent His Messenger Muhammad with, is the Creed of the Saved Sect, Ahlus-Sunnah walJamaa’ah, which the Prophet spoke about when he said: “There will not cease to be a group from my ummah victorious upon the truth. Those who break away from them will not be able to harm them, until the Order of Allaah comes.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “The Jews split into seventy-one sects and the Christians split into seventy-two sects. And this ummah will split into seventy-three sects – all of them will be in the Hellfire except one.” So the Companions said: “Which one is it O Messenger of Allaah?” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Those who are upon the likes of that which I and my Companions are upon.” This refers to the Creed that one is obligated to abide by, remain steadfast upon, and be cautious of what opposes it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who deviate from this Creed and those who follow its opposite, then they are of several types: Amongst them are those who worship idols, statues, angels, awliyaa (pious worshippers), Jinn, trees, stones, etc. These people have not answered the call of the messengers. On the contrary they have opposed and rejected them, as Quraish and other Arab tribes did with our prophet Muhammad. They would ask their deities to grant their needs, cure their ill and defeat their enemies, and they would offer sacrifices and make vows to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when Allaah’s Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) forbade them from this and ordered them to sincerely worship Allaah alone, they found this strange and rejected it, saying: “Has he made (all) the gods into one God? This is truly a strange thing!” [Surah Saad: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he did not stop from calling them to Allaah and warning them from Shirk, and from explaining to them the reality of what he was calling to, to the point that Allaah guided those among them whom He guided. Afterward, scores of people entered into the Religion of Allaah and so the religion of Allaah become triumphant over all the other religions after an extensive call and long Jihaad from Allaah’s Messenger, his Companions and those who followed them in goodness. Then the conditions changed and ignorance prevailed over a majority of the creation to the point that a large portion of them turned back to the Religion of the Days of Ignorance, by going to extremes with regard to the prophets and pious worshippers, by supplicating to them, seeking assistance from them and performing other forms of Shirk. And they didn’t know the meaning of Laa Ilaaha IlaaAllaah, the way the disbelieving Arabs (during the time of the Prophet) used to understand it, and we seek Allaah’s aid!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Shirk has not stopped spreading amongst the people even to this time of ours due to the overwhelming magnitude of ignorance and the long distance of time that has passed since prophethood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The argument that these contemporary people use as proof is the same argument that those in the past used, which is their saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“These (idols) are our intercessors before Allaah” [Surah Yoonus: 18] and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“We only worship them so that they can bring us closer to Allaah.” [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah has invalidated this argument and clarified that whoever worships other than Him, whoever it may be, has ascribed partners to Him and disbelieved, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And they worship besides Allaah (false deities) that can neither harm them nor benefit them, and they say: ‘These (idols) are our intercessors before Allaah.’” [Surah Yoonus: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah refuted them saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Say: &#8216;Are you informing Allaah of something He doesn’t know in the heavens and the earth? Far removed and High above is He from the partners they ascribe to Him!’” [Surah Yoonus: 18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah explains in these verses that worshipping others besides Him, such as prophets, pious worshippers or anyone else, is considered major Shirk, even if those who commit it may call it by another name. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Those who take others as supporters besides Allaah say: ‘We only worship them so that they can bring us closer to Allaah.’” [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah refuted them by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily Allaah will judge between them concerning that which they differed on. Verily, Allaah does not guide he who is a liar, a disbeliever.” [Surah Az-Zumar: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He clarified by this that their worship of others besides Him, be it through supplication, fear, hope and so on is in fact disbelieving in Him. And He denied their statement that their gods would bring them closer to Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the ideologies of disbelief that contradict the authentic Creed and oppose what the messengers came with is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What the atheists of this era believe in, such as the followers of Marx, Lenin and others who call to atheism and disbelief, regardless of whether they call that socialism, communism, ba’athism or any other name, for indeed from the base principles of these atheists is the belief that there is no god and that life is only (based on) matter. And from their principles is to reject the Day of Final Return, Paradise, Hellfire, and to disbelieve in all of the religions. Whoever examines their books and studies what beliefs they were upon will come to know that with full certainty. No doubt this belief is in contradiction to all of the heavenly revealed religions and leads its followers to the worst of fates in this world and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the beliefs that are in opposition to the truth is that which some of the Baatinees and Sufis believe in that some of those whom they call awliyaa (saints) share with Allaah in His administration, and that they manage the affairs of the world. They call them Aqtaab, Awtaad, Aghwaath and other names that they have devised for their (false) gods. This is from the vilest forms of Shirk committed with regard to Allaah’s Lordship, and it is worse than the Shirk (polytheism) that was performed during the Days of Ignorance of the Arabs. This is since the disbelievers among the (first) Arabs did not commit Shirk with regard to Allaah’s Lordship, but rather they would only ascribe partners to Allaah in His worship. And their Shirk would occur during times of ease only. But as for times of distress and dire need, they would worship</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sincerely, as Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when they embark on a ship, they invoke Allaah, making their Faith pure for Him alone. But when He brings them safely to land, behold, they give a share of their worship to others.” [Surah Al-‘Ankaboot: 65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Allaah’s Lordship, they used to acknowledge that it belonged solely to Allaah alone, as He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And if you were to ask them who created them, they would surely say &#8216;Allaah.’&#8221; [Surah Az-Zukhruf: 87]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Say: &#8216;Who provides for you from the heaven and from the earth?’ Or ‘Who has power over hearing and sight?’ And ‘Who brings out the living from the dead and the dead from the living?’ And ‘Who administers all of the affairs?&#8217; They would surely say: &#8216;Allaah.&#8217; Say: &#8216;Will you not then fear and be dutiful to Him?’” [Surah Yoonus: 31] The verses bearing this same meaning are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the contemporary polytheists, they have surpassed the first polytheists in two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: Some of them ascribe partners to Allaah in His Lordship</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: They commit Shirk (polytheism) in times of comfort and in times of distress, as can be understood by the one who mixes with them, examines their conditions and looks at what they do at the gravesites of Al-Husayn, Al-Badawee and others in Egypt, and at the gravesite of Al-‘Eidroos in ‘Aden, Al-Haadee in Yemen, Ibn ‘Arabee in Syria, Shaikh ‘Abdul-Qaadir AlJilaanee in Iraq, and all the other gravesites that the common folk have gone to extremes about and to which they have transferred many of Allaah’s sole rights. How few are those who forbid them from this and explain to them the reality of Tawheed, which Allaah sent our prophet Muhammad and the messengers before him with. So verily to Allaah we belong and verily to Him we will return!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to return them to what is correct and to place many callers of guidance amongst them and that He grant the Muslim leaders and scholars the ability to wage war against this Shirk (polytheism), verily He is the All-Hearer, the All-Encompassing. And from the beliefs that oppose the Correct Creed with regard to Allaah’s Names and Attributes are the beliefs of the innovators from the Jahmiyyah and the Mu’atazliah, as well as those who follow their way, which is that of negating Allaah’s Attributes, denying His Attributes of perfection, and describing Him with attributes of non-existence and inanimateness. Far removed is Allaah from their views!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What falls under this category are those who negate some of Allaah’s Attributes while affirming others, such as the Ash’arees, for indeed those Attributes that they do affirm necessitates the same thing that they are fleeing from with regard to the Attributes that they negate and whose evidences they misinterpret. So because of this, they have opposed the textual and logical proofs and fallen into clear contradiction. But as for Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, they affirm all the Names and Attributes that Allaah has affirmed for Himself or that His Messenger Muhammad has affirmed for Him, in a perfect manner. And they make Him free from resembling His creation in any way, without resorting to complete denial (of His Attributes). So they act upon all of the textual evidences, not distorting them or rejecting them. Thus they saved themselves from the contradictions that others fell into, as we have explained previously. This is the path of salvation and prosperity in this world and in the Hereafter. And it is the Straight Path, which the predecessors and Imaams of this ummah treaded upon. And (know) that the last part of this (Muslim) nation will not be rectified except with that which rectified its first part, and that is: Following the Qur’aan and the Sunnah and abandoning what opposes them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>THE NULLIFIERS OF ISLAAM</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know O Muslim brother that Allaah has obligated all of His servants to enter the fold of Islaam, to hold tightly onto it and to beware of those things that oppose it. And He sent His Prophet, Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), to call the people to that, informing us that whoever follows him is guided, whereas whoever turns away from him is astray. In many ayaat (verses) of the Qur’aan, He has warned us about the things that cause one to apostate as well as all the rest of the types of Shirk (polytheism) and Kufr (disbelief).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars, may Allaah have mercy on them, have mentioned in their chapters on the “Ruling of the Apostate”, that a Muslim may apostate from his Religion through various types of Nullifiers (of Faith), which cause his life and wealth to become permissible (for taking) and which causes him to leave from the fold of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the most dangerous amongst them and those that occur most often are ten nullifiers [2] that we will mention to you in the following lines, in a summarized manner, so that you may beware of them and warn others about them, hoping that Allaah will protect and safeguard us from them. We will also mention a few short clarifications after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: Shirk (associating partners) in the worship of Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners be associated with Him in worship (Shirk), but He forgives what is less than that to whom He wills.” [Surah An-Nisaa: 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily, the one who mixes partners in worship with Allaah (Shirk), then Paradise has been made forbidden for him and his final abode will be the Hellfire. And the wrongdoers will not have any helpers (in Hell).” [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What falls into this is supplicating and invoking the deceased, seeking assistance from them, as well as making oaths to them and offering sacrificial animals to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Whoever places intermediaries between himself and Allaah, asking them to intercede on his behalf, and relying on them, has committed disbelief according to the unanimous agreement of the scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: Whoever does not hold the polytheists to be disbelievers, or has doubts about their disbelief or considers their ways and beliefs to be correct, has committed disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: Whoever believes that some guidance other than that of the Prophet’s (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) is more complete than his guidance and that someone else’s judgement is better than his judgement, such as those who prefer the judgement of the Tawaagheet (pl. of Taaghoot; false deities/religions) over his judgement, then he is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: Whoever hates something that the Messenger came with, even though he may act on it, has disbelieved, based on Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“That is because they disliked what Allaah sent down, so He nullified their (good) deeds.” [Surah Muhammad: 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth</strong>: Whoever mocks or ridicules any part of the Messenger’s Religion or its rewards or punishments has committed an act of disbelief. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement: “Say: ‘Was it Allaah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking? Make no excuses, you have disbelieved after having had faith.” [Surah At-Tawbah: 65-66]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventh</strong>: Sorcery, which includes magic spells that causes a person to hate (sarf)[3] or love (‘atf)[4] someone/something. So whoever performs it or is pleased with it being done, has committed disbelief. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And neither of these two (angels) would teach anyone until they had first said to them: ‘We are only a trial (for the people), so do not commit disbelief.’” [Surah Al-Baqarah: 102]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eighth</strong>: Supporting and assisting the polytheists against the Muslims. The proof for this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And whoever amongst you takes them (i.e. the disbelievers) as allies and protectors then he is indeed from among them. Verily, Allaah does not guide a wrong-doing [5] people.” [Surah Al-Maa’idah: 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ninth</strong>: Whoever believes that it is permitted for some people to be free of (implementing) the Sharee’ah (revealed laws) of Muhammad (i.e. Islaam), then he is a disbeliever, according to Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And whoever seeks a Religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted from him and in the Hereafter, he will be from among the losers.” [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 85]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tenth</strong>: Turning away from Allaah’s Religion, not learning it or implementing it (is an act of disbelief). The proof for this is Allaah’s saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And who does more wrong6 than he who is reminded7 of the ayaat (signs/verses) of his Lord, then turns away [8] from them. Verily, We shall extract retribution [9] from the criminals.” [Surah As-Sajdah: 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no difference, with regard to (committing any of) these nullifiers, between the one who jokes, the one who is serious or the one who does so out of fear. However, the one who commits them due to being coerced (is excused). All of these (ten) matters are from the gravest in danger and from those that most often occur. So the Muslim must beware of them and fear from these acts befalling him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What falls into the Fourth Nullifier are those who believe that the man-made laws and constitutions that the people have legislated are better than the Sharee’ah (laws) of Islaam. Or those who believe that it is not correct to implement the Laws of Islaam in the twentieth century.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that this is a cause for the backwardness of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or that it is limited to only playing a part in the relationship between the servant and his Lord and that it should not interfere in the other affairs of life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under this fourth category are those who hold that carrying out Allaah laws, such as cutting off the hand of a thief or stoning a guilty adulterer is not befitting for this modern era.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What also falls under this category are those who believe that it is permissible to rule by other than the Laws of Allaah (Sharee’ah) in matters of interactions, penal laws and so on, even if he doesn’t believe that it is better than ruling by the Sharee’ah. This is since by doing this, he will be making lawful that which Allaah has made forbidden, according to the unanimous consensus (Ijmaa’).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone that makes lawful that which Allaah has prohibited from the matters that one is required to know by necessity, such as fornication, alcohol, interest and ruling by other than Allaah’s Laws, then he is a disbeliever according to the Ijmaa’ (unanimous consensus) of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We seek refuge in Allaah from those things that bring about His Anger and painful Punishment. May the peace and blessings be on the best of His creatures, Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[1] Translator’s Note: This means: What has been described to us already in the Qur’aan, as Allaah says: “He created man (Aadam) from sounding clay like the clay of pottery.” [Surah Ar-Rahmaan (55): 14]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[2] As mentioned by the Shaikh and Imaam, Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, and other scholars, may Allaah have mercy on all of them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[3] Sarf: A Magic act done in order to turn a person away from what he desires, such as turning a man away from loving his wife to loving another.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[4] ‘Atf: A Magic act done in order to turn a person towards something that he does not desire, using satanic methods (to achieve it).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[5] Dhaalimoon (wrong-doing people) here means the disbelievers.:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[6] Meaning: “There is no one that does more wrong…”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[7] Tadh-keer (Reminder) means: “Admonishing and drawing one’s attention to something that must be called to mind.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[8] I’raad (turning away) means: “Refraining from and turning one’s back on.”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;">[9] Intiqaam (revenge/seeking retribution) means: “Responding with severity against something that had been done prior.”</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allaah, the One praised in every tongue (i.e. language), the One worshipped in every era. There is not a place that is free of His Knowledge nor does one affair preoccupy Him over another. He is far beyond any equals and rivals, as well as being free of any wife or children. His Decree is carried out in all of His servants. No intellect can derive an example of Him with its pondering, nor can any heart attempt to depict Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the AllHearer, the All-Seer.”</strong> [Surah Ash-Shoora (42): 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Him belong the best of Names and the most honorable of Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“The Most Gracious (Allaah) rose over the Throne (in a manner that suits His majesty). To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth, and all that is between them, and all that is under the soil. And if you speak aloud, then verily, He knows the secret and that which is yet more hidden. Allaah! None has the right to be worshipped except Him. To Him belong the best of Names.”</strong> [Surah TaHa (20): 5-8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His knowledge encompasses everything. He subjugates all creatures by His Honor and Rule. And His knowledge and mercy engulf everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“He (Allaah) knows what happens to them (His creatures) in this world, and what will happen to them (in the Hereafter) but they will never encompass anything of His knowledge.”</strong> [Surah TaHa (20): 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is described by what He has attributed to Himself in His Magnificent Book and upon the tongue of His honorable Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are obligated to believe in and to welcome with submission and acceptance everything that is mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan or that is authentically reported on the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) concerning Allaah&#8217;s Attributes. And we must abandon opposing it (which is done) by radd (rejection), ta&#8217;weel (distortive misinterpretation), tashbeeh (comparison) and tamtheel (representation). As for what appears unclear from that, then we are obligated to affirm its wording and not oppose it’s (literal) meaning. We are to return the precise knowledge of it to the One who stated it and we entrust it upon the one who transmitted it, following the example of the ones who are deeply endowed with knowledge, those whom Allaah has praised in His manifest Book, saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And those who are firmly grounded with knowledge say: ‘We believe in it (the Qur&#8217;aan); the whole of it (clear and unclear verses) is from our Lord.’”</strong> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan (3): 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says, dispraising the one who seeks the ta&#8217;weel (hidden meaning) of the unclear verses of His revelation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“As for those in whose hearts there is deviation, they follow that which is not entirely clear thereof, seeking fitnah (mischief) and seeking for its ta&#8217;weel (hidden meanings), but no one knows its hidden meanings except Allaah.”</strong> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan (3): 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus Allah has placed the aspect of seeking after the hidden meanings (ta&#8217;weel) as a sign of deviation. And He has placed it at the same level of seeking after mischief, in the dispraise of it. Then He placed a barrier between them and that which they aspire and He cuts off their ambitions from what they seek after, by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“But no one knows its hidden meanings except Allaah.”</strong> [Surah Aali &#8216;Imraan (3): 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the hadeeths: “<strong>Verily, Allaah descends to the lowest heaven</strong>&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Verily, Allaah will be seen on the Day of Judgement</strong>” and what is similar to these ahaadeeth, Imaam Abu &#8216;Abdillaah Ahmad bin Hanbal (rahimahullaah) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;We believe in them and we attest to their verity, without saying how and without ascribing a (fixed) meaning for them. Nor do we reject any part from them. We know that whatever the Messenger came with is the truth. We do not reject what Allaah&#8217;s Messenger came with, nor do we describe Allaah with more than He has described Himself, without limits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: ‘<strong>There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</strong>.’ We say as He has said. We describe Him with what He has described Himself and we do not transgress that. The description of those who (attempt to) describe Him, cannot grasp Him. We believe in the Qur&#8217;aan, all of it, its clear verses as well as its unclear verses. We do not reject any of His Attributes due to a discomfort (that we may perceive towards it). We do not transgress the Qur&#8217;aan and the Hadeeth. And we have no knowledge of how to understand them, except through the affirmations of the Messenger and the confirmation of the Qur&#8217;aan.” Imaam Abu &#8216;Abdillaah Muhammad bin Idrees Ash-Shaafi&#8217;ee, may Allaah be pleased with him, said: “I believe in Allaah and in what has been reported concerning Allaah, upon what was intended by Allaah. And I believe in the Messenger of Allaah and in what has been reported concerning the Messenger of Allaah, upon what was intended by the Messenger of Allaah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way that the scholars of the past and present have followed, may Allaah be pleased with them. They all unanimously agreed on acknowledging, accepting, and affirming what has been mentioned in the Book of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) concerning the Attributes, without turning towards the use of ta&#8217;weel.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have been commanded to follow their way (the Prophet and his Companions) and to be guided by their example. And we have been warned of the newly invented matters and we have been informed that they are from among the things that lead astray. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Khaleefahs (who will come) after me. Bite onto it (i.e. the Sunnah) with your molar teeth and beware of newly invented matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For indeed, every newly invented matter is an innovation and every innovation is a misguidance.” [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah bin Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said: “Follow (the Sunnah) and do not innovate! For you have been sufficed.” [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Umar bin &#8216;Abd-il-&#8216;Azeez (rahimahullaah) said something with the meaning:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Stop where the people have stopped! For, indeed, they stopped upon receiving knowledge. The clear evidences would suffice them and they were the strongest at manifesting it. If there were any addition (to the Religion), they would be most likely to have done it (first). So if you say: it was introduced after them, then no one introduces into it except for he who opposes their guidance and desires other than their example. They have described from it what was enough and they have spoken concerning it what has sufficed. What is above them is excessiveness. And what is below them is inadequacy. Some people have fallen short of them and so they have drawn away. And others have transgressed them and so they became extreme. But indeed, they were between these two, upon a straight guidance.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu &#8216;Amr Al-Awzaa&#8217;ee (rahimahullaah) said: “Stick to the narrations of those who came before you (man salafa), even if the people reject you. And beware of the opinions of men, even if they beautify them for you with their speech.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad bin &#8216;Abd-ir-Rahmaan Al-Adarmee (rahimahullaah) said to a man who was speaking of an innovation and calling the people towards it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Did the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), Abu Bakr, &#8216;Umar, &#8216;Uthmaan and ‘Alee have knowledge of it or did they not have knowledge of it?” He said: “They did not have knowledge of it.” He said: “So something which they had no knowledge of, you know!?!&#8221; The man said: “Then I say that they did have knowledge of it!” He said: “Was it sufficient for them that they not speak about it nor call the people towards it, or was it not sufficient for them?” The man said: “Of course it was sufficient for them.” He said: &#8220;So something which was sufficient for the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and his Khaleefahs is not sufficient for you!?!” So the man refrained (from his call) and the Khaleefah, who was present there, said: &#8220;May Allaah not suffice the one who is not satisfied by what they found sufficient.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, whoever does not feel content with what was sufficient for the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), his Companions, those who followed them in righteousness, the Imaams that came after them and those deeply endowed with knowledge, regarding reciting the verses on (Allaah’s) Attributes, reading the reports about them and leaving them the way they came (i.e. were reported), then may Allaah not suffice him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among what has been revealed in the verses concerning Allaah’s Attributes, is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And the Face of your Lord, full of Majesty and Honor, will remain forever.”</strong></span> [Surah Ar-Rahmaan (55): 27]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched.” </strong></span>[Surah AlMaa&#8217;idah (5): 64]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement in which He informs us that &#8216;Eesaa bin Maryam said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“You know what is in my inner-self, though I do not know what is in Your Self.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Maa&#8217;idah (5): 116]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“And your Lord comes…”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Fajr (89): 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>“Do they then wait for anything other than that Allaah should come to them.”</strong></span> [Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 210]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him.”</strong> [Surah Al-Maa&#8217;idah (5): 119]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Allaah will bring a people whom He will love and they will love Him.”</em> </span>[Surah AlMaa&#8217;idah (5): 54]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement concerning the disbelievers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“And the Anger of Allaah is upon them.”</em></span> [Surah Al-Fath (48): 6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“That is because they followed that which discontented Allaah…”</em></span> [Surah Muhammad (47): 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“But Allaah disliked their being sent forth.”</em></span> [Surah At-Tawbah (9): 46]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Sunnah is the statement of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Our Lord, may He be Blessed and Exalted, descends to the lowest heaven every night.”</strong> [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Your Lord is amazed by the youth who does not possess childish manners.”</strong> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Allaah laughs at two men – one of whom kills the other, then they both enter Paradise.”</strong> [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We believe in this and what is similar to it, from that which has an authentic chain and reliable reporters. We do not reject it nor do we negate it. Nor do we change its meaning with something that contradicts what is literally apparent from it. We do not compare it to the attributes of the creation nor by (using) the naming schemes of the innovators. And we know that Allaah, Glorified and Exalted, has no equal or comparison.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“There is nothing whatsoever like Him (in comparison). And He is the AllHearer, the All-Seer.”</strong> [Surah Ash-Shoora (42): 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everything that is imagined by the intellect or pondered in one’s thoughts, then Allaah is contrary to that. Another example is His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;But they give preference to others over themselves, even though they had a need for it.&#8221;</em></span> [Surah Al-Hashr (59): 9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“The Most Merciful rose over the Throne.”</em></span> [Surah TaHa (20): 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Do you feel secure that He, who is above the heavens…”</span></em> [Surah Al-Mulk (67): 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the statement of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Our Lord, Allaah, who is above the heavens! Sanctified be your Name.”</strong> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) saying to the slave girl: “Where is Allaah?” She said: “Above the heavens.” So he said: “Free her, for indeed, she is a believer.” Maalik bin Anas, Muslim and other scholars have reported this hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said to Husayn (bin &#8216;Imraan): “How many gods do you worship?” He said: “Seven. Six in the earth and one above the heavens.” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said “Who is it that you hope in and fear (most)?” He said: “The One that is above the heavens.” He said: “Then abandon the six and worship the One who is above the heavens, and I will teach you two supplications.” So he accepted Islaam and the Prophet taught him to say: “O Allaah, Grant me guidance and save me from the evil of my self.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What was reported in the previously revealed books, concerning the signs of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and his Companions, is that: <strong>“They prostrate on earth while claiming that their god is above the heavens.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawood reported in his Sunan that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: <strong>“Indeed what is between one level of heaven and (another) level of heaven is a distance of such and such…”</strong> He continued until he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) mentioned: <strong>“And above that is the Throne. And Allaah, the One free of all defects, is above that.”</strong> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This and what is similar to it is from what the Salaf, may Allaah have mercy on them, have unanimously agreed on reporting and accepting. And we do not incline towards rejecting it (radd), nor toward distorting its meaning (ta&#8217;weel), nor towards making comparisons to it (tashbeeh), nor towards likening it (tamtheel).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik bin Anas (rahimahullaah) was questioned once, and it was said to him: “O Abu &#8216;Abdillaah! (Allaah says): ‘The Most Merciful rose over the Throne.’ How does He rise?” So he (rahimahullaah) responded: “The Rising (Al-Istiwaa) is not something unkown. How (it is done) is incomprehensible. Believing in it is an obligation. And asking concerning it is an innovation.” Then he put someone in charge of the man and he was thrown out. [9]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE SPEECH OF ALLAAH</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Attributes of Allaah is that He speaks with a speech that is pre-existent. He causes whomsoever He wills to hear it. Moosaa heard it from Him without there being any intermediary. Jibreel heard it, as well as whomever He permits from His angels and messengers. He, the One free from all defects, will speak to the believers in the Hereafter and they will speak to Him. He will grant them permission and they will visit Him. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And to Moosaa, Allaah spoke directly.” [Surah An-Nisaa (4): 164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He (Allaah) said: ‘O Moosaa, I have chosen you above men by My messages, and by My speaking (to you).’” [Surah Al-A&#8217;araaf (7): 144] And He says: “Those messengers! We preferred some of them over others; to some of them Allaah spoke (directly).” [Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 253]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is not for any human being that Allaah should speak to him unless (it be) by Revelation, or from behind a veil.” [Surah Ash-Shuraa (42): 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when he came to it (the fire), he was called by name: ‘O Moosaa! Verily, I am your Lord!’” [Surah TaHa (20): 11-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily, I am Allaah! None has the right to be worshipped but I, so worship Me, and establish the prayer for My Remembrance.” [Surah TaHa (20): 14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible for anyone to say this (last ayah) except Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah bin Mas&#8217;ood (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said: “When Allaah speaks through revelation, the inhabitants of the heavens hear His Voice.” He reported this on the Prophet. [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Abdullaah bin Anees (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) reported that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Allaah will gather the creatures on the Day of Judgement, naked, barefoot, uncircumcised and not having anything with them. He will then call them with a voice that those who are far as well as those who are near will be able to hear: ‘I am Al-Malik (the King). I am Ad-Dayyaan (the Recompenser).’” [11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In some narrations, it mentions that: One night Moosaa saw the Fire and it overthrew him so he became frightened from it. Then his Lord called to him: “O Moosaa!” So he responded quickly, being familiar with the voice: “Here I am to serve you! Here I am! I hear Your voice but I do not see Your place (i.e. where you are). Where are You?” He said: “I am above you and in front of you and on your right and on your left.” So he realized that this attribute did not befit anyone except Allaah. He (Moosaa) then said: “You are just as You say, my Lord. Do I hear Your speech or the speech of one of Your messengers (angels)?” He said: “No, rather My speech, O Moosaa.”</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE QUR’AAN IS THE SPEECH OF ALLAAH</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Speech of Allaah, is the Glorious Qur&#8217;aan. It is the plain Book of Allaah and His firm rope. It is His straight path and the revelation of the Lord of the universe. The most honorable spirit (Jibreel) brought it to the heart of the best of messengers, in a clear Arabic language. It was revealed and not created. From Him it began and to Him it will return.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It consists of precise chapters, clear verses, and letters and words. Whoever recites it and does so properly (with &#8216;Iraab), he will have ten good deeds for every letter he recites. It has a beginning and an end, and it consists of sections and parts. It is that which is recited by the tongues, memorized in the hearts, listened to by the ears, and recorded in the scriptures (masaahif).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In it are verses that are clear and ambiguous, that which abrogates and those that are abrogated, those that are specific and those that are general, and those that contain obligations and prohibitions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Falsehood cannot approach it from before it or behind it. (It is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allaah).” [Surah Fussilat (41): 42]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Say: If mankind and jinn were to gather together to produce the likes of this Qur&#8217;aan, they would not produce the likes thereof, even if they helped one another.” [Surah Al-Israa (17): 88]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Arabic Book of which the disbelievers said concerning it: “We will never believe in this Qur&#8217;aan.” [Surah Saba (34): 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And some of them said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is nothing but the words of a human being!” [Surah Al-Mudaththir (74): 25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I will cast him into the Hellfire.” [Surah Al-Mudaththir (74): 26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them said that it was poetry, so Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And We have not taught him (i.e. Muhammad) poetry nor is it suitable for him. This is only a reminder and a plain Qur&#8217;aan.” [Surah YaaSeen (36): 69] Thus, when Allaah denies that it is poetry and confirms that it is a Qur&#8217;aan, there should not remain any doubt for the one possessing intellect, that the Qur&#8217;aan is that Arabic Book which is composed of words, letters and verses. This is because if it were not so, then they (disbelievers) would not have claimed that it was poetry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah, the Mighty and Sublime, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And if you (disbelievers) are in doubt concerning what We have sent down (i.e. the Qur&#8217;aan) to Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a chapter the like thereof and call your witnesses besides Allaah.” [Surah Al-Baqarah (2): 23] It is not right for Him to challenge them with producing something that they neither know nor understand (i.e. it is words and letters, which they know).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when Our clear verses are recited unto them, those who hope not to meet Us, say: ‘Bring us a Qur&#8217;aan other than this, or change it.’ Say (O Muhammad) ‘It is not for me to change it on my own accord. I only follow that which is revealed unto me.’” [Surah Yoonus (10): 15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This confirms that the Qur&#8217;aan is (made of) verses, which are recited unto them (i.e. the disbelievers).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Nay, but they are clear verses that are preserved in the hearts of those who have been given knowledge.” [Surah Al-&#8216;Ankaboot (29): 49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says after having sworn upon it:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is indeed an honorable Qur&#8217;aan. In a Book well guarded (i.e. Al-Lawh-ulMahfoodh), which none can touch, except the purified (i.e. the angels).” [Surah<br />
Al-Waaqi&#8217;ah (56): 77-79]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Kaaf-Ha-Ya-&#8216;Ayn-Saad” [Surah Maryam (19): 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Ha-Meem. &#8216;Ayn-Seen-Qaaf” [Surat-ush-Shooraa (42): 1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He commences twenty-nine chapters of the Qur’aan with individually separated letters. The Prophet (sallAallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Whoever recites the Qur&#8217;aan and recites it properly, there will be ten good deeds for him, for every letter from it. And whoever recites the Qur&#8217;aan and recites it improperly, there will be one good deed for him for every letter.” [12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (sallAallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Read the Qur&#8217;aan before there comes to you a people who will throw forth its words as fast as an arrow (shoots out), yet it will not pass their throats. They will hasten its reward and not delay it.” [13]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar (radyAllaahu ‘anhumaa) said: “To make &#8216;Iraab of the Qur&#8217;aan (recite it properly with all its rules) is more beloved to us than to memorize some of its letters.” [14]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Alee (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said: “Whoever disbelieves in one letter from it, then he has disbelieved in all of it.” [15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims (i.e. scholars) have unanimously agreed on the number of chapters (suwar), verses, words and letters of the Qur&#8217;aan. There is no disagreement amongst the Muslims (i.e. scholars) concerning the disbelief of one who denies a chapter (surah), verse (ayah), word, or letter from the Qur&#8217;aan, which has been agreed on. There is a clear decisive proof in this that it is (made of) letters.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">THE BELIEVERS WILL SEE THEIR LORD ON THE DAY OF JUDGEMENT</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The believers will see their Lord in the Hereafter with their own eyes and they will visit Him. He will speak to them and they will speak to Him. Allaah says: “(Some) Faces on that Day will be shiny and radiant. Looking at their Lord (Allaah).” [Surah Al-Qiyaamah (75): 22-23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says: “Nay! Surely, they (evildoers) will be veiled from seeing their Lord that Day.” [Surah Al-Mutaffifeen (83): 15]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If Allaah is screened from these people (disbelievers) during a state in which they are in discontentment this indicates that the believers will see Him while being in (the opposite) a state of pleasure. If this were not so, there would be no distinction between the two.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) said: “Indeed, you will see your Lord, just as you see this moon. There is no difficulty in your seeing it.” This is an authentic hadeeth that has been agreed upon. [16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement is a comparison between one manner of seeing with another manner of seeing. It is not a comparison between what is being seen and something else that is being seen, for indeed, Allaah has neither comparisons nor equals.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>THE DIVINE DECREE AND ORDAINMENT OF ALLAAH</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Attributes of Allaah, is that He does whatsoever He wants. Nothing comes to pass, except by His desire (Iraadah) and nothing escapes His Will (Mashee&#8217;ah). There is nothing in this world that escapes from His Preordainment (Taqdeer) and nothing comes to pass except with His Administration (Tadbeer). There is no one that can go around the Preordainment (Qadar) that has been recorded for him. Nor can one transgress the limits of what has been decreed for him in the Written Tablet (Al-Lawhul-Mahfoodh). He wills all that the creation does. Had He made them infallible, they would not disobey Him, and had He willed that they all obey Him, they would surely obey Him. He created the creation and their actions, and He preordained their provision and lifespans. He guides whom He wills by His wisdom. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He cannot be questioned as to what He does, while they will be questioned.” [Surah Al-Anbiyaa (21): 23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:<br />
“Verily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainment).” [Surah Al-Qamar (54): 49]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:<br />
“He has created everything, and so He has assigned its Preordainment.” [Surah Al-Furqaan (25): 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves, except that it is (written) in a Book (Al-Lawh-ul-Mahfoodh) before We bring it into existence.” [Surah Al-Hadeed (57): 22]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And whoever Allaah wills to guide, he opens his breast (i.e. heart) to Islaam. And whoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast (i.e. heart) closed and constricted.” [Surah Al-Ana&#8217;aam (6): 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn &#8216;Umar reported that Jibreel asked the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) what Eemaan was, so he responded: “To believe in Allaah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Last Day and Al-Qadar, the good of it and the bad of it.” So Jibreel told him: “You have spoken truthfully.” Reported by Muslim [17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;I believe in Al-Qadar, the good of it and the bad of it, the sweet of it and the bitter of it.&#8221; [18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the supplications that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) taught AlHasan bin &#8216;Alee and which he himself used to supplicate with during the Qunoot of<br />
Witr, was: &#8220;And save me from the bad of what You have ordained.&#8221; [19]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not use the Qadaa and the Qadar of Allaah as an excuse for us to abandon following His commandments and avoiding His prohibitions. Rather, we are obligated to believe in and know that with Allaah lies the proof (eliminating all excuses) by His revealing of the Books and His sending of the Messengers. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“In order that mankind shall have no excuse (i.e. proof) against Allaah after the (coming of) Messengers.” [Surah An-Nisaa (4): 165]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We know that Allaah, High and Exalted, did not command or forbid except that which can be acted upon or abandoned. He did not force anyone to commit acts of disobedience nor did He compel anyone to abandon obeying Him. Allaah, the Most High, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah has not given any soul a responsibility, except that He has given it the ability (to carry out that responsibility).” [Surat-ul-Baqarah (2): 286]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:<br />
“So fear Allaah as much as you are able to.” [Surah At-Taghaabun (64): 16]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:<br />
“This Day every person will be recompensed for what he earned. There will be no injustice (upon anybody in their judgement) on that Day.” [Surah Ghaafir (40): 17]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that every servant possesses actions and things he earns – he will be recompensed for his good deeds with reward and for his bad deeds with punishment. This will occur by the Divine Execution (Al-Qadaa) and Decree (Al-Qadar) of Allaah.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">EEMAAN IS SPEECH AND ACTION</span></strong></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Eemaan (Faith) is a statement of the tongue, an action of the limbs and a belief of the heart. It increases with obedience and decreases with disobedience. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And they were commanded not, except that they should worship Allaah alone, making the Religion sincere to Him, and establish the prayer, and give the Zakaah. And that is the right religion.” [Surah Al-Bayyinah (98): 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He has placed the worship of Allaah, the sincerity of the heart, the establishment of prayer and the giving of Zakaah, all as being from the Religion (i.e. Eemaan). The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Eemaan consists of more than seventy branches. The highest of them is to testify that La ilaaha illa Allaah (None has the right to be worshipped except Allaah). And the lowest of them is removing a harmful object from the road.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) placed speech and action as part of Eemaan (Faith). Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for those who believe, it has increased their Eemaan.” [Surah At-Tawbah (9): 124]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He says:<br />
“In order that they may grow more in Eemaan (Faith), along with their (present) Eemaan.” [Surah Al-Fath (48): 4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Whoever says: &#8216;Laa Illaaha Illaa Allaah&#8217; and he has in his heart Eemaan, the weight of a wheat grain, or a mustard&#8217;s seed or an atom, he will be extracted from the Hellfire.” Therefore he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) has placed Eemaan at different levels.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT THE MESSENGER INFORMED OF</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are obligated to have Faith in everything that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) informed us about and in what has been authentically attributed to him through reports, whether we witnessed it or it was hidden from us. We know that it is a reality and the truth. This is the same with regard to whether we comprehend it or we do not comprehend it. We do not go beyond the outer actuality (i.e. literalness) of its meaning, such as the hadeeth concerning the Israa and the Mi&#8217;raaj.[20] It occurred while the Prophet was awake and not in a dream, for indeed the Quraish denied it and considered it something incredible. And they did not used to deny dreams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of that, is when the angel of death approached Moosaa in order to take his soul. He (Moosaa) struck him and gouged his eye, so he returned to his Lord who gave him his eye back.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another example of that: are the signs of the Hour, such as the emergence of the Dajjaal, the descent of &#8216;Eesaa bin Maryam, who will then kill him, the coming out of Ya&#8217;jooj and Ma&#8217;jooj, the emergence of the Beast, the rising of the sun from the west, and all that is related to this from what has been authentically reported. [21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The punishment and pleasure of the grave are true. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would seek refuge from it (the punishment) and he commanded that it be done in every prayer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The trial of the grave is true. The questioning of Munkar and Nakeer is true. The resurrection after death is true, and that will occur when Israafeel blows on the trumpet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And behold from the graves they will come out quickly to their Lord.” [Surah YaaSeen (36): 51]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mankind will be gathered on the Day of Judgement, barefoot, naked, uncircumcised, and having nothing with them (i.e. possessions). They will stop at the final place of standing, until our Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) intercedes for them and Allaah, Blessed and Exalted, reckons with them (i.e. judges them). The Balances will be set up, the records will be distributed and the pages containing the deeds of each individual will be dispersed into the right hands and the left hands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Then as for him who will be given his record in his right hand, he surely, will receive an easy reckoning. And will return back to his family in joy! But whoever is given his record behind his back (or in his left hand), he will invoke (for his) destruction. And he shall enter a blazing Fire and made to taste it’s burning flames.” [Surah Al-Inshiqaaq (84): 7-12]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Balance (Al-Meezaan) has two scales and a tongue, with which it will weigh the deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Then those whose Balances (of good deeds) are heavy, they are the successful. And those whose Balances (of good deeds) are light, they are those who lose their own selves, in Hell will they abide.” [Surah Al-Mu&#8217;minoon (23): 102- 103]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Prophet Muhammad (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) will have the Fountain (AlHawd) on the Day of Judgement. Its water is whiter than milk and sweeter than honey. Its drinking vessels are as numerous as the stars in the sky. Whosoever drinks a serving from it, will never thirst again after that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Bridge is true. The righteous ones will cross it and the evil ones will fall from it. Our Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) will intercede for the members of his ummah who have entered the Hellfire due to their major sins. Thus they will be</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">extracted from it due to his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) interceding (for them), but only after having been set ablaze and burned to ashes and charcoal. Then they will enter Paradise due to his intercession.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There will also be interceding done by the rest of the prophets, believers and angels. Allaah says:<br />
“And they cannot intercede except for him with whom He is pleased. And they stand in awe for fear of Him.” [Surah Al-Anbiyaa (21): 28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intercession of the interceders will be of no avail to the disbelievers. Paradise and the Hellfire are two creations that will not cease to exist. Paradise is the abode of the close friends of Allaah, while the Hellfire is the place of punishment for His enemies. The inhabitants of Paradise will abide therein (i.e. Paradise) forever. “Verily, the sinful evildoers will be in the torment of Hell to abide therein forever. (Their torment) will not be lightened for them, and they will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets and sorrows.” [Surah Az-Zukhruf (43): 74-75]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Death will be brought in the form of a sturdy ram and slaughtered between Paradise and Hellfire. Then it will be said: “O inhabitants of Paradise! Eternity for you and no (more) death! And O inhabitants of Hellfire! Eternity for you and no (more) death!” [22]</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>MUHAMMAD, THE SEAL OF THE PROPHETS</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), the seal of the Prophets and the leader of those sent by Allaah. The Eemaan (Faith) of a servant is not valid until he believes in his message and bears witness to his prophethood. Mankind will not be judged on the Day of Judgement except with his (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) intercession. And no nation will enter Paradise, until his nation has entered it first.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He is the possessor of the banner of praise, the most praiseworthy station (almaqaam-ul-mahmood) and the flowing Fountain (Al-Hawd). He is the leader (Imaam) of the prophets, their spokesman and the one who holds their intercession. His (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) nation is the best of nations and his Companions are the best of those who accompanied prophets, may the peace of Allaah be upon them. The best of the Prophet&#8217;s ummah was Abu Bakr As-Siddeeq, then &#8216;Umar Al-Faarooq, then &#8216;Uthmaan Dhun-Noorain, and then &#8216;Alee Al-Murtadaa. May Allaah be pleased with all of them. This is due to what has been reported on &#8216;Abdullaah bin &#8216;Umar that he said: “We used to say, while the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) was alive: ‘The best of this nation, after its Prophet, is Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar, then &#8216;Uthmaan, then &#8216;Alee.’ This would reach the Prophet and he would not oppose it.” [23]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported on &#8216;Alee that he said: “The best of this nation after its Prophet is Abu Bakr, then &#8216;Umar. And if I wanted to, I would have named the third.” [24]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Ad-Dardaa reported that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “The sun does not rise nor does it set upon anyone better, after the prophets and the messengers, than Abu Bakr.” [25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Abu Bakr) was the most deserving of the Khilaafah from all of the creation, after the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), due to his merits, his precedence, and also due to the Prophet&#8217;s preference of him to lead the prayer over all of his Companions, may Allaah be pleased with them. It is also due to the unity in agreement of the Companions upon his precedence and giving the oath of allegiance to him. And Allaah would not have united them in agreement upon something erroneous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then after him was ‘Umar, due to his merits and Abu Bakr&#8217;s empowering it to him. Then ‘Uthmaan due to the preference of him by the members of the governing council. Then &#8216;Alee due to his merits and the unanimous agreement of the people of his time on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the rightly guided Khaleefahs. They are the ones about whom the Messenger of Allaah (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the rightly-guided Khaleefahs (who will come) after me. Bite onto it (the Sunnah) with your molar teeth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “The Khilaafah after me will endure for thirty years.” [26] The last part of it occurred with the Khilaafah of ‘Alee, may Allaah be pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We bear witness that the ten (individuals) will be in Paradise, just as the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) bore witness to it, when he said: “Abu Bakr is in Paradise. &#8216;Umar is in Paradise. &#8216;Uthmaan is in Paradise. &#8216;Alee is in Paradise. Talha is in Paradise. Az-Zubair is in Paradise. Sa&#8217;ad is in Paradise. Sa&#8217;eed is in Paradise. &#8216;Abd-ur-Rahmaan bin &#8216;Awf is in Paradise. Abu &#8216;Ubaydah Ibn AlJarraah is in Paradise.” As for everyone else whom the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) has testified will be in Paradise, then we bear witness to that (as well). This is reflected in his statement: “Al-Hasan and Al-Husayn are the (two) leaders of the youth in Paradise.”[27] And his statement to Thaabit bin Qays: “Indeed, he (Thaabit) is from the inhabitants of Paradise.” [28]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not ascertain for anyone from the people of the Qiblah (i.e. Muslims) that he will be in Paradise or the Hellfire, except for he whom the Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) has ascertained it for. However, we wish well for the good-doer and we fear for the evildoer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We do not declare anyone from the people of our Qiblah (Muslims) a disbeliever due to a sin nor do we cast him out of the fold of Islaam based on a deed. We hold that Hajj and Jihaad are everlasting along with the obedience to every leader, whether he is righteous or evil. In addition, praying behind them (in congregation) is permissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas (radyAllaahu ‘anhu) reported that the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Three things are from the essence of Eemaan: Refraining from (harming) anyone who says: &#8216;Laa Ilaaha Illaa Allaah&#8217;. We do not declare him a disbeliever due to a sin (he may have committed) nor do we cast him out of Islaam due to an action. The Jihaad is everlasting from the time that Allaah sent me to the time when the last part of my ummah fights the Dajjaal. Neither the oppression of a tyrant nor the justice of a righteous leader nullifies it. And (the third is) the belief in Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainment).” Abu Dawood reported it. [29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Sunnah is: Loyalty to the Sahaabah, love for them, mentioning their good qualities, and asking Allaah to grant them mercy and to forgive them. And (also) refraining from mentioning their bad qualities and what they differed in, believing in their virtues and acknowledging their superiority. Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And those who came after them say: ‘Our Lord! Forgive us and our brothers who preceded us in Faith. And put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed.’” [Surah Al-Hashr (59): 10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah. And those who are with him are severe against the disbelievers, while being merciful among themselves.” [Surah Al-Fath (48): 29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Do not revile my Companions, for indeed if one of you were to give in charity, the equivalent of mount Uhud in gold, it would not reach a mudd (handful) of one of them, nor even half of it.” [30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Sunnah is: Being content with the wives of Allaah’s Messenger, the Mothers of the Believers, and the pure ones free from every type of evil. The best of them were Khadeejah Bint Khuwailid and &#8216;Aa&#8217;isha Bint As-Siddeeq, whom Allaah absolved from guilt in His Book. She is the wife of the Prophet in this world and the next. Whosoever discards her from what Allaah has absolved her from, has disbelieved in Allaah, the Most Great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mu&#8217;awiyah is the (maternal) Uncle of the Believers and one of those who wrote down the revelation of Allaah. He was one of the Khaleefahs of the Muslims, may Allaah be pleased with him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From the Sunnah is: Hearing and obeying the Muslim leaders and the Khaleefahs (Ameer-ul-Mu&#8217;mineen), the righteous from among them as well as the evil. This is so long as they do not command us with disobedience to Allaah, for indeed, there is no obedience to anyone if it involves disobedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is obligatory to obey: Whoever is given the Khilaafah while the people agree and are pleased with him, as well as (to obey) the one who fought against the people till he became the Khaleefah and was proclaimed “Ameer-ul-Mu&#8217;mineen.” Opposing him, revolting against him and sowing the seeds of dissension amongst the Muslims against him is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the Sunnah is: Making Hijrah from (i.e. Boycotting) the People of Innovations and separating oneself from them, abandoning arguing and disputing in the Religion, not looking into the books of the innovators and giving attention to their speech. And every newly invented matter in the Religion is an innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anyone who attributes himself with something other than Islaam and the Sunnah is an innovator, such as the Raafidah, the Jahmiyyah, the Khawaarij, the Qadariyyah, the Murji&#8217;ah, the Mu&#8217;atazilah, the Karaamiyyah, the Kilaabiyyah and those similar to them. These are sects of misguidance and groups of innovation. May Allaah grant us refuge from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In respect to an Imaam, concerning the (differing in the) subsidiary issues of the Religion, such as the four madhaahib (schools of thought), then it is not blameworthy. For indeed, differing in the subsidiary issues of the Religion is a mercy and those who differ in it are praiseworthy in their differing, and will be rewarded for their Ijtihaad. Their differing is a vast mercy and their agreement is a conclusive evidence. We ask Allaah that He protect us from innovations and fitnah and that He cause us to live upon Islaam and the Sunnah. And (we ask) that He make us from among those who follow the Messenger of Allaah when alive, and that He resurrect us in his company after death, by His Mercy and His Grace, Ameen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the last of the Creed – all praise is due to Allaah, alone. And may Allaah send His peace and blessings upon our leader Muhammad, his family and his Companions.</p>

And ten evil deeds of his will be expiated and he will be raised ten levels.’” Al-Haythamee said of it: “In its chain is Nuhshal and he is rejected (matrook).” Nuhshal is Ibn Sa&#8217;eed bin Wardaan Al-Wardaanee. Ishaaq Ibn Raahawaih declared him a liar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[13] An authentic hadeeth reported by Ahmad (5/338), Abu Dawood (831) and Ibn Hibbaan (1876 of Al-Mawaarid). Its chain of narration is saheeh as has been stated by Al-Albaanee in As-Saheehah (259). Ibn Qudaamah also mentioned the hadeeth in Al-Burhaan (pg. 35-36) from the report of Sahl bin Sa&#8217;ad.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[14] This is an extremely weak narration reported by Ibn Al-Anbaaree in Al-Waqf wal-Ibtidaa (1/20) with the wording: &#8220;Some &#8216;Iraab (pronouncing properly) of the Qur&#8217;aan is more pleasing to us than memorizing some of its letters.&#8221; Its chain is da&#8217;eef jiddan (very weak) for there is weakness and a break in its chain, according to Badr AlBadr&#8217;s notes to Lumu&#8217;at-ul-&#8216;Itiqaad (19).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[15] Reported by Ibn Abee Shaybah (10/513-514) and Ibn Jareer (At-Tabaree) in his Tafseer (56).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[16] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of the Times of Prayer (no. 573) and Saheeh Muslim: Book of Masjids and Places of Prayer (no. 633) from the hadeeth of Jareer bin &#8216;Abdillaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[17] Saheeh Muslim: Book of Faith (no. 1) and it is also found in the hadeeth of Abu Hurairah in Saheeh AlBukhaaree (no. 50) and Muslim (no. 5)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[18] The chain of this hadeeth is weak. It is reported by Al-Haakim in Ma’arifatu ‘Uloom-il-Hadeeth (31-32) and from that path of narration, by Al-‘Iraaqee in his Sharh of Al-Ulfiyyah (pg. 327), from the path of Yazeed ArRaqaashee on the authority of Anas bin Maalik.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[19] An authentic hadeeth reported by Ahmad (1723), Abu Dawood (1425-1426), At-Tirmidhee (464), An-Nassaa’ee (3/248) and Ibn Maajah (1178) and its chain is saheeh. Ahmad Shaakir (rahimahullaah) authenticated it in his notes to Sunan At-Tirmidhee.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[20] See the hadeeth of Al-Bukhaaree (no. 3207) and Muslim (no. 164) from the report of Anas bin Maalik on the authority of Maalik bin Sa’sah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[21] Refer to An-Nihaayah of Ibn Katheer (rahimahullaah) and Al-Idhaa’ah of Sideeq Hasan Khaan (rahimahullaah) for this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[22] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of Commentary of Surah Maryam (no. 4730)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[23] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of the Virtues of the Companions (no. 3655). And in another wording found in AlBukhaaree (no. 3697), it states: “During the lifetime of the Prophet, we used to not put anyone equal to Abu Bakr, then (the same was with) ‘Umar, then (the same was with) ‘Uthmaan. Then we left the (remaining) Companions of the Prophet alone, not distinguishing between any of them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[24] An authentic narration reported by Ahmad in his Musnad (1/106 &amp; 110) and his son ‘Abdullaah in his Zawaa’id (1/10620110 &amp; 127). Ibn Abee ‘Aasim also reported it in the book As-Sunnah (1201) and Al-Albaanee authenticated it in his checking of As-Sunnah (2/570)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[25] A hadeeth with a weak chain of narration reported by Ahmad in Fadaa’il-us-Sahaabah (135), Ibn Abee ‘Aasim in As-Sunnah (1224) and Abu Nu’aim (3/325) from the hadeeth of Abu Ad-Dardaa. Refer to the comments on this narration found in the checking of Fadaa’il-us-Sahaabah of Imaam Ahmad with the notes of Wasiyullaah bin Muhammad bin ‘Abbaas (1/152-153).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[26] An authentic hadeeth reported by Abu Dawood (4646-4647), At-Tirmidhee (2226) who declared it hasan, AnNasaa’ee in Fadaa’il-us-Sahaabah (52) and Al-Haakim (3/71 &amp; 145) who authenticated it, and Adh-Dhahabee agreed. Refer to Al-Albaanee’s As-Saheehah (459) for a tremendous discussion on it as well as a refutation against those who claim it to be da’eef.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[27] Al-Albaanee authenticated it in As-Saheehah (796), saying: &#8220;For the most part, the hadeeth is authentic, without any doubt about it. Rather, it is mutawaatir as has been stated by Al-Manaawee.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[28] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of Virtues (no. 3613) and Saheeh Muslim: Book of Faith (no. 119) from the hadeeth of Anas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[29] A weak hadeeth reported by Abu Dawood (2532) and Abu &#8216;Ubayd Al-Qaasim bin Salaam in his book AlEemaan (pg. 47). Its chain is weak for in it is Yazeed bin Abee Nushba and he is unknown as is stated in AtTaqreeb. Al-Mundhiree graded its chain weak in his abridgement to Sunan Abu Dawood (3/380) for this reason.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[30] Saheeh Al-Bukhaaree: Book of the Virtues of the Companions (no. 3673) and Saheeh Muslim: Book of the Virtues of the Companions (no. 2541) from Abu Sa&#8217;eed Al-Khudree.</p>

PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p><strong>About the Book: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a complete translation of the booklet Fusool fis-Siyaam war-Taraweeh waz-Zakaat (Lessons on Fasting, Taraaweeh and Zakaat) written by Imaam Muhammad bin Saalih Al Uthaimeen, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this on-line publication was the version of the book available on binothaimeen.org.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Imaam Ibn Al-Uthaimeen discusses various topics concerning Ramadaan, such as fasting, the Taraaweeh prayer and Zakaat-ul-Fitr. He also includes two sections on Zakaat and those who are entitled to receive it since it is the custom of many people to give out their yearly Zakaat during this blessed month of Ramadaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author presents the material broken down into eight short lessons, including proofs and evidences for his points. At times, he goes into detail regarding some issues and gives the correct scholarly opinion with regard to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We hope that this treatise can benefit the English speaking Muslims as we are now well into the month of Ramadaan for this year.</p>

TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p><strong>About the Book: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allaah, before you is a complete translation of the booklet &#8220;<strong>Qiyaamu Ramadaan</strong>&#8221; (The Night Prayer in Ramadaan) of Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this translation was the seventh edition of this book published by Dar Ibn Harm in 1997. This shows the tremendous benefit of this book and the great effect it had on the Muslim ummah, such that it underwent several printings and was spread throughout the Muslim lands.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The treatise was revised and updated after its initial printing. Thus the second edition contains more updated information and reference, and all subsequent editions maintained the same format as the second edition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The book&#8217;s introduction consists of a counter-refutation of those who replied to Al-Albaanee&#8217;s book <strong>Salaat at-Taraaweeh</strong>, namely Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah AI-Ansaaree. But the main core of the book contains a point-by-point discussion on the Night Prayer during Ramadaan, as well as the benefits and rulings of itikaaf. This books serves as an abridgement to Imam Al-Albaanee&#8217;s larger treatise Salaat at-Taraaweeh.</p>

TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of the beneficial treatise of Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, “<i>Shuroot as-Salaat wa Arkaanuhaa wa Waajibaatuhaa.</i>” <b>[The Conditions, Pillars and Requirements of the Prayer]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this short treatise, Imaam Muhammad bin ‘Abdil-Wahhaab, may Allaah have mercy on him, briefly outlines the nine conditions for the acceptance of one’s prayer, as well as the fourteen pillars and eight requirements of the prayer, mentioning some of their proofs and evidences from the Book and the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A condition is something that is required before the commencement of prayer in order for it to be valid. “The pillars are that which if one fails to perform any of them out of forgetfulness or intentionally, his prayer is rendered invalid because of his abandoning it. The requirements are that which if one fails to perform any of them intentionally, his prayer is rendered invalid due to his abandoning it, but if he leaves any of them due to forgetfulness, he is obligated to perform the (extra) prostrations for forgetfulness.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The author also lists the conditions, obligations, requirements and nullifiers of <i>wudoo</i> (ablution). The translator has provided a quick reference guide as an appendix listing each of these points, as well as footnotes with hadeeth references and other comments gathered from several sources of this treatise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The things that nullify (<i>nawaaqid</i>) the ablution are eight: (1) Whatever comes out from the two private parts; (2) Any foul impure substance that comes out from the body; (3) Loss of consciousness (i.e. sleep/insanity); (4) Touching a woman with sexual desire; (5) Touching one’s private part with the hand, whether it is the frontal or rear (private part); (6) Eating the meat of camels; (7) Bathing a deceased person; and (8) Apostating from Islaam, may Allaah protect us from that!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The pillars of the prayer are fourteen: (1) Standing, if one has the ability to do so; (2) The opening Takbeer; (3) Reciting Surah Al-Faatihah; (4) Bowing; (5) Rising from Bowing; (6) Prostrating on all seven limbs; (7) Erecting oneself from it; (8) Sitting between the two prostrations; (9) Remaining tranquil (i.e. not rushing) during all of these pillars; (10) Maintaining the same sequence; (11) the Final Tashahhud; (12) Sitting for it; (13) Sending Salaat on the Prophet; and (14) the (final) two Tasleems.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small booklet titled: <b><i>“Al-Qaradaawee fil-Meezaan”</i></b><i></i> [Al-Qaradaawee on the Scales] compiled and prepared by Naasir bin Hamad Al-Fahd and published by Maktabah Asad as-Sunnah, Egypt (2nd Edition).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This small pamphlet provides a glimpse into some of the peculiar and strange opinions of the well known Dr. Yoosuf Al-Qaradaawee so that the Muslims could be aware of his reality. If it were not for his widespread fame throughout the Muslim and non-Muslim lands, there would be no need for treatises such as this, let alone detailed books, which have also been authored about him by various authors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, for the sake of advising the Muslims and warning them from the dangerous views and philosophy of this individual, these books and treatises were written – this pamphlet being one of the smaller abridged ones. This e-book is in no way meant to be a definitive source or a comprehensive refutation. Rather, the main goal intended here is to provide the readers with a glimpse of some of Al-Qaradaawee’s outlandish views and statements, which prove his remoteness from knowledge and the way of the true scholars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allaah to make this treatise a source of guidance for the Muslims and a means for them to avoid deviation and misguidance and all those who call to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“He said about the Christians: ‘All of the issues that exist between us are common. We are all sons of one country – our destiny is one…our nation is one…I say about them that they are our Christian brothers…but some people condemn me for this…How can I say that they are our Christian brothers when Allaah says: <b>‘Verily the believers are only brothers?’</b>…yes, we are believers but they too are believers from another perspective.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“As for the Raafidah, who inherited the beliefs of the Mu’tazilah and added more grotesque and bizarre views to it of which the least of them is enough to associate them with the likes of Abu Jahl, then you find him defending them and fraternizing with them. In fact, he even regards inciting any conflicts with them as an act of treachery against the ummah. And he considers their cursing of the Companions, their distortion of the Qur’aan, their beliefs that their Imaams are infallible, and their pilgrimage to the gravesites among other things as ‘marginal oppositions to Creed.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said in quote: ‘Unfortunately, I am in my seventies and I go to America to participate in Islamic conferences, but the lectures in these conferences are held with the women on one side and the men on another side. So sternness has overcome the organizations there and they have forced customs on the western community itself to the point that they have followed the stricter views whilst abandoning the more favorable views. So this has resulted in men having their own gathering place apart from the gathering place of women.’”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You will find that the elder figures and prominent members of the Ikhwan-ul-Muslimoon group do not allow one single hair to grow on their faces. And this is even though everyone knows that this person is from the Ikhwan-ul-Muslimeen – I mean by this (especially) the national security forces. So therefore, the issue (of shaving) is not that of someone who is fearful and afraid of being targeted, rather it is a matter of flattering the secular community and presenting the Ikhwani version of Islamic moderation!!! Did you not see their most recent caller, ‘Amr Khaalid, and how he always appears clean-shaven, charming the crowds and demolishing what Ahlus-Sunnah have built, since when confronting the low ones among them, they are faced with the argument: ‘Are you better than ‘Amr Khaalid?!’ As for those from the Ikhwan-ul-Muslimoon that do grow a beard, then it is only a light circular set of hairs around the face – the trademark of the Ikhwan and the practice of Hasan Al-Bannaa, not that of the Prophet! [Written by the Publisher]”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a complete translation of the small booklet <b><i>“Al-Masaa’il-ul-Muntaqaat min Sifaat al-Khawaarij-ul-Ghulaat” </i></b><i></i>[Selected Examples from the Characteristics of the Extremist Khawaarij] compiled and prepared by a student of knowledge, ‘Aadil bin ‘Alee Al-Furaydaan, and reviewed and examined by Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan and Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Khumayyis.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, the author briefly touches upon the definition, history, and characteristics of the Khawaarij, one of the first and most dangerous sects in Islamic history whose effects and ideologies continue to exist up to today and will remain until the Final Hour. The majority of the treatise is dedicated to outlining the major and distinguishing attributes of the Khawaarij, which the author counts at 58.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is important to study and be aware of these attributes so that one may avoid characterizing himself with them and thus fall into the ranks of the Khawaarij. This is from the perspective of learning evil in order to avoid it. And it is also beneficial since today, the ways and ideologies of the Khawaarij are prevalent, as can be seen in terrorist acts, suicide missions, assassinations and political strife. So by understanding the characteristics of the Khawaarij, the reader will be able to identify the perpetrators of such crimes, acknowledge their remoteness from Islaam and the fact that they are indeed from the extremist Khawaarij.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The word <i>Khawaarij </i>is the plural of <i>Khaarijee</i>, and that refers to a person that removes himself from the obedience of the true ruler, outwardly proclaims opposition to him and incites the people against him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“If someone (1) outwardly proclaims rebellion against the Muslim rulers or (2) holds Muslims to be disbelievers due to major sins, apart from Shirk, or (3) justifies the views of the Khawaarij and considers it permissible to shed the blood of Muslims in the name of Jihaad in the Way of Allaah and in the name of changing an evil, then these are all factors for identifying the Khawaarij.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“‘Alee tried to convince ‘Aa’ishah, Talhah and Az-Zubair of the pressing importance of first declaring allegiance to the ruler and then to seek retribution for the murder of ‘Uthmaan. The matter finally became resolved in their mutual agreement to that. However, on the following day, the callers to mischief mobilized their forces and began skirmishes and clashes on both sides. So the peace-makers from both groups thought that the other group had deceived the other, and fighting broke out. The battle that ensued, which later came to be known as the Battle of the Camel, ended with the death of Talhah, Az-Zubair and ten-thousand members from each group.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<b>The Fifteenth Characteristic: </b>They go to extremes in worship. So they perform acts of worship to the extent that those who see them become amazed with them and they become amazed with themselves. [<i>As-Sunnah </i>of Ibn Abee ‘Aasim (no. 945) from the hadeeth of Anas bin Maalik] Ibn ‘Abbaas said: ‘And I have not seen a people that are stricter in their exertion (of worship) than them. Their hands are like the calluses of camels and their foreheads are marked due to the traces of prostration.’ [<i>Majma’-uz-Zawaa’id </i>(6/240)]”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of the small treatise titled <b><i>“Hiwaar ma’a Jamaa’at at-Takfeer”</i></b> (A Debate with the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer) by Imaam Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi’ee, may Allaah have mercy on him. The source used for this e-book was the treatise that is found within Imaam Muqbil’s book Fadaa’ih wa Nasaa’ih (pg. 168-186) [Dar-ul-Haramain: 1st Edition; 1999]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this treatise, Imaam Muqbil refutes the false concepts of the Takfeeri Jamaa’at, a group that was founded in Egypt by a man named Shukree Mustafaa, and which later spread to other Muslim countries. Their beliefs revolve around declaring Muslims to be disbelievers, hence the name Jamaa’at at-Takfeer, declaring the leaders infidels and actively calling the people to revolt against the Muslim governments and anyone that supports them. Even though Mustafaa was executed in 1978, the false concepts of his group have still managed to creep into the hearts of many Muslims today.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This treatise is especially important, since it deals with the beliefs of those who in recent times call to rebellion, revolution, terrorism and those who seek to spread instability in the Muslim lands as well as throughout the world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The best remedy for them is to seek knowledge. As for one of them remaining ignorant and not knowing anything about the Arabic language, and then he says: ‘We are men and the Companions are (also) men’, then yes, you are men and the Companions, too, are men. However, the difference between you and the Companions is like the difference between the heavens and the earth.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Who is it that the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer preys on? They prey on those individuals who have enthusiasm and zeal for their Religion based on ignorance. The founder of the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer, which has appeared during these recent times, was Shukree Mustafaa Al-Misree, who used to be part of the Bankrupt Brotherhood (Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen). Then he experienced great trials in prison and was hardened along with a group of individuals. The governments (at that time) strove hard to disunite the Muslims. So this group would call themselves the Jamaa’at-ul-Hijrah (The Party of Withdrawal). This Shukree Mustafaa used to have some knowledge and he would challenge the faculty of the Azhar University to debate with him, but the Azharees would be afraid due to two reasons: <b>First:</b> All that many of them had to offer was a scanty portion of knowledge of Hadeeth and knowledge of the Book and the Sunnah. So they were either only strong in their knowledge of Grammar or their knowledge of Fiqh. <b>Second:</b> They feared that if they beat him, he and his group (Jamaa’at) would come to them at night and kill them. As a result of this, the group grew and spread. So it originated in the Jamaal ‘Abdun-Naasir Prison and then spread to Sudan and to the lands of the Sacred Precincts (Makkah and Madeenah), inconspicuously, and to Yemen, openly. Jamaa’at Ansaar-us-Sunnah rose against them in Sudan after we said that there were some individuals from the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer amongst them. So they feared that people would hear this speech and therefore not support them anymore.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“So the one who these Takfeeris prey on is the individual who has lots of zeal for the Religion based on ignorance. I challenge all of them – the Egyptians, Sudanese, Yemenis, Kuwaitis and Algerians among them to bring forth one scholar from amongst them. And they claim that they strive hard to have a scholar amongst their ranks! We seek refuge in Allaah from any scholar agreeing with your Da’wah, for he would then be one of the dogs of the Hellfire on the Day of Judgement, and he would shoot out from the Religion just as an arrow shoots out from the hunted game.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This is how Ahlus-Sunnah is, may Allaah preserve them – they are the ones who confront the people of falsehood, such as the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer. Don’t think that I am condoning the other groups, for I consider them to be the product of ignorance and calamities caused by the enemies of Islaam in order to split up the ranks of the Muslims. So I say to the Jamaa’at at-Takfeer: You must repent to Allaah and ask the people of knowledge (when you are unaware of matters), as Allaah says in His Noble Book: <b>‘So ask the People of the Reminder if you don’t know.’</b> [Surah An-Nahl: 43] This is since if you were to ask one of them what’s your proof on raising the hands in prayer, you would find him saying: ‘I don’t know.’ Or if you were to ask him what’s your proof for prostrating on the seven limbs, he would reply: ‘I don’t know.’ But yet after all that, he puts himself in charge of declaring Muslims to be disbelievers! So take things easy, you small ignoramus! How can you put yourself in charge of declaring Muslims to be disbelievers?? By doing this, you would be assisting the Communists, the Ba’athees, the Naasirees and the governments, rather, the enemies of Islaam, in splitting up the ranks of the Muslims. Then you would just dwindle away (and be forgotten) like Shabeeb, Naafi’ bin al-Araq, ‘Imraan bin Hattaan and other heads of the Khawaarij. So the ignorant ones melt way, but the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger remains and continues.”</p>

<p>About the Book:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a traanslation of the small booklet Radd-al-Jawaab alaa man Talaba Minnee &#8216;Adam Taba&#8217;il-Kitaab (Returning a Reply to the one who Requested me not to Print my Book) by Shaikh Ahmad bin Yahyaa An-Najmes, may Allaah preserve him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The original source for this booklet was a letter Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee sent to <strong>Shaikh &#8216;Abdullaah bin Jibreen</strong> in response to a letter he received from the latter requesting him not to print his book Mawrid-ul-Adhb az-Zulaal, which is a valuable work consisting of about 300 pages and provides an in-depth analysis and refutation of the deviant groups, <strong>Jamaaat at-Tableegh</strong> and <strong>Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimoon</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This magnificent book was published in 1418H with forewords from <strong>Shaikh Saalih al-Fawzaan</strong> and <strong>Shaikh Rabee</strong>&#8216; bin Haadee Al-Madkhalee. The letter was also later published and distributed, in order to refute those who misuse Shaikh Ibn Jibreen&#8217;s erroneous  stances regarding <strong>Hasan Al-Bannaa</strong> and the <strong>Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimoon</strong> as a means to attack the Salafi Da&#8217;wah and create disunity amongst its ranks. May Allaah reward Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee for the sincere advise, valuable work and exposition of the deviations of Hasan Al-Bannaa that he produces in this treatise.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Returning a Reply</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allaah, the Most Merciful, Bestower of Mercy</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Ahmad bin Yahyaa An-Najmee to my brother and loved one for the sake of Allaah, a member of the Committee of Religious Verdicts (Daar-ul-Iftaa), Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin ‘Abdir-Rahmaan Al-Jibreen:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-Salaamu ‘Alaykum wa Rahmatullaahi wa Barakaatuh. To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I am in receipt of your kind letter written on 4/11/1418H as well as your valuable gift, which was copies of your precious books, may Allaah reward you with good, bless you, guide you and me and protect you and me from the evils of our souls. And since I am thanking you for the gift, I also thank you for your advice and for your openness, if only they were put in their proper place, since a Muslim is only obligated to accept the advice if that person’s advice implicates an incorrect understanding or an erroneous statement. So I apologize and ask your forgiveness beforehand if I state something in this discussion that you may interpret as being or having in it that which hurts your feelings. So I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You stated in your letter concerning my book <em>“The Pure and Pleasant Spring containing criticisms of the beliefs and actions of some of the Methodologies used in Da’wah”</em>:[1] “I was delighted by this splendid title … (up to where you said) … but when I reached the ninth chapter, I encountered that which I didn’t expect…” I felt saddened upon reading your letter that such a thing would emanate from the likes of someone with your standing, in terms of knowledge and status. Why did you not continue reading it in order to find out if what I had written in it was the truth or falsehood? So if it were true you would then support it, acting on the statement of the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam), the prophet of guidance and the messenger of mercy, when he said: “Assist your brother whether he is oppressing or being oppressed.” It was said: “A person can help him if he is oppressed but how can he assist him if he is oppressing others?” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Impede him or prevent him from oppressing (others).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if what I had written in it were false, you would then assist me by clarifying the truth to me with proofs and evidences. And I would have been ready to accept that from you and to thank you and supplicate for you, because you would have saved me from a sin and a wrong that I would have fallen into. But this is on the condition that this criticism would be detailed with clear proofs and decisive evidences, which would clarify to me my error. But as for you reaching the ninth chapter and then abandoning reading the rest of it and thereafter launching an all-out attack without proofs, then I can never accept this from you or agree with you on it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for your saying that the title pleased you and that you decided to read the whole book, stating: “I was delighted by this splendid title such that I set out to read the entire book. However, in the beginning of it, I found beneficial subjects regarding Calling to Tawheed and the methodologies employed in Da’wah. But when I reached the ninth chapter, I encountered that which I didn’t expect from the likes of you, such as <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>attacks on the personality of Hasan Al-Bannaa</strong></span>. And you unleashed great anger against him”, then I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: Allaah, the All-Knower of what is seen and unseen, knows that I did not intend to attack the honor of anyone, not Hasan Al-Bannaa or anyone else. This is especially since I know that on the Day of Judgement people’s rights will be recompensed with the taking of good deeds (from others’ scales) and the giving of bad deeds (to others’ scales).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: You know that mentioning the bad qualities a person has in him is permissible if it is done for a beneficial reason, and this is from the allowable forms of backbiting. The proof for this is what the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) told Faatimah bint Qays when she came to him seeking advice on who to marry. He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “As for Mu’aawiyah, then he is utterly broke, he has no money. And as for Abu Jahm, then he beats his wives. Instead, marry Usaamah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) consented with Hind bint ‘Utbah’s statement concerning (her husband) Abu Sufyaan that he was: “A stingy man who doesn’t give me enough money for me and my children.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said concerning a man who sought permission to enter his home: “What an evil brother of his family he is.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: You also know that the Scholars of Hadeeth spoke against those narrators who had in them that which necessitated that their reports be rejected and declared weak. So they issued such statements as: “So and so is a liar”, “So and so is a fabricator”, “He narrates from reliable reporters that which is not found in their narrations”, “So and so has weak memory”, “So and so make many errors”, and “So and so is heedless.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They did this out of sincerity to Allaah, His Messenger and the Muslims, and in order to defend the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger from having what isn’t part of it enter into it. This was such that when it was said to one of these scholars: “What will you do when these people – meaning those whom he spoke against and criticized – come to you on the Day of Judgement disputing with you (i.e. seeking their right)?” He responded: “That all of these people be my opponents (on the Day of Judgement) is more beloved to me than that the Messenger of Allaah be my opponent on the Day of Judgement.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So because of this, they spoke out against the criticized narrators without any hesitancy and they considered that as being the best of their deeds, which they hoped would be stored for them and wished would be rewarded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: You stated in your book “The Lone (Ahaad) Reports in the Prophetic Hadeeth” in the fifth chapter on “Efforts of the Scholars in Preserving the Hadeeth” (pg. 30), and you were correct in what you said that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“2. Investigating the Conditions of the Reporters and Researching their Status in Hadeeth and their Qualification for conveying it: They took it upon themselves to speak out against them, from the aspect of sincerity to the ummah, since they were entrusted for conveying something from the affairs of the Religion that had a ruling in it. And they distinguished this aspect as being separate from the general forbiddance of backbiting, due to what it contained from overall benefit to the ummah.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the view of all of the people of knowledge from the scholars of Fiqh and Hadeeth, without exception, may Allaah reward them with good. You will see in what follows that I only spoke against Hasan Al-Bannaa and those who follow his group in order to sincerely advise the ummah. And I am not praising myself, as Allaah knows all that we conceal and reveal and nothing is hidden from Him whether it is in the the heavens or the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: Please think, what is the reason that caused me to speak against this man who died while I was still in my adolescence? [2] He didn’t shed any of my blood or destroy my honor, nor did he take any of my wealth. So what is it that caused me to speak out against him when he didn’t transgress against me personally in any way? If I had spoken against him without him having previously oppressed me or not due to some religious benefit, just speaking against him for the sake of it, then I would be an oppressor and a transgressor and Allaah would take his right from me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth</strong>: We are afflicted in this time of ours with methodologies of Da’wah that have come to us from abroad,[3] which turn the eyes away from Major Shirk and allow it to spread. The greatest of these in terms of self-corruption and corrupting of others is the methodology of the Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen for it indeed brainwashes the minds of the youth who are raised upon its way, transforming them into revolutionists, takfeeris, terrorists and khawaarij. The proofs for this are many, the most significant of them being the own acknowledgement of this by those who bombed the upper part of Riyadh – ‘Abdul-‘Azeez ‘Athaam and his cohorts. So this is what caused me to write about him (i.e. Hasan Al-Bannaa) and his group, before the story of this bombing occurred.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventh</strong>: Concerning your saying that when you reached the ninth chapter, you encountered that which you didn’t expect from me, such as attacking the personality of Hasan Al-Bannaa, and that I unleashed great anger against him and that I took his words to mean what he didn’t intend, my response to this is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you had read the entire book with impartiality, you would have known that I made clear what this methodology and its founder have in them from opposition to the Islamic Legislation and the Creed of the Salaf. He is the one, according to his own brother’s acknowledgement, who would boastfully say, and this is widely circulated in the books of his party:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah raised and scattered (all) the existence and what it contains<br />
So if you desire to attain His perfection<br />
Then everything in the universe if you realize it<br />
is non-existent, specifically and generally.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if you think that I understood from his words that which he didn’t intend, then please interpret for me what this statement of his contains religiously and intellectually, other than wahdat-ul-wujood.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And Secondly:</strong> He is the one who would recite the following poetry: “May the Divine (Allaah) bless the light (i.e. Muhammad) that appeared to the creation and so he surpassed the (light of the) sun and the moon This beloved one (i.e. Muhammad) along with his loved ones has attended And pardoned everyone of what they did and will do (of sins).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Interpret these verses with an interpretation that this wording contains other than that of Major Shirk, as in his statement “And pardoned everyone of what they did and will do (of sins)” and other than that of a lie against Allaah’s Messenger, as in his statement: “This beloved one (i.e. Muhammad) along with his loved ones has attended”, as well as what these words contain from affirming the lies of the Sufis who say that the Prophet attends their innovated gathering, which is nothing else but the celebration of the Prophet’s Birthday.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: Explain to me his praise for Al-Mirghanee, who was well known for wahdat-ulwujood with an explanation that would please Allaah and His Messenger and then the believers other than that he was pleased with wahdat-ul-wujood and praised those who held that view.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: Explain to me the statement he made to the Associated Press: “There is no religious enmity between us and the Jews” with an explanation pleasing to Allaah and His Messenger and then the believers other than the fact that he was flattering the Jews and Christians by lying on Allaah, His Messenger and the Religion of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: Explain to me why he attended the gravesite of Sayyida Zaynab (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) on the occasion of the yearly migration, and why he didn’t mention the Shirk that occurred there nor forbid it, even though he saw people making Tawaaf around the grave and asking the one buried in it requests that only should be made to Allaah? Explain that to me in a way that pleases Allaah and His Messenger, and then the believers, other than that it was because he was pleased with Major Shirk and that he permitted it with himself and in his methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth</strong>: Explain to me why he would walk to the graves of Ad-Dasooqee and Sinjar on foot, 20 kilometers going and (another) 20 kilometers returning, with an explanation pleasing to Allaah and His Messenger and then to the believers other than that it was because he was either performing a polytheistic form of visitation or an innovated form of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Seventh</strong>: Explain to me why he strived to unite the Sunnees and the Raafidees with an explanation pleasing to Allaah and His Messenger and then the believers, other than that it was because he was ignorant of what the Raafidah were upon from innovations and deviations or that he was lenient towards them and their deviations and sacrificed the Islamic Creed for the sake of pleasing them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eighth</strong>: Explain to me how he could combine between opposing factors in the description of his Da’wah (Call), (stating) that it was a “Call to the Salaf, a Path upon the Sunnah and a Sufi Reality.” Is it possible that these opposing factors can be united? Is it possible to unite Sufism and Salafiyyah and to unite Sufism and the Sunnah? Trying to combine between these two is like trying to mix water with fire!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ninth</strong>: Explain to me the ten pillars of his <em>ba’yah</em> (pledge of allegiance) with an explanation pleasing to Allaah and His Messenger and then the believers, other than that he brought a new legislation to the Da’wah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Tenth</strong>: Explain to me why he took the <em>bay’ah</em> (pledge of allegiance) from people who <em>bay’ah</em> was binding on other than that it was because he was disobeying Allaah and His Messenger and introducing new laws into Islaam, which neither Allaah nor His Messenger gave permission for.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Eleventh</strong>: Explain to me why he made obedience to him, which he placed as a condition in his <em>bay’ah</em>, as something obligatory to be carried out immediately and without any reservations, even though according to Islaam, obedience is restricted by two things:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. It must be with regard to something good, and<br />
2. It is dependent upon one’s ability.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So isn’t this legislating a law into the Religion, which neither Allaah nor His Messenger authorized?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Twelfth</strong>: Explain to me why he limited Islaam to just <span style="color:#993300;">twenty principles</span> or why he gave these principles the ultimate importance with an explanation that Allaah and His Messenger, and then the believers would be pleased with, other than that it was because he introduced a new legislation into Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Thirteenth</strong>: Explain to me why he said <em>Tafweed</em> was the madh-hab of all of the Salaf without exception, with an explanation pleasing to Allaah and His Messenger and then the believers, other than that it was because he was ignorant of the madh-hab of the Salaf regarding Allaah’s Attributes or because he forged a lie against them stating that the Salaf would believe in the meaning (of the Attribute) but return knowledge of how the attribute was to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lastly</strong>, I say: If you can interpret and explain these statements of his, which I just mentioned, with explanations that do not contradict the Religion and do not leave from the fold of what is contained in the wording, then I rightfully deserve your comment of me understanding from his words that which they don’t contain. And if you are unable to do that, then it becomes clear that you lied on me and slandered me with this statement. And know that I will not seek my right from you, even if your wronging of me becomes manifest, except before Allaah on the Day of Judgement. However I will place between you and I the noble Shaikh, ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin Baaz, Chief Muftee of the Kingdom (of Saudi Arabia), head of the Committee of Senior Scholars, and head of the Committee for Religious Research and Verdicts, as well as his deputy, Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah Aali Shaikh, and Shaikh Saalih bin Fawzaan Al-Fawzaan, Shaikh ‘Abdullaah Al-Ghudayyaan and Shaikh Saalih Al-Atram to read the ninth chapter of the book from its beginning to end. So if they find that I have misinterpreted Al-Bannaa’s words in a way that they were not intended then they shall pronounce me guilty, and if they find that the one who stated this wronged me and slandered me with this statement, then they will find him guilty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your statement that I took my anger out on him</span></strong>, then Allaah knows that I didn’t write what I wrote except to clarify the truth and to advise the people. This is what I hope for and I am not praising myself nor am I purifying my soul from sin:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily the soul commands to evil except for those whom my Lord has mercy on. Verily, my Lord is Most Forgiving, Bestower of Mercy.”</span> </strong>[Surah Yoosuf: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if there was some anger on my part, then Allaah knows that it was only for His sake. This is since, it can hardly be imagined that I would be angry for my own sake towards a man that didn’t oppress me in any way, along with there being great distances and time-spans between him and I. And indeed I ask Allaah, may He be Glorified, to make my deed sincerely for His Face, intending to please Him by it, and to not make any part of it for the sake of anyone from His creatures. Verily, he is the All- Hearer, the One who responds to invocations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for your saying that you encountered that which you didn’t expect from me</strong></span>, then did you find that I disobeyed Allaah and His Mesenger and opposed the Religion of Islaam by clarifying the truth that I did? Didn’t Allaah take a covenant from the People of the Scripture that they would convey the truth to the people and not conceal it? Isn’t this covenant that He took binding upon us? Didn’t the Prophet (<em>sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam</em>) take this covenant from his Companions when giving the <em>bay’ah</em> (pledge), as is stated in the agreed upon hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah bin Saamit, where he said: “<strong>And (we pledge allegiance to you) that we will speak the truth wherever we may be and not fear the blame of the blamers?</strong>” Doesn’t Allaah curse those who conceal the truth in His Book, as He states:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, those who conceal what We have revealed from the clear proofs and the guidance after We clarified it to the people in the Book, they are the ones cursed by Allaah and cursed by the cursers. Except for those who repent, rectify matters and clarify. These people, I will accept their repentance, and I am the Acceptor of Repentance, the Bestower of Mercy?”</span></strong> [Surah Al-Baqarah: 159-160]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Isn’t refuting those who oppose the mandates and laws of the Religion an obligation upon the people of knowledge? So if they fall short of this necessary obligation and someone fulfills this task, the obligation is removed from the rest. And from the rights he has over others is that they should supplicate for success for him and thank him after thanking Allaah in a good and nice manner, and not that he be confronted with accusations and bad thoughts about him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Didn’t the Salaf carry out this order and fulfill this obligation, thus authoring numerous books, the likes of which cannot be counted, refuting the innovators from the time of the Taabi’een to this time of ours, and they still continue to do this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Didn’t you, O Shaikh, write two books refuting the people of innovation, the first of which is the book “<em>Akhbaar-ul-Aahaad</em>”, in which you refuted the Mu’tazilah and whoever holds their views, and the second of which is your book “<em>Al-Faa’iq fir-Raddi ‘alaa Mubaddil-il-Haqaa’iq</em>?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And, by the One of whom there is no deity that has the right to be worshipped except Him, I truly love a man who defends the religion, protecting it and shielding it, and who refutes those who enter into it that which doesn’t belong to it. However, I don’t know why some of the Mashaayikh, may Allaah guide them, have swerved away from the truth, when they know (better), instead rebuking the one who rises to fulfill this obligation, calling him a criminal, transgressor and an oppressor! And yet on the other hand if this evil were to affect anyone else, the world would be in an uproar and huge commotion. But when it affects the Religion, violating it and oppressing its right, the whole world is peaceful and forgiving! Would we be giving justice to the Religion and fulfilling its right this way, or would we be violating it, disregarding it and neglecting its characteristics, especially if what was affected from it was its foundations, principles and fundamentals, such as Tawheed when it is demolished by Major Shirk, and the Sunnah when it is destroyed by innovations, and the truth when it is ruined by falsehood? So at this point, do you hold that we should remain silent? No, by Allaah! Unless some of us rise to fulfill this right, since it is a collective obligation. And as for the one who fulfills this obligation (of refuting innovation), he has a huge reward and a grand recompense with Allaah, the Mist High, the All-Able, as has been stated just now.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your statement that for the past forty years you received news about him from noble scholars</span></strong> such as Shaikh ‘Abdur-Razzaaq ‘Afeefee, Shaikh ‘Abdur- Rahmaan Ad-Dawsiree, Shaikh ‘Abdullaah bin Humaid and Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz, and that they praised his Da’wah and mentioned his positive effects and they examined news of him, then I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: As for the Mashaayikh you mentioned, then you probably asked them before they were aware of what is well known today about his condition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Perhaps during that time news about the outer appearance of his Da’wah reached them. Many people are deceived by the outer appearance of his Da’wah even up to today, because they do not know this (Ikhwaanee) methodology well enough since they didn’t read about it during those times.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: If they didn’t say anything against him, then this was because they weren’t aware of any of the mistakes he made. So they had a right to refrain (from speaking against him) if this was the case.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: But as for now, then it has been made clear and manifest that there are many errors in his Da’wah. And “The one who preserved it is a proof against the one who didn’t preserve it.” This is a principle that is well known amongst the Muhadditheen, and acting on it with regard to this matter is an obligation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: As for Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz, who is the only one who remains alive from them,[5] then he knows what they are upon and there is no doubt about this. He responded to a question related to the movement of the Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen founded by Hasan Al-Bannaa, in which the questioner said: “Noble Shaikh, the movement of the Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen entered the Kingdom (of Saudi Arabia) some time ago, and they became active amongst the students of knowledge. What is your opinion with regard to this movement and to what extent do they comply with the methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He responded by saying: “The movement of Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen has been criticized by specialized scholars because they do not have any enthusiasm with regard to calling to the Tawheed of Allaah and rejecting Shirk and rebuking innovations. And they have specific methods, which are made deficient by their lack of efforts to call to Allaah and their lack of guiding towards the correct Creed, which Ahlus-Sunnah wal- Jamaa’ah are upon. So it is upon the Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen to give importance to the Salafee Call to the Tawheed of Allaah, and to reject the worship of graves, the devotion to the deceased and the seeking assistance of those buried in the graves such as Husayn or Badawee and so on. This is what I wanted to convey.” [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Did you hear, O brother in Islaam, what Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz said, may Allaah prolong his life? So why won’t you say similar to what he said concerning the Da’wah of the Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen and what it contains from oppositions to the methodology of the Salaf as-Saalih. By this, you would be aiding the truth, removing an evil and advising the ummah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your statement that they would mention his positive effects</span></strong>, then if any of the Mashaayikh you mentioned, with the exception of Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz, stated that he had positive effects, then he has been deceived just like you. However, what seems apparent from your words is that you are convinced that he had positive effects, therefore I must ask you the following questions, which I hope you can answer clearly and truthfully. So I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Is it from his positive effects that he was silent about the polytheistic worship that the people committed at the gravesites and tombs present in Egypt and that he didn’t forbid it, as if it had been sent down definitively from the heavens in verses recited?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. Was from his positive effects the partisanship and division that he left behind amongst the ummah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. Is it from his positive effects that he established the Call to the Khilaafah and abandoned the Call to Tawheed, which all the messengers called to?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4. Is it from his positive effects that he caused the youth to hate the leaders and the scholars and prepared them to overthrow the present (Muslim) countries in order to establish a Khilaafah, which they claim will be opposite to them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5. Is it from his positive effects that he brought about the false ascription of faults and blemishes on the leaders and the scholars, which his followers do, claiming afterward that these leaders are not fit for ruling and that the scholars are only flattering them?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6. Is it from his positive effects that he transformed the youth and placed them in positions in Da’wah while they were ignorant?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7. Is it from his positive effects that he instituted giving bay’ah (pledge of allegiance) to common people whilst abandoning those who rightfully deserve the bay’ah, such as the rulers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8. Is it from his positive effects that he called to the coming together of the Shi’ees and the Sunnees? What is meant by coming together, is that each group should refrain from criticizing any of the beliefs of the other groups, so that the first group can come closer to the second group.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">9. Is it from his positive effects that he claimed that the Salaf would commit Tafweed, designating the meaning of all of Allaah’s attributes (back to Allaah)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">10. Is it from his positive effects that he said: “There is no religious enmity between us and the Jews” which means that the Jews are our brothers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">11. Is it from his positive effects that he said: “We will work with one another in that which we agree on, and overlook from one another that which we differ on” which means that we should nullify the acts of commanding good and forbidding evil, which Allaah described the believers with, while praising them, in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“You were the best nation brought forth for mankind &#8211; commanding towards good and forbidding from evil and believing in Allaah” [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 110] and other ayaat?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">12. Is it from his positive effects that he gathered together people whose beliefs differed and whose convictions varied? So this person is a Sunnee and that person is a Shi’ee. This person is a Sufi and that person is a Jahmee. This person is an Ash’aree and that person is a rationalizing Mu’tazilee and so on and so on. And he claimed that they are all brothers because they say Laa Ilaaha IllaaAllaah Muhammad Rasoolullaah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">13. Is it from his positive effects that he revived innovations, amongst which was the innovation of celebrating the Prophet’s Birthday and his attending a gathering for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">14. Is it from his positive effects that he claimed that the Messenger (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) attended his gathering, blessed it and forgave the sins of those present?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">15. Is it from his positive effects that he was immersed in Sufism, having passion and affection for it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">16. Is it from his positive effects that he limited Islaam to twenty principles, making that binding upon his followers?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">17. Is it from his positive effects that he made the conditions of bay’ah ten and that he obligated conditions that are not found in the Book of Allaah or in the Sunnah of His Messenger?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">18. Is it from his positive effects that he made blind obedience a condition for the bay’ah, where he said: “By obedience I mean that the command should be carried out and executed immediately in times of hardship and in times of ease, in things pleasing and in things detested. This is because the levels of this (Ikhwaanee) Da’wah are three…(up to where he said about the second level, which is the level of Formation)…Organizing the da’wah in this level is to be carried out purely in a Sufi way from the spiritual standpoint and militarily from the practical standpoint.” [7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hearing and obeying is obligatory to the one in authority. However it is constrained by two restrictions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">First: It must be obedience with regard to something good. So there is no obedience to be given if it entails disobedience to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: It must be in those things that a person is able to do, therefore he is not required to do what he is unable to. The Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) would instruct his Companions to only obey in what they were able to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">19. Is it from his positive effects that he attended the gravesite of Sayyidah Zaynab (radyAllaahu ‘anhaa) on the occasion of the annual gathering, and did not reject one word of the Shirk that took place there? On the contrary, he would advise and encourage the attendees to purify their souls and hearts from spite and malice!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">20. Is it from his positive effects that he allowed Coptic Christians to enter his organization, making them supporters of his Call? Did any of the callers ever do this?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">21. Is it from his positive effects that he established an assembly for Muhammad ‘Uthmaan Al-Mirghanee, who is well know for his belief in wahdat-ul-wujood, praising him and saying in this gathering: “Indeed, we the gathering of Ikhwaan owe the Mirganee leaders pure affection and a warm welcome?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">22. Is it from his positive effects that he would go to public assemblies from the first night of Rabee’-ul-Awwal to the 12th of Rabee’-ul-Awwal in which he would recite a chant that consists of Major Shirk:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“May the Divine (Allaah) bless the light (i.e. Muhammad) that appeared to the creation and so he surpassed the (light of the) sun and the moon This beloved one (i.e. Muhammad) along with his loved ones has attended And pardoned everyone of what they did and will do (of sins).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">23. Is it from his positive effects that he and his associates would travel three hours on foot going and three hours returning in order to visit the graves of the elite among the Husaafee Shaadhilee Order? But if it is said that his intention behind visiting was for purposes related to the Sunnah (i.e. to remind himself of death), then we say that it is not permissible to set out on a journey to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">24. Is it from his positive effects that he would chant the following verses, which clearly indicate wahdat-ul-wujood:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Allaah raised and scattered (all) the existence and what it contains<br />
So if you desire to attain His perfection<br />
Then everything in the universe if you realize it<br />
is non-existent, specifically and generally.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">25. Is it from his positive effects that he claimed that Tawassul, which is the greatest of ways that people fall into Shirk, is from the subsidiary issues, which should not be given importance?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lastly, I ask you, by Allaah, are these things that I have just listed above in these numbers in agreement with the Religion or in contradiction to it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And I ask you, by Allaah, a third time: Is the one who clarifies the truth to the people and defends the Creed considered erroneous and a criminal who deserves to be censured, reprimanded, incriminated and told that your books should not be printed?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your statement that they excused him from the errors he committed, then I say:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: What are the errors that should be excused – aren’t they those that are made in subsidiary issues, which stem from Ijtihaad? So are the errors committed by Al- Bannaa on subsidiary issues, such that they can be excused? And is Al-Bannaa from the people of Ijtihaad whose status should be preserved? Who are his teachers whom he studied religious knowledge under?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Errors made in matters of Creed are not excused based on the unanimous agreement of the scholars from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah. And the books that they wrote refuting the innovators during every era and every location, which are too many to be counted, from the time of the Taabi’een to our present time, bears witness to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: The Mashaayikh you mentioned are from Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah, and if they knew of Al-Bannaa’s contradictions against the Religion in fundamental issues and matters of Creed, they would not make excuses for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: As for your saying that they excused him, then this is an allegation on your part. So if you have with you something that confirms this, then present it. This only applies to you with respect to those who have passed away. But as for Shaikh ‘Abdul- ‘Azeez [8] then he is still alive and his stance regarding them (i.e. Ikhwaan-ul-Muslimeen) is well known. And he is our Imaam and our role model, and we know from the Shaikh that he refutes every error that he hears or learns of even if the one who commits it may be far away and even if the error is in relation to subsidiary issues. So how many errors has he refuted – they are too many to be taken into account. And if they were to be counted, then it would be long. And if it is possible, I will write to him asking:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“There is a person that claims that you have excused Hasan Al-Bannaa for the errors in Creed that he made, so is this correct?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fifth</strong>: Even if we assume that someone from Ahlus-Sunnah excused him for what he committed from errors in Creed, then his opinion of excusing him is to be considered as irregular and in contradiction to what Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah are upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sixth</strong>: As for the one who excused him, did he say that he can’t be refuted? If he said that he can’t be refuted, then he has aided the innovators and troublemakers who seek to deviate others by it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your saying: “And they found in his words that which makes it known that he is a Mukhlis (sincere), Muwahhid (affirmer of Tawheed)”</span></strong>, then I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his being sincere (mukhlis), then no one can know this except Allaah because sincerity is something hidden, which only Allaah has knowledge of. It is stated in the authentic hadeeth: “Actions are only base don’t heir intentions, and indeed every person will have only that which he intends.” [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the hadeeth of Abu Moosaa: “Whoever fights so that the Word of Allaah could be the highest, then it (his fighting) was for the sake of Allaah.” And in the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood reported by Ahmad: “Perhaps a person may be killed between two groups and Allaah only knows his intention.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the hadeeth of ‘Ubaadah: “Whoever fights not intending anything except recognition, then he will have what he intends.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the story of the (brave) man who would follow and kill with his sword every pagan he encountered (during a battle), and the Companions were amazed by him and said: “No one amongst us has profited today like so and so has profited.” So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “He is from the inhabitants of the Hellfire.” So a man followed him the next day (while the battle continued), and found him fighting (with polytheists). When he had suffered many wounds, the man placed the tip of his sword on his upper chest and fell on it, thrusting it in him and thus killing himself. The man (who followed him) then went to the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) and said: “I bear witness that you are the Mesenger of Allaah.” He (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Why is that?” He said: “That man about whom who said what you said yesterday killed himself.” So the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) said: “Rise, O Bilaal, and announce to the people that no one shall enter Paradise except a believing soul, and that Allaah will indeed aid this religion by an evil man.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The important point here is that sincerity is something hidden, which no one has knowledge of except Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for you saying that he is a Muwahhid,</span></strong>[10] then this is a testimony and a commendation for him on your part that Allaah will question you about. It is obligatory for you to think carefully before sending out such commendations – where they put in their proper place or not? I don’t know if perhaps this is due to ignorance on your part of what Al-Bannaa fell into from Shirk, his disregard for those who committed it, as well as their polytheistic rituals, and his accepting them as members in his methodology. He is the one who said during the innovation of the Prophet’s Birthday:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This beloved one (i.e. Muhammad) along his loved ones has attended And pardoned everyone of what they did and will do (of sins).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that the Messenger of Allaah attends their gathering, blesses it and pardons and forgives them! So I ask is this Shirk or not, O Shaikh?! And is the one who says such a statement and chants it a Muwahhid?! Is the one who takes the bay’ah (pledge of allegiance) in accordance with the Husaafee Shadhilee (Sufi) order a Muwahhid?! Have you come to know that the Sufis are Muwahhids and that they call to Tawheed, or that they commit Shirk and call to polytheism and innovation? Are you aware that Sufism is built upon Shirk and that it weaves its thread and fabric from polytheism and innovations?! Did you know that Hasan Al-Bannaa used to walk by foot, 20 kilometers going and the same distance returning, every Friday, to visit the graves of the (deceased) high members of Sufism, like Ad-Dasooqee, Sinjar and their likes? Is the one who does this a Muwahhid? O Shaikh, fear Allaah and know that you have severely damaged and violated your Tawheed by testifying that those upon Shirk (polytheism) and Bid’ah (innovation) are Muwahhideen. So repent to Allaah and turn to Him before time runs out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, the true Caller who was a Muwahhid was Shaikh Muhammad bin ‘Abdil- Wahhaab, may Allaah have mercy on him, as well as those who treaded upon his methodology and followed his way from the scholars and the leaders from his time and the time of the Ameer, Muhammad bin Sa’ood up to this day of ours. May Allaah have mercy on those of them who passed away and preserve those of them who remain living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also the Shaikh, ‘Abdullaah bin Muhammad Al-Qar’aawee, who spread Tawheed throughout the southern areas (of Saudi Arabia) with the help of the late king, who went by the nickname of “The Falcon of Arabia”11 and who brought most of the areas of the (Arab) peninsula together under his sovereignty, uniting them under his rule, and cleansing them of aspects of polytheism and innovation. And he was followed in this by his noble children, may Allaah have mercy on those of them who passed away and may He preserve those of them still living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask you, by Allaah, O Shaikh, if a person were to ask you: “What do you say concerning an individual who participated in a procession from the first of Rabee’-ul- Awwal to the twelfth of Rabee’-ul-Awwal and happily chanted verses of poetry, which I mentioned previously, amongst which was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“This beloved one (i.e. Muhammad) along with his loved ones has attended And pardoned everyone of what they did and will do (of sins)?”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Will you make a ruling on him, that he is upon Shirk or Tawheed? What would be your answer?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And if you were asked about a man who endured the hardship of traveling by foot every week the distance of twenty kilometers to the Sufi gravesites and then the same distance returning, how would you judge this individual? Would you say that he is a Sunnee or an innovator, and would you say that he is a Muwahhid or a Mushrik?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So fear Allaah man and return to the truth, and repent to Allaah for indeed He accepts the repentance. Do not misguide the people, especially the students of knowledge, by defending the innovators. This traveling that Hasan Al-Bannaa and his associates would do every week is not free from three possibilities:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1. Either they intended to supplicate to those buried in the graves, which is Major Shirk and takes one out of the Religion, or</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2. They intended to supplicate to Allaah while at these gravesites, which is an innovation, or</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3. They intended to visit the graves as part of the Sunnah (i.e. to be reminded of death). However this couldn’t be achieved except by setting out on a journey, and setting out on a journey to make the lawful visitation of the graves, is an innovation. So based on this, the one who does it is either a polytheist or an innovator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for your statement: “Allaah granted benefit through his Da’wah and guided many people”, then:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What benefit came about for them? Is having disregard for Major Shirk and being silent about those who perform it, such as the deviants and the innovators considered a benefit? Is keeping silent about evil and not forbidding it – which stems from the principle that Hasan Al-Bannaa instituted: “We will work together in that which we agree on and pardon one another in that which we disagree on” – is this a benefit. Are those who are calling to the Khilaafah and who have abandoned calling to Tawheed, which was the way of all the messengers, a benefit?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is intending to destroy the present (Muslim) states and revolting against them, even if those who govern them are Muslims and rule by Allaah’s Legislation, establishing the penal laws, a benefit?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, the Da’wah (Call) of the Ikhwaan (Al-Muslimoon) only destroys the youth and doesn’t benefit them, and it only corrupts them and doesn’t rectify them. As for your statement that you didn’t stop hearing him being praised in gatherings and his books being read until about seven years ago when the brothers turned against him and degraded his rank, then I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is this a proof for him? If someone praises his methodology or praises him, who doesn’t know what is in his methodology from destructive ideologies and what he had from vile errors, this is not a proof for him or a scale determining the correctness of his methodology.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You know as well, deep down inside, that this is not a proof, and that they only praised him when they were misled by the general outer appearance of his methodology. But when they came to realize what he was upon, they rebuked it and censured him. and they had every right to do what they did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, You indeed know that we do not intend to disparage anyone nor to speak out against anyone, rather we only intend to clarify the truth and to warn the youth and the students of knowledge from the methodologies that consist of innovations and deviations. And we are only pointing out to them the errors in them so that they may not be deluded by them, entering into them and missing the path of truth, thus being misguided and misguiding those who come after them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for them having degraded his rank, then this is not correct. Rather they said about him what was conveyed to them with statements established in their sources, mentioning the names of the books and their page numbers. So are they degrading his rank when they relate these quotes to convince the youth that this methodology is erroneous because it contains truth and falsehood and mixes that which is correct with that which is wrong? This is like someone who drinks from water with impurities and dirtiness, and next to him is a person who drinks from water that is pure and free from pollution. Which of these two would you love most to drink from? So by doing this are they degrading or destroying his status?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: No, then again no. Rather, the heavens and the earth were not established nor were the messengers sent nor were the divine books revealed except to establish the truth and suppress the falsehood and to command the good and forbid the evil. So if the universe is void, or more appropriately, if the earth is void of one who will establish the truth for the sake of Allaah and those who command good and forbid evil, the earth will earn Allaah’s wrath and His punishment will descend. What indicates this is Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And when the Word is fulfilled against them, we shall bring out from the earth a Beast for them to speak to them because mankind believed not with certainty in our ayaat (signs).” [Surah An-Naml: 82]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn ‘Umar and Abu Sa’eed Al-Khudree, may Allaah be pleased with them, said: “When they stop commanding good and forbidding evil, (Allaah’s) Discontentment becomes binding upon them.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the part “when the word is fulfilled”, ‘Abdullaah bin Mas’ood said: “It will be when the scholars die, knowledge goes away and the Qur’aan is raised up (to Allaah).”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: It is clear from this that commanding good and forbidding evil prevent torment from descending and Allaah’s Displeasure of His servants from being mandated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what falls into commanding good and forbidding evil is refuting the errors in Creed made by those who pronounce that, whoever they may be and wherever they may be. Would you like that the people of truth remain silent about clarifying it (i.e. the truth) and hold back from purifying it from that which is not part of it mixing and entering into it? Never! This will never be, by the Will of Allaah, so long as there are men to carry the Hadeeth and there is room for speech and there is force and strength for the truth and its people, who in doing this hope for Allaah’s Contentment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your saying: “And they imposed themselves over him without there being anything mandating that he be specified (apart from others), for there were other more famous books that were worse that his books. And there are other leading figures, both dead and alive, that are more deviant than him”, </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">then I say: First: All praise be to Allaah who caused you to speak the truth even though you weren’t aware of it, for you have acknowledged that there is evil in his books, as well as deviation in his methodology and history. How close in resemblance is your statement O Shaikh to the speech of the people of innovation in terms of contradiction, so reflect!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Second: The obligation on the scholars is to clarify to the people, according to the extent of their ability, what they are unaware of and to distinguish the truth from falsehood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Third: We have been afflicted by this methodology in our very own lands and so it has corrupted the minds of our children. So now they reject the compassionate father, the affectionate friend and the educating teacher. And they do not take the advice of the advisor or the criticism of the critic unless he is a member of their party. So they resemble those who Allaah spoke about in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And do not believe (in anyone) except he who follows your religion.” [Surah Aali ‘Imraan: 73]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they say: “Do not believe anyone except the people of your group.” So this makes it necessary that one speak out against this methodology and its founder, as well as its offshoots, such as the Suroorees and the Qutubees. This is the reason that caused it (i.e. Ikhwaanee Manhaj) to be specified because it has spread amongst us and extended throughout our lands and regions. And it has corrupted the minds of our youth turning them into revolutionaries, takfeeris and terrorists.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is nothing strange if the Salafee students of knowledge rebuke this methodology and spread the errors it has in it, in order to uphold the truth, advise the people, seek nearness to Allaah and make Jihaad in His Cause:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Verily We will not cause the reward of one who does a good deed to be lost.” [Surah Al-Kahf: 30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for your saying: “They have specifically chosen him and his books out of other well known books that are far worse than his books and callers, dead and alive, that are more deviant than him”, then I say:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have already explained to you the reason for this. Also, along with this is the fact that the Salafees, all praise be to Allaah, do not remain silent with falsehood for they have refuted all of the deviant sects, past and present, old and new, as much as they were able to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this time, I specifically mean our noble teacher and our unique great intellectual and our sincere and dignified scholar, Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin ‘Abdillaah bin Baaz, may Allaah preserve him, grant him success and aid him, then the Committee of Senior Scholars after him, may Allaah grant all of them success, assist them with every good and aid them against every evil. So whoever flips through the fataawaa of Shaikh ‘Abdul-‘Azeez bin Baaz, whose number has reached seven volumes, will realize that he has written many refutations against the people of falsehood, with all of its components and all of their factions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this goes as well for what has been written from verdicts and refutations in the magazine of Islamic Research of the Committee of Senior Scholars, may Allaah reward them with good and bless their time</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that your statement: “Many of the brothers have imposed themselves over him without there being anything mandating that he be specified (apart from others), for there are other more famous books that were worse that his books. And there are other leading figures, both dead and alive, that are more deviant than him” means that they should not be refuted. This is a statement that is not put in its proper place. May Allaah forgive you and us and rectify our affairs and yours. This, O Shaikh, isn’t the way the arguments of the scholars are. On the contrary, their proofs were in affirming what the texts of the Book and the Sunnah, according to the understanding of the Salaf of the ummah, affirmed and negating what they negated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, O brother in Islaam, if you hold that refuting Hasan Al-Bannaa and the people of his group from those who wallowed in Sufism and idolatry, entered innovations into the Religion and legislated into it that which Allaah and His Messenger didn’t legislate. If you consider that refuting these people and clarifying what their methodology consists of from falsehood and deviation – if you consider that to be a violation against the members of this methodology and its founder, then we have no control over guiding others, however it is upon us to supplicate to Allaah to remove from you this strange ideology and this false understanding that has deprived you and confused matters for you. And at the same time we fear that this ideology causes you to enter into the ranks of those whom Allaah spoke of when He said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And whoever opposes the Messenger after the guidance was made clear to him and follows a way other than the Way of the Believers, We will turn him to what he has chosen and land him in Hell – what an evil destination.” [Surah An-Nisaa: 115]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that supporting the people of falsehood and defending them is not from the Way of the Believers, especially if they are polytheists or innovators, whose innovation leads to disbelief or sin. So I advise you and ask Allaah for you, O brother in Islaam, that you return to the truth and to supporting it. And I ask Allaah that He allow you to see it (i.e. the truth) and that he remove the veil that is before your eyes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is my advice to you, and it is the advice of every Salafee that loves good for you and fears for you the consequences of this foreign ideology and erroneous understanding. And with Allaah lies the success, to him I place my reliance and to Him I repent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for your statement: “Therefore I advise you O Shaikh to withhold your tongue and your pen from attacking this Caller, whom Allaah granted benefit by”</strong></span>,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I say: What a great advice this is, if only it were put in its proper place. This is a valuable gift for the one who wishes to preserve his Religion by it. However, you advised me not to advise, so is this a proper advice? So in reality it is only preventing good and hindering from the Path of Allaah. So fear Allaah, O Shaikh ‘Abdullaah [12], and return to the truth. By Allaah, of whom there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, there is not one percent of doubt in my heart that would lead me to undo what I have done. Rather, I hold that this is obligatory on me, since I have come to know about this man and his methodology that which entitles me to advise others and to clarify the observations made against this methodology, out of sincerity for the students of knowledge who have been deceived by them, in order to fulfill Allaah’s right over me that I defend the Religion of Islaam and to protect the Tawheed and preserve its honor as the Prophet (sallAllaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam) did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your statement where you advised me to not attack the honor of this Caller, I say:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In your opinion, what has more right to be defended and protected – Tawheed and the authentic Creed, the Creed of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah or the honor of Hasan Al- Bannaa? Didn’t Allaah order us to fight the polytheists and the disbelievers for the sake of the Creed? Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And fight them until there is no more fitnah and the Religion is for Allaah.” [Surah Al-Baqarah: 193]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The word fitnah has been interpreted here as Shirk. Didn’t Allaah permit the termination of the lives of the disbelievers and the polytheists, the imprisonment of their women and children and the taking of their wealth as booty for the Muslims due to the Creed? Shouldn’t this be permitted for one who commits Major Shirk, agrees with those who perform it, and introduces innovations into the Religion as well as laws that have not been legislated?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shouldn’t this be permitted against his honor, for the purpose of clarifying the truth to those who have been deceived by this man and his methodology?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, by Allaah of whom there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, the obligation upon me and you and all of the seekers of knowledge is that aiding the Religion and exposing the truth must take precedence over everything in this world, out of obedience to Allaah, establishing His right, aiding his Religion and defending the beliefs of the Muslims from deceptions. And with Allaah lies the success.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>As for your statement in which you advised me to not print my book, then:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: I consider this to be hindering from the Way of Allaah on your part. This is because I hold this book as being one of the best of my good deeds since I aided the truth by it, preserved the honor of Tawheed with it and defended the authentic Creed through it. I hope that I have done this sincerely for Allaah’s sake, establishing His right and defending the sanctuary of His Religion, but I am not freeing myself from shortcomings and errors. And I ask Allaah to forgive me, for indeed whatever deed an individual performs, he is prone to deficiencies and shortcomings.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: I consider this to be an abandonment of the truth from you, a siding with the people of falsehood on your part and support for them. This is enough as an offense against the Religion and then against those who carry it, those about whom Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“And who is better in speech than he who calls to Allaah and does righteous deeds and says: ‘I am from the Muslims.’” [Surah Fussilat: 33]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: I heard that some of the hizbees (partisans) buy the books that criticize and speak against their party in large amounts and then burn them. So what is the difference between one who burns my book after it’s printed and one who tells me not to print it?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: I consider this to be from interfering in other people’s affairs in order to prevent the spread of good. And it states in the hadeeth: “From the goodness of a person’s Islaam is that he abandons what doesn’t concern him.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Fifth</span></strong>: If I printed it and the people disseminated it, then I would be printing a book that affirms Tawheed and censures Shirk, that affirms the Sunnah and censures Innovation, and that affirms the truth and censures falsehood. So it would be an obligation on you to request the expeditious printing of the book, in order to aid Tawheed, the truth and the Sunnah. However, you have done the opposite and instead requested me not to print the book. And by doing this, you are supporting the people of innovations and partisanship wrongfully against the people of Tawheed and the Sunnah, the followers of the way of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So seek forgiveness from Allaah and repent to Him before your life passes and comes to an end. For by Allaah, neither this person nor that person will be able to benefit you before Allaah (on the Day of Judgement). Rather, the only thing that will benefit you is your standing up for the truth and your support for it and its people. And Allaah is the only One whom we ask that He guide us and you to the truth and to supporting it and its people. And He is the only One whom we seek refuge in from vain desires and misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">As for your warning me against printing the book out of fear for me that it will ruin my reputation, then I say to you:</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know that the ruining of one’s reputation comes only due to supporting falsehood and speaking it or doing it. And I, thanks to my Lord, have not committed any falsehood and nor have I supported the people of falsehood in order that my reputation would be ruined in front of the believers, who are Allaah’s witnesses on His earth. Rather, I have performed the truth and supported the truth, which I hope I will be rewarded for by Allaah and due to which I will be considered honest amidst the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the people of falsehood, then I am not concerned about my reputation with them. I ask Allaah the Most Great, Lord of the Noble Throne, to protect me from their evil and to save me from their plots. And I will continue to pursue my printing and distribution of the book, if Allaah wills, relying upon Allaah in whose Hand lies the forelock of all His slaves.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Translator’s Note: This tremendous book written by Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee was written and published in the same year as this letter (1418H). It is about 300 pages long and contains an in depth analysis of the two most popular deviant methodologies in the field of Da’wah today, that of the Jamaa’at at-Tableegh and the Ikhwaan-ul- Muslimeen. The book has introductory commendations from Shaikh Saalih Al-Fawzaan and Shaikh Rabee’ Al- Madkhalee, may Allaah preserve all of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Translator’s Note: Shaikh Ahmad An-Najmee was born in 1346H and was around 22 years old when Hasan Al- Bannaa was shot and killed in Egypt on 2/12/1949 (1368H).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3] Translator’s Note: He means by this outside of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] Translator’s Note: The belief of wahdat-ul-wujood is a deviant Sufi concept that entails the belief that Allaah and His creation are one existence. Thus there is no distinction between Creator and creation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Shaikh Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab Al-Wassaabee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah Book Publishing<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of a small booklet entitled: <b><i>Eedaah-ud-Dalaalah fee Takhreej wa Tahqeeq &#8220;Laa &#8216;Itikaaf Illaa fil-Masaajid ath-Thalaathah¡¨</i></b><i></i>(Clarifying the Evidence in Referencing and Verifying the Hadeeth: &#8220;There is no &#8216;Itikaaf except in the Three Mosques&#8221;) printed by Dar-ul-Athaar, San&#8217;aa in 2003H.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this brief discussion, the author, Shaikh Muhammad bin ¡¥Abdil-Wahhaab Al-Wasaabee, presents the references and grading of the hadeeth: <b>&#8220;There is no &#8216;Itikaaf except in the Three Mosques&#8221;</b> through a discourse on the hadeeth&#8217;s narrators and sources. He also alludes to points of benefit drawn from the discussion on the verification of the hadeeth and presents the readers with advice concerning &#8216;Itikaaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Itikaaf is an important topic, especially in this month of Ramadaan, due to the many blessings and rewards contained within it. The matter of it being legislated in just the three mosques, i.e. Masjid al-Haraam in Makkah, Masjid an-Nabawee in Madeenah and Masjid Al-Aqsaa in Jerusalem, or in every mosque in which the Jumu&#8217;ah Prayer is established is an issue that has long been in debate. However, through the presentation of the evidence in this treatise, it is hoped that the readers may gain insight on the correct position with regard to this tremendous act of worship. It is also hoped that this book will aid the one who reads it into preserving and abiding by this sacred practice of Islaam, by which one¡¦s heart grows attached to the masjid and the servant dedicates himself entirely for a specified amount of time to the service and worship of His Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Author:</b> Shaikh Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi¡¦ee said in his introduction to the book: &#8220;As for the author of these three treatises, then he is Shaikh Muhammad bin &#8216;Abdil-Wahhaab &#8211; the teacher of Tawheed and Fiqh, and of good manners, abstinence and piety; the compassionate educator; the caller to Muslim unity; the warner against repulsive partisanship; the one who is extremely patient with poverty and difficulties, and the one who is wise with regard to the field of Da&#8217;wah (Calling to Allaah). He loves the predecessors (i.e. Salaf) of this ummah and hates the innovators &#8211; each one according to the form of his innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Quotes from the Book:</b> &#8220;In the report of Sa¡¦eed, there occurs the wording: <b>&#8220;&#8230;or a congregational masjid.&#8221;</b> This addition has not been mentioned by those who reported it in marfoo&#8217; form or those who reported it in mawqoof form. Yes, the addition occurs in some of the paths of narration from Ibraaheem bin Yazeed An-Nakha¡¦ee. However, you have already read that the path of narration from Ibraaheem bin Yazeed is broken.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;When a Companion states: <b>&#8220;Such and such is from the Sunnah&#8230;&#8221;</b>, the hadeeth takes on the ruling of being raised to a statement of the Prophet. This has been agreed upon in the books on Principles of Hadeeth. So based on this hadeeth, &#8216;Itikaaf is therefore permissible in every masjid in which the Jumu&#8217;ah prayer is established. However, performing it in the Three Mosques is better and more complete.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The summary of this study is that &#8216;Itikaaf is prescribed in every masjid in which the Jumu&#8217;ah Prayer is established. However, performing it in one of the Three Mosques is better and more perfect. This was the favored opinion of our teacher, the great scholar, the Muhaddith, the Faqeeh, Abu &#8216;Abdir-Rahmaan Muqbil bin Haadee Al-Waadi&#8217;ee, may Allaah have mercy on him.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">AUTHOR: Imaam Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaanee<br />
TRANSLATED: Al-Ibaanah E-Books<br />
PRODUCED BY: Al-Ibaanah.com</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>About the Book:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is a complete translation of <b><i>“Khutbat-ul-Haajah”</i></b><i></i> (The Sermon for Necessities, which the Messenger of Allaah would teach his Companions). The source used for the translation was the 2001 <i>Maktabah al-Ma’aarif </i>Edition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This book is one of the famous works of Imaam Al-Albaanee written about 50 years before his death and having a profound impact on the Muslim ummah. This was such that through his effort, this once-forgotten and almost-abandoned Sunnah was able to be revived. Many people from the time of its publication to this very day have begun to implement this <i>khutbah</i> in their lectures, sermons, books, articles, and ceremonies. So may Allaah reward the author with the best of rewards.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We hope that this translation provides a glimpse into the wealth and ocean of knowledge of Imaam Al-Albaanee as well as give the readers a detailed understanding of the prescription of this blessed <i>khutbah</i> and some points of benefit related to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All footnotes are from the author unless otherwise noted. There is one large footnote at the end which was added by the original publishers, <i>Maktabah al-Ma’aarif </i>in their recent edition. Translation of the meanings of Allaah’s verses were taken from the Dar-us-Salam Noble Qur’an translation with slight adaptations and alterations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Excerpts from the Book: </b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“On the day of my marriage to my second wife, which took place after some months had passed since the death of my first wife, Umm ‘Abdir-Rahmaan, may Allaah have mercy on her, one of the brothers offered to give the wedding sermon, stating that many times he had felt its benefit and effect whenever he would give it. So I said to him: ‘I have no objection. However, I would like to give my opinion on it, so show me the sermon.’ After reviewing it, I found that, generally, there were no problems with it, even though I did make some corrections to it, such as removing certain weak ahaadeeth and putting authentic ones in their place. However, the most important change I made, in my opinion, was the incorporation of <i>Khutbat-ul-Haajah </i>(Sermon for a Necessity) as its introduction, which is the sermon that the Messenger of Allaah would teach his Companions. This was after I researched its paths of narrations and wordings from the various books of the purified Sunnah.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The wisdom behind this differentiation is clear. And it is because the Prophet is not in a position in which it could be understood from his words that he intended something unbefitting to Allaah’s Lordship and Worship. This is contrary to others, since that may be understood from their speech (whereas it is not the case with his speech). This is why he ordered us to avoid doubtful matters and to be clear in one’s intentions, based on the fundamental principle found in his statement: <b>‘Leave that which makes you doubt for that which doesn’t make you doubt.’</b>”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It has become clear to us by way of the collection of afore-mentioned ahaadeeth that all sermons should be commenced with this sermon, regardless of whether these sermons occur during marriage ceremonies, the Friday Prayer or any other occasion. So it is not specific to just the marriage ceremony as some people think. In fact, in some narrations of the hadeeth of Ibn Mas’ood, it clearly shows this, as was seen previously. What further supports this is the actions of the righteous predecessors (Salaf as-Saalih), for they would commence their books with this sermon as was the case with Abu Ja’far At-Tahaawee, may Allaah have mercy on him, who stated in the introduction of his book <i>Mushkil-ul-Athaar</i>: ‘And I begin with what he ordered us to begin our necessities with, in that which has been reported on him with chains of narration that I will mention afterward, if Allaah wills: <b>Verily, all praise is due to Allaah…’</b>”</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>About the Book</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a translation of a small booklet titled <strong>Dhammu maa &#8216;alayhi Mudda&#8217;oo at-Tasawwuf </strong>(Condemning the Practices of those who Claim Sufism) by Imaam Abu Muhammad Ibn Qudaamah Al-Maqdisee, may Allaah have mercy on him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The booklet was published by Maktab al-Islami and is a short treatise containing a fatwa (religious verdict) from this great scholar of the seventh century on some of the practices that those who ascribed themselves to Sufism were upon in those days, and still are upon till this day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fatwa generally focuses on <strong>musical instruments and singing</strong>, which were practices the Sufis performed, taking it as part of the religion and using that as a means of drawing nearer to Allaah. The Shaikh has filled his response With Quranic verses, prophetic ahaadeeth and narrations from the Salaf.</p>
