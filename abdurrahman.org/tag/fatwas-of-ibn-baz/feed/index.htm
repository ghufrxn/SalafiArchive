<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>37- Merits of learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A questioner from Hadhramaut is asking about &#8216;Aqidah (creed): Your Eminence, is learning the Attributes of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Wajib (obligatory) or Mustahab (desirable)? Does learning these Attributes make any difference? What is the ruling on those who believe that it is not Wajib to learn the Attributes because this might entangle one into asking why and what? What are the books you recommend in this regard?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes from the Noble Qur&#8217;an and the purified Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) is <strong>one of the best acts of worship that brings us nearer to Allah</strong>. Learning Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes <strong>helps one to glorify, praise and call on Allah by His Names and Attributes</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allâh, so call on Him by them)&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that we should know Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes and use them while calling on Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Allah has ninety-nine Names; anyone who learns them will be admitted to Jannah (Paradise).&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p>This Hadith indicates that Allah is Witr (&#8216;Odd&#8217;, i.e. He is one) and He loves odd numbers.  It also indicates that scholars and believers should learn the Names and Attributes of Allah to invoke and praise Him and act upon them so that they enter Jannah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A believer should know that to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) belongs all Magnificent Names and that He has no peer, equal or rival. He is Perfect in His Essence, His Names, His Attributes and His Deeds and none is comparable to Him. Allah (Glorified be He) says: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</span></strong>.) None of Allah&#8217;s Attributes such as His Mercy, Highness, Istiwa&#8217; (Allah&#8217;s rising over the Throne in a manner that befits Him), Wrath , Laughter etc, is similar to ours.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">As for the books we recommend in this regard,</span> </strong>the Noble Qur&#8217;an is the greatest Book. We advise you and all Muslims to adhere to it and recite it frequently because it is the Book of Allah which contains light and guidance. Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, this Qur&#8217;ân guides to that which is most just and right</strong>&#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing.&#8221;</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(This is) a Book (the Qur&#8217;an) which we have sent down to you, full of blessings, that they may ponder over its Verses, and that men of understanding may remember</strong></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do they not then think deeply in the Qur&#8217;ân, or are their hearts locked up (from understanding it)?)&#8221;</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We advise all Muslims to frequently recite, ponder over, and memorize the entire Qur&#8217;an or parts thereof. It is the Book of Allah and the source of light and guidance. It calls for adopting good morals, performing righteous deeds, following that which Allah has enjoined, and avoiding that which He has forbidden. It contains the stories of the prophets, messengers, and the righteous so that people may follow in their footsteps and the stories of the wrongdoers, so people may avoid their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We also recommend those who are versed to read the books of Hadith such as the Two Sahihs (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) and the four Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) books (of Imams Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, Al-Nasa&#8217;y and Ibn Majah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, we recommend novices to read the abridged versions of these books which can be easily memorized, such as, Bulugh Al-Maram by Al-Hafidh ibn Hajar Al-Asqalani, Kitab Al-Tawhid, Thalathat Al-Usul, Al Qawa&#8217;id Al &#8216;Arba&#8217;, and Kashf Al-Shubuhat by Shaykh Muhammad ibn &#8216;Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah be merciful to him), Al-`Aqidah Al-Wasatiyyah by Shaykh Al-Islam ibn Taymiyyah, and Umdat Al-Hadith by Shaykh Al-Hafidh Abdul Ghani Al-Maqdisi. These are some important books which should be read and studied because they are useful.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">(Part No. 11; Page No. 58)</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>27- Ruling on performing the Sunnah of Wudu&#8217; during a time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Depending on the indication of the Hadith reported by Bilal (may Allah be pleased with him): Whenever I perform Wudu&#8217; (ablution), I offer a two-Rak&#8217;ah (unit of Prayer) Salah after it) I sometimes perform Wudu&#8217; during a time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah, such as the times after the &#8216;Asr (Afternoon) Prayer, after the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer, or during sunset or sunrise. Will I be blamed if I perform the two Rak&#8217;ah Salah of Wudu then? May Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Wudu&#8217; is <em><strong>Mustahab</strong></em> (desirable) and offering Salah is Mustahab, so whenever a person performs Wudu&#8217;, it is recommended to pray the two-Rak&#8217;ah Salah of Wudu&#8217; at any time, even during the times when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah, because the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever performs Wudu like this Wudu&#8217; of mine and then prays a two-Rak&#8217;ah Salah without being distracted with worldly matters during them will have their previous sins forgiven.)&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that whenever he (peace be upon him) performed Wudu&#8217;, he would pray the two-Rak&#8217;ah Salah of Wudu&#8217; and would encourage people to pray them, may Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon him. This Salah is called the Sunnah (supererogatory) Salah of Wudu&#8217;.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, there is nothing wrong with praying this Salah during the time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah, because it is a stressed Sunnah.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q: A questioner from Bahrain asks: Is it permissible for me to offer Salah (Prayer) at the time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah? For example, I may hasten to perform Wudu&#8217; (ablution) and start reciting the Qur&#8217;an and supplication, especially on Fridays after the &#8216;Asr (Afternoon) Prayer, knowing that I do not perform Wudu&#8217; for Salah, but I do it for supplication as mentioned. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If one performs Wudu&#8217; during the time when it is not permissible to offer supererogatory Salah, one may offer <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship) of Wudu&#8217; (ablution)</strong></span>, as there is no forbidden time for it. So, when performing Wudu&#8217; after Fajr (Dawn) Prayer or after Asr Prayer, it is prescribed to offer two Rak ahs (unit of Prayer) as Sunnah of Wudu&#8217;. This applies to both males and females.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, when entering the Masjid after &#8216;Asr or Fajr Prayer, it is prescribed to offer two Rak&#8217;ahs as <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Tahiyyat-ul-Masjid</strong></span> (two-unit-Prayer to greet the mosque) and there is no restriction regarding the time of these ceremonial Salahs; it may be offered during the time when it is impermissible to offer supererogatory Salah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same equally applies to the <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Salat-ul-Kusuf</span> </strong>(Prayer on a solar eclipse) when a solar eclipse takes place after &#8216;Asr Prayer. Muslims should perform Salat-ul-Kusuf, because this Salah is one of the ceremonial Salahs that are offered for specific reasons and there is no restriction imposed regarding the time when these Salahs are offered.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 11; Page No. 61)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is permissible to perform these ceremonial Salahs that are <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>offered for specific reasons</strong> </span>even during the time when it is impermissible to offer supererogatory Salah.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">29- Ruling on postponing the Sunnah of Wudu&#8217;</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">Q: A female questioner says: Should the Sunnah (supererogatory Prayer) of Wudu&#8217; (ablution) be offered immediately after Wudu&#8217; or is it permissible to postpone it due to some affairs while holding the intention of performing it after finishing my work? Which of these two practices is better; to perform it immediately or postpone it until I finish my work? May Allah reward you with the best! </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is better to hasten to perform the two-Rak&#8217;ah (unit of Prayer) Salah (Prayer) immediately after Wudu&#8217;, and if a person is occupied with work and thus prays it after that, this is acceptable. Both cases are good, but it is better to perform the Salah immediately.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Slaughtering animals upon building houses</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#800000;">Q: In our residential area, people are accustomed to slaughtering an animal upon starting or finishing the construction of a house. Neighbors and relatives are invited on this occasion. What is Your Eminence&#8217;s opinion about this practice? Is there any recommendable act to be performed before going to live in a new house? Benefit us may Allah reward you well!</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 2; Page No. 29)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This practice needs to be clarified.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If by slaughtering the animal the owners of the house seek to protect themselves from jinn or ensure that the house is safe to live in or any similar issue, this practice will be considered an act of <strong>Bid&#8217;ah</strong> (innovation in religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the slaughter is offered for the sake of the jinn, then it will be considered an act of <strong>major Shirk</strong> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) as it involves offering an act of Ibadah (worship) to someone other than Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if by doing this, one intends <strong>to show gratitude to Allah&#8217;s Blessings</strong> for reaching the roof or completion of construction works there is nothing wrong with this and with inviting the relatives and neighbors. This is the custom of many people who offer thanks to Allah due to Him helping them construct a house of their own instead of renting a house to live in. There is nothing wrong in this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the <strong>intention</strong> behind this is to protect oneself from jinn or to fulfill any other non-Islamic purpose, then this practice is impermissible.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This practice will be valid only if the intention is to show gratitude to Allah for enabling one to construct a house of their own. This practice is similar to being hospitable to one&#8217;s relatives and neighbors.This is also similar to holding a <strong>marriage banquet</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A similar practice is performed when people <strong>return from travel</strong> when animals are sacrificed and relatives are entertained. It was the Prophet&#8217;s (<em>sallallaahu alaihi wasallam</em>) regular practice that upon returning from a journey he would slaughter a camel and invite people to dine with him.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>32- Description of the relationship between the mind and the soul</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Human beings have both minds and souls. Can the soul oppose or agree with the mind? Is there a relationship between both the soul and the mind? Or does each of them operate independently?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mind and the soul are one entity. The mind thinks, considers and contemplates through the soul. If the soul departs the body, every other thing stops to be. While the soul is in the body, the mind thinks and distinguishes between good and evil, as the mind operates through the soul. Therefore, one can think, consider, plan, and decide as long as his soul resides in his body. When it is gone, one cannot think anymore.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">31-Ruling on making Du&#8217;a&#8217; the dead</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: What is the ruling on those who make Du&#8217;a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ans by Imam Ibn Baz (rahimahullaah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to the dead are Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). If they make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to the dead, idols, trees, stones, angels or jinn, they will be regarded as Kafirs (disbelievers) as making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to all these leads to one thing; namely, Kufr (disbelief that takes the Muslim out of Islam),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One thing that can be excluded from this ruling which is seeking help from his fellow Muslim brother or non-Muslim like buying a commodity from a non-Muslim, asking him to build a shop or mend a car while the person while he is alive. This case is considered to be exceptional and is not a kind of Shirk. It is similar to what Allah (Exalted be He) mentions in the story of Musa (Moses): <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>(The man of his own) party asked him for help against his foe)</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one asks his fellow Muslim brother or the non-Muslim, who is present, to do something for him like building a house, mending the car, or plowing the land in return for something, or they agree upon doing something that is legally permitted, there will be nothing wrong as all these things are normal and can be done by human beings who are alive and present.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But what is Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) is making Du&#8217;a&#8217; to those who are not present and cannot hear him, the dead or a living person whom he thinks to be supernatural and has a mysterious power. This understanding leads him to think that if he makes Du&#8217;a&#8217; to this person for forgiveness and admittance to paradise, he will be able to do this because of something secret about this person. This is Munkar even if the person who is invoked besides Allah (Exalted be He) is living.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Sufis who worship their Shaykhs and their senior and prestigious persons who are dead. They ask them for help and make Du&#8217;a&#8217; to them to cure the sick. All these things are considered to be major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) <strong>even if the person whom they make Du`a&#8217; to is alive because they ask him something beyond his abilities</strong>. This behavior differs from asking a person to lend you something, build a house for you, cultivate some land, mend a car, bring your belongings from the car, and so on. All these things are normal and contain there is nothing wrong in them.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">23- Sincerity in dedicating one&#8217;s deeds to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Q: Sister M. H. from Makkah Al-Mukarramah asks: What is the correct way to sincerely dedicate one&#8217;s deeds to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He)? How can deeds be done sincerely for His sake?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808080;">Answer by Imam Ibn Baaz (rahimahullah):</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To act sincerely, a person must turn to Allah (Exalted be He) and have an attentive heart. A person should perform all deeds such as Salah (Prayer), Sawm (Fast), Sadaqah (voluntary charity), Hajj (Major Pilgrimage), Umrah (Minor Pilgrimage), and so on, seeking the Pleasure of Allah, salvation from the Hellfire, and attainment of Allah&#8217;s Mercy and Forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sincerity is to seek the Pleasure of Allah (Exalted be He), to draw close to Him, to hope for His Mercy, to have one&#8217;s deeds accepted, to be saved from Hellfire, and to be admitted to Jannah (Paradise), not for the purposes of Riya&#8217; (showing-off) or enhancement of one&#8217;s reputation. A believer should perform deeds for the sake of Allah (Exalted be He) in order to attain salvation in the Hereafter, to be saved from the Hellfire, and to be granted absolution. Hence, every believer, male and female, should dedicate all their deeds to Allah seeking His Pleasure so that Allah may accept their deeds.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1- Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Is it true that some Muslims will enter Jannah (Paradise) without being called to account?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Yes, it is true, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(<strong>&#8220;All the nations were shown to me, and I saw a prophet accompanied by a small group of his followers, another with two or three people of his followers and a third not accompanied by any follower.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">At the end of the Hadith, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;Among my Ummah there are seventy thousand who would enter Jannah without being brought to account or being punished.&#8221;</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) asked who these people were, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) replied:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah (recitation for healing or protection); they are those who do not get themselves cauterized; and they are those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith implies that the Mu&#8217;min (believer), who continues obeying Allah&#8217;s commands and avoiding His prohibitions until death, will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds and without suffering punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Falling under this category are the Mu&#8217;mins who do not ask others to recite Ruqyah over them. There is nothing wrong, however, if they themselves are accustomed to reciting Ruqyahs over other Muslims. This is because one who recites Ruqyah basically does a good deed by asking Allah (Exalted be He) to cure the illness of the person for whom they recite the Ruqyah. This is based on the authentic Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Whosoever among you is able to benefit his fellow believer, let him do so.)</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Istirqa</strong></span>&#8216; means to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. For example, you may ask a person to recite Rygyah for you. It is better not to ask others for Ruqyah unless one happens to be suffering from an ailment, In this case, it is not wrong to ask others to recite Ruqyah. It has been reported that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) asked Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) saying: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Seek healing through asking for Ruqyah</span></strong>) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered her to treat herself by means of asking others for Ruqyah, He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to recite Ruqyah to the children of Jafar when they were under the influence of the evil eye. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>There is no Ruqyah (reciting Qur&#8217;an and supplicating over the sick seeking healing) better than that which is said as a treatment for an evil eye or (a sting of) a venomous animal</strong></span>.&#8221; It is not wrong to seek treatment by means of Istirqa’ when necessary. However, it is better not to resort to such means if it is possible to cure oneself by means of some other kind of medicine.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also better not to treat oneself by means of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>cauterization</strong> </span>if another means of treatment is available. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The best of all remedies are three; cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I hate to be cauterized.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version it states: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">..and I forbid my Ummah (nation) from cauterization.</span></strong>) This denotes that cauterization should be used as a last resort when all other means prove unsuccessful. It is better to seek treatment by other means if possible. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah. However, cauterization may only be resorted to when necessary. It is, however, better to apply another means of treatment like drinking honey, cupping, or reciting the Qur&#8217;an, The Prophet&#8217;s (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) statement: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are those who do not seek Ruqyah; they are those who do not get themselves cauterized&#8230;</strong></span>) does not denote that seeking Ruqyah or cauterization are prohibited; rather, it denotes that one may resort to other means of treatment in preference to these kinds. However, if one is forced by necessity to seek Ruqyah or cauterization, there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“T<strong><span style="color:#008000;">hey are these who do not believe in bad omens</span></strong>&#8220;: Believing in the occurrence of evil omens, a custom practiced by the pre-Islamic Arabs, constitutes an act of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among the characteristics of the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without being called to account is that they avoid the prohibited practice of believing in bad omens and the reprehensible practice of seeking Ruqyah and cauterization when there is no need for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>,&#8221; means that such Muslims avoid these things because they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He) and seek to attain His Pleasure. The statement implies that they steadfastly obedient to Allah (Exalted be He) and they avoid not only what He has declared as prohibited but also some of what He has declared as permissible if there is something better than it. By doing so, they hope for Allah&#8217;s Reward and fear His Punishment. They draw near to Him through doing deeds that He loves and do so with their hearts filled with trust and confidence in Him (Glorified and Exalted be He),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another similar Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand&#8230;)</span></strong> According to another Hadith: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Allah promised to increase the number by as many as three Handfuls added by my Lord, Glorified be He.</span></strong>) This increase in number is known to none but Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize, every upright Mu&#8217;min who avoids Allah&#8217;s Prohibitions and does not allow themselves to go beyond the limits set by Allah (Exalted be He) will be counted among the seventy thousand Muslims who will enter Jannah without Allah calling them to account or consigning them to punishment.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment. When the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) inquired about their characteristics, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told them that they are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omen. We ask Your Eminence to clarify these characteristics so that we may develop them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said that <strong><span style="color:#008000;">seventy thousand people of his Ummah (nation) will enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment.</span></strong> In another Hadith, it was stated: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">An extra number of seventy thousand Muslims will enter Jannah with every thousand.,.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) was asked about their characteristics, he said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah from others, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.</span></strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith refers to pious and faithful Muslims who adhere steadfastly to Allah&#8217;s Din (religion), those who worship Allah Alone, those who fulfill their religious duties, those who avoid His Prohibitions and strive hard to do good to the point that they decline to do what is permissible, yet undesirable, like seeking Ruqyah and cauterization. This perfects their Iman (faith). They do not ask others to make Ruqyah for them nor do they get themselves cauterized. It is better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization unless under necessity. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also ordered Asma’ bint Umays to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah when they were under the influence of the evil eye. This indicates that seeking Ruqyah is permissible only when necessary. However, it is better not to treat oneself by means of Istirqa&#8217; or cauterization if another means of treatment is available, Some of the Sahabah were treated by means of cauterization. Khabbab ibn Al-Arat and other Sahabah were also treated by means of cauterization, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is also reported to have used cauterization as a means of treating the sickness of some of his Sahabah. Having oneself cauterized does not necessarily mean that one will not be counted among the seventy thousand people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds. However, one of their good characteristics includes their uprightness, truly obeying Allah (Exalted be He) and avoiding disobedience to Him.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the meaning of the following Hadith: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) once asked his Sahabah: &#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221; They asked him about those people who will enter Jannah without being called to account. Whereupon the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said: &#8220;They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This has been reported in the Hadith about the seventy thousand Muslims who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) told his Sahabah that his Ummah were displayed before him. Among them were seventy thousand people who are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account and without suffering punishment, Some people said; &#8220;The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) may be referring to those who were born Muslims.&#8221; Others said: &#8220;He may be referring to those who accompanied the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) during the early days of Islam and did not associate any partners with Allah.&#8221; When the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) entered upon them, he asked them about the topic they were discussing, When they told him that they were inquiring about the Muslims who will enter Jannah without being judged, the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said; (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not seek Ruqyah, those who do not get themselves cauterized, and those who do not believe in bad omens; rather, they put their trust in their Lord</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to the characteristics mentioned in the above Hadith, they also fear Allah, believe in Him and hold steadfastly to His Din (religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“<strong><span style="color:#008000;">They are those who do not get themselves cauterized</span></strong>&#8221; means that they do not resort to cauterization when they are ill. Another great characteristic is that they put their trust in Allah (Exalted be He), However, it is permissible to treat sickness by means of cauterization or seeking Ruqyah as the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have permitted them both. He permitted “Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah. He also permitted the mother of Ja ‘far&#8217;s children to treat them by means of seeking Ruqyah. However, if another means of treatment is available, then it will be better not to resort to seeking Ruqyah or cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, drinking honey, and cupping, yet I do not like to be cauterized</span></strong>. )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Believing in bad omens is prohibited because it leads to pessimism. There is a narration from Imam Muslim that states: &#8220;They do not recite Ruqyah to others,&#8221; but its status has been classified as weak. Some narrators have mistaken seeking Ruqyah for Ruqyah. There is nothing wrong if the Muslim recites Ruqyah for his fellow Muslim, The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing wrong with Ruqyahs as long as they do not contain formulas that bear the meaning of Shirk</span></strong>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have recited Ruqyah to his Sahabah, “Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) is also reported to have recited Ruqyah over the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) when he fell sick. The Sahabah are also on reported to have recited Ruqyah to each other. There is nothing wrong with reciting Ruqyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is better not to seek Ruqyah unless there is a necessity. This is based on the fact that the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered Aishah saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over you.</strong></span>&#8221; The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) also said to the mother of the children of Ja ‘far &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">You may ask for someone to recite Ruqyah over them (her children).</span></strong>&#8221; There is nothing wrong to ask someone saying: “<strong>O so and so, recite the Qur&#8217;an over me so that Allah may cure my sickness. May Allah reward you greatly</strong>.&#8221; There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is need for that.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Who are the people who will enter Jannah without being held accountable for their deeds? Are they those who do not recite Ruqyah for themselves nor for others? Kindly explain this to us. May Allah reward you with the best.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Those who follow Allah&#8217;s Din, fulfill His religious duties, and avoid His Prohibitions are destined to enter Jannah without being called to account or suffering punishment. Among them are the seventy thousand who do not seek Ruqyah, have themselves cauterized or believe in bad omens, but put their trust in Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They also do not believe in bad omens because believing in them is prohibited. Moreover, they prefer to avoid cauterization as a form of treatment, This is because the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said that these are among the characteristics of the seventy thousand (who will enter Paradise without being called to account). It would be better to use another form of treatment instead of cauterization. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey, yet I do not like to be cauterized, ) The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have cauterized some of his Sahabah, Therefore, it is better not to treat oneself by means of cauterization, especially when another means of treatment is available. If no other means is available, then there is nothing wrong to resort to this. That does not necessarily mean that they will not be accounted among the seventy thousand. This is because the seventy thousand are those who adhere to the Din of Allah, avoid His Prohibitions, and fulfill the duties He prescribed. Among their good characteristics is that they do not seek Ruqyah. However, seeking Ruqyah does not necessarily mean that they will not be included among the seventy thousand. Seeking Ruqyah is to ask others to recite Ruqyah for you. There is nothing wrong to ask for Ruqyah if there is need for that. The Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) ordered ‘Aishah to treat herself by means of seeking Ruqyah, He also ordered the mother of the children of Ja far to treat her children by means of seeking Ruqyah, so there is nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is also nothing wrong to have oneself cauterized if there is a need for that. This is based on the Hadith in which the Prophet (sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is reported to have said: (The best of all remedies are three things: cauterization, cupping, and drinking honey.) This Hadith denotes that though it is permissible to seek treatment by means of cauterization, it is preferable not to resort to it, especially when some other sort of medicine is available.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">7- The most authentic books on “Aqidah</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Q: Please guide me to the most authentic book on true Islamic Aqidah (creed)! May Allah grant you success!</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A: The most authentic, noblest and greatest book dealing with the subject of Aqidah and other subjects is <strong>the Glorious Qur&#8217;an</strong>. It contains the most truthful speech. </span><span style="color:#000000;">No falsehood can approach it from before or behind it. It is a revelation from Allah, the All-Wise, the Praiseworthy. I advise the inquirer and all Muslims to hold fast to the Qur&#8217;an and to give it due attention by reciting it often, reflecting on its meanings and trying hard to memorize as many chapters of it as possible. It is the Greatest Book which Allah has sent down to His servants so that they may memorize it, follow its teachings and act upon it. It contains plain truths and clear guidance. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states, «<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Verily, this Qur’an guides to that which is most just and right</strong></span>» </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He (Glorified be He) also says,« <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>it is an honourable well-fortified respected Book (because it is Allah’s Speech, and He has protected it from corruption)</strong></span>» «<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Falsehood cannot come to it from before it or behind it: (it is) sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all praise (Allah azza wa jal)</strong></span></span>».<span style="color:#000000;"> and: «<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur’an) as an exposition of everything, a guidance, a mercy, and glad tidings for those who have submitted themselves (to Allah as Muslims)</span></strong>.»</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I thus advise the inquirer to care for this Great Book, recite it frequently, ponder over its meanings, study it together with colleaques and fellows, and refer to reliable books of Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an), such as the book entitled <strong>&#8220;Adwa&#8217; Al-Bayan&#8221;</strong> for Al-Baghawy, <strong>Tafsir Ibn Kathir </strong>(may Allah be merciful to them all), and the like. They may also refer to commentaries of other Mufassirs (exegetes of the Qur&#8217;an) who clarified the meanings of the Ayahs of the Qur&#8217;an, citing related Hadiths of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I advise you my fellow brother to study the Book of Allah and to pay due concern to the <strong>Sunnah</strong> (whatever reported from the Prophet) of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), which contains guidance and light. You may refer to such books as <strong>Sahih Al-Bukhari</strong>, <strong>Sahih Muslim</strong> and the remaining four collections of Hadith (<strong>Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, Al-Nasa&#8217;i, and Ibn Majah</strong>). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There are also many other books which </span><span style="color:#000000;">explain the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him), including the <strong>Muwatta&#8217; of Imam Malik</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), the <strong>Sunan of Al-Darimi</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), the <strong>Sahih of Ibn Khuzaymah</strong>, the <strong>Sahih of Ibn Hibban</strong>, <strong>Al-Hakim</strong> and other books which are very beneficial. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">If you have some knowledge of Hadith, you will be able to differentiate between authentic and false Hadiths cited in the books referred to above. The Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) are an exception to this. The Muslim Ummah (community) has unanimously agreed on the authenticity of all the Hadiths compiled in them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">You are also advised to follow in the footsteps of the righteous scholars of Hadith. The Two Sahih Books of Hadith have gained the credibility of AhI-ul- Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream). The Muslim Ummah has also acknowledged them as authentic. Therefore, you must adhere to them tenaciously. You must also hold fast to the Book of Allah, the remaining four books of Sunan and the books we just mentioned. Scholars of Hadith have pointed out weak Hadiths and have given reasons for their weakness.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">As for books on the topic of “Aqidah, they are many. One of the best books in this regard is the <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221; by Ibn Khuzaymah</strong>, <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Sunnah&#8221; by *Abdullah Ibn Ahmad Ibn Hanbal</strong>, <strong>&#8220;Minhaj Al-Sunnah&#8221;, by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>, which refutes the claims of the Mutazilites, and <strong>&#8220;Zad Al-Ma‘ad&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong>, knowing that the latter is very good reference in the field of “Aqidah and rulings of Shariah (Islamic Law). Other books include <strong>&#8220;Ijtima Al-Juyush Al-Islamiyyah&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> which refutes the claims of innovators in religious matters, &#8220;<strong>Al-Sawa ‘iq Al-Mursalah&#8221; by Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong>, which also involves refutation of the claims of innovators in religious matters, and <strong>&#8220;Al- Aqidah Al-Wasitiyyah&#8221; by Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>. This is a concise book which involves great benefit to Muslims. It is in line with the guidance of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah, and Shaykh- ul-Islam advised all Muslims, particularly seekers of knowledge, to memorize it, as it contains clear illustration of the doctrine of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama ‘ah. Shaykh-ul-Islam also authored a book entitled <strong>&#8220;Al-Risalah Al-Hamawiyyah&#8221;</strong> which answers questions posed by the people of Hamah </span><span style="color:#000000;">concerning proper understanding of Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes, and other questions related to Aqidah. Upon visiting the people of Tadmur, he also wrote an epistle which he entiteled <strong>&#8220;Al-Risalah Al-Tadmuriyyah&#8221;.</strong> It is a great piece which clarifies sound Aqidah. There is also a book entitled &#8220;<strong>Al- Aqidah Al-Tahawiyyah&#8221; by Imam Al- Izz</strong>. It is wonderfully written. There is also another book called <strong>&#8220;Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221; written by Shaykh-ul-Islam Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him), which is a valuable book. He also wrote <strong>“At-Thatlathat Al-Usul&#8221;</strong>. He also wrote a short treatise on Aqidah. Another book called <strong>&#8220;Fat-h Al-Majid Sharh Kitab Al-Tawhid&#8221;</strong> was written by his grandson Shaykh ‘Abdul-Rahman Ibn Hasan Ibn Al-Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab. It is a great and useful book. The book was annotated by Shaykh Sulayman Ibn ‘Abdullah Ibn Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab. He titled it &#8220;<strong>Taysir Al- Aziz Al-Hamid li-Sharh Kitab Al-Tawhid</strong>&#8220;. It is also a great and useful book.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I advise all Muslims to refer to and benefit from these and other beneficial books on the subject of Aqidah. I again stress the fact that the Qur&#8217;an is the greatest, noblest and most truthful of all books. It is the greatest remedy for those who seek healing for their souls. The Salaf (righteous predecessors) did not have any other book except the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). The Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) and the Tabi‘un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) had only the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and the Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and they were sufficient for them. They contain every type of guidance. However, there is nothing wrong in referring to the books of well known and reliable scholars as has been mentioned.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There is no harm in making use of their writings, benefiting from them or calling other people to benefit from them. Some people may not trust their own understanding of the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah, and when they refer to books written by reliable scholars and such references happen to be in conformity with their understanding, their knowledge is further enhanced and their hearts are set at ease. Allah alone grants success.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Q: What are the means which help one to wake up for Fajr (Dawn) Prayer?</strong></span></p>
<p>(Part No. 6; Page No. 147)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>From among the helping means is to sleep early after ‘Isha’ (Night) Prayer. One should sleep early and should not stay up late and set the alarm to wake up an hour before the Adhan (call to Prayer) in order to benefit and profit from this blessed time. One can also ask their household members to wake them up for Fajr Prayer. The point is that one has to make use of all possible means along with asking Allah for help and success.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 4; Page No. 17)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4- Observing causes does not contradict Tawakkul</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: The questioner asks: “I recite many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) that talk about Tawakkul (putting one’s trust in Allah). How can we observe Tawakkul in our life? I hope you will give me examples of that.”</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Tawakkul is one of the duties of the believers. Allah (Glorified be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and put your trust in Allah if you are believers indeed</strong></span>.) , (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He will suffice him</span></strong>.) and, (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>and in Allah (Alone) let those who trust, put their trust.</strong></span>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Tawakkul is one of the acts of worships and obligations upon Muslims. It means entrusting all affairs with Allah (may he be Exalted) and depending upon Him in everything. It also means putting one&#8217;s trust in Allah along with observing the causes. One should believe that Allah is the Causer of causes and the Disposer of all affairs and that everything rests in Allah&#8217;s Hands (Glorified and Exalted be He). One should also believe that no one can hinder what Allah gives and no one can give what Allah hinders and that Allah is the benefit Giver and the harm Inflicting, and the Supreme Giver and the Preventer. But, at the same time, one should follow legal causes that can bring him benefit by eating when he is hungry, drinking when he is thirst, marrying, earning lawful provision through selling and buying and other things. One should not neglect observing causes and put his trust in Allah along with believing that nothing happens to him except what is predestined by Allah (Exalted be He) and that he will not succeed without Allah&#8217;s support and help. Therefore, one should observe causes and put his trust in Allah and rely upon Him alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Part No. 4; Page No. 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One should treat the patient while putting his trust in Allah as He is the One Who brings cure. You should follow the causes by seeing a physician, carrying out his instructions, having medicine, Cauterization, dietary or the like. You should sell and buy while putting trust in Allah and believing that nothing will occur except what Allah predestines for you. You can rent your estates in order to receive their due revenues, irrigate your farm, give your animals to drink and eat in order to gain their benefits while depending upon Allah in all these things. This means that one should observe the causes in everything while putting his trust in Allah and believing that He is the Causer of causes, Disposer of all affairs, benefit Giver, harm Inflicting, the Supreme Giver and the Preventer. One should only observe the causes that are ordained for him. You travel for performing Hajj (Pilgrimage), Umrah (Lesser Pilgrimage) or for trading while observing causes and believing that Allah is the Causer of causes and He is the Only One Who can make you reach your destination, support you in performing rites of Hajj and help you to achieve your goals in trade, return from your journey, and so on.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">20- The wisdom of creating the universe</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: It has become quite common knowledge that this world came into existence only for the sake of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and that had it not been for his sake, it would not have come into existence. I hope that our grand Shaykh will answer this question and mention related evidence. May Allah reward you richly.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This claim is adopted by some common people who lack proper understanding of the purpose of life. Some people say that the world was created for the sake of Muhammad. They say that were it not for Muhammad (peace be upon him), neither the world nor the people living in it would have been created. This is a false and groundless claim which is based on corrupt understanding. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allah (Exalted be He) created the world so that people would know Him, realize His existence and worship Him Alone (Glorified and Exalted be He)</strong></span>. He created the world and human beings so that His Names and Attributes, His Graciousness and Knowledge would be known and so that He Alone would be obeyed and worshipped with no partner. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">He did not create this world for the sake of Muhammad, Nuh (Noah), Musa (Moses), Isa (Jesus) or any other prophet</span></strong>. Rather, Allah (Exalted be He) created the universe so that He Alone would be worshiped with no partner or associate,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And I (Allah) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)</span><span style="color:#008000;">. )</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) states that He created mankind so that they would worship Him and not for the sake of Muhammad (peace be upon him), Being one of the prophets, Muhammad (peace be upon him) was also created to worship His Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) states, (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And worship your Lord until there comes unto you the certainty (i.e, death).</span> </strong>)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Surah Al-Talaq, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, (<strong><span style="color:#008000;">It is Allah Who has created seven heavens and of the earth the like thereof (i.e. seven). His Command descends between them (heavens and earth), that you may know that Allah has power over all things, and that Allah surrounds all things in (His) Knowledge</span></strong>. )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says,(<strong><span style="color:#008000;">And We created not the heaven and the earth and all that is between them without purpose!</span> </strong>}</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) created mankind so that He would be worshipped, obeyed, glorified and so that people may know that He has power over all things and that He disposes of all affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, the questioner must realize that the things which he heard are void and groundless. It was not for the sake of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) nor for the sake of any other messenger that Allah (Exalted be He) created the jinn, mankind, the heavens, the earth or other objects. Rather, Allah (Exalted be He) created life and mankind so that He will be worshipped Alone without any partner and that His Names and Attributes are known to everyone. This is the truth of the matter as is indicated by many proofs. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">This is by no means in contradiction with the fact that Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the best and most honorable of men, the last and final Prophet, and the master of the children of Adam</span></strong>. It must be known that Allah (Exalted be He) created him for the purpose of worshipping Him, which is the very purpose for which all mankind was created. Again, Allah (Exalted be He) did not create people for the sake of Muhammad (peace be upon him). At the same time, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the best of all people. Therefore, you must understand this and convey it to others because this matter is very important.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some &#8216;so-called&#8217; scholars and uneducated extremists have misunderstood this matter and this may confuse common Muslims. On the contrary, people of knowledge and far-reaching insight know very well that these are but false claims and that Allah (Glorified be He) created mankind for the purpose of worshipping Him Alone and that they may come to know about His Names and Attributes, like the All-Wise, the All-Knowing, the Hearer, the Answerer of supplications, the One Who has Power overall things, and the One Whose Being, Names and Attributes and Actions are perfect.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>1- Definition of Islam</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Please, illustrate to me the meaning of Islam.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>Islam</strong> means <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>total submission to Allah (Exalted be He) through belief in His Oneness, and showing subservient and servile obedience to Him</strong></span>. This is the meaning of Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabic root word ‘<strong>Aslama</strong>&#8216; means to show submission and surrender to someone and obey his commands. Accordingly, Islam means surrender and submission to Allah&#8217;s Will by means of believing in His Oneness, being devoted to Him, obeying His commandments and abandoning what He has prohibited. Such is Islam, about which Allah (Exalted be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam</strong></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides, a Muslims are thus called as they show complete submission to Allah and obey Him, abiding by His Commandments and refraining from what He has prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is also a name for <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>all the Commandments of Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him)</strong></span>, including Salah (Prayer), Sawm (fast), Zakah (obligatory charity), Hajj (pilgrimage), faith and so on. Such categories fall under Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this regard, Allah (Exalted be He) says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favor upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion</b></span></span>.)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: (<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers</strong></span>, )</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, a Muslim is a person who submits himself to Allah (Exalted be He) as far as words, practical behavior and belief are concerned. In other words, Islam stands for total submission to and abidance by His Commandments in all aspects of life.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">167. The difference between the Fard and Nafilah Prayers</p>
<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Q: Are there differences between the Fard and Nafilah Prayers ?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Yes, there are differences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>Nafilah</em> is a desirable supererogatory act, while the <em>Fard</em> is obligatory, based on a definitive text. If one does not offer the <em>Nafilah</em> Prayer, such as <em>Salat-ul-Duha</em> (supererogatory Prayer before noon), <em>Al-Witr</em> (Prayer with an odd number of units), or the <em>Sunnah Ratibah</em> (supererogatory Prayer performed on a regular basis) related to the the <em>Zhuhr</em> (Noon), <em>Fajr</em> (Dawn), <em>Maghrib</em> (Sunset), and ‘<em>Isha</em>’ (Night) Prayers, one is not regarded as sinful for this. On the other hand, if one gives up the the Fard Prayers, one is sinful and may even be considered a disbeliever if one does so intentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Nafilah Prayer may be offered while sitting, even if the person performing it is healthy, while the Fard Prayer cannot be performed while sitting unless the person offering it has a reason for this; such as being sick or disabled.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) would sometimes offer the optional late night Prayer while sitting, and he (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said: (<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever prays while standing will get greater reward;one who prays while sitting will get half of the reward of the person praying while standing; and one who prays laying will get half of the reward of the person who prays sitting</strong></span>.) Peace and blessings be upon the Prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is permissible in general to pray the Nafilah during the night or day while sitting. However, this is not the case with the Fard Prayer. The latter must be offered while standing, as the Prophet (sallallahu alaihi wasallam) said to “Imran: (<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Offer Prayer while standing).</span></strong> He said to ‘Imran ibn Al-Husain (may Allah be pleased with him): (<strong><span style="color:#000000;">Pray while standing and if you cannot, pray while sitting, and if you cannot do even that, then pray lying on your side.) (If you cannot do even that, you can pray lying on your back</span></strong>.) This Hadith is about the Fard; as for the Nafilah, there is no problem if one performs it while sitting; if he or she finds himself or herself too tired to stand while praying the same, they may sit.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>However, I know also that some scholars dispute this, so I want to know the generally-accepted opinion of scholars in this regard. May Allah reward you with the best.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The correct opinion is that <strong>nutritive injections break the Sawm if taken deliberately</strong>. However, this does not apply to ordinary injections which are solely medical. May Allah grant us success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is permissible for a person observing Sawm (Fast) to be treated by injections, whether intravenous or intramuscular, during the day in Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not permissible to have nutritive injections</strong></span>, as they come under the same ruling as having food and drinks.Thus, taking them is considered a trick to break Sawm in Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is possible to have the intravenous or intramuscular injections during the night, it will be better.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From <a href="http://alifta.net/Fatawa/MoftyDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;Type=Mofty&amp;section=tafseer&amp;ID=2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">`Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz</a> to the honorable brother H. M. Th., may Allah grant him safety! May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you. In respect of your request for Fatwa registered in the Department of the Scholarly Research and Ifta’ (no. 1513), dated (21/4/1407 A.H.), it contains three questions. Here are the answers:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"> Q3: What is the wisdom behind saying, <span class="f"> </span><strong>لا حَوْلَ وَلا قُوَّةَ إِلا بِالله</strong> &#8220;<strong>La Hawla Wala Quwwata Illla Billah</strong>&#8221;  (There is no might nor power except with Allah) when the Mu`adh-dhin says, <strong> حي على الصلاة</strong> &#8220;<strong>Hayya `Ala Al-Salah</strong> (Come to Salah)&#8221; and  <strong>حي على الفلاح &#8220;Hayya `Ala Al-Falah</strong> (Come to Success)&#8221; taking into consideration that they imply a call to Salah? Is there a Hadith that refers to that?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The wisdom behind that saying is that man is weak by nature. He has no ability to move from a condition to another except with the help of Allah. Even his going to Salah in congregation needs the help and power of Allah. A servant of Allah has no might or power except with Allah. He realizes that he is weak, powerless, and unable to answer this call unless Allah helps him Alone. Therefore, upon hearing that call, he says: &#8220;La Hawla Wala Quwwata Illa Billah&#8221;.</strong> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is authentically reported from `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) as related by Muslim in his Sahih. May Allah grant us all success! May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!</p>

<p>Q 43: What is the ruling on blood donation? [1]</p>
<p>A: There is no wrong in doing so, especially at times of necessity and need.</p>
<p>[1] Published by Al-`Arabiyyah Magazine, Rajab, 1420 A.H.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>What is the ruling on non-Muslims donating blood to Muslims?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 1: What is the ruling on blood donation? What is the ruling on non-Muslims donating blood to Muslims?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is permissible to donate blood to Muslims whether the donor is Muslim or Kafir (non-Muslim); and whether he is of the People of the Book, or idolater if there is no harm to the donor and the person to whom blood is donated was in need of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; &#8211; alifta.net<br />
Fatwas of the Permanent Committee&gt;Group 1&gt;Volume 25: Miscellaneous Fatwas 2&gt;Treatment with blood&gt;Blood donation</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it allowed to transfer blood from one person to another, and what if the two are of different religions?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a patient becomes so sick that the only way for him to get better is to undergo a blood transfusion, and when doctors are at least confident of the benefits that will result, he may be treated in this fashion, even if the donor and the recipient belong to different religions. Blood form a disbeliever, even though he may be at war with the Muslims, can be donated to a Muslim. <strong>And Muslim blood may be donated to a disbeliever who is not at war with the Muslims</strong>. May Allaah send peace and blessings upon Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Muslims donating blood to non-Muslims is a good deed</strong></span></h3>
<p>The former Mufti of Saudi Arabia Shaykh bin Baz mentioned&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for Muslims to donate blood to non-Muslims and you will be rewarded (by Allah) for doing so. But it’s not permissible to accept compensation for donating blood. Thus Whoever accepted money for donating blood should give that money in charity to the poor.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transferring blood from a male to a female and vice versa</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is nothing wrong with transferring blood from a male to a female and vice versa, as this does not affect marriageability and such matters.</p>
<p>[Issued by the Permanent Committee, Fatwa no. 19477, the sixth question]<br />
<a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=319&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=319&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=17</a></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Donating blood and taking a Price / receiving Gifts for it.</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Receiving compensation for blood donation is unlawful, whether the compensation is money or any other kind of payment based on the Hadith reported on the authority of Abu Juhayfah in Sahih Al-Bukhari: The Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade the price of blood [1].There is a general Ijma` (consensus of scholars) that it is unlawful even if the money is a gift; for it is a gift given in return for something that it is forbidden to sell.</p>
<p>[1] Al-Bukhari, Sahih, Book on clothing, no. 5945; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 4, p. 308.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=321&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=17" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=321&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=17</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated `Aun bin Abu Juhaifa:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My father bought a slave who practiced the profession of cupping. (My father broke the slave&#8217;s instruments of cupping). I asked my father why he had done so. He replied, <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;The Prophet (صلّى الله عليه وسلّم) forbade the acceptance of the price of a dog or blood, and also forbade the profession of tattooing, getting tattooed and receiving or giving Riba, (usury), and cursed the picture-makers.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahih al-Bukhari 2086 (Book 34, Hadith 39), Translated Dr. Muhammad Muhsin Khan</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: A blood bank grants gifts to blood donors, such as prayer rugs, medals, head coverings or the like, and sometimes three hundred riyals. I would like to know what is the Islamic ruling on such gifts.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: After considering the Fatwa request, the Committee gave the following answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not permissible to sell blood based on the Hadith related in Sahih Al-Bukhari on the authority of Abu Juhayfah who said: I saw my father buying a cupper [a person who performs cupping] and ordered that his tools be broken. I asked him about this and he replied: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade the price of blood, the price of dogs, and the earnings of a prostitute; and he cursed the woman who tattoos others and she who gets tattooed, the one who takes or gives Riba (usury or interest), and the Musawwir (one who makes pictures, statues, or photographs of living beings).</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafiz in Al-Fath said: <strong>&#8220;This means that it is prohibited to sell blood just as it is prohibited to sell dead meat and pork. This is unanimously Haram (unlawful), i.e., to sell blood and take a price.&#8221;</strong></p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Does blood transfusion create a Mahram relationship?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Transferring blood from a man to a woman or vice versa does not fall under the same category as breastfeeding, whether linguistically, conventionally, or legally, nor is it liable to the rulings on breastfeeding, such as creating a Mahram (unmarriageable relatives) relationship or affecting marriageability and the like, as breastfeeding does.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Issued by His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad ibn Ibrahim Al-Shaykh, may Allah be merciful to him]</p>

<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Establishing an Islamic bank to store blood for emergency aid for wounded Muslims</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible to found an Islamic bank for accepting blood donations from people and preserving it to provide first aid to the Muslims who need it, provided that the bank does not take anything from the patients or their guardians in return for providing blood to them and does not use it as a commercial means to earn money. There is no doubt that such project will be of public interest to Muslims.</p>

Some people of knowledge, including Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his knowledgeable disciple Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah be merciful with both of them, supported this view saying that the astronomers may sometimes be wrong and then these reports are not reliable and people should not offer Salat-ul-Kusuf depending on them. Rather, they have to offer the Salah upon seeing the eclipse when it is happening.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The publications of the astronomers’ reports about the timing of eclipse should be banned by the Ministry of Information lest some people should be deceived by them. These publications may make people feel less fear upon seeing the eclipse. Allah (Exalted be He) has made them to be frightening and hence, people remember, fear, invoke Allah, and treat their slaves well. May Allah grant us success!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have received your noble letter, may Allah be pleased with you. I have also reviewed the enclosed documents on the properties of the copper bracelet recently made to cure rheumatism. I have considered the whole matter more than once and discussed it with a number of university lecturers. We exchanged opinions on the juristic ruling on the copper bracelet in question, but there were different opinions on the matter; some regard it permissible as it has properties of curing rheumatism, whereas others see that it is better not to wear it, on the ground that wearing it is like the practice of the people of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance), who used to wear copper amulets and bracelets, thinking that they were a cure for many diseases and a reason for the safety of the person wearing them against envy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`Uqbah ibn `Amir (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who wears an amulet, Allah will not fulfill their need, and anyone who wears a seashell, Allah will not give them peace</span>. [1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another narration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who hangs an amulet has committed Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). </span>[2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imran ibn Al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) also narrated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) saw a man with a brass bracelet on his hand. He (peace be upon him) asked him, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; The man replied, &#8216;A protection from weakness.&#8217; He (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;Cast it off, for verily it will only increase your weakness; and if you die wearing it, you will never succeed.&#8217; </span>[3]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another Hadith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) in one of his journeys sent a messenger to check the camels of the caravan, and ordered the cutting of all string necklaces hung around the necks of the camels which were thought by the people of Jahiliyyah to benefit and protect their camels. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Hadiths and others show that a Muslim must not wear amulets, bracelets, strings, bones, beads or other things that are used by some people to prevent or remove evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In my opinion, it is better not to wear or use this copper bracelet to block any means to Shirk, and to not let the heart be attached to such things, and to direct Muslims with their hearts toward Allah Alone trustingly and confidently, and to restrict oneself to lawful means that are indisputably permissible. Surely, what Allah has made lawful and accessible is sufficient and dispenses with any need for what is forbidden.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who guards themselves against doubtful matters keeps their religion and honor blameless, and anyone who indulges in doubtful matters indulges in unlawful matters, just as a shepherd who pastures his animals around a sanctuary will soon (transgress upon it and) pasture them in it. </span>[4]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Leave what causes you doubt and turn to what does not cause you doubt. </span>[5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Undoubtedly, wearing a copper bracelet is similar to what was practiced by the people of Jahiliyyah. Wearing it constitutes either a prohibited matter of Shirk or a means leading to Shirk or at least a doubtful matter.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is better for a Muslim not to wear it and resort to lawful medical treatment. This is the opinion that seems correct to a group of scholars, shaykhs, and myself as well with regard to this issue.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah (Exalted be He) to guide you and us to what pleases Him, grant us good understanding of His Religion, and protect us against all that opposes His Laws. Indeed, He is Able to do all things. May Allah safeguard you. As-salamu `alaykum.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;"><strong>Q: What is the opinion of your Eminence regarding the opinion of the one who says that Sawm in the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah is Bid`ah (innovation in religion)?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is an ignorant person who should be taught.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (peace be upon him)ordered that good deed should be done in them and fasting is one of the good deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are no days during which the righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these ten days (i.e. The first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah)</strong></span>.&#8221; They asked him: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>O Messenger of Allah, not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah?</strong></span>&#8221; He (peace be upon him) replied: <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Not even Jihad in the Cause of Allah, except in case one goes forth with his life and his property and does not return with either of it.&#8221;</span></strong> Narrated by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih Book of Hadith. [1]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Though it is not certain whether the Prophet (peace be upon him) fasted them or not, yet it should be relied on what the Prophet said because saying is much more significant than practice. When saying is accompanied by practice, this will affirm the Sunnah. The Sunnah of the Prophet are divided into saying, practice, and approving. Though each of them forms the Sunnah, the saying is the most significant and strong of them. Then, the practice comes next and then approval follows.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There are no days during which the righteous action is so pleasing to Allah than these days</strong></span>.&#8221; [2] By these days the Prophet means the first ten days of Dhul-Hijjah. Thus, if one fasts or gives to charity during them, one will be doing a great good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is ordained during these days also to recite Takbir (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221;), Tahmid (saying: &#8220;Al-hamdu lillah [All praise is due to Allah]&#8221;), and Tahlil (saying: &#8220;La ilaha illa Allah [There is no god except Allah]&#8221;) because he (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;There are no days that are greater before Allah or in which good deeds are more beloved to Him than these ten days, so recite a great deal of Tahlil, Takbir, and Tahmid during them</strong></span>.&#8221;[3]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: <strong>Among the qualifications necessary for a Da`y is that he should have patience, kindness, and gentleness with forbearing temperament as the prophets (peace be upon them) were.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never should a Da`y be rushing, violent, or unduly strict. Rather, he has to be patient, forbearing and kind while practicing Da`wah. To this effect, we have stated some evidence earlier. For example, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.”</strong> [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: And by the Mercy of Allâh, you dealt with them gently. In the story of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allâh).”</strong>[Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“O Allah, whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is hard upon them, be hard upon him, and whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is kind to them, be kind to him.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Muslim, Sahih, Book on rulership, no. 1828; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 6, p. 93.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, it is obligatory for you, slaves of Allah, to be kind in your Da`wah, and not to be harsh with people. Do not make people turn away from Islam because of your harshness, ignorance or violent, harmful approach. It is thus obligatory for you to be forbearing, gentle, pleasant and lenient in speech so that your words may have an effect on the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect on one toward whom your Da`wah is directed. As such, people will receive your Da`wah better, will be affected by it and will show appreciation. On the contrary, harshness causes disaffection, alienation, and division, not unity.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">A: If it is compulsory and a person has no choice, they should not take more than what they paid because this is a form of gambling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For example, if a person pays ten thousands to an insurance company, they should only take ten thousands only and if they pay four thousands, they should take four thousands only; for it is not permissible to accept any profit. If one receives an additional amount it should given it in charity.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>How to fight the Eastern and Western cultural invasion [1]</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family and Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that the gravest danger that Muslim societies are facing nowadays is the so-called cultural invasion with its different weapons, including all media means, printed and broadcast alike. Invaders have realized in the modern age that the old ways have become ineffective. Nations fight courageously to defend their religion, homelands and their heritage. Usurping by violence and terrorism is an inherently refused concept, especially in modern times after the spread of awareness among the people. The world has become like a small village and many organizations were established to defend the rights of nations, refuse political invasion, and claim the right to self-determination. Every nation has the right to have sovereignty over its own territory, invest its resources, and rule its territories according to its own standards. Nations also adopt different beliefs, creeds and ruling systems, which made invaders leave these countries after fierce, bloody wars.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, before leaving those countries, the invaders thought of many ways and prepared many plots based on thorough investigation, full awareness of the aims and effectiveness of those plans, and the ways that should be followed to accomplish them. Their aims revolved around designing highly deceiving curriculums of weak ties with religion, focusing on spreading their culture and instilling in the souls of most of the people the admiration of their material achievements in different aspects of life. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>When people, especially teenagers and young students, are impressed by this superficial brilliant achievements and inventions in the world, some of them who are totally impressed choose to complete their education in European and American universities</strong></span>. There they are surrounded with doubts and sorts of lusts systematically presented by orientalists and atheists, using well-organized, perverted, cunning schemes, where they face the Western lifestyle with all its corruption, dissolution and obscenity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rarely does a person remain safe from these weapons, being accompanied with enticement and lack of religion or authority. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>After completing their study and returning to their countries, those people assume important posts and become agents for the colonialists and apply their demands and implement their plots precisely, even with harsher means than those used by the colonialists themselves</strong></span>. This has taken place, indeed, in many countries that were occupied by invaders. The way to safety from this danger lies in establishing universities and institutes in different specializations, in order to limit the missions abroad and teach all forms of knowledge in all universities and institutes. This should be accompanied with paying attention to Islamic subjects and culture, in order to keep the `Aqidah (creed) of the students intact, and protect their morals and future, so that they take part in building their society on a Shari`ah (Islamic law) basis and according to the needs of the Islamic Ummah (nation). We should restrict educational missions abroad to certain forms of knowledge that are not available at home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah guide us to all what benefits the people and the countries, and protects the Muslims against anything that might harm them in their `Aqidah and morals. He is the Most Generous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, <strong>we need to take more care of curricula, add a perfect Islamic touch to them, and establish more scientific institutions to help the people study at home instead of traveling abroad</strong>. <strong>We should also choose teachers and managers perfectly; all of them should be of good morals, sound `Aqidah, reputation, jealousy on Islam, power and honesty.</strong> Whoever enjoys these traits is guaranteed and will most probably do their best to explain information to the students in a correct way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if it is a necessity to send some students to learn abroad due to the lack of some professional institutions, especially in the field of industry, an objective committee should be formed to choose the most suitable students in terms of religion and morals and who are well-versed in Islamic culture and have an Islamic spirit. The committee can also choose a knowledgeable, righteous supervisor, who is active in practicing Da`wah (calling to Islam), to accompany the mission, practices Da`wah there, supervises and guides the students, and refutes any doubts they may come across.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>They should be given even a short course before traveling to be aware of all the problems they might encounter abroad</strong>, and clarify the Shari`ah viewpoint and wisdom behind such issues according to the Qur&#8217;an, the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet), and the opinions of scholars. This includes, for instance, the rulings on slavery, polygyny in general, polygyny of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in particular, Talaq (divorce pronounced by a husband), the wisdom behind both offensive and defensive Jihad (fighting in the Cause of Allah), and such doubts that are mentioned by the enemies of Allah to Muslim youths, so that they would be fully ready to refute any such issues.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for facing the invasion of print and broadcast media, which have afflicted the Muslim Ummah in the modern age and have come to occupy most of the time of Muslims in spite of the deadly poison and the misleading promotion they usually contain, it is one of the most important tasks to protect Islam and the Islamic culture from its evil plotting. We should make sure that the Du`ah (callers to Islam) dedicate themselves to writing useful researches, periodicals and articles; practicing Da`wah, replying to different forms of cultural invasion and exposing their falsehood. The enemies have dedicated all their resources and potentials, founded many organizations and applied different means to deceive Muslims. Their misconceptions should be refuted and Islamic `Aqidah, legislation, rulings and morals should be clarified and explained in a nice, attractive way using suitable modern ways; wisdom and good discourse of preaching, arguing in a gentle way via all mass media as much as possible. Islam is the perfect religion that encompasses all goodness, guarantees happiness to all people, good progress, sound development, peace, security, prosperous life and winning in this world and in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims are afflicted by all this as they do not stick to their religion as they should have, with most of the people not understanding its reality, because of being not interested; ignorant of it; negligent of many scholars in clarifying its advantages, wisdoms and secrets; lack of honesty and patience in inviting others to it; and not bearing harm and using the modern ways. Thus, discrepancy took place. Most of the people have become ignorant of the Islamic rulings. They have become deluded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that the last generation of this Ummah will not succeed except with what brought success to the first generation &#8211; that is, to follow the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>[Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) to these idolaters (pagan Arabs) of your folk:] </strong><strong>Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord (the Qur’ân and Prophet Muhammad’s Sunnah), and follow not any Auliyâ’ (protectors and helpers who order you to associate partners in worship with Allâh), besides Him (Allâh). Little do you remember! </strong>[Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And verily, this </strong>(i.e. Allâh’s Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses 151 and 152)<strong> is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqûn </strong>(the pious &#8211; see V.2:2)<strong>.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 153]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>And this is a blessed Book (the Qur’ân) which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allâh (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you may receive mercy (i.e. be saved from the torment of Hell). </strong>[Surah Al-An`am, 6: 155]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), Who is the Most Truthful, has promised us a great victory and successful outcome in return for this in His Statement: &#8230;and<strong> (as for) the believers, it was incumbent upon Us to help (them). </strong>[Surah Al­Rum, 30: 47]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaqûn [the pious &#8211; See V.2:2], not the least harm will their cunning do to you. Surely, Allâh surrounds all that they do. </strong>[Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 120]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me. But whoever disbelieves after this, they are the Fâsiqûn (rebellious, disobedient to Allâh).</strong>[Surah Al-Nur, 24: 55]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And: <strong>O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm</strong>.[Surah Muhammad, 47: 7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) in this regard. When the Salaf (righteous predecessors) applied these noble Ayahs, whether in words, actions, or beliefs, Allah granted them victory over their enemies, made them rulers of the world, spread justice through them, and made them leaders of the Ummah and Imams of guidance. When the latter generations faltered in this (Allah&#8217;s Orders) their conditions declined, according to Allah&#8217;s Statement: <strong>Verily, Allâh will not change the (good) condition of a people as long as they do not change their state (of goodness) themselves (by committing sins and by being ungrateful and disobedient to Allâh).</strong>[Surah Al-Ra`d, 13: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah make the Muslims, whether people or governments, return to their faith in a proper way; grant them comprehension of it, cause them to apply it, make them unanimous on Al-Haqq (the Truth), guide them to cooperation in righteousness and piety, and enjoining each other to Al-Haqq and persevering upon it. He is the All-Hearing, Ever Near. May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: <strong><span style="color:#993300;">Among the qualifications necessary for a Da`y is that he should have patience, kindness, and gentleness with forbearing temperament as the prophets (peace be upon them) were.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Never should a Da`y be rushing, violent, or unduly strict. Rather, he has to be patient, forbearing and kind while practicing Da`wah. To this effect, we have stated some evidence earlier. For example, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.&#8221;</strong> [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says: And by the Mercy of Allâh, you dealt with them gently. In the story of Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron), Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;And speak to him mildly, perhaps he may accept admonition or fear (Allâh).&#8221;</strong> [Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 44]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;O Allah, whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is hard upon them, be hard upon him, and whoever gains control over some affairs of my people and is kind to them, be kind to him.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Muslim, Sahih, Book on rulership, no. 1828; and Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Musnad, vol. 6, p. 93.]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">So, it is obligatory for you, slaves of Allah, to be kind in your Da`wah, and not to be harsh with people. Do not make people turn away from Islam because of your harshness, ignorance or violent, harmful approach. It is thus obligatory for you to be forbearing, gentle, pleasant and lenient in speech so that your words may have an effect on the heart of your brother, or that it may have an effect on one toward whom your Da`wah is directed. As such, people will receive your Da`wah better, will be affected by it and will show appreciation. On the contrary, harshness causes disaffection, alienation, and division, not unity.</span></strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: It is known that many people are pessimistic about the month of Safar regarding many affairs. Such people, for example, do not conclude <strong>marriage contracts</strong> during Safar. Moreover, many people believe that it is not permissible to <strong>break a stick, knot ropes, or entwine fingers</strong> when concluding a marriage contract for this leads to failure of the concerned marriage and disharmony between the spouses. Since all the foregoing are beliefs bearing on ‘Aqidah (creed), could you please advise and clarify the ruling on it? May Allah guide us all to all that He loves and is pleased with.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Pessimism about Safar is not permissible. It is a characteristic of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance)</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Safar &#8211; just like all other months &#8211; does not bring good or evil, as good is only from Allah (Glorified be He) and evil is predestined by Him. Moreover, it is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) annulled the concept of pessimism when he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>There is no ‘Adwa (contagion, disease transmission naturally by itself not by the Decree of Allah), nor is there any Tiyarah (evil omen), nor is there any Hamah (pre-Islamic superstitious belief that the bones of a dead person turn into an owl), nor is there Safar (the month of Safar was believed to bring bad luck during Jahiliyyah).</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same applies to pessimism about entwining fingers, breaking a stick, etc., when concluding a marriage contract. Such beliefs are false, baseless, and thus they should not be adopted by a Muslim. May Allah grant us all success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: <span style="color:#993300;">Does performing ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) during the months of Hajj have any particular virtue different from performing it in other months?  </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The best month to perform ‘Umrah is during Ramadan, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ‘Umrah (performed) in Ramadan is equal to Hajj (in reward). <span style="color:#808080;">[1]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Agreed upon its authenticity by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to another narration by Al-Bukhari:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is equivalent to performing Hajj with me.<span style="color:#808080;"> [2]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the narration by Muslim:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is equivalent to Hajj or Hajj performed with me (in reward). <span style="color:#808080;">[3]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means that it is equivalent to Hajj or (indicative of uncertainty on the part of the Hadith narrator) equivalent to Hajj performed with the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, comes the <strong>‘Umrah in Dhul-Qa‘dah</strong>, for all the ‘Umrahs which the Prophet (peace be upon him) performed took place in Dhul-Qa‘dah. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow <span style="color:#808080;"> [4]</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>May Allah grant us success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;">Q: It is known that the scholars disagree as to whether it is obligatory to pay Zakah (obligatory charity) on jewelry that is worn, intended to be worn, or borrowed.What is Your Eminence’s opinion on this issue? Supposing that it is obligatory to pay Zakah on them, is there a Nisab (the minimum amount on which Zakah is due) for this? If there is a Nisab, it seems from the Hadith that indicate the obligation of giving Zakah on jewelry &#8211; where the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) warned against the punishment of Fire awaiting those who do not pay the Zakah &#8211; that there is no Nisab. How is this resolved? [1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is a famous controversy among the scholars as to whether it is obligatory to pay Zakah on gold and silver jewelry that is worn, intended to be worn, or borrowed. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The preponderant opinion is that it is obligatory, according to the general evidence on the obligation of Zakah on gold and silver</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also authentically reported that `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: <span style="color:#008000;">A woman came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) with her daughter, on whose hand were two heavy bangles of gold. He (peace be upon him) asked, “Do you pay Zakah on these?” She said, “No.” He (peace be upon him) said, “Would it please you if Allah were to encircle you on the Day of Resurrection with two bracelets of Fire because of them?” She threw them down and said, &#8220;They are (I have given them away) for the sake of Allah and His Messenger.&#8221;</span> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also authentically <span style="color:#008000;">reported from Um Salamah (may Allah be pleased with her) that she was wearing some gold ornaments, so she asked, “O Messenger of Allah! Is this Kanz (hoarded wealth, the Zakah of which has not been paid)?” He (peace be upon him) said, “Anything that reaches the amount at which Zakah is payable and its Zakah is paid is not considered Kanz.”</span> [3] The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not tell her that there is no Zakah on jewelry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these Hadith refer to jewelry that reach the Nisab, when they are combined with other evidence, as Hadith explain one another just as Qur’anic Ayahs (verses) explain one another, and also Hadith explain Ayahs and make their generality specific and their absoluteness limited, because all of them are revelation from Allah (Glorified be He). Whatever comes from Allah is not contradictory; in fact they confirm and explain one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is necessary that a Hawl (one lunar year calculated from the time a property reaches the minimum amount upon which Zakah is due) must be completed (on jewelry) as is the case with other categories of Zakah wealth, such as money, commercial commodities, and livestock. May Allah grant us success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Ruling on paying Zakah for building Masjids</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: What is the ruling on paying Zakah (obligatory charity) money for helping to build a Masjid (mosque) whose construction was halted due to lack of financial resources?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A: </b>According to the opinion of the majority of Muslim scholars and the Ijma` (consensus) of our Salaf (righteous predecessors), <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Zakah is not to be paid for constructing Masjids, buying books, etc</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, Zakah must be spent on the eight categories which are mentioned in the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) of Surah Al-Tawbah, i.e. the poor, the needy, those employed to collect (the funds), to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islâm), to free captives, for those in debt, in the cause of Allah, and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is worth mentioning that scholars are of the view that the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>category of &#8220;in the cause of Allah&#8221; refers only to Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah)</strong></span> and this does not include constructing Masjids, schools, roads, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah’s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Please advise me by giving me a Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) as to whether it is permissible to pay Zakah (obligatory charity) outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the known categories of Zakah recipients, in the same way as it is done inside the Kingdom. We appreciate your assistance and may Allah protect you. Wa‘alaykum as-salam warahmatullah wabarakatuh (And may Allah’s Peace and Blessings be upon you!)</p>
<p><strong>A question asked to His Eminence. He replied on 3/9/1410 A.H.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is permissible for the Zakah payer to send Zakah to a country other than where they are living, <strong>if this is for a Shar‘y (Islamically lawful) benefit</strong>, according to the more correct of the two opinions held by the scholars, <strong>such as </strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">sending it to the Mujahidun (strivers/fighters in the Cause of Allah),</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">to the poor who are in greater need than those in their country, or</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">for being their relatives, as this combines maintaining the ties of kinship and Zakah.</li>
</ul>
<p>May Allah guide everyone to that which pleases Him.</p>
<p>As-salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">A lecture entitled, &#8220;<strong>Zakah: Its status in Islam</strong>&#8220;, which His Eminence gave in<br />
Al-Jami Al-Kabir, Riyadh<b><br />
</b></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>In the Name of Allah, the Compassionate, the Merciful</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah, the Lord of all creation. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon His Slave, Messenger, Khalil (beloved, close elect) and truthful conveyer of the Divine Revelation, our Prophet, Imam and Master Muhammad ibn `Abdullah, his family, and Companions and whosoever follows his example and seeks his guidance until the Day of Resurrection. To continue:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The topic of the lecture as the presenter said is (<strong>Status of Zakah in Islam</strong>). Every Muslim individual who possesses the least knowledge of Islam knows that Zakah, being the third pillar of Islam, holds a great status in Islam. Zakah has been mentioned in connection with Salah (Prayer) in many places of the Qur&#8217;an. The Prophet (peace be upon him) also mentioned Zakah next to Salah in numerous Hadiths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât and bow down (or submit yourselves with obedience to Allâh) along with those who bow down (in prayer)&#8221;  </strong>[</span>Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 43]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;And perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) that you may receive mercy (from Allâh)&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#000000;">[</span><span style="color:#000000;">Surah Al-Nur, 24: 56]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another place, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;But if they repent, perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât) and give Zakât, then they are your brethren in religion&#8221; </strong>[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 11]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In yet another place, Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allâh, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât) and give Zakât, and that is the right religion&#8221; </strong></span>[Surah Al-Bayyinah, 98: 5]</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e., Al-Bukhari and Muslim) on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdullah ibn `Umar ibn Al-Khattab</span>(may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><span style="background-color:#d5d5d5;">I</span>slam was based on five pillars: testimony that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah; performing Salah (prayers), giving Zakah; fasting Ramadan; and performing Hajj (pilgrimage).</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="webkit-html-attribute-value" style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Book on faith, Chapter on Islam is based on five things, no. 8; Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on Islam is founded on five (fundaments), no. 16; and Al-Tirmidhy, Book on faith, Chapter on Islam is based on five things, no. 2609, and the wording is his]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another version, the Hadith reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Islam was based on five pillars: worshipping Allah Alone and disbelieving that there is any other Gods, performing Salah (Prayers), giving Zakah&#8230;</strong></span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Chapter on Islam is founded on five (fundaments), no. 16]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates the great position which Zakah holds in Islam. It is mentioned next to Salah both in the Qur&#8217;an and Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Salah is considered the cornerstone of Islam and the second greatest pillar next to only the Shahadah (testimony of faith).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says regarding Salah:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 238" target="_blank" name="Guardstrictly(fiveobligatory)" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Guard strictly (five obligatory) As-Salawât (the prayers) especially the middle Salât (i.e. the best prayer &#8211; ‘Asr ). And stand before Allâh with obedience [and do not speak to others during the Salât (prayers)]. </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 238]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) is also reported to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#000000;">That which differentiates us from the disbelievers and hypocrites is our performance of Salah. He who abandons it, becomes a disbeliever. </span></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">[</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Narrated by Al-Tirmidhy, Book on faith, Chapter on abandoning Salah, no. 2621.]</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) is reported to have said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">What makes one a disbeliever and a polytheist is abandoning prayers.</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on calling one who neglects Salah a disbeliever, no. 82]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Zakah is the sister pillar of Salah</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Salah is a physical act of worship in which the Muslim stands before Allah supplicating to Him, mentioning His Name and reciting Ayahs of the Qur&#8217;an. It has such a great effect on hearts. If performed properly, Salah will restrain one from committing indecent acts and will serve as a means to attaining happiness, safety and salvation. It will also set their heart aright and bless their deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One day the Prophet (peace be upon him) was speaking to his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) about Salah and he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Whoever observes it regularly, it will be a source of light, authoritative proof and a means of salvation on the Day of Resurrection, and whoever does not observe it regularly, it will not be a source of light, authoritative proof and a means of salvation and on the Day of Resurrection he will join the company of Fir`aun (Pharaoh), Haman, Qarun (Korah), and Ubay ibn Khalaf.</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Section on the Hadiths narrated by the Companions who narrated a large number of Hadiths, Section on the Hadiths narrated by `Abdullah ibn `Amar ibn Al-`As, no. 6540.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Imam Ahmad and others with a good Sanad (chain of narrators).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Commenting on the above Hadith, some scholars said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;On the Day of Resurrection one who abandons Salah will join the company of Pharaoh, Haman Qarun, and Ubayy ibn Khalaf on account of his imitating them.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The reason is that if he abandons it for the sake of holding a prestigious position, he will be behaving like<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Fir`aun (Pharaoh) </span>who, being an enemy to Musa (Moses, peace be upon him), transgressed and behaved arrogantly taking advantage of his royal position. T</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">he same is true with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Haman, </span>Pharaoh&#8217;s minister,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> </span>who, taking advantage of his position, behaved arrogantly and refused to follow Musa (Moses, peace be upon him). Therefore, one will dwell in Hellfire with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Haman, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Pharaoh&#8217;s </span>minister, because of being occupied with his prestigious position and getting distracted from obeying Allah.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">One who abandons it for the sake of collecting wealth will join the company of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Qarun (Korah) </span>who was addicted<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> </span>to the collection of wealth and lusting after his desires. He behaved arrogantly and disobeyed Prophet Musa. Thus, Allah caused the earth to swallow him up together with his dwelling. He was destined to enter Hellfire.<span style="line-height:1.5;">Those who behave after the manner of Qarun will enter Hellfire with him. We seek refuge in Allah from this. </span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="line-height:1.5;">One who abandons Salah on account of being busy, conducting buying and selling transactions will be behaving after the manner of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="line-height:1.5;"> Ubay ibn Khalaf, </span><span style="line-height:1.5;">the Makkan merchant,</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="line-height:1.5;"> </span><span style="line-height:1.5;">and will thus join his company in Hellfire. We seek refuge in Allah.</span></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Zakah and Salah are equally important.</strong> Those who abstain from paying it on account of miserliness and greed for wealth will join the company of Allah&#8217;s enemy who preferred collecting wealth to showing obedience to Allah and His Messenger. It is reported that <a name="WhentheProphet(peacebeupon"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112839" class="tip"></span>when the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent Mu`adh to Yemen, he said: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Invite them to bear witness that there is no God but Allah and that I am the Messenger of Allah. Should they accept your invitation, then tell them that Allah has prescribed upon them to offer five Prayers a day. Should they obey you, tell them that Allah has prescribed upon them to pay Zakah which is collected from the rich among them and given to the poor.&#8221;</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Section on Banu Hashim, the beginning of the Section on the Hadiths narrated by `Abdullah ibn `Abbas, no. 2072; Al-Bukhari, Book on Zakah, Chapter on taking Sadaqah from the rich and giving it to the poor&#8230;, no. 1496; and Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on calling people to the testimony of faith&#8230;, no. 19.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This indicates that Zakah was prescribed as an act of sympathy and kindness to the poor. It is an obligation due from one&#8217;s wealth which they are obliged to ensure its delivery to those who deserve it. This is based on the Hadith of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ibn `Umar </span>(may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> <a name="Ihavebeencommandedtofight"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112840" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#000000;">I have been commanded to fight against people until they testify that there is no God but Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, perform the Prayer, and pay Zakah. If they do that, their blood and property are guaranteed protection on my behalf except when justified by law, and their affairs rest with Allah.</span></span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Book on faith, Chapter on Allah&#8217;s Saying: &#8220;If they turn in repentance and establish the prayer&#8221;, no. 25; and Muslim, Book on faith, Chapter on the command to fight people until they profess that there is no God but Allah, no. 22.&#8217;]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This and other similar Hadiths indicate the lawfulness to fight those whose miserliness makes them abstain from paying Zakah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>During Abu Bakr&#8217;s lifetime, war was waged against those who refused to pay Zakah.</strong></span> This is because the blood of a Muslim is protected against being shed only when they establish Salah and pay Zakah. That is why when some Arabs refrained from paying Zakah following the Prophet&#8217;s demise, the Sahabah engaged in fighting against them so that they could pay it off. After the Prophet&#8217;s demise, some Muslims apostatized from Islam. Some of them said that had Muhammad been truly a Prophet of Allah, he would not have passed away. They forgot the fact that all prophets preceding him had also passed away.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some others refused to pay Zakah. At this point<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Bakr </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) delivered a sermon encouraging the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) to fight the apostates until they came back to Islam.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>argued with him saying: &#8220;How will you fight those who bear witness that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah?&#8221;<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Bakr </span>replied: &#8220;We have been commanded to fight against people until they testify that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. If they do that, their blood and property are guaranteed protection on our behalf except when justified by law.&#8221; Then Abu Bakr went on to say: &#8220;Is not Zakah one of Allah&#8217;s Rights? By Allah, I will keep fighting those who differentiate between Salah and Zakah. By Allah, if they refuse to give me as much as a she-kid which they used to give during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah, I will fight them on its account. Then<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>said: &#8220;It was nothing but Allah Who had guided<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Bakr </span>to fight and I came to realize that he was right.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sahabah unanimously agreed on fighting the Murtads (apostates). They fought against them vigorously until they came back to the fold of Islam. Only those among them who were destined to die as Murtads were killed at the hands of Muslims. We seek refuge in Allah from this. The ones killed included <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><strong>Musaylimah Al-Kadhab</strong> (the head of the apostates who claimed himself a Prophet after the death of Prophet Muhammad), </span>some of his followers, some people from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Banu Asad, </span>and others. As they refused to come back to Islam, Muslims continued to fight them until they were killed. Other Murtads were guided back to Islam by the Will of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To sum it up: Zakah is of great importance in Islam. It is the third greatest pillar next to Salah and Shahadah. Muslims are duty bound to deliver it to those who deserve it. If the Muslim ruler orders that Zakah be paid off to him to undertake the process of distributing it, his order must be executed. If he does not demand that, the believer has to distribute it to the poor and other people who deserve it. </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has defined the categories of Zakah recipientsin the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) where He (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> &#8220;As-Sadaqât (here it means Zakât) are only for the Fuqarâ’ (poor), and the Masâkin (needy) and those employed to collect (the funds), and to attract the hearts of those who have been inclined (towards Islâm), and to free the captives, and for those in debt, and for Allâh’s Cause, and for the wayfarer (a traveller who is cut off from everything); a duty imposed by Allâh. And Allâh is All-Knower, All-Wise. </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 60]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first and second categories of Zakah recipients include <strong>Faqirs</strong> (the poor) and the <strong>Miskins</strong> (the needy): These two have been defined as people who do not possess enough money. The Faqir is the person who does not have sufficient wealth to fulfill his needs or the needs of his dependents, such as food, drink, clothing and housing. The Miskin may be someone whose standard of living is better than the Faqir. However, their ruling is the same in all matters. They should be given an amount of Zakah which covers their basic needs for one whole year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third category of Zakah recipients includes <strong>those employed to collect Zakah</strong>: Collectors of Zakah include the people who travel around to collect it, or those who are responsible for maintaining it, or the scribes who record it in its register. Such people are given an amount from Zakah according to the effort they exert in collecting and maintaining it. The Muslim ruler can estimate the amount given to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth category includes <strong>the hearts that are newly inclined to Islam</strong>, This category includes chiefs, masters and men of high standing whose word is listened to by their people. When they enter Islam, their people are expected to follow in their footsteps. When they refuse to accept Islam, the same will be the attitude of their people. They are given a portion of Zakah with the purpose of strengthening their Iman (faith), or winning the hearts of their counterparts, or seeking their help in defending Islam against its enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth category includes the <strong>freeing of slaves and captives of war</strong>: Zakah is to be given to slaves so that they can set themselves free from the bondage of slavery. In this regard, Zakah is given to the type of slaves known as <strong>Mukatabs</strong> (slaves with an agreement to buy their freedom). According to the correct view, one who delivers Zakah may buy slaves with the money of Zakah for the purpose of freeing them. It is also permissible that he uses the money of Zakah in buying Muslims who have fallen captive to the Kafirs (disbelievers). Thus Zakah is delivered to the Kafirs as a ransom to release the Muslim captives.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The sixth category includes <strong>those in debt</strong>: These are the people who borrow money from others to provide the basic needs of their dependents or to reconcile between Muslims. They offer to pay the money in order to bring about reconciliation between Muslims who are at enmity with each other. One who offers to pay money for that purpose should be given an amount of the Zakah even if he is rich. Zakah is also given to insolvent debtors who are incapable of paying off their debts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The seventh category includes paying Zakah <strong>in the cause of Allah</strong>: in this category Zakah is given to equip Mujahidun (persons fighting in the Cause of Allah) with necessary weapons and cavalry if Bayt-ul-Mal (Muslim treasury) is short of providing them with this. Therefore, they are given a portion of Zakah which enables them to fight against the enemies of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The eighth category includes the <strong>wayfarers</strong>: wayfarers are people who move from one country to another. They may happen to run out of provisions due to the long distances they travel when journeying or being attacked by highway robbers or due to any other reason. They must be given a portion of Zakah which enables them to return home safely even if they are naturally rich people. They must be given an amount of Zakah that helps them return to their country.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zakah has such a great effect when delivered to those eight categories of recipients. It helps them perform the duties of Allah and relieves them of their sufferings like paying off their debts if they are in debt or freeing themselves from the bondage of slavery if they are slaves or fighting in the cause of Allah if they are Mujahidun or assisting the wayfarers.It is out of Allah&#8217;s mercy that He makes His poor and rich Slaves co-operate with one another in righteousness and piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Payment of Zakah is a way of giving thanks to Allah</strong> because of the blessings He bestows upon them. Allah is the true Bestower of favors and blessings. It is the duty of every Muslim to pay out their Zakah as an act of showing gratitude to Allah. A Muslim should thank Allah for making him a deliverer and not a recipient of Zakah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The upper hand is better than the lower one&#8230;</strong></span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Al-Bukhari, Book on Zakah, Chapter on Sadaqah should only be given by the wealthy, no. 1428; and Muslim, Book on Zakah, Chapter on the statement that the upper hand (that which gives) is better than the lower hand (that which receives), no. 1034]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The upper hand is the one that delivers Zakah while the lower hand is the one which receives it. The Muslim should thank Allah for providing them with wealth which they are duty bound to give a portion of to Allah&#8217;s Slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Zakah also purges the soul of the deliverer and purifies his wealth as well</strong>. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 103" target="_blank" name="TakeSadaqah(alms)fromtheir" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it&#8221;</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 103]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>You will be rewarded on account of paying Zakah both in this life and the Hereafter. </strong>Your money is purified and preserved when you pay it out.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is also a means of purifying the soul</strong>. This has been referred to in the above Ayah which reads: &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 103" target="_blank" name="TakeSadaqah(alms)fromtheir" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Take Sadaqah (alms) from their wealth in order to purify them and sanctify them with it&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslim gives their fellow poor Muslims from the wealth that Allah has bestowed on them, they will be abundantly rewarded by Allah for relieving them of their distresses.This act of yours will make them hold you in high esteem. It may be that they will make Du`a&#8217; (supplication) for you which may be a reason for your happiness and salvation in this life and the Hereafter. A Muslim is not harmed when they pay only a little amount of the many bounties that Allah has bestowed on them. They give these amounts to the children, old people and poor ones. The Muslim will receive great rewards from Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Allah has threatened those who refuse to pay Zakah out of miserliness.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And those who hoard up gold and silver [Al-Kanz: the money, the Zakât of which has not been paid] and spend them not in the Way of Allâh, announce unto them a painful torment</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 35" target="_blank" name="OntheDaywhenthat(Al-Kanz:" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>On the Day when that (Al-Kanz: money, gold and silver the Zakât of which has not been paid) will be heated in the Fire of Hell and with it will be branded their foreheads, their flanks, and their backs, (and it will be said unto them): <strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;This is the treasure which you hoarded for yourselves. Now taste of what you used to hoard.&#8221;</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 34-35]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the evil consequence of those who withhold payment of Zakah. They will be thrown into Hellfire where the wealth they amassed and refused to pay its Zakah will be a source of their agony on the Day of Resurrection. This will be a fitting retribution for their refusal to fulfill the right of Allah. While the wealth which a person does not give its due Zakah is labeled as &#8220;<strong>hoarded wealth</strong>&#8220;, that money whose due Zakah is paid is free of blame.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong> <a style="color:#000000;" name="Whateverreachesaquantityon"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112843" class="tip"></span>Whatever reaches a quantity on which Zakah is payable is not a treasure (kanz) when Zakah is paid</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Abu Dawud, Book on Zakah, Chapter on what is Kanz and Zakah on jewelry, no. 1564]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whenever you pay the Zakah due from the wealth in your possession, it will not be labeled as hoarded wealth and vice versa.If you refuse to pay Zakah due from it, it will be a source of your agony on the Day of Resurrection. It is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><a name="Anypersonwhopossessesgoldor"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="112844" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#000000;">Any person who possesses gold or silver and does not pay what is due from them (in another narration their Zakah); on the Day of Resurrection, plates of silver and gold would be heated for him in the fire of Hell and with them his flank, forehead, and back will be branded during a day the extent of which will be fifty thousand years. Then he will be shown his final abode, either to Paradise or to Hell. </span></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">He who possesses camels and does not pay what is due from him regarding them, will be thrown on his face or on his back in a vast desert plain (on the Day of Resurrection) and they will trample him with their hoofs and bite him with their teeth.

And he would be shown his last abode either to Paradise or to Hell. </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">He who possesses cows and sheep and does not pay their Zakah (in another wording of the Hadith what is due on him regarding them) will be thrown on the Day of Judgment in a vast desert plain and they will trample him with their hoofs and gore him with their horns. As often as the last of them passes him the first of them would be made to return to him again during a day the extent of which would be fifty thousand years. Then he would be shown his last abode either to Paradise or to Hell.</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on Zakah, Chapter on sin of one who does not pay Zakah, no. 987.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith indicates how severe the punishment is of one who refuses to pay Zakah out of miserliness. On the Day of Resurrection, their wealth will be a source of their grief and agony whether it be money, food, fruit, camels, cattle or sheep. They will be used as tools of punishment on the Day of Resurrection. The Prophet indicated how they will be punished with their own wealth. The same is true with regard to gold and silver and other things of the sort. We ask Allah to grant us safety and protection from this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>It is our duty and the duty of all Muslims to enjoin one another to pay Zakah.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We are duty bound to enjoin one another to fulfill Allah&#8217;s Rights, strive hard to do that and remind those who are negligent of paying Zakah. Reminding people of this benefits the believers. Zakah, Salah and fasting are all obligatory duties, yet one may be heedless of that because of the gravity of his sins which darken their heart and cause them to continually disobey Allah. Satan and his helpers also make their deeds fair-seeming to them until they become completely unmindful of Allah and the Hereafter. They fall victim to the worship of Satan and start to accompany evil people. Their hearts become obsessed with the love of wealth and lustful desires. They refuse to befriend righteous people and prefer to follow the path of deviant fellows. Therefore, it is the duty of all Muslims to remind those heedless Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#000000;" title="Surah Al-Dhariyat, 51: 55" target="_blank" name="Andremind(bypreachingtheQur%E2%80%99%C3%A2n," rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>And remind (by preaching the Qur’ân, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), for verily, the reminding profits the believers</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Dhariyat, 51: 55]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So remind them (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) &#8211; you are only one who reminds </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;"> [Surah Al-Ghashiyah, 88: 21]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A believer should remind his fellow believing brother. He should not assume that their fellow brothers are well aware of the consequences of refraining from paying Zakah. Whenever they see that their brothers have started to be neglectful of Allah&#8217;s duties, they must start advising them and reminding them of Allah through the use of kind words and gentle preaching. They should seem to beworried about them and concerned with their salvation and happiness. A true Muslim brother is one who keeps advising, reminding and directing you to the straight path. He never keeps himself away from you nor flatters you. Rather, he gives you counsel and admonishes you. He reminds you to be mindful of Allah. He shows you the path of salvation so that you can follow it and warns you of treading the path of perdition so that you can steer clear of it. You should never give up hope of advising him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;&#8230;and never give up hope of Allâh’s Mercy&#8221; </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Yusuf, 12: 87]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Despair not of the Mercy of Allâh&#8221;</strong></span> <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 53]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reality proves that there have been many disobedient Muslims who continued to be heedless of Allah&#8217;s Commandments for years. Then, the time came when they were guided back to the straight path at the hands of righteous Muslims who kept encouraging them to perform deeds of righteousness. They started to awaken from their heedlessness and pray to Allah for the sake of those who guided them. As Allah shows them true guidance, they return to the path of truth and repent to Him of all their past sins. In this way, Allah forgives them and atones their previous misdeeds. So, I advise you, my dear brothers, not to give up hope.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Someone has told me just after Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer that he had come from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Masjid Al-Nusiry </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Masjid Al-Turky </span>while the marketplaces there were filled with people who did not offer Salah and were busy conducting buying and selling transactions. He started to weep and said: &#8220;This is intolerable.&#8221; Therefore, I see that we are in need of advising and co-operating with one another. It should not be said that authorities in charge would undertake this duty. It is true that these authorities shoulder great responsibility and that they have to be held accountable if they ever fail to play their role properly. We ask Allah to grant them help and success.Muslim rulers shoulder great responsibility in this regard. Every Muslim whether educated, scholar, or judge shares their prescribed responsibility of disapproving evil acts and enjoining good ones. The more Muslims co-operate with one another and enjoin one another to hold fast to the truth, the less evil will spread. Marketplaces are filled with many Muslims who neglect offering Salah (Prayer) and sit outside Masjids (mosques) while their fellow Muslims are in the process of offering it. These people must be reminded of their negligence of Salah and passers-by must disapprove of this heinous act of theirs. They may be warned in such words as &#8220;Do you not fear Allah? How come you are sitting like this while your Muslim brothers are offering Salah.&#8221; One should join their fellow Muslims in Salah even if they are on a journey.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">After the Prophet had offered the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer in Mina in the year of the Farewell Hajj, some people said to him: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Here are two people who have not offered the Fajr Prayer with us.&#8221; He asked that they be brought to him. They came trembling with fear. The Prophet (peace be upon him) inquired: &#8220;What prevented you from offering Salah with us?&#8221; They said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! We offered it in our camp&#8221;. The Prophet said: &#8220;Never do this again.If you have prayed in your houses and then you come to the Masjid (mosque), then pray with the congregation. It will be regarded as supererogatory Prayer for you&#8221;.</span></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Imam Ahmad, Section on the Hadiths narrated by Levanters narrators, the Hadith narrated by Yazid ibn Al-Aswad, no. 17020; and Al-Tirmidhy, Book on Salah, Chapter on a man offers Salah alone and then joins the congregation, no. 219]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If someone, who has already offered an Obligatory Prayer alone, goes to the Masjid and sees that the Congregational Prayer is not yet finished, they have to join the Muslims. If they happen to join the Imam in the first Rak`ah (unit of Prayer), then they will make Taslim (salutation of peace ending the Prayer) with him. If they miss some Rak`ahs, they have to make up for them after Taslim. When the Prophet was asked about some Muslim rulers who delay offering Salah until later times, he said to the questioner:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Observe the prayer at its proper time and if you can, do it along with them, and do not say that you have already observed prayer for it would be a supererogatory prayer for you.</span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on Masjids and places for Salah, Chapter on disapproval of delaying Salah from its prescribed time&#8230;, no. 648; Al-Nasa&#8217;y, Book on Imamate, Chapter on performing Salah with wrongful rulers, no. 778; and Abu Dawud, Book on Salah, Chapter on if an Imam delays Salah after its prescribed time, no. 431.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslims should reprimand those who sit in the streets at prayer time. Should one of them argue that he has already offered Salah, he must be ordered not to sit near the Masjid and to hide from people or join them in Prayer which will be regarded as supererogatory for him. He must be ordered to do this in order not to discourage people from offering Salah.He must be told to hasten to offer it with his fellow Muslims. It will be regarded as supererogatory Prayer if he has already offered it alone. The Imams at different Masjids should spend equal or similar times in offering Salah so that those who abandon Salah might not claim that they have prayed at such and such Masjid. Muslims are duty bound to co-operate in righteousness and piety and enjoin one another to hold steadfastly to the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah describes those of His servants who are winners that they enjoin one another to hold to the path of truth and to endure it patiently. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-&#096;Asr, 103: 1" target="_blank" name="ByAl-%E2%80%98Asr(thetime" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><strong>By Al-‘Asr (the time). </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-&#096;Asr, 103: 2" target="_blank" name="Verily,manisinloss" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Verily, man is in loss, </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-&#096;Asr, 103: 3" target="_blank" name="Exceptthosewhobelieve(inIsl%C3%A2mic" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>Except those who believe (in Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al-Ma‘ruf) which Allâh has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al-Munkar which Allâh has forbidden], and recommend one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allâh’s Cause during preaching His religion of Islâmic Monotheism or Jihâd).</strong> <span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Asr]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) informs us that this type of people are the real winners who will attain happiness on account of their possession of the following four characteristics. Firstly, they have sincere belief in Allah and His Messenger. Secondly, they work deeds of righteousness which means that their Iman is fruitful. Iman is not just what resides firmly in the heart as it has to be confirmed by deeds. For example, it is not just enough to believe in the obligatory nature of Salah while neglecting to offer it, or to believe in the obligatory nature of Zakah while refusing to pay it, or to believe in the obligatory nature of fasting while abstaining from it. Iman has to be demonstrated both in words and in deeds. The real winners are those who combine between true Iman, righteous deeds and enjoining one another to do good and to remain steadfast. These are the real winners as they have firm belief in Allah and His Messenger. They declare the Oneness of Allah and His Messenger. They also believe in the Truth revealed by Allah and conveyed by His Messenger. Then, they practiced that really after their belief undertaking the obligations that Allah ordained and leaving the Prohibitions that He forbade. They also advised one another to hold fast to the truth without negligence or weakness, enjoining each other to the truth and cooperating with one another in righteousness and benevolent acts. They preached Islam, enjoined what is right and forbade what is wrong patiently as these matters cannot be attained without observing patience. Whoever seeks these merits has to keep patient and seek the help of Allah; beseeching Allah for His Help, thank Him, do the best in doing His Commandments, advising for His Sake, enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong, reminding people of Allah forbearingly. Undoubtedly, you have to bear troubles as it is the way of Paradise that is surrounded with troubling hardships. The Prophet (peace be upon him) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong>Paradise is surrounded by hardships and Hell-Fire is surrounded by temptations.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">[Narrated by Muslim, Book on Paradise, description of its boon and inhabitants, first chapter, no. 2823]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">There are many obstacles lying in the way to Jannah (Paradise). These obstacles have to be overcome with patience. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The greatest of these obstacles include following desires of the self, surrendering to the temptations of Shaytan (devil) and keeping company with evil friends. While the Shaytan makes bad deeds fair-seeming to the doer, his soul is naturally prone to evil and the evil company he keeps corrupts his manners.This evil company brings harm to him by causing him to deviate from the right path. Therefore, one should patiently endure breaking their relationship with them. One should also develop a kind of steadfast adherence to obeying the Commands of Allah and disobeying the incitements of Shaytan. One should have firm determination that helps them not to fall victim to their whims and desires which lead to eternal dwelling in Hellfire. Therefore, you will realize the true meaning of felicity by following the commands of Allah, refusing to follow your whims and desires and holding fast to the path of guidance and steadfastness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Muslim man or woman is duty bound to hasten to performing congregational Salah (Prayer) at its appointed time. They should put aside everything that distracts them from offering Salah like work or sleep. Undoubtedly, some Muslims find this difficult to do. However, once one starts to tame themselves by exercising <strong>self-restraint</strong>, they will sense a feeling of pleasure overwhelming their hearts each time they offer Salah. Self-restraint will help make their souls amenable to them. Thus, the heart is revived each time the Prayer time becomes due. One will also sense a feeling of comfort upon offering Salah to which they will hasten with pleasure. They will sense the same feelings when doing other good deeds. However, if one neglects offering Salah surrendering themselves to whims and desires, Satan will play tricks on them and their heart will become weak to the point that they will feel that Salah is burdensome,because the heart becomes weak due to its submission to desires, devil, and tempting ways of laziness and harmful neglect when a servant argues, in his defense of his falsehood, saying, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful.. Allah is All-Forgiving and All-Generous while he forgets that Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Declare (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) unto My slaves, that truly, I am the Oft-Forgiving, the Most-Merciful. &#8220;And that My Torment is indeed the most painful torment. </strong></span><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Al-Hijr, 15: 49-50]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also forgets that Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">The Forgiver of sin, the Acceptor of repentance, the Severe in punishment, the Bestower (of favours). Lâ ilâha illâ Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), to Him is the final return.</span> </strong><span style="color:#808080;">[Surah Ghafir, 40: 3]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah forgives and is merciful to those who turn to Him in repentance, yet He inflicts severe punishment on those who neglect His Rights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant all Muslims success and guidance. May He guide us and you to that which pleases Him. May He also guide us to His Straight Path, teach us what is beneficial to us, and assist us in obeying Him and fulfilling His Rights. May Allah make us all among those who co-operate in righteousness and piety and those who enjoin one another to hold steadfastly to the truth. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) is Most Generous and Most Gracious. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Advising women who listen to music<br />
</b>Nur `Ala Al-Darb Program, Tape no. 11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b></b><b>Q: Kindly advise those women who listen to songs.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b></b>I advise all men and women not to listen to music, because they bring about evil consequences. Songs are presented on TV, broadcast on the radio, and recorded on cassettes. All Muslim men and women are thus required to beware the evil of these songs. Instead, they should listen to the Qur&#8217;an, Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him) or Islamic lectures which benefit them in this life and the Hereafter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">As for songs and music, their evil is great as they may cause Muslims to deviate from their religion. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Songs and music may <strong>sow seeds of hypocrisy in the heart</strong>, at which point one begins to develop a dislike for everything that is good and become fond of every other thing that is evil. This is the true meaning of hypocrisy in addition to its literal meaning of pretending to be a Muslim while concealing Kufr (disbelief). Therefore, music is one of the means that invites to hypocrisy. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Having the habit of listening to music may lead to hating the recitation of the Qur&#8217;an, being heedless of beneficial advice, or listening to Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Moreover, one may be deluded into committing obscenities and corruption. </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Thus, it is the duty of faithful men and women to be cautious of evil of songs and music.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states in the Glorious Qur&#8217;an:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing, etc.) to mislead (men) from the Path of Allâh without knowledge, and takes it (the Path of Allâh, or the Verses of the Qur’ân) by way of mockery. For such there will be a humiliating torment (in the Hell-fire). </strong></span>(Surah Luqman, 31: 6)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And when Our Verses (of the Qur’ân) are recited to such a one, he turns away in pride, as if he heard them not &#8211; as if there were deafness in his ear. So announce to him a painful torment. </span></strong>(Surah Luqman, 31: 7)</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Commentators of the Qur&#8217;an interpret <strong>&#8220;idol talk&#8221;</strong> to mean <strong>singing</strong> and it is equally applied to every sound produced by musical instruments and diversions. This is the view held by most scholars of the Qur&#8217;an (may Allah have mercy on them).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Commenting on the above Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse),<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `<strong>Abdullah Ibn Mas`ud </strong></span>(may Allah be pleased with him) swore: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;By Allah! The reference in this Ayah is to singing.&#8221; </span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">He would swear and say: </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;Singing causes the seeds of hypocrisy to grow in the heart like water causes seeds of plants to grow.&#8221; </span></strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">This means that singing causes one to hate good and to love evil; to hate listening to the Qur&#8217;an and to love songs and diversion and other things of the sort. This is a type of hypocrisy.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">A hypocrite pretends to be associated with Islam. He pretends to be a believer while in fact he conceals Kufr. He pretends to love the Qur&#8217;an while in fact he does not. Music causes one to hate listening to the Qur&#8217;an or listening to someone calling to the way of Allah. It encourages the love of falsehood, speaking evil and obscene words. It not only causes the heart to deviate from the straight path but also to develop a fondness for what Allah (Glorified be He) has declared prohibited. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><strong>This has been proven by experience. Those who are in close contact with singers know how corrupt and spoiled they are because of their love of music and song</strong>. This brings about great evil to those who are accustomed to it. There is no power or might except with Allah.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Saying Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Azhim upon finishing recitation of the Qur&#8217;an</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b></b><b>Q: I often hear that</b><b> saying Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim upon finishing recitation of the Glorious Qur&#8217;an </b>is an act of Bid`ah (innovation in religion). Other people told me that there was nothing wrong with it. Supporting their view, they quote the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) which reads:<b> <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 95" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85):"></a>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;Allâh has spoken the truth; follow the religion of Ibrâhîm (Abraham) Hanîfa (Islâmic Monotheism, i.e. he used to worship Allâh Alone) &#8221; </b>Some educated people also told me that whenever the Prophet (peace be upon him) wanted a Qur&#8217;an reciter to end his recitation, he would just say &#8220;That is enough&#8221;. Never did he use to ask him to say Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim. Therefore, would you kindly give a detailed explanation of the relevant ruling.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b>Habitual saying of Sadaqa Allahu Al-Azhim upon concluding recitation of the Glorious Qur&#8217;an is not supported by any proof in the Shari`ah (Islamic Law) and should, therefore, not be used as a common practice. It belongs to the category of Bid`ah particularly when someone believes it to be an act of Sunnah. Such a practice must be given up.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">As for the Ayah which reads: &#8221; <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 95" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85):"></a>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;Allâh has spoken the truth &#8221; it has nothing to do with saying this expression. The Ayah simply means that the Prophet (peace be upon him) is commanded by Allah (Exalted be He) to make it clear to people that the revelations contained in the Tawrah (Torah), the Injil (Gospel) and all other heavenly revealed Scriptures are true.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">By the same token, clear revelations contained in the Glorious Qur&#8217;an are true. However, this does not establish a proof for the desirability to conclude reading of some Ayahs or a certain Surah of the Qur&#8217;an by saying: Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim. Neither the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor any of his Sahabah (Companions, may Allah be pleased with them) were authentically reported to have done such a practice. <a name="TheProphetoncelistenedtoIbn"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="110824" class="tip"></span>The Prophet once listened to Ibn Mas`ud reading Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;. Upon reaching the Ayah which reads: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 41" target="_blank" name="How(willitbe)then,whenWe"></a>How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as a witness against these people? &#8221; The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him:&#8221;That is enough&#8221;. Ibn Mas`ud said: &#8220;When I turned to him, I saw his eyes shedding tears.&#8221;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> The Prophet (peace be upon him) was moved to tears because the Ayah reminded him of the great horror of the Day of Resurrection. The Ayah reads: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 41" target="_blank" name="How(willitbe)then,whenWe"></a>How (will it be) then, when We bring from each nation a witness and We bring you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) &#8221; <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 41" target="_blank" name="How(willitbe)then,whenWe"></a>&#8230;as a witness against these people &#8221; i.e. The Muslim people.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">In short, there exists no evidence in the Shari`ah that makes it desirable to conclude recitation of the Qur&#8217;an by saying: Sadaqa Allahu Al-`Adhim. This expression has to be left unsaid so that one would be following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them). However, there is nothing wrong if someone happens to say this expression unintentionally. Since Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) always speaks the truth, this expression of Sadaqa Allahu Al-Azhim has to be thought of as an absolute expression which should not be limited to a given time, place, or situation. Therefore, habitual recitation of this expression whenever one finishes reading the Qur&#8217;an has no evidence in its support as has been early mentioned.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Ruling on offering Salah without a turban</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: Is it permissible to offer Salah (Prayer) without a turban? Is it permissible for the Imam (the one who leads congregational Prayer) to pray without a head cover? Is wearing a cap sufficient? Please support your answer with evidences. May Allah protect you. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you). </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is nothing wrong with offering Salah without a turban because the head [with regard to men] is not included in `Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered in public), and it is not obligatory to cover it when offering Salah, whether the person praying is an Imam, a Munfarid (person offering Prayer individually), or a Ma&#8217;mum (person being led by an Imam in Prayer).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, if wearing a turban is customary then it is best to do it, especially when offering Salah with others. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes), while praying [and going round (the Tawâf of) the Ka‘bah,]</span></em></strong> The turban is considered a type of adornment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>It is well known that men who are Muhrims (pilgrims in the ritual state for Hajj and `Umrah) offer Salah bareheaded, because they are not allowed to cover their heads while in Ihram (ritual state for Hajj and `Umrah). Hence it is known that there is nothing wrong with offering Salah bareheaded. </strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah guide all to acquire beneficial knowledge and act upon it! He is the All-Hearer and All-Respondent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Baaz Fatwas &#8211; <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaSubjects.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;HajjEntryID=0&amp;HajjEntryName=&amp;RamadanEntryID=0&amp;RamadanEntryName=&amp;NodeID=3329&amp;PageID=1687&amp;SectionID=14&amp;SubjectPageTitlesID=23811&amp;MarkIndex=1&amp;0#ToofferSalah(Prayer)withoutaturban" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.net</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 10: Some people wear a turban, some wear a Qulunsuwah (cap), and many offer Salah (Prayer) with bare heads, I mean men. Which manner is the best in reward? We appreciate your advice, may Allah reward you with the best. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is desirable for a Muslim to wear his full garment when going to Prayer, the head cover included; because Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) enjoined His servants to adorn themselves when going to Salah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O Children of Adam! Take your adornment (by wearing your clean clothes), while praying [and going round (the Tawâf of) the Ka‘bah,]</strong></span></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Besides, it has not been reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he offered Salah without a head cover</strong></span>. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In fact, he used to always wear a turban, and the practice of Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the best guidance.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong> بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </strong></h2>
<p><em>The following are the excerpts from Fatwas of Ibn Baz &#8211; read the full article at <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=139&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.net</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>This was published in the magazine of the Islamic University in Madinah, the fourth edition, the sixth year, Rabi` Al-Thany, 1394 A.H., pp. 175-182.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah. May peace be upon the Last Prophet, his family, and his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Muslim related in his Sahih (Book of sound Hadiths) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;If anyone invokes blessings on me once, Allah will bless him ten times&#8221; </strong></span></em>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Do not make your houses graves and do not make my grave a place of celebration but invoke blessings on me, for your blessings reach me wherever you may be&#8221; </span></strong></em>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (May peace and blessings be upon him) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;May his nose soil with dust in whose presence mention is made of me and he does not supplicate for me&#8221; </strong></span></em>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since invoking peace and blessings on the Prophet (peace be upon him) is permissible in Salah during Tashahhud (a recitation in the sitting position in the second/last unit of Prayer) and permissible in Khutbah (sermon), invocations, seeking forgiveness, after Adhan (Call to Prayer), upon entering, and leaving the Masjid (mosque), when uttering his name and in other positions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed to write the form of invoking peace and blessings when writing His name in a book, a message, or an article, because of the proofs mentioned above. It is permissible to write the full form in order to apply what Allah has commanded and the reader would remember it when passing by it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should not reduce it to the acronym e.g. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(P)</strong></span> that stands for peace or <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(PBUH)</span></strong> that stands for (peace be upon him) or the like abbreviations that may be used by some writers.Such an act is against the ordinance of Allah (May He be Praised and Glorified) which are mentioned in His Book by His saying: <em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Send your Salât on (ask Allâh to bless) him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islâmic way of greeting (salutation i.e. As-Salâmu ‘Alaikum)</span></strong></em>.[Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 56] It does not have the same privilege of writing (peace be upon him) in full form. The reader may not watch out or may not understand the meaning, bearing in mind that referring to it is disapproved by the religious scholars who even warned against it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Salah said in his book: &#8220;`Ulum al-Hadith&#8221; i.e. The sciences of Hadith, known as &#8220;Muqadimat Ibn Al-Salah&#8221; in the twenty fifth type of his book: (Al-Hadith wa Kayfiyat Dabt-ul-kitab wa Taqyiduh). He said that which means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ninth: A person must keep writing the form of sending Salat and taslim i.e. &#8220;peace and blessing be upon the Messenger of Allah&#8221; in full form upon mentioning him. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A person must not be weary of repeating it, because it is one of the greatest benefits which the Hadith students and writers may overlook</strong></span>. Whoever disregards this, he will be deprived of a great reward. We have seen good visions for the people who write the form in full, because it is a form that a person writes as a Du`a&#8217; (supplication), not a part of the narration to make it dependent on the source of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Similarly, the same is true with regard to praising Allah (Glorified be He) upon mentioning His Name such as (Glorified and Exalted be He), (Blessed and Exalted be He), and the like&#8230;</strong></span> (Until he says): then a person should avoid two shortcomings:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">First: Writing it in incomplete form by two letters or the like.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Second: Writing it in short form by meaning such as (wa sallam i.e. blessings).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated from Hamzah Al-Kinany (may Allah be merciful to him) that he used to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to record the Hadith and I used to write down upon mentioning the name of the Prophet (salla-Allah-u-`alaihi i.e. May Allah&#8217;s peace be upon him) without writing (wa sallam). Thereupon, I saw the Prophet (peace be upon him) in a vision saying to me: Why do you not complete the form of invoking peace and blessingson me? He continued: Ever since, I did not write it in short form like this (salla-Allah-u-`alaihi) but in this form (salla-Allah-u-`alaihi-wa-sallam i.e. May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon him). Ibn Al-Salah added: I said: it is also reprehensible to write (`alaihi-s-salam i.e. peace upon him) and Allah knows best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His authority, the encyclopedic scholar Al-Sakhawy (May Allah be merciful with him) said in his book (Fath-ul-Mughith Sharh Alfiyat Al-Hadith by Al-`Iraqy) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O writer, avoid (referring to it) i.e. peace and blessings upon the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) by writing only two letters or the like as done by Al-Kattany and the ignorant of the non-Arabs and ignorant students. They write instead of (May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon him), <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(p) </span></strong>or <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(pb) </span></strong>or <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(pbuh)</span></strong> and that entails decrease in reward, because it is unlike the proper manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Suyuty (May Allah be merciful with him) said in his book (Tadrib Al-Rawy Fi Sharh Taqrib Al-Nawawy):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reprehensible to write the short form of peace and blessings here and in every position where invoking peace and blessings is required as mentioned in the commentary of Sahih Muslim and others because of Allah&#8217;s saying: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>Send your Salât on (ask Allâh to bless) him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islâmic way of greeting (salutation i.e. As-Salâmu ‘Alaikum)</em></span>.[Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 56] Until he says: It is reprehensible to refer to it with one or two letters as those people who write (pbuh), he must write it in full form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of quote, adapted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My advice for every Muslim; reader or writer, is to <strong><span style="color:#000000;">seek for the best reward</span></strong> and stay away from what <strong><span style="color:#000000;">may invalidate or reduce it</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to grant us success to that which pleases Him, for He is the Most Generous. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>The following are the excerpts from  A speech delivered by His Eminence at Al-Jami` Al-Kabir in Riyadh on 27/4/1400 A.H., published in His Eminence&#8217;s book &#8220;Collection of Miscellaneous Fatwas and Articles&#8221;, vol. 9, pp. 128-141. </em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><em>Read the full speech  at <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&amp;View=Page&amp;PageID=1375&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.net</a></em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>If Allah wills to do good to a person, He makes them comprehend Din &#8216;religion&#8217;.</strong></span></em>&#8221; (Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This important Hadith shows us the excellence of comprehending Din.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Comprehending religion</strong> includes understanding the Qur&#8217;an, the Sunnah, and Islam. Islam covers the basics of Shari`ah, Allah&#8217;s Ordainment&#8217;s, His Prohibitions, a servant&#8217;s duty towards Allah and other servants and Allah&#8217;s fear, glorification, and watchfulness. In fact, the first step towards attaining knowledge is fearing Allah (Exalted be He), honoring His Sanctities, and watching Him in all deeds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever does not <strong>fear or be aware of Allah</strong> (Exalted be He) in their deeds, all their knowledge will be worthless. However, true beneficial knowledge and understanding of Din that leads to happiness is that which instills Allah&#8217;s Awe in a Muslim&#8217;s heart, directs them to honor Allah&#8217;s Sanctities, pushes them to obey Allah&#8217;s Orders and abstain from His Prohibitions, and urges them to call to Allah (Exalted be He) and to clarify Shari`ah to people. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>So, anyone who is granted comprehension in religion in this way, Allah (Exalted be He) has indeed wanted to do them good.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, anyone deprived of these blessings will be among the ignorant, misguided and negligent who renounce attaining the knowledge that Allah (Exalted be He) has made obligatory. They will be among those whom Allah (Exalted be He) has not wanted to do good to them. Further, Allah (Exalted be He) talks about Kafirs (disbelievers) who turn away from the purpose of their creation, to teach us that it is our duty, as Muslims, to haste to comprehend religion and ask about any unclear matter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;But those who disbelieve turn away from that whereof they are warned</span></em>.&#8221; </strong>[Surah Al-Ahqaf, 46: 3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And who does more wrong than he who is reminded of the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his Lord, but turns away from them, forgetting what (deeds) his hands have sent forth.&#8221;  </span></em></strong>[Surah Al-Kahf, 18: 57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Consequently, it is the duty of a Muslim to seek for attaining knowledge in religion, to attend to, reflect on, and benefit from the Qur&#8217;an and pay great attention to, study, apply, and memorize the Sunnah as much as possible. When a person neglects these two basics, it is an indication that Allah (Exalted be He) did not will good for him. They are doomed since their heart is corrupt and deviating from the path to guidance. We ask Allah to protect and keep us away from whatever displeases Him!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear Muslims, it is incumbent upon us to learn our religion and know its rulings and to attend to, meditate, reflect on, recite, and apply the Qur&#8217;an. In addition, we should give great care to, memorize, apply and study the Sunnah along with asking about ambiguous matters. Muslims should ask those who have more knowledge to find out the correct answer.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: &#8220;<em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So ask the people of the Scripture, if you do not know</strong></span></em>.&#8221; [Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 43]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, a Muslim can attend knowledge lessons and benefit from them and study with other knowledgeable Muslims to benefit from them and add to himself. In this way, a Muslim can attain comprehension of religion and avoid the characteristics of the negligent and heedless.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;If Allah wills to do good to a person, He makes him comprehend the Din.&#8221; </strong></span></em>[1]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fatwa no. 14777</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I am a married woman with children and I am a practicing Muslim &#8211; all praise be to Allah &#8211; but my husband smokes<strong> Shisha (hookah, water pipe)</strong>. I have advised him, in vain, to give it up. In fact, he has sworn by Allah that he will stop smoking it, but he has not done so. After this, I took an oath by Allah that, if he did not stop smoking, I would go to my parents, but he has not stopped and I have not gone to my parents. What should I do with my husband? What is the ruling on the oath that I took? What is the ruling on smoking Shisha? I hope that you will answer my letter.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>First</strong>: smoking shisha is Haram (prohibited) because it is an obnoxious habit and includes many harmful effects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: It is Wajib (obligatory) on your husband to fulfill his oath and stop smoking Shisha.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: You have done well to advise your husband to stop smoking Shisha. You should continue doing so and make Du‘a’ (supplication) to Allah for Him to guide your husband.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the oath that you broke, you have to make Kaffarah (expiation) for it and you should not go to stay with your parents.The Kaffarah is to feed ten Miskin (needy people), to clothe them, or to free a believing slave. If you are unable to do any of these things, you should observe Sawm (Fasting) for three days.<br />
May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.</p>

<p>Ruling on smoking and using hookah &#8211; Shaykh Ibn Baaz</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the ruling on smoking and using hookah? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Smoking and using hookah are prohibited, because they contain evil and much harm. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) made lawful for His servants all kinds of lawful and good things and made unlawful to them all kinds of evil things, as He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says to His Prophet (peace be upon him): <span style="color:#008000;">They ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) what is lawful for them (as food). Say: &#8220;Lawful unto you are At-Tayyibât [all kind of Halâl (lawful-good) foods which Allâh has made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and fruits)]</span>. Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 4</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says with regard to the description of His Prophet (peace be upon him): &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;he allows them as lawful At-Tayyibât (i.e. all good and lawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons, foods), and prohibits them as unlawful Al-Khabâ’ith (i.e. all evil and unlawful as regards things, deeds, beliefs, persons and foods)&#8221;  </span>Surah Al-A`raf, 7: 157</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No type of smoking is from the lawful good things, but they are from the evil things due to their much harm. They are not from the lawful-good things which Allah (Exalted be He) permitted; therefore, they should be abandoned and o<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>ne should beware of approaching them and should strive against his evil soul to avoid these evil things, because the soul persists in evil, except those relieved by Allah&#8217;s Mercy.</strong></span> It is the duty of the believer to strive against his soul to set aside whatever harms him from these and other evil things.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A 2005 WHO report states that smoking using a waterpipe poses a serious potential health hazard and is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking. The average hookah session typically lasts more than 40 minutes, and consists of 50 to 200 inhalations that each range from 0.15 to 0.50 liters of smoke. <strong>In an hour-long smoking session of hookah, users consume about 100 to 200 times the volume of smoke of a cigarette</strong>. The chemical compositions of cigarette smoke and hookah smoke are different, however, as the workings of the charcoal in the modern hookah causes the tobacco mixture to be heated to a lower temperature, as opposed to the higher temperature in a cigarette where the tobacco is directly burnt. Consequently, the potential health effects of hookah smoke are expected to be very different.<sup id="cite_ref-Saad_58-0" class="reference"><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">From<span id="ContentParagraph"><a id="ContentAnchor" href="http://www.alifta.net/Search/MoftyDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;Type=Mofty&amp;section=tafseer&amp;ID=2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" name="Abdul-AzizibnAbdullahibnBaz"> `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz </a></span>to any Muslim who reads this Fatwa. May Allah guide us all and grant us the means to make sincere repentance from all sins. Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace, Mercy and Blessings of Allah be upon you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a>&#8220;</a><span id="This was published on Sunday 7/5/1408 A.H. and this collection, vol. 13, p. 69."></span> :As you know, may Allah bestow His Mercy upon us all, that the ruler of Muslims, may Allah protect and guard him, gave directions for offering the <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">Rain Prayer </span></span>in the morning of Monday, 7 Jumadal-Ula, 1408 A.H., because <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>season is late this year and has not fallen in many places at its annually scheduled time. Muslims are in dire need of it, and they are desperately asking Allah to overwhelm them with His Mercy [Exalted and Sublime Be He], His Bounty and Kindness. He (Exalted and Glorified be He) has guided them to invoke and implore Him so that He grants them their needs with His Grace.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most Glorified, assured them of answering their supplications, as He (Exalted and Glorified be He) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Ghafir, 40: 60" target="_blank" name="AndyourLordsaid:^InvokeMe,"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And your Lord said: &#8220;Invoke Me, I will respond to your (invocation). Verily! Those who scorn My worship [i.e. do not invoke Me, and do not believe in My Oneness, (Islâmic Monotheism)] they will surely enter Hell in humiliation!</span>&#8220;&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 186" target="_blank" name="AndwhenMyslavesaskyou(OMuhammad"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And when My slaves ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) concerning Me, then (answer them), I am indeed near (to them by My Knowledge). I respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on Me (without any mediator or intercessor). So let them obey Me and believe in Me, so that they may be led aright.</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In other verses, He (Exalted and Glorified be He) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 55" target="_blank" name="InvokeyourLordwithhumility"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Invoke your Lord with humility and in secret. He likes not the aggressors.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" style="color:#008000;" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 56" target="_blank" name="Anddonotdomischiefontheearth,"></a>And do not do mischief on the earth, after it has been set in order, and invoke Him with fear and hope. Surely, Allâh’s Mercy is (ever) near to the good-doers</span>&#8221; .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and the early Muslims always turned to Allah seeking His Help in times of distress or adversity. He answered their invocations and granted them of His Bounties and Benevolence as He (Exalted and Glorified be He) said regarding the Battle of Badr,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 9" target="_blank" name="Remember)whenyousoughthelp"></a><span style="color:#008000;">(Remember) when you sought help of your Lord and He answered you (saying): &#8220;I will help you with a thousand of the angels each behind the other (following one another) in succession</span>.&#8221;&#8221; .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When drought intensified in<span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Madinah </span>and its suburbs, Muslims requested the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) to pray for <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain</span></span>. He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) then<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> raised his hands while giving the Friday Sermon and prayed for <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>and repeated his supplication twice</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On another occasion he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) went out with them to the desert where he led them in<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> two Rak&#8217;ahs <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">prayer </span></span>similar to the &#8216;Eid <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">prayer</span></span></strong></span>. He supplicated his Lord asking Him for <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain</span></span>. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>In this <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">prayer </span></span>he raised his hands and repeated the invocation many times and then inverted his garment.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the example of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), Muslims also raised their hands in <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">prayer </span></span>and supplicated Allah. Then Allah sent down abundant <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain</span></span>, bestowed His Mercy upon them and removed their distress.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted and Glorified be He) said: &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 21" target="_blank" name="IndeedintheMessengerofAll%C3%A2h"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Indeed in the Messenger of Allâh (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) you have a good example to follow for him who hopes for (the Meeting with) Allâh and the Last Day, and remembers Allâh much</span>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>most important means</strong></span> of obtaining Allah&#8217;s Mercy and being blessed with <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>is fearing Allah [Exalted and Sublime Be He], turning to Him in repentance from all sins, promoting all what is right and forbidding all what is evil, cooperating in matters of piety and righteousness, holding mutual consultation for the sake of Allah, advising each other with the truth and being steadfast in implementing it, being compassionate to the poor and the needy, consoling them and being generous to them.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted and Glorified be He) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 96" target="_blank" name="Andifthepeopleofthetowns"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And if the people of the towns had believed and had the Taqwâ (piety), certainly, We should have opened for them blessings from the heaven and the earth</span>&#8221; till the end of the verse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He,Most Glorified, said</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Talaq, 65: 2" target="_blank" name="Thenwhentheyareabouttoattain"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty).</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Talaq, 65: 4" target="_blank" name="Andthoseofyourwomenashave"></a><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted and Glorified be He) also said in another verse:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 56" target="_blank" name="Anddonotdomischiefontheearth,"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Surely, Allâh’s Mercy is (ever) near to the doers of good</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 71" target="_blank" name="Thebelievers,menandwomen,are"></a><span style="color:#008000;">The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden); they perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give the Zakât, and obey Allâh and His Messenger. Allâh will have His Mercy on them. Surely Allâh is All-Mighty, All-Wise.</span>&#8220;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In these noble verses, He (Exalted and Glorified be He) explained that fearing Allah, being kind to Allah&#8217;s servants and keeping upright and straight on the path of Allah are of the means of bringing about Allah&#8217;s Mercy to His servants, His kindness to them, sending down <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>and removing their distress.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, fear Allah O servants of Allah! Be kind to His servants, and advise one another with truth and be steadfast and patient in doing so; cooperate among yourselves in acts piety and righteousness, promote what is right, forbid what is evil and repent altogether from all your sins. Hence your Sustainer (Exalted and Glorified be He) will encompass you with His Mercy upon you and send down blessed <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>for you. He will also give youwhatever you desire and withhold from you whatever you dislike.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Almighty said: &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Nur, 24: 31" target="_blank" name="Andtellthebelievingwomento"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And all of you beg Allâh to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful</span>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) advised us saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a name="Whoeverisnotmercifultoothers"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="405861"></span>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Whoever is not merciful to others will not be treated mercifully&#8221;</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another Hadith he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) stated:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<a name="TheMostCompassionate(Allah)"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="405862"></span><span style="color:#008000;">The Most Compassionate (Allah) has mercy on those who are compassionate to people. If you show mercy to those on the earth, He Who is in the heaven will show mercy to you</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">&#8221; .</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;anic verses and Prophetic Hadiths urging people to observe piety, uprightness, mercy and kindness to those in need are many and well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah to rectify the affairs of all Muslims; to grant them sincere repentance from all sins; to send down the <span id="firstKeyWordFound"><span id="ContentParagraph">rain </span></span>for them out of His Grace and Bounty; to reconcile and unite their hearts on piety and good deeds; to protect everyone from the evils of their selves and to purify them from their sinful acts; to rid them of misguidance of tribulations; to support His Deen; to make His word the uppermost; to guide our rulers to what is good and beneficial forpeople and countries; to correct the behavior of their advisors and enable them to do all kinds of good. Indeed, He is the Grantor of all this and is the Most Omnipotent. Peace, Mercy and Blessings of Allah be upon you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b></b><b></b><b>Q 6: I have some non-Muslim and Muslim neighbors about whom I have some reservations. What is the ruling on exchanging visits with them?</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><b>A: </b>Visits exchanged in such circumstance are a good thing enjoined by Islam when they are <strong>for the purpose of guidance, advice, and cooperation in righteousness and piety</strong>. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;<a style="color:#008000;" name="Allah(GlorifiedandExaltedbe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="11401" class="tip"></span>“Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, ‘My Love is due to those who love one another for My Sake, who sit with one another for My Sake, who visit one another for My Sake, and who are generous to one another for My Sake.’”</span>&#8220;</span> (Related by Imam<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Malik </span>[may Allah be merciful to him] with a Sahih (authentic) Sanad (chain of narrators)][1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Also, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<a name="TherearesevenwhomAllahwill"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="11402" class="tip"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">There are seven whom Allah will shade with His Shade on the Day when there will be no shade but His Shade&#8230;”</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;</span> among them he (peace be upon him) mentioned: &#8220;<a name="Twomenwholoveeachotherfor"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="11402" class="tip"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">Two men who love each other for the sake of Allah, meeting for that and parting upon that.</span>”</span>&#8221; [2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The example given is that of two men, but the ruling is general and applies to two men or two women. Thus, if a Muslim visits another Muslim or non-Muslim for the purpose of calling them to Allah, teaching them and guiding them to goodness without seeking worldly gain or taking the Commands of Allah lightly, this is a good act.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">It is good for a Muslim woman to visit her sister in Islam and advise her to avoid Tabarruj (woman’s public display of her adornment or charms), unveiling the face or taking lightly what Allah prohibits. Similarly, it is good to visit her Christian or non-Christian female neighbor, such as a Buddhist woman or the like, to advise, teach, or instruct her. Actually, this comes under the heading of the Prophet’s words: &#8220;<a name="Religionissincerity(well-wishing)."></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="23000688" class="tip"></span>“<span style="color:#008000;">Religion is sincerity (well-wishing). Religion is sincerity. Religion is sincerity.</span>”</span>&#8220;[3]  <strong>If she responds positively, all praise is to Allah; if she does not then you should give up the visits which do not serve any useful purpose.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Visiting for the purpose of gaining worldly benefits, playing, exchanging idle talks, eating or the like is not permissible to be made to non-Muslims, whether they are<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Christians </span>or others. Such visits may corrupt one’s religious commitment or morals, because the Kafirs (disbelievers) are enemies to us and we do not feel love towards them [as a reaction for their Shirk, disbelief, rejection of truth, enmity, sinning, transgression against Allah, etc. Ed]. Thus, we should not take them as protectors or confidants. </span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">However, visits are required when they are made for the purpose of calling to Allah, urging to do goodness, and warning against evil. In Surah (Qur’anic chapter) Al-Mumtahinah, Allah (Glorified be He) says: &#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: &#8220;Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh: we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allâh Alone&#8221;&#8221; </span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[</span><span id="ContentParagraph">Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60: 4]</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><b>An extract from my letter I sent to His Excellency Shaykh</b><b> Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy </b><b>concerning</b><b> the difference between `Ibadah and obedience</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On 2/4//1392 A.H.,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy </span>sent me a letter no. 1526, dated 2 Safar, 1392 A.H. explaining his case and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Tufayl&#8217;s, </span>his successor in the leadership of Islamic Group. I replied in the same year when I was the President of the Islamic University in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah </span>and the following is some of my reply:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some brothers from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Milbar </span>living in the country told me that Your Eminence opine that <em>`Ibadah is clarified by obedience and that when someone obeys another, he worships him. `Ibadah is also interpreted as enslavement and idolization. </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar ibn Ahmad Al-Millibary, </span>owner of Al-Salsabil Magazine, wrote to me concerning this issue asserting what is mentioned about you and the Group. He sent me a copy of a survey pertaining to this question. You will find an enclosed copy of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This question appears strange for me so I determined to write to you before I receive your letter to know whether these statements which are attributed to you are true. So, please let me know your opinion. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>I see that obedience has a wider scope than `Ibadah. Every act of `Ibadah a person does in compliance with Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah is seen as obedience, but not every act of obedience to anything other than Allah (Exalted be He) is seen as `Ibadah</strong></span>. This matter needs more elaboration. <strong><span style="color:#000000;">Obedience to Allah (Exalted be He) is seen as `Ibadah when a person seeks to please Him. However, it may be valid or corrupt depending on whether the requirements of `Ibadah are met.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Please tell me in details your view on this question. It adds further explanation that `Ibadah may be denied when tainted with Shirkas Allah says concerning Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), &#8220;<a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Kafirun, 109: 3" target="_blank" name="NorwillyouworshipthatwhichIworship"></a>&#8220;<strong><span style="color:#008000;">Nor will you worship that which I worship</span></strong>.&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Kafirun, 109: 3</span> . Ibadah is negated because of their acts of Shirk. It is known that they worship Allah (Exalted be He) during times of hardships through showing Tawhid, performing Hajj and `Umrah, offering Sadaqah and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since these acts of `Ibadah are spoiled by Shirk, disbelief in the Hereafter and other kinds of disbelief during times of prosperity, it is permissible to negate the `Ibadah of people who show it. Furthermore, I would like to explain another point.<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> The person who obeys the authorities or rulers in something forbidden by Allah (Exalted be He) is not seen worshipping them when he does not believe in the permissibility of obedience to anyone in something opposing Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah. They rather obey these rules out of fear of their evils or vain desires while they know that they are sinful. Due to their act of obedience, such persons are sinners, not Mushriks, unless they obey such rulers in matters which do not involve Shirk. Examples of these matters include striking, killing, and taking someone&#8217;s money unjustly.</strong></span> There are many other examples that come under this heading. I think this view is known by the people of knowledge whose status is below yours. I find it imperative to ask you about this and know your detailed opinion so that I can refute any claim against you and support you with sure knowledge and show the truth concerning the Islamic Group to any one who seeks it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If what is attributed to you is true, we can discuss it thoroughly and examine the problematic issues using the evidence. The truth is the long-sought aim of everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah (Exalted be He) to grant us success to do what pleases Him and to comprehend His Religion and to adhere to it. May Allah purify our hearts and deeds and make the truth our long-sought aim wherever we are, for He is the Most Generous. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"> &#8220;O mankind! Worship your Lord (Allâh), Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become Al-Muttaqûn (the pious &#8211; See V.2:2).&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 21</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">The `Ibadah (worship) that mankind and Jinn are created for and commanded to do is to obey Allah (Exalted be He), avoid His prohibitions, and mention Him abundantly. The essence of `Ibadah is to believe in Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and to manifest this through making Du`a&#8217; (supplication) to Allah Alone, fearing Allah Alone, longing for His Mercy, and being sincere to Him in all forms of `Ibadah such as Salah (Prayer), Sawm (Fast), and so on.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) promises His obedient slaves that He will bestow upon them abundant goodness and praised rewards in this world and in the hereafter. Allah (Exalted be He) promised them that He will grant them Jannah (Paradise) and dignity in the Hereafter. Thus, Allah (Exalted be He) says:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"> &#8220;So be patient. Surely, the (good) end is for Al-Muttaqûn (the pious)&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Hud, 11: 49</span></span><strong><span class="HarfBody"><br />
</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">Allah (Exalted be He) also says: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody">&#8220;&#8230;but give glad tidings to As-Sâbirûn (the patient).&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 155</span></span><strong><span class="HarfBody"><br />
</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span class="HarfBody"> &#8220;Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: &#8220;Truly! To Allâh we belong and truly, to Him we shall return.&#8221;&#8221; </span></strong><span class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 156</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;They are those on whom are the Salawât (i.e. who are blessed and will be forgiven) from their Lord, and (they are those who) receive His Mercy, and it is they who are the guided ones.&#8221; </strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 157</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Only those who are patient shall receive their reward in full, without reckoning.&#8221; </strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 10</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;Whoever works righteousness &#8211; whether male or female &#8211; while he (or she) is a true believer (of Islâmic Monotheism) verily, to him We will give a good life (in this world with respect, contentment and lawful provision), and We shall pay them certainly a reward in proportion to the best of what they used to do (i.e. Paradise in the Hereafter).&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 97</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;<a style="color:#000000;" name="Nobodyisgivenablessingbetter"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="15206" class="tip"></span>Nobody is given a blessing better and greater than patience.</span>&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[1]</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;<a style="color:#000000;" name="Wonderfularetheaffairsofa"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="10537" class="tip"></span>Wonderful are the affairs of a believer, for there is good in every affair of them. If they have an occasion to feel delight, they thank &#8216;Allah&#8217;, thus there is good for them in it; and if they suffer from an affliction, they endure it patiently, which is good for them. This is not the case with anyone else except a believer.</span>&#8221; <span style="color:#808080;">[2]</span></strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the patient person has a praised reward in this world and in the hereafter or he will be rewarded in Jannah and dignified in the hereafter. It is worth mentioning that such a reward will only be given to the patient person who shows patience regarding being pious, adherence to obedience of Allah, and enduring the hardships that they encounter in this world; poverty, illness, and so on. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to Allâh, etc.) that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Al-Birr is (the quality of) the one who believes in Allâh, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 177</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">until His Saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;&#8230;and who are patient in extreme poverty and ailment (disease) and at the time of fighting (during the battles). Such are the people of the truth and they are Al-Muttaqûn (the pious).&#8221; </span></strong><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 177</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Generally speaking, patience and piety always lead to praised consequences. Allah (Exalted be He) tells the believers regarding their enemy: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">&#8220;But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaqûn [the pious &#8211; See V.2:2], not the least harm will their cunning do to you. Surely, Allâh surrounds all that they do.&#8221; </span></strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span style="color:#808080;">Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 120</span></span></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q : A brother from Dar&#8217;a, Syria asks: What is the correct opinion about the stories narrated from one of the famous leaders of Sufism, Al-Sayyid <strong>Ahmad Al-Rifa&#8217;y</strong> that he visited the Mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in Al-Madinah and supplicated at the Prophet&#8217;s grave. The Messenger (peace be upon him) then stretched his hand out to him and he kissed it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">This is a widespread belief among the followers of his Tariqah (Sufi order). It is a belief they hold firmly, even though he lived in the 6th century A.H. How true is this story?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">A : This is false and baseless, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) died as decreed by Allah (Glorified be He) who says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30" target="_blank" name="Verilyyou(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Verily you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will die, and verily they (too) will die.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> [Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">According to a Sahih Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah has angels roaming around the land; if they find anyone greeting me, they carry back these greetings to me.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">There is no one who sends greetings upon me but Allah will restore my soul to me so that I may return his greeting.</span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) said: <a name="Themostexcellentofyourdays"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">The most excellent of your days is Friday; so invoke more blessings on me on that day, for your blessings will be submitted to me.</span> The people asked: O Messenger of Allah, how can it be that our blessings will be submitted to you while your body is decayed? He replied: <span style="color:#008000;">Allah, the Exalted, has prohibited the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets. </span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths which say similar things but it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that he would shake hands with anybody</strong></span>. This indicates that this story is false. Even if we were to assume that it is true, then it could be that this was a <strong>shaytaan</strong> (devil) who shook hands with him in order to deceive him and lead him and others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What all Muslims have to do is to fear Allah and adhere to His Shari`ah, which is indicated in His Noble Book and in the Sunnah of His trustworthy Messenger, and beware of anything that goes against that. May Allah reform the Muslims and grant them understanding of His religion and cause them to adhere to His Shari`ah, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span class="HarfBody">This authentic Hadith reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) indicates the <strong>permissibility of killing harmful creatures, such as ants, cockroaches, mosquitoes, flies, and predators</strong>. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808080;">Fatwas of Ibn Baz &gt; Volume 8 &gt; Ruling on saying &#8220;Whatever is good is from Allah while evil and sin are from ourselves and Satan&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q: <span style="color:#993300;">We received a question from Makkah and it reads: Some Du`ah (callers to Islam) and lecturers say at the end of their lecture, &#8220;Whatever is good is from Allah while evil and sin are from ourselves and Satan.&#8221; What is the ruling on saying that? Please, enlighten us. May Allah enlighten you!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: <strong>There is nothing wrong &#8211; I see &#8211; with saying that, as it is the truth</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A lecturer, teacher, preacher or anyone else giving advice should observe Taqwa (fear/wariness of offending Allah) and seek the truth. If they do well, it is due to Allah&#8217;s Favor on them and if they err, it is due to their negligence and Satan. Allah (Glorified be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) are free from such error.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah is the Grantor of success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Fatwas of Ibn Baz &gt; Volume 8 &gt; A note concerning a false report circulated by some ignorant people</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah. May Allah&#8217;s Blessings and Peace be upon the slave and Messenger of Allah, our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have come across a false report that is being disseminated by some ignorant people who have little understanding of the religion of Allah.<b> The text of this report is as follows:</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><b> </b><span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. Peace and blessings be upon the noblest of the messengers, our Master Muhammad (peace be upon him), and upon his family and Companions! Allah (Exalted be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#993300;" title="Surah Yunus, 10: 62" target="_blank" name="Nodoubt!Verily,theAuliy%C3%A2%E2%80%99of"></a><span style="color:#008000;">No doubt! Verily, the Auliyâ’ of Allâh [i.e. those who believe in the Oneness of Allâh and fear Allâh much (abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds which he has forbidden), and love Allâh much (perform all kinds of good deeds which He has ordained)], no fear shall come upon them nor shall they grieve.</span> Allah is Most Truthful.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">My Muslim brother, my Muslim sister. A thirteen-year-old girl was inflicted with hard illness and the doctor failed to treat her. One night her sickness grew worse and she wept until sleep overtook her. In her dream, she saw Sayyidah<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Zaynab </span>(may Allah be pleased with her). She put some drops in her mouth, and when she woke up she was completely healed from her sickness. Sayyidah<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Zaynab </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) asked her to write this story thirteen times and distribute it to the Muslims to demonstrate the power of the Creator, may He be Exalted, and how it is manifested in His signs and His creation, Exalted be He above all that they associate with Him. The girl did what she was asked to do, and this is what happened:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>1 – The first copy </b>fell into the hands of a poor man, who wrote it out and distributed it. Thirteen days later, the Lord willed that this poor man should become rich.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>2 – The second copy </b>fell into the hands of a worker who ignored it. Thirteen days later he lost his job.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>3 – The third copy </b>fell into the hands of a rich man, who refused to write it out. Thirteen days later, he lost all the riches that he possessed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">Hasten, O Muslim brother or sister, after reading this story, to copy it out thirteen times and distribute it to people, so that you may get what you wish for from the Most Generous Lord, may He be Glorified and Exalted. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings upon our Master Muhammad and upon all his family and Companions!”</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I read this false report, I thought it is necessary to point out that the benefits and good things that the author claims will come to those who copy and distribute it, and the bad things that will happen to those who ignore it and do not disseminate it further, are all lies and baseless. Rather, they are fabrications of the liars and charlatans. They want to divert the Muslims from putting their trust in their Lord alone, with no partner or associate, to bring them benefits and ward off harm, as well as taking the permissible means as prescribed in the Shari`ah (Islamic law). They also want them to put their trust in someone or something other than Allah to bring benefits and ward off harm and to take false means that are not permitted or prescribed in the Shari`ah, which lead them to become attached to something other than Allah and to worship someone other than Him. Undoubtedly, this is one of the plots of the enemies against the Muslims, who want to divert them away from their true Din (religion) of Islam by any means possible. The Muslims should beware of these plots and not be deceived by them. The Muslim should pay no attention to this false report and similar reports which appear from time to time. Warnings have been issued about several of them in the past. It is not permissible for a Muslim to copy out this and similar reports, or to distribute them under any circumstances. Rather, doing so is an evil action and a person who does that is committing a sin; there is the fear that he will be punished in this world and in the Hereafter, because this isBid`ah (innovation in religion) whose evil is great and whose punishment is severe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This report is a kind of reprehensible Bid`ah and is one of the means that lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and overestimation of Ahl-ul-Bayt (members of the Prophet&#8217;s extended Muslim family) and others among the dead; calling upon them instead of Allah, seeking their help, and thinking that they can bring benefit or ward off harm from those who call upon them and seek their help. It is also a kind of telling lies about Allah. Allah (Glorified be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 105" target="_blank" name="Itisonlythosewhobelievenot"></a><span style="color:#008000;">It is only those who believe not in the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh, who fabricate falsehood, and it is they who are liars</span>. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <a name="Hewhoinnovatesthingsinour"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="18424" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#008000;">He who innovates things in our affairs for which there is no valid (reason) (commits sin) and these are to be rejected.</span></span> (Agreed upon by Imams Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Muslims who receive this letter should tear it up, destroy it, warn people against it and pay no attention to any promises or warnings that it may contain, because these are false reports that have no sound basis and nothing good or bad will result from it. But the one who invents it, those who copy it out and distribute it, and those who promote it and disseminate it among the Muslims are all sinful, because all of that comes under the heading of cooperating in sin and transgression which Allah has forbidden in His Book, where He (Glorified be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 2" target="_blank" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Violatenot"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwâ (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is Severe in punishment.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to keep us and all the Muslims safe and sound from all evil. Allah is Sufficient for us and He is the best to deal with those who fabricated this report and similar reports, and introduced into the religion of Allah things that have nothing to do with it. We ask Allah to deal with them as they deserve, for telling lies about Allah, disseminating falsehood, calling people to the means that lead to Shirk and exaggeration about the dead and distracting them with something that will harm them and will not benefit them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sincerity towards Allah and His slaves demands that we point this out. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon His slave and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#808080;">Content &gt; Volume 8 &gt; Answers to some questions submitted by students to His Eminence &gt; How to wake up for Fajr Prayer everyday  </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q : <span style="color:#993300;">What are the methods I can use in order not to miss the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer? I go to bed early but wake up after sunrise. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Every Muslim has to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>fear Allah</strong></span> (Exalted be He) and offer the Five Obligatory Daily Prayers at their appointed times. He has to try all means that help him in this regard. One of the means that he can try in order to offer the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer in congregation is to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>sleep early</strong></span> and to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>set the alarm</strong></span> for the Fajr prayer time. In this way he will be able to arise at the right time and attend the congregational Prayer. He should also<span style="color:#000000;"><strong> ask Allah (Exalted be He) to help him</strong></span> wake up at Fajr time. Another means he can try is to <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>recite the Dhikr (remembrance of Allah)</strong></span> which is said upon sleeping. This way, Allah (Exalted be He) will help him wake up to offer Fajr Prayer in congregation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q 4: <span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for people who suffer from jinn possession to seek the help of soothsayers in order to kill or exorcise the jinn possessing them?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is not permissible for them to do so because <strong>sorcery</strong> and <strong>soothsaying</strong> can only be performed with the aid of <strong>devils</strong> whose help is attained when the performer attributes them as partners to Allah in worship. A soothsayer is known to have contact with the jinn who inform him of what is going on at certain places. For example, so-and-so died in the Levant (the region covering Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine) and the like matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Devils pass information about future events to each other until it finally reaches the soothsayer. When he passes this information to an ignorant person, the latter comes to believe that the soothsayer or fortuneteller possesses knowledge of <em>Ghayb</em> (Unseen) where in fact the source of this information is Devil. A soothsayer may also seek the help of powerful devils to exorcise another devil possessing the person. This can only be done if the possessed person fulfills their desire that they be worshipped beside Allah or that the possessed person makes vows for their sake or slaughters animals for the sake of drawing near to them. Once their desire is fulfilled, the Shayateen start to threaten the possessing devil with death or imprisonment unless he surrenders to their commands. At that point, the possessing devil will have no choice but to obey his master devils and then leave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It is not a valid excuse to seek the help of soothsayers on the basis that some people benefit from their help</strong>. Those who worship jinn seek to get benefit from them even though the jinn themselves may cause them greater harm by possessing them or robbing their property. Thus, it is not a valid excuse to join jinn in the worship of Allah on the pretext of seeking their benefit to cure the illnesses of humans. During the pre-Islamic era, people used to speak to the idols. The Shayatin would incarnate the idols and would speak with people whom they tempted into worshipping them beside Allah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><b> A speech by His Eminence published in the local and Islamic newspapers in 1395 A.H</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family, his Companions, and those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The so-called science of summoning spirits is widespread among many people including writers and others. They claim that they summon the souls of the dead through a method invented by those who practice such jugglery. They further claim that they ask such souls about the dead, whether they are in bliss or torture, as well as other such affairs as they may think the dead know about.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have investigated the issue thoroughly to find that it is a false science and a satanic jugglery that aims at corrupting beliefs and morals, confusing Muslims, and <strong>claiming to know the Ghayb (the Unseen)</strong> in many respects.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, I considered it proper to write a brief note to clarify the truth, advise the Ummah, and ward off confusion. Undoubtedly, this issue, as any other issue, should be referred to the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah so that we might verify what they or one of them verify and reject what they or one of them rejects. In this regard, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 59" target="_blank" name="Oyouwhobelieve!ObeyAll%C3%A2hand"></a><span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Obey Allâh and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allâh and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), if you believe in Allâh and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With regards to<a name="Soul-relatedissues,theyhave"></a> soul-related issues, they have to do with matters relating to the Ghayb, the truth about which is exclusively known by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). It is impermissible to discuss them unless substantiated by a Shar`y (Islamic legal) evidence. Allah (Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 26" target="_blank" name="HeAloneis)theAll-Knowerof"></a>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">(He Alone is) the All-Knower of the Ghaib (Unseen), and He reveals to none His Ghaib (Unseen).&#8221;<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:#008000;" title="Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 27" target="_blank" name="ExcepttoaMessenger(frommankind)"></a>Except to a Messenger (from mankind) whom He has chosen (He informs him of unseen as much as He likes)</span>, and then He makes a band of watching guards (angels) to march before him and behind him.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified be He) also says in Surah Al-Naml: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Naml, 27: 65" target="_blank" name="Say:Noneintheheavensandthe"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Say: “None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (Unseen) except Allâh”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars differed regarding what is intended by the <strong>Ruh (the Spirit)</strong> in the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) in Surah Al-Isra&#8217; that reads: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Isra', 17: 85" target="_blank" name="Andtheyaskyou(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And they ask you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) concerning the Rûh (the spirit); Say: &#8220;The Rûh (the spirit) is one of the things, the knowledge of which is only with my Lord. And of knowledge, you (mankind) have been given only a little.&#8221;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Some scholars view that it refers to the soul that is in the bodies. Accordingly, the Ayah indicates that the soul is a divine secret unknown to humankind and no one can know about it except what Allah tells. Thus, it is something that is known exclusively to Allah who concealed it from creatures. The Qur&#8217;an and authentically reported Hadiths indicate that the souls of the dead survive after the death of bodies. The following Ayah indicates the same fact: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 42" target="_blank" name="ItisAll%C3%A2hWhotakesawaythe"></a><span style="color:#008000;">It is Allâh Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep. He keeps those (souls) for which He has ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span> It is also authentically reported <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="ThatontheDayofBadr,theProphet"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="24552" class="tip"></span>that on the Day of Badr, the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered that the corpses of twenty-four leaders of Quraysh should be thrown into one of the dirty dry wells of Badr. (It is a habit of the Prophet, peace be upon him, that whenever he conquered some people, he used to stay at the battlefield for three nights). So, on the third day of the Battle of Badr, he ordered that his she-camel be saddled, then he set out, and his Companions followed him saying among themselves, &#8216;Definitely, he (peace be upon him) is proceeding for some great purpose.&#8217; When he (peace be upon him) halted at the edge of the well, he addressed the corpses of the Quraishi infidels by their names and their fathers&#8217; names, &#8216;O so-and-so, son of so-and-so, and O so-and-so, son of so-and-so!Would it have pleased you if you had obeyed Allah and His Messenger? We have found true what your Lord promised us. Have you too found true what your Lord promised you?&#8217; `Umar said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allah! You are speaking to bodies that have no souls!&#8217; The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;By Him in Whose Hand is the soul of Muhammad, you do not hear what I say better than they do, but they cannot answer.&#8217;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> The Prophet (peace be upon him) is authentically reported to have said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="Thedeceasedpersonhearsthefootsteps"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="15489" class="tip"></span>The deceased person hears the footsteps of those who escort him to his final destination after they leave him.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The great scholar<strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ibn Al-Qayyim </span></strong>(may Allah be merciful to him) said: <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;The Salaf (righteous predecessors) are unanimously in agreement with that, and they believed, according to many transmitted reports, that a dead person recognizes the visit of a living person and becomes cheerful about it.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ibn Al-Qayyim </span>recorded that<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ibn `Abbas </span>(may Allah be pleased with him and his father) gave an interpretation of the Ayah that reads: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 42" target="_blank" name="ItisAll%C3%A2hWhotakesawaythe"></a><span style="color:#993300;">It is Allâh Who takes away the souls at the time of their death, and those that die not during their sleep. He keeps those (souls) for which He has ordained death and sends the rest for a term appointed.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: &#8220;<span style="color:#993300;">I was told that the souls of both the living and the dead meet while sleeping and ask each other questions. However, Allah maintains the souls of the dead and sends the souls of the living back to their bodies</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ibn Al-Qayyim </span>(may Allah be merciful to him) commented, saying: <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;The meeting between the souls of the living and the dead is proven by the fact that a living person might see in his dream a dead person and ask him about things not known by the former for which the latter gives an answer that might correspond with the real fact.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the view held by the Salaf that the souls of the dead survive until a time known only to Allah. However, it is not authentically reported that they communicate with the living people at any time other than that of sleeping.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Claims of jugglers that they have the ability to summon the soul of any dead person they like, talk to, and ask it questions are all false. Actually, such are false claims that have no textual or rational grounds. Rather, Allah Alone is the One Who knows about and disposes of souls. He Alone is the One capable of returning them to bodies whenever He so wills. In fact, He Alone is the One who disposes of His Kingdom and no one can interfere with His Plan. However, those who claim otherwise are those who claim to know things they are totally ignorant about and deliberately lie to people regarding the news they report about souls,which they spread either in order to earn money, to prove themselves able to do things they actually cannot do or to confuse people and thus corrupt their religion and `Aqidah (creed).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition, souls summoned by such jugglers are souls of devils they make use of after worshipping and obeying the commands of such devils. The latter do what the former asks and thus deceive people and impersonate the claimed dead people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says in this regard: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-An&#096;am, 6: 112" target="_blank" name="AndsoWehaveappointedforevery"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And so We have appointed for every Prophet enemies &#8211; Shayâtîn (devils) among mankind and jinn, inspiring one another with adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of deception). If your Lord had so willed, they would not have done it; so leave them alone with their fabrications. (Tafsîr Qurtubi)</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-An&#096;am, 6: 113" target="_blank" name="Andthisisinorder)thatthe"></a>(<span style="color:#008000;">And this is in order) that the hearts of those who disbelieve in the Hereafter may incline to such (deceit), and that they may remain pleased with it, and that they may commit what they are committing (all kinds of sins and evil deeds)</span>.<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted be He) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-An&#096;am, 6: 128" target="_blank" name="AndontheDaywhenHewillgather"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And on the Day when He will gather them (all) together (and say): &#8220;O you assembly of jinn! Many did you mislead of men,&#8221; and their Auliyâ’ (friends and helpers) amongst men will say: &#8220;Our Lord! We benefited one from the other, but now we have reached our appointed term which You did appoint for us.&#8221; He will say: &#8220;The Fire be your dwelling-place, you will dwell therein forever, except as Allâh may will. Certainly your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing.&#8221;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Scholars of Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an) say that Jinn benefit from humans in the sense that the latter worship them through sacrificing, vowing for and supplicating to them. On the other hand, humans benefit from Jinn in the sense that the latter fulfill the requests which the former ask of them. In return, they tell them about things that only the Jinn may get to know from remote places, or about things they overhear, or merely about lies, which happens in most cases. Supposing that such people do not offer acts of worship for the souls they summon, even then such a practice may not be considered permissible. This is because merely asking devils, soothsayers, jugglers, and diviners is impermissible. Believing what they say is more unlawful and sinful and even falls under disbelief. In this regard, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="Anyonewhovisitsadivinerand"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="11016" class="tip"></span>Anyone who visits a diviner and asks him about anything, his Salahs (Prayers) extending to forty nights will not be accepted.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> It is also reported in Musnad<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ahmad </span>and the Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="Anyonewhoresortstoadiviner"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="13365" class="tip"></span>Anyone who resorts to a diviner and believes in what he says has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>****</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So many Hadiths and traditions were related in this regard. Undoubtedly, the so-called summoned souls are included under those things prohibited by the Prophet (peace be upon him), as <strong>they are of the same kind of souls of devils</strong> used by diviners and jugglers and thus have the same ruling. They may not be summoned or believed. In fact, such are all prohibited, abhorred, and false practices based on the above-quoted Hadiths and traditions to this effect. This is also because the statements they report from such souls are included under knowledge of the Ghayb. Allah (Glorified be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" title="Surah Al-Naml, 27: 65" target="_blank" name="Say:Noneintheheavensandthe"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Say: “None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (Unseen) except Allâh”</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Such souls might also belong to the devils who used to accompany the dead people</strong>, while they were alive, whose souls are summoned. Thus, they may tell some events that had passed to the dead person while alive. Therefore, they may neither be summoned, asked, nor believed as substantiated by the above-quoted evidence. Actually, those people summon no more than devils and Jinn and make use of them in return for acts of worship, which should not be offered to anyone except Allah. Thus, such people commit major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship that takes the Muslim out of Islam). We seek refuge with Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; in the<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Saudi </span>House of Fatwa issued a Fatwa on <strong>Hypnotism included under summoning spirits</strong>, which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Hypnotism is a kind of fortune-telling or magic whereby the hypnotist uses the Jinn to overpower the subject and then speak through his tongue and give him strength to do things by means of controlling his faculties. This is true if the Jinni is sincere to the hypnotist and obeys him in return for the things by means of which the hypnotist draws close to him. So, the Jinni makes the subject obey the commands of the hypnotist and helps him do things he is asked by the hypnotist to do. Thus, it is impermissible to use hypnotism in finding out stolen objects or lost thingsor in treating diseases or doing anything. Rather, it is an act of Shirk, for the reasons stated above and because it implies relying on other than Allah in things beyond ordinary means which Allah has made accessible for His creatures and permitted them to use.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a title="Click here">Among scholars who disclosed the truth about such false claims is <strong>Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Muhammad Muhammad Husayn </span></strong>in his book <strong>&#8220;Modern Spirituality, Truth and Objectives.&#8221;</strong> He was one of those deceived by such jugglery for a while but Allah guided him to truth to uncover the falsehood of such claims after he had gone deeply into them and found them no more than superstitions and jugglery. He stated that those who practice summoning spirits make use of a variety of methods. Beginners use a <strong>small cup</strong> to receive them therein. Others make use of the <strong>basket method on whose edge a pen</strong> is fastened to write answers to the questions of questioners. However, others depend on an <strong>intermediary</strong> such as in the case of Hypnotism.</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He added that he has doubts about those who claim to summon spirits and that they are supported by certain sponsors in view of the <strong>huge propaganda</strong> made for them. Therefore, <strong>many newspapers and magazines</strong> that have never been active in any spiritual or hereafter-related fields hurried to be updated with them and publish their claims. Such magazines have never called to religion or belief in Allah. He also added that they concern themselves with reviving the Pharaonic and other pre-Islamic ideologies. Moreover, he added that those who promote these ideas are people who lost a dear person, and thus try to console themselves through fancies. In this regard, the most famous person who promoted such an idea is Mr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Oliver Lodge </span>who lost his son in World War I. The same applies to the founder of Spiritualism movement in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Egypt </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Ahmad FahmyAbul-Khayr </span>whose long awaited son died in 1937.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Muhammad Muhammad Husayn </span>stated that he practiced such a false practice starting with the method of cup and table, which he found them unpersuasive. He ended up using the method of an intermediary and tried to watch the so-called embodiment of souls or hear their direct voice that they deem the evidence of the truthfulness of their claims. Neither he nor others were successful because this cannot be materialized in the actual fact. Rather, they are no more than exact deceptions based on secret skillful tricks that aim at destroying religions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Universal destructive Zionism is not far away this. When the man came to realize the truth about such false ideas and to lose confidence in them, he forsook them and decided to make clear the truth to people. He began to say that those deviated people work hard to extract deep-rooted faith and `Aqidah out of people&#8217;s hearts and plunge them into a confusing mix of doubts and illusions. Those who claim to summon spirits describe the Messengers of Allah (peace be upon them) as no more than spiritual intermediaries as claimed by their leader<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Arthur Findlay </span>in his book &#8220;On the Edge of the Ether.&#8221; Speaking about prophets, the author describes them as high class intermediaries, and their miracles as no more than spiritual phenomena as those that happen in the room where spirits are summoned.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Husayn </span>further said: &#8220;If they fail to summon a spirit, they will say that the intermediary is unsuccessful or tired, that attendants are incompatible or that among attendants are dubious or challenging people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Among their false claims is their claim that Jibril (Gabriel, peace be upon him) attends and blesses their sessions (may Allah damn them). This was a brief outline of the ideas of Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Muhammad Muhammad Husayn </span>on the subject.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to what we mentioned above as well as the opinion of the Committee and Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Muhammad Muhammad Husayn </span>on Hypnotism, it becomes clear how false are the claims of those who allege that they talk to souls, including summoning the souls of the dead and asking them what they would like to know. It also becomes clear that all these are satanic acts and jugglery falling under acts warned against by the Prophet (peace be upon him), such as consulting diviners, soothsayers, augurs and the like. It is thus obligatory on officials in Muslim states to ban and eliminate such falsehood and prescribe deterrent penalties against those indulgent in them. It is also obligatory on editors-in-chief of Muslim newspapers not to publish such falsehood which might defame their newspapers. Rather, they have to criticize and refute it and warn people against the traps, deceptions and illusions of devils from among both human and Jinn. Indeed, Allah says the truth and guides to the straight path. We ask Him to reform the states of Muslims, grant them clear understanding of the religion, and protect them against the deception of criminals and the illusions of the friends of devils. Indeed, He is the Patron, Capable of all things. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q. What is the degree of authenticity of the Hadith: There should be no I`tikaf (seclusion for worship in a Masjid) except in the Three Masjids (mosques) If it is authentic, does it actually mean that there should be no I`tikaf except in the Three Masjids (i.e., the Sacred, Prophet&#8217;s, and Al-Aqsa)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A. <span style="color:#666699;"><strong>It is valid to observe I`tikaf in any Masjid other than the three Masjids, on condition that congregational Salah (Prayer) is established therein</strong></span>. For, if this condition is not fulfilled, it becomes invalid to observe I`tikaf there.</p>
<p>However, this does not apply if a person vows to observe I`tikaf in any of the three Masjids, for they are then obliged to fulfill their vow. May Allah guide us all to do what pleases Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 1: Some people understood from your answer to the first question in the interview about concluding treaties with the Jews that signing a peace treaty or truce with the Jews who captured the lands and committed transgressions is unconditionally permissible. They also understood that they have to support and befriend the Jews. Making peace with them requires the Muslims not to stir hatred and disavowal of the Jews in the educational curriculum or mass media in the Muslim countries. The world is now witnessing a phase of international reconciliation and peaceful coexistence. It is not allowed to arouse feelings of religious hatred among people. Would you please explain this issue.</span></p>
<p>A 1: <strong>Making peace with the Jews or other disbelievers does not necessitate support and friendship</strong>. It ensures that both sides enjoy safety and peace and may engage in other dealings such as sale, purchase, and exchange of ambassadors. These actions do not require the Muslims to support or befriend the disbelievers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) concluded <strong>peace treaties with the people of Makkah</strong>. This act did not force the Muslims to befriend or support the pagans, but the feelings of hatred remain until the Opening of Makkah and people entered into the religion of Allah (Exalted be He) in multitudes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, he (peace be upon him) <strong>made peace with the Jews of Al-Madinah</strong> for an unlimited period when he emigrated to Al-Madinah. He (peace be upon him) used to buy things from them, talk to them and call them to Islam but it was not necessary to befriend or support them. Furthermore, the Prophet (peace be upon him) died while his armor was in pawn with a Jew in return for food.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When Banu Al-Nadir, a Jewish tribe, committed high treason, they were expelled from Al-Madinah. When Qurayzhah breached the covenant and joined a besieging army of the enemy that came from Makkah to fight the Prophet (peace be upon him) on the Day of Ahzab, the Prophet (peace be upon him) fought them killing their leaders and taking their women and offspring captives. When Sa`d Ibn Mu`adh (may Allah be pleased with him) judged them, he judged that the men must be killed and the women and children taken captives. So, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that he judged according to the judgment of Allah (Exalted be He) from above the seven heavens.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims among the Sahabh and their followers often declared a <strong>truce with the Christians and other non-Muslims</strong> without having to support or befriend them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says, <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, you will find the strongest among men in enmity to the believers (Muslims) the Jews and those who are Al-Mushrikûn</span>. <span style="color:#525253;"> [Sooratul-Maa‘idah 5:82]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <span style="color:#008000;">Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: &#8220;Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh: we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allâh Alone&#8221; <span style="color:#525253;">[Sooratul-Mumtahinah 60:4]</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says, <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Auliyâ’), then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust)</span>.<span style="color:#525253;">[Sooratul-Maa‘idah 5:51]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <span style="color:#008000;">You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred (people)</span>.<span style="color:#525253;">[Sooratul-Mujaadilah 58:22]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs that convey the same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Here is another situation showing that making peace with the Jews or other disbelievers, when necessary, does not necessitate supporting and befriending them. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) conquered <strong>Khaybar</strong>, <strong>he made peace with the Jews</strong> and agreed that they take care of the palms and fields and the harvest was to be halved between them and the Muslims. This agreement was unlimited and they stayed in Khaybar under this agreement as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, We will let you stay on this (condition), as long as we will.<strong>[1]</strong> According to another narration, “We will let you stay, as long as Allah will let you stay.” <strong>[2]</strong> They stayed there until `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) evacuated them. It is narrated that when `Abdullah ibn Rawahah (may Allah be pleased with him) estimated the value due on the fruits of the palm trees one year, they alleged that the value was unjust. He (may Allah be pleased with them) told them, &#8220;By Allah! My hatred for you and my love for the Muslims will never make me treat you unjustly. If you will, accept my bulk assessment of the outcome that I made for you; otherwise we accept it all.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, these situations indicate that making peace treaties and truce with the enemies of Allah does not require us to support or befriend them, as some of those who are not aware of the rulings of the purified Shari`ah believe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>It should be clear that making peace treaties with the Jews or other disbelievers does not require us to change the educational curriculum or other dealings based on support and befriending</strong>. May Allah grant us success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><b>No excuses are accepted regarding the Fundamentals of Tawhid</b><b> </b></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;"><b style="color:#000000;"></b><b></b><b>Q:</b><b> Can a person be excused for their ignorance regarding the fundamentals of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) </b>which represent the core of Din (religion)? What is the ruling on judging specific people as being Kafirs (disbelievers) for indulging in practices of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) out of their ignorance?</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">A: No person can be excused for their ignorance regarding issues of Tawhid so long as they live amongst Muslims. However, whoever lives far away from Muslim areas and is ignorant of Islam, they will be judged by Allah (Glorified be He). They will be dealt with in the same way as Ahl-ul-Fatrah (people having no access to Divine Messages) on the Day of Resurrection i.e. they will be tested there and judged accordingly.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">On the other hand, whoever lives amongst Muslims and hears the Word of Allah and His Messenger without adhering to them but instead worships the graves and seeks their help or insults Din, such people are Kafirs (disbelievers). Muslim authorities have to ask such people to repent and if they do not, they have to be killed for their Kufr (disbelief).</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">The same applies to whoever mocks the Din, considers Halal (lawful) things that Allah declares as being Haram (prohibited) such as Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage), Khamr (intoxicant), applying positive law, judging by laws other than what Allah has revealed, or claiming that such laws are better than the laws which are set by Allah. Declaring any of the foregoing as Halal is tantamount to committing Riddah (apostasy), we seek refuge with Allah from this. It is thus Wajib (obligatory) on every Islamic government to apply Shari`ah (Islamic law), to advise whoever indulges in any of the practices which revoke their Islam to make Tawbah (repentance to Allah), and to kill them if they refuse to give up their Kufr.</p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Proof for this is the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="Whoever(aMuslim)discardstheirDin,killthem"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="18055" class="tip"></span>Whoever (a Muslim) discards their Din, kill them.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> (Related by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadiths). Moreover, it is reported in the Two Sahih Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="OntheauthorityofMuadhibn"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="25525" class="tip"></span>on the authority of Mu`adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) that he ordered some rulers to kill the apostates if they do not make Tawbah. Mu`adh said: &#8216;This is the judgment of Allah and His Messenger&#8217;.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">However, such a judgment has to be applied by the Muslim ruler and through the Shar`y (Islamic legal) courts. This is to ensure that the ruling of Allah is implemented on the basis of true knowledge and insight of Muslim authorities. May Allah set right the affairs of us all. Verily, Allah is the All Hearer, the Most Near.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A: </b>Observing Sawm on Mondays and Thursdays is not only restricted to Rajab or Sha‘ban, rather it is a Mandub (commendable) act during all the months of the year. It is also permissible for whoever is in the habit of fasting them all year to observe fasting them after the fifteenth of Sha‘ban, even if one of these days coincides with the Day of Doubt (so called because there is doubt concerning it &#8211; is it the last day of Sha‘ban or the first day of Ramadan), for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <a style="color:blue;" name="Donotobservefastforadayor"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="92685" class="tip"></span>Do not observe fast for a day or two days ahead of Ramadan, except a person who is in the habit of observing a particular Sawm; they may fast on that day.</span> (Agreed upon its authenticity by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: There are some Muslim sisters from Al-Mujamma`ah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia who say in their question: When we try to stop the spread of Namimah (tale-bearing) and Ghibah (backbiting) among people, those whom we advise may insult and become mad at us. Are we sinful for making them angry, especially if they are parents? Should we prevent them or forget about matters that are not related to us? Please, advise!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>A: </b>Enjoining right and forbidding wrong are <strong>of the most important acts of worship</strong>, as Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 71" target="_blank" name="Thebelievers,menandwomen,are"></a><span style="color:#008000;">The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden) </span>(<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#222222;">Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 71)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allah (Glorified be He) explains in this Ayah that enjoining right and forbidding wrong are of the <strong>qualities of the believing men and women</strong> where Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 110" target="_blank" name="You[truebelieversinIsl%C3%A2mic"></a><span style="color:#008000;">You [true believers in Islâmic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his Sunnah] are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islâm has forbidden), and you believe in Allâh</span>. (<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 110)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a style="color:blue;" name="Whoever,amongyou,seessomething"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="24179" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#008000;">Whoever, among you, sees something abominable should rectify it with his hand; and if he has not strength enough to do it, then he should do it with his tongue; and if he has not strength enough to do it, (even) then he should (abhor it) from his heart, and that is the least of Faith</span>.</span> Related by Muslim in his Sahih (book of authentic Hadiths).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs and Hadiths on the obligation of enjoining right and forbidding wrong that rebuke those who neglect this duty. It is obligatory upon you and upon every believing man and woman to enjoin right and forbid wrong, <strong>even if those whom you invite become angry or insult you</strong>. Indeed, <strong>observing patience is obligatory</strong> as the Prophets (peace be upon them) and their followers did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) addressed His Prophet (peace be upon him) saying: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ahqaf, 46: 35" target="_blank" name="Thereforebepatient(OMuhammad"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Therefore be patient (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) as did the Messengers of strong will .<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Ahqaf, 46: 35</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"> </span>Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 46" target="_blank" name="AndobeyAll%C3%A2handHisMessenger,"></a><span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and be patient. Surely, Allâh is with those who are As-Sâbirûn (the patient)</span>. <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 46</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) says about<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Luqman Al-Hakim (Luqman the wise) </span>that he said to his son: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Luqman, 31: 17" target="_blank" name="Omyson!Aqim-As-Sal%C3%A2t(perform"></a>&#8220;<span style="color:#008000;">O my son! Aqim-As-Salât (perform As-Salât), enjoin (on people) Al-Ma‘rûf &#8211; (Islâmic Monotheism and all that is good), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief in the Oneness of Allâh, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad), and bear with patience whatever befalls you</span>.<span style="color:#008000;">Verily, these are some of the important commandments (ordered by Allâh with no exemption). (<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Luqman, 31: 17)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No doubt, reforming the society and preserving its integrity are achieved by following the instructions of Allah and then by enjoining right and forbidding wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The neglect of enjoining right and forbidding wrong is one of the greatest reasons for corrupting the society, tearing it apart, and exposing it to general punishment</span>. It is authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that he said: <a style="color:blue;" name="Ifactsofdisobediencearedone"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="24301" class="tip"></span><span style="color:#008000;">If acts of disobedience are done among people and they do not change them, Allah will soon punish them all.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;"> </span>(<span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#222222;">Al-Tirmidhy, Sunan, Book on trials, no. 2168; and Ibn Majah, Sunan, Book on trials, no. 4005.&#8217;)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) warned His servants against following the example of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> the Children of Israel </span>in His saying: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 78" target="_blank" name="ThoseamongtheChildrenofIsrael"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Those among the Children of Israel who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of Dâwûd (David) and ‘Isâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). That was because they disobeyed (Allâh and the Messengers) and were ever transgressing beyond bounds. <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 79" target="_blank" name="Theyusednottoforbidoneanother"></a>They used not to forbid one another from Al-Munkar (wrong, evil-doing, sins, polytheism, disbelief) which they committed. Vile indeed was what they used to do</span>. (<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 78-79)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to guide all Muslims, rulers and subjects, to do this duty in the best form, to reform their conditions, and protect all people from the causes of His wrath. He is the All-Hearer, the All-Respondent.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="color:#000000;text-align:center;"><b>Avoiding recitations for healing or protection that violate Shari`ah</b></p>
<p>From<a id="ContentAnchor" href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/MoftyDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;Type=Mofty&amp;section=tafseer&amp;ID=2" target="_blank" name="Abdul-AzizibnAbdullahibnBaz"> `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz </a>to all Muslims in the district of Al-Far` and other districts of Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, may Allah guide you to have insight into the religion of Islam, Amen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah&#8217;s peace, mercy and blessings be upon you. To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have been informed that in your district there is an incantation against scorpions and other poisonous creatures, and that this incantation contains statements of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). That is why I see I have to warn you against such Ruqyahs (recitations for healing or protection).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is the text of some of such Ruqyahs referred to above:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">(In the Name of Allah! O Allah&#8217;s Words! By the seven heavens and the revealed Ayahs that rule but not ruled! O Sulayman Al-Rifa`y! O fighter of scorpions&#8217; poison! Call scorpions in the name of Al-Rifa`y, both female scorpions and male ones, both long scorpions and short ones, both red scorpions and white ones, and both big scorpions and small ones against the evil of scorpions creeping both in the evening and in the morning. I seek help against them from Allah, His Ayahs, ninety nine prophets, Fatimah, the Prophet&#8217;s daughter and her offspring).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These words are only some of the incantations I have been informed of. They have many formulas, which all involve Shirk. There could be no doubt that such incantations include <strong>statements of Shirk</strong>, such as, &#8220;<strong>By the seven heavens</strong>,&#8221; and, &#8220;<strong>O<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Sulayman Al-Rifa`y! </span>O fighter of scorpions&#8217; poison! Call scorpions in the name of</strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><strong> Al-Rifa`y</strong>,&#8221; </span>and, &#8220;<strong>I seek help against them from Allah, His Ayahs, ninety-nine prophets, and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Fatimah, </span>the Prophet&#8217;s daughter and her offspring</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is worth mentioning that the Glorious Qur&#8217;an and the Prophetic Sunnah stress that Allah Alone is the only One worthy of worship and no one should be invoked or asked for help except Allah (Exalted be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Allah (Glorified be He) says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Fatihah, 1: 5" target="_blank" name="You(Alone)weworship,andYou"></a><span style="color:#008000;">You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Jinn, 72: 18" target="_blank" name="AndthemosquesareforAll%C3%A2h(Alone):"></a><span style="color:#008000;">And the mosques are for Allâh (Alone): so invoke not anyone along with Allâh</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <a style="color:blue;" name="Dua(supplication)is(theessenceof)worship"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="18029" class="tip"></span>Du&#8217;a` (supplication) is (the essence of) worship.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">He(peace be upon him) also said: <a style="color:blue;" name="Ifyoubeg,begofAllahAlone;"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="23001503" class="tip"></span>If you beg, beg of Allah Alone; and if you need assistance, supplicate to Allah Alone for help.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and Prophetic Hadiths that stress this meaning. Moreover, Muslim scholars unanimously agree that appealing to the heavens, stars, idols, trees, and so on, for help is as an act of Shirk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, they unanimously agree that it is not permissible to invoke the dead or seek their help whether they were prophets, righteous people or others. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <a style="color:blue;" name="Whenamandies,hisdeedscome"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="14124" class="tip"></span>When a man dies, his deeds come to an end, except for three: Sadaqah Jariyah (ongoing charity), knowledge by which people benefit, or a pious son who prays for him (the deceased).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">The Ruqyah referred to above includes some statements like asking the heavens, the dead, including prophets,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Rifa`y, </span>and others for help. All this is regarded as an act of Shirk.</span> Thus, all Muslims should be cautious about such Ruqyahs and similar incantations that contain statements of Shirk. Moreover, Muslims should advise and warn one another against such Ruqyahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They should resort to legal Ruqyahs (i.e. reciting Qur&#8217;an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing), such as Ayat-ul-Kursy (the Qur&#8217;anic Verse of Allah&#8217;s Chair, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255), Surah Al-Ikhlas, Surah Al-Falaq, Surah Al-Nas and other Ayahs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is in addition to supplications for refuge and protection prescribed by Shari`ah (Islamic law), such as seeking refuge with Allah&#8217;s Perfect Words from the evil of His creation. Also, a Muslim can say three times in the morning and in the evening: <a style="color:blue;" name="IntheNameofAllah,withWhose"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="11111" class="tip"></span>In the Name of Allah, with Whose Name nothing can be harmful on the earth or in the heaven, and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.</span> Also, there is the Islamic Ruqyah for the sick and for people who are stung in which a Muslim can say three times: <a style="color:blue;" name="Removetheaffliction,OLordof"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="11113" class="tip"></span>Remove the affliction, O Lord of mankind, and bring about healing, as You are the Healer. There is no healing but Your Healing; a healing that leaves behind no ailment.</span> <a style="color:blue;" name="IntheNameofAllahIperform"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="11191" class="tip"></span>In the Name of Allah I perform Ruqyah for you, from everything that may harm you; from the evil of any soul or envious eye. May Allah heal you. In the Name of Allah I perform Ruqyah for you.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, reciting Surah Al-Fatihah over the sick and the people who are stung is one of the greatest causes of cure, especially when recitation is performed sincerely and truthfully asking Allah (Exalted be He) to grant healing with full faith that Allah (Exalted be He) is the Only One who Cures and that no one can cure people from a diseases except Him (Glorified be He).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">I ask Allah to guide us and all Muslims to have insight into His Religion and to steadfastly adhere to it. I ask Him to protect us from all that violates His Laws. Indeed, He is the Most Generous and the Most Beneficent. May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy and Blessings be upon you.</span></p>

This was meant to protect Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and eliminate the means leading to Shirk, Bid`ah and superstitions related to Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Below is some of what was mentioned by some scholars in this regard, so that you will be well informed about this matter.</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imam Abu Bakr Muhammad ibn Al-Walid Al-Tartushy</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">said in his book &#8216;<strong>Al-Hawadith wal-Bida</strong>`&#8217;, a chapter entitled &#8216;A Chapter on Forms of Bid`ah&#8217;, p. 135,</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;Al-Ma`rur ibn Suwayd </span><span style="color:#000000;">said, &#8216;When we went to perform Hajj with</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him), we saw a Masjid (mosque) on the way, so people began offering Salah (Prayer) in it.&#8217;</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar </span><span style="color:#000000;">said, &#8220;O, people! Those who were before you perished because of honoring such sites, until they took them as places of worship. If one arrives there at the time of Salah, one should offer Salah there; otherwise they should leave.'&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">On p. 141, he said on the authority of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Muhammad ibn Waddah </span><span style="color:#000000;">that</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span><span style="color:#000000;">ordered that the tree under which the Prophet (peace be upon him) was given the Bay`ah be cut, because people began to visit it and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Umar </span><span style="color:#000000;">feared that they might be misled.</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Ibn Waddah</span><span style="color:#000000;">said:</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;Malik </span><span style="color:#000000;">and other scholars of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Madinah </span><span style="color:#000000;">hated going to the Masjids and Islamic monuments in Al-Madinah except</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Quba&#8217; </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Uhud. </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Sufyan </span><span style="color:#000000;">entered</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Aqsa Mosque </span><span style="color:#000000;">and offered Salah there, but he did not inquire about those monuments or offer Salah there; and others who imitated him did the same.&#8221;</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Ibn Waddah </span><span style="color:#000000;">then said: &#8220;How many matters are now considered acceptable by many people that were once considered Munkar. People try to get closer to Allah through means that drive them further from Allah.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">Shaykh-ul-Islam</span></strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong> Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) said in his book &#8216;<strong>Majmu` Al-Fatawa</strong>&#8216;, Vol. 26, P. 133:</span><a style="color:#000000;" name="AsforclimbingMountAl-Rahmah"></a></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">&#8220;As for climbing Mount Al-Rahmah (at<span id="ContentParagraph"> `Arafah) </span>it is neither an act of Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) nor Mustahab (desirable).</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">Nor is it Mustahab to enter the dome above it, called the Dome of Adam, to offer Salah there, or circumambulate it, as this is one of the major sins.</span></p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333300;">It is neither Mustahab to enter the Masjids at the place of Jamarat (stone pillars at which pebbles are thrown during Hajj) or offer Salah there. Circumambulation around them, the Stone, the room of the Prophet (peace be upon him) or anything other than the Ka`bah is a grave Bid`ah.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He also said on p. 144 of the same section, </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;As for visiting the Masjids that were built in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Masjid Al-Haram </span><span style="color:#000000;">(the Sacred Mosque in Makkah), such as the one by the foot of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Safa, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the one by the</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> foot of Abu Qubays,</span><span style="color:#000000;">and such Masjids that were built at the sites of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah, such as Masjid Al-Mawlid (the Prophet&#8217;s birthday) and others, it is neither a Sunnah to visit these places, nor was it preferable by any of the Imams. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is only permissible to visit</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Masjid Al-Haram </span><span style="color:#000000;">in particular, and the sacred ritual places, such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Arafah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Muzdalifah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Mina, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Al-Safa and Al-Marwah. </span><span style="color:#000000;">However, visiting the mountains and areas around</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> `Arafah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Muzdalifah </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Mina, </span><span style="color:#000000;">such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Hira&#8217; Mountain, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the mountain at</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Mina </span><span style="color:#000000;">where it is claimed that there was the sacrifice dome and such places. It is not a Sunnah related to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), but rather a Bid`ah. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">The same applies to the Masjids built at the sites said to be monuments. The Prophet (peace be upon him) did not permit visiting any of these.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">In vol. 27, p. 134, of the same book, he also said:</span><a style="color:#000000;" name="Somepeoplemightaskwhetherit"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#333300;">&#8220;Some people might ask whether it is permissible to glorify a place where there is worn-out things and saffron as the Prophet (peace be upon him) was seen there. Glorification of such places and turning them into Masjids is an imitation of the People of the Book whom we are prohibited to imitate.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#333300;">It was authentically reported that<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) was traveling when he saw a group of people hurrying to a place. He asked, &#8216;What is this?&#8217; People replied, &#8216;It is a place where the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered Salah.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Do you want to turn the sites of your prophet into Masjids? If the time of Salah comes while a person is there, they can offer Salah there; otherwise they should leave.&#8217;<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>said this in the presence of a number of Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them). It is known that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to offer Salah in many places while traveling, and the people would see him in their sleep in different places. However, the Salaf did not turn any of these into Masjids or tourist sites. If this door is opened, many of the Muslim lands will be turned into Masjids and tourist sites, as people still dream that the Prophet (peace be upon him) visits them at home. Establishing such tourist sites is a loathed Bid`ah. Allah has not ordered that the places of prophets be turned into a Musalla (a place for Prayer) except Maqam Ibrahim (the Station of Ibrahim) in His statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 125" target="_blank" name="And(remember)whenWemadethe"></a>And take you (people) the Maqâm (place) of Ibrâhîm (Abraham) [or the stone on which Ibrâhîm (Abraham) عليه السلام stood while he was building the Ka‘bah] as a place of prayer (for some of your prayers, e.g. Two Rak‘at after the Tawâf of the Ka‘bahat Makkah)<img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">He has neither ordered that a stone be touched and kissed except Al-Hajar Al-Aswad (the Black Stone in a corner of the Ka`bah), or Salah be directed to a building other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Bayt-ul-Haram </span><span style="color:#000000;">(the Sacred House, another name for the Ka`bah). According to the Ijma` (consensus) of the Muslims, it is impermissible to make analogies in this matter. It is tantamount to asking the people to perform Hajj to a place other than</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Bayt-ul-`Atiq </span><span style="color:#000000;">or observe Sawm (fasting) in a month other than Ramadan, and so on.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He then said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;The rest of the issues have been definitely answered. If a person offers Salah or recites Du`a&#8217; (supplication) intentionally at the place of a prophet&#8217;s footprints or site; the grave of a Sahaby (Companion of the Prophet), a sheikh, or one of Ahl-ul-Bayt (members of the Prophet&#8217;s extended Muslim family), a tower or a cave, this is a rejected Bid`ah in Islam, as neither the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) nor the early generation of Muslims or those who followed them in righteousness did so. Not one of the Muslim Imams preferred it; rather, it is a means leading to Shirk.&#8221; There is elaboration on this elsewhere. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He then said on p. 500 in the same section,</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#000000;"> &#8220;After Islam, none of the Sahabah used to go to Hira&#8217; Cave on purpose. It is impermissible for us to seek the caves of mountains or sit in seclusion there&#8230;As for sitting in seclusion in caves and traveling for a mountain to seek blessings, such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Tur Mountain, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Mount Hira&#8217;, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Mount Thawr </span><span style="color:#000000;">and others, it is impermissible for us. The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="Donotsetoutonajourneyexcept"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="18171" class="tip"></span>Do not set out on a journey except to three Masjids: Al-Masjid Al-Haram, this mosque of mine (the Prophet&#8217;s Mosque), and Al-Aqsa Mosque (in Jerusalem).</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">End of quote.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong>Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) wrote on p. 204 of his book <strong>Ighathat Al-Lahfan min Masa&#8217;id Al-Shaytan</strong>, after warning against visiting graves to seek blessings in them and recite Du`a&#8217; there:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><a style="color:#000000;" name="TheSahabahdisapprovedofthings"></a><span style="color:#333300;">&#8220;The Sahabah disapproved of things much more trivial than this. Many people narrated from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Ma&#8217;rur ibn Suwayd </span>that he offered Fajr (Dawn) Prayer with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar ibn Al-Khattab </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) on the way to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah, </span>and then people began spreading everywhere. He asked, &#8216;Where are these people going?&#8217; It was said, &#8216;O Amir Al-Mu&#8217;minin, they go to offer Salah in a Masjid where the Prophet (peace be upon him) offered Salah.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Those who were before you perished because of this; they used to follow the traces of their prophets and turn them into places of `Ibadah. If the time of Salah comes while you are in such places, offer Salah there; otherwise you should leave, and do not go there intentionally.&#8217;<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) also uprooted the tree under which the Sahabah made the Bay`ah to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">End of quote.</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Scholars stated much about this issue. We hope that what we have already mentioned is enough and convincing for those who seek the truth. Having known the previously mentioned pieces of evidence from Shari`ah and the opinions of scholars on this issue, you would know that the call of the writer for glorifying Islamic monuments, such as</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Thawr Cave, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the place where Al-Rudwan Bay`ah took place and others; reconstructing what was demolished of them; paving roads leading to them; making elevators or cable cars for high places such as the two mentioned caves; turning them into tourist sites; erecting signs to them; and appointing tourist guides for the visitors is all contrary to Islamic Shari`ah, which provides for achieving and boosting interests, and preventing and curbing evil, as well as blocking the means leading to Shirk and Bid`ah. You would also know that we should prevent Bid`ah and the means leading to Shirk, even if those who call for them have good intentions, as they lead to great evil, change the rites of Islam, and create new places and forms of `Ibadah that were not prescribed by Allah or His Messenger (peace be upon him). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 3" target="_blank" name="Forbiddentoyou(forfood)are:"></a><span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;"><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Anything that was not prescribed in the era of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them) cannot be made permissible later. If this door is opened, Islam will be misrepresented and innovated ideas will enter it. Muslims will thus become like</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Jews </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Christians </span><span style="color:#000000;">in their manipulating their faiths and changing them according to their whims and desires. That is why Imam</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Malik ibn Anas, </span><span style="color:#000000;">the Imam of Madinah (may Allah be merciful to him), made a great statement that all the scholars agreed upon, saying: &#8220;The last generations of this Ummah (nation) will not succeeded except when they resort to what made the former followers succeed.&#8221; He meant that what brought success to the first generation was adherence to the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), following their rules and avoiding what contradicts them. The last generations of this Ummah will not succeed unless they resort to what made the former generations succeed. He (may Allah be merciful to him) has spoken the truth. When people corrupted their faith, created Bid`ah and founded new ways, they divided into different sects, became confused with every sect rejoicing in what they had. Their enemies attacked them, taking advantage of discrepancy among them, weakness of faith, difference in intentions, and fanaticism of every sect to their misleading ways and Bid`ah, until the conditions of the Muslims have reached the current weakness and many nations have attacked them. All Muslims should return to their correct faith adhering to its just rules, learning from the original sources of the Qur&#8217;an and the authentic Sunnah, and advising each other accordingly. We must cooperate to achieve this in all fields, whether legislative, economic, political, social or others; and avoid anything that contradicts it or leads to ambiguity. In this manner Muslims will restore their lost dignity and their previous glory, and Allah will make them triumph over their enemies and rule the world</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Outset and end of the last third of night</b><b>  [1]<span id="This was published in Al-Da&#096;wah magazine, issue no. 1138, on 2/9/1408 A.H." class="tip"></span></b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Q: It is reported in the Hadith that <a name="Allahdescendseverynighttothe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="24854"></span><span style="color:#008000;">Allah descends every night to the lowest heaven in the last third of the night</span> [2].</span> When does the last third of the night begin and end?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There are Mutawatir Hadiths (a Hadith reported by a significant number of narrators throughout the chain of narration, whose agreement upon a lie is impossible) from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that prove that Allah descends. The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, <a name="OurLorddescendstothelowest"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="13253"></span><span style="color:#008000;">Our Lord descends to the lowest heaven every night when the last third of the night begins when He says, ‘Who calls Me to answer him? Who asks Me to give him? Who asks Me for forgiveness to forgive him?</span> [3]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) unanimously agreed that Allah descends in a manner that befits Him and that He is not like His creation at all in any of His Attributes, as He states, <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 1" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%85):"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;He is Allâh, (the) One. <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 2" target="_blank" name="All%C3%A2h-us-Samad(%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%8A%D9%8A%D8%B5%D9%85%D8%AF"></a>&#8220;Allâh-us-Samad (السيد الذي يصمد إليه في الحاجات) [Allâh the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither eats nor drinks)]</span></em>. <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 3" target="_blank" name="Hebegetsnot,norwasHebegotten"></a>&#8220;He begets not, nor was He begotten. <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 4" target="_blank" name="Andthereisnoneco-equalorcomparableuntoHim"></a>&#8220;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&#8221; <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says, <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Shura, 42: 11" target="_blank" name="TheCreatoroftheheavensand"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</span></em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah, we must accept the Ayahs and Hadiths that speak of the Attributes of Allah as they are without <strong>Tahrif</strong> (distortion of the meaning), <strong>Ta`til</strong> (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), <strong>Takyif</strong> (descriptive designation of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), or <strong>Tamthil</strong> (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation). At the same time, we must believe in them and believe that what is mentioned in these texts is true without likening Allah to His creation or discussing the nature of His Attributes. Rather, their view concerning His Attributes is like their view concerning His Dhat (Essence). Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah affirm the Essence of Allah without Takyif, or Tamthil, and thus, we must also affirm His Attributes without Takyif or Tamthil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The descent of Allah occurs in every country in a manner that befits Allah, because the descent of Allah is not like the descent of any of His creation. He is described as descending in the last part of the night in all parts of the world in a manner that befits His Majesty, Exalted be He.No one can know how He descends just as no one can know how His Essence is, except Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He states, <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Shura, 42: 11" target="_blank" name="TheCreatoroftheheavensand"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</span></em>.<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Shura, 42: 11.</span> Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: <a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 74" target="_blank" name="Soputnotforwardsimilitudes"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">So put not forward similitudes for Allâh (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor He resembles anything). Truly! Allâh knows and you know not.<span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 74</span></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The time of the first and last third of the night differs according to the season; if the night is nine hours long, then the time of descent begins at the onset of the seventh hour and continues until dawn. If the night is twelve hours long, then the last third begins at the beginning of the ninth hour until the break of dawn and so on, depending on how long or short the night is in each place</strong></span>. May Allah grant us success.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The first question of Fatwa no. 19886   </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">Q 1: <strong>is the hour that precedes the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer considered as part of the last third of the night?  </strong> </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;"> A: The hour that precedes the second Fajr (true dawn), which consists of 60 minutes, is part of the last third of the night and is considered to be the last hour of the last third of the night. This is because the <span style="color:#0000ff;"><strong>night begins from the sunset and lasts until the emergence of the second Fajr</strong></span>. It is authentically reported that Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) descends to the worldly heaven in the last third of the night. It was related by Al-Bukhari in his &#8220;Sahih (Book of Authentic Hadith)&#8221;, vol. 2, p. 47, on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;Our Lord, Blessed and Exalted is He, descends every night to the heaven of the world, when only the last third of the night remains and says, &#8220;Who will supplicate Me that I may respond to him; who will ask Me that I may give him; who will beg My forgiveness that I may forgive him?&#8221; Every Muslim and Muslimah is free to benefit from the blessed times and the times when supplications are answered, to supply themselves with good righteous deeds and supplicate for whatever they like from the matters of the Din (religion) or the Duniya (this world). </span><br style="color:#000000;" /><br style="color:#000000;" /><span style="color:#000000;">May Allah grant us success!

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Warning against traveling to non-Muslim countries and outlining its dangers</b><b>on `Aqidah and manners</b><b> [1]</b></p>
<p style="color:#000000;text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah, Alone. May peace and blessings be upon whom no Prophet shall come after, our Prophet Muhammad and upon his family, Companions, and followers till the Day of Judgment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Exalted be He) has blessed the Muslim nation with many favors, distinguished it with unique characteristics, and made it the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind when it enjoins what is good and forbids what is evil and believes in Allah (Exalted be He). Indeed, the best thing Allah (Exalted be He) bestowed upon it is the Religion of Islam. Allah (Exalted be He) chose Islam as the Shari`ah (revealed teachings and laws) and way of life for His Slaves and completed His Favor upon His Slaves and perfected the religion by Islam. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">He (Exalted be He) says, </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 3" target="_blank" name="Forbiddentoyou(forfood)are:"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion</span></em>.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Ma&#8217;idah, 5: 3</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">However, the enemies of Islam feel envy towards Muslims owing to this great favor and are filled with spite and rage as well as enmity and hatred toward Muslims and Islam. They wish to deprive Muslims of this favor as Allah (Exalted be He) says describing what occurs in their psyches: </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 89" target="_blank" name="TheywishthatyourejectFaith,"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">They wish that you reject Faith, as they have rejected Faith, and thus that you all become equal (like one another)</span></em>.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;, 4: 89</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says: </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 118" target="_blank" name="Oyouwhobelieve!Takenotas"></a><span style="color:#008000;"><em>O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitânah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses) if you understand</em></span>.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <span class="webkit-html-attribute-value" style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 118</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Exalted be He) also says: </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60: 2" target="_blank" name="Shouldtheygaintheupperhand"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">Should they gain the upper hand over you, they would behave to you as enemies, and stretch forth their hands and their tongues against you with evil, and they desire that you should disbelieve. </span></em><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Mumtahanah, 60: 2</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 217" target="_blank" name="Theyaskyouconcerningfighting"></a><em><span style="color:#008000;">And they will never cease fighting you until they turn you back from your religion (Islâmic Monotheism) if they can. </span></em><span style="color:#008000;"><span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 217</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) that speak about the enmity of disbelievers towards Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">However, what I want to refer to here is that the disbelievers exert effort and search every way in order to realize their purposes to damage Muslims. They use numerous ways and many concealed and apparent means in order to reach their evil purposes. Among their ways is what some travel institutions do from time to time such as distributing publications which promote people in this country <strong>to spend summer holidays in</strong></span><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Europe </span><span style="color:#000000;">and</span></strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong> America</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">on the pretext of learning English and they offer inclusive programs for the entire time for the one who travels with them. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The following things are always included in their programs:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">1- Choosing a non-Muslim family with which a student will live in spite of the great risks included in this.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">2- Attending music parties and shows performed in the city where the student lives.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">3- Going to dance and entertainment clubs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">4- Disco dancing with non-Muslim girls and participating in dance competitions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">5- It is mentioned about the entertainment centers in one of the non-Muslim countries that they include the following things: nightclubs, discos, jazz and rock parties, modern music, theaters, cinemas and bars. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">However, these publications aim at many dangerous purposes, such as:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">1- Working towards deviating the Muslim youth and leading them astray.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">2- Spoiling manners and tempting people to commit adultery by making it obtainable.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">3- Filling Muslims with doubts concerning their doctrine.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">4- Developing in the Muslims who go there a sense of admiration and amazement with the culture of non-Muslim countries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">5- Promoting Muslim to adopt many of their bad traditions and customs.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">6- Urging heedlessness towards religion and its morals and teachings.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">7- Utilizing Muslims who go there so that they call others to travel to non-Muslim countries after returning from these journeys and being filled with the thoughts, customs and traditions of the disbelievers.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">There are many other dangerous purposes and objectives that the enemies of Islam strive to achieve like gaining as much power as they could and using various apparent and concealed ways that serve their aims. <strong>These evil-minded people may work under Arabic names and national institutions; conspiring against Muslims, keeping suspicions away from them, and concealing their wicked aims from Islamic countries.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Therefore, I am here to warn my Muslim brothers who are living in this country in particular and in all Muslim countries against being deceived and influenced by these publications and not to respond to them. These publications are nothing but some evil-oriented plans by the enemies of Islam that aim at taking Muslims out of their religion, arousing doubts in them over their doctrine and sowing the seeds of discord among Muslims. Allah (Exalted be He) says about them in His Book, </span><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 120" target="_blank" name="NeverwilltheJewsnortheChristians"></a><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Never will the Jews nor the Christians be pleased with you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) till you follow their religion</em></span>.</span><span style="color:#000000;"> <span style="color:#222222;">Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 120</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Moreover, I direct my <strong>advice to the guardians of students</strong> in particular to take care of their children and not to respond to their requests concerning traveling to non-Muslim countries owing to the expected harms and corruption in religion and manners. Praise be to Allah, we, in our countries, have education in various kinds of sciences which suffice from traveling to foreign countries. There are many places of entertainment in our country that are useful substitutes for theirs. In this way, we can protect our young people from the previously mentioned dangers, troubles, harmful results, and difficulties which are encountered in foreign countries.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">I invoke Allah (Exalted be He) to protect our country and all Muslim countries and our children and Muslims&#8217; children from every evil and harm and to save them from the conspiracies and mischief of our enemies. I supplicate Him to turn their evil plots on them and to guide our rulers and all Muslim rulers to abolish these harmful publications and dangerous reports and to guide them to all that benefits the people and the countries for He is the One Who is Capable of doing so.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">May Allah&#8217;s Peace and blessings be upon His slave and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his family, Companions, and followers till the Day of Judgment.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Ruling on restoration of monuments</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">All praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family and Companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Some newspapers have published articles on reviving and paying attention to monuments, written by some authors, including Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Salih Muhammad Jamal. </span>These articles have been responded to by His Eminence, Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdullah ibn Muhammad ibn Humayd. </span>He efficiently and instructively answered to the claims included therein, may Allah reward him. However, Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Anwar Abul-Jadayil, </span>may Allah guide and inspire him with what is right, was not satisfied with that reply or had not seen it. Therefore, he wrote an article on the subject, published by the &#8216;Madinah&#8217; newspaper, issue number 5448, dated 22/4/1402 A.H. In this article, which is entitled &#8220;The Way of the Two Hijrahs&#8221;, he stated: &#8220;This is a review of the word published in the &#8216;Madinah&#8217; newspaper, issue 5433, on 7/4/1402 A.H., by Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdul-Quddus Al-Ansary, </span>as a commentary on the investigation done by the researcher and man of letters, Professor<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdul-`Aziz Al-Rifa`y, </span>of the sites which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) passed through on his Hijrah (emigration) from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah </span>to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah. </span>It urges us to stimulate officials to set signs indicating such posts such as, for example, two tents as close as possible to the two tents of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Um Ma`bad </span>with whatever else is suitable for the rest of posts, after taking the necessary precautions to prevent any transgression that could impart to them the tinge of sanctity or glory, and any deviation from the requirements of Shari`ah (Islamic law). For, the aim is to inform students, researchers and tourists who want to know about this path and these posts, to perceive the difficulties that the Messenger (peace be upon him) went through during this secret and covert trip.This is meant only to give lesson and example and inure people to hardships in Da`wah (calling people to Allah), following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">However, side roads should be built and paved, off the main roads, with rest houses for the tourists, making it easier for people to enter the places where the Prophet (peace be upon him) passed, starting with<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Hira&#8217; Cave, </span>then<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Thawr, </span>and the place where the Prophet (peace be upon him) was pursued by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Suraqah ibn Malik, </span>until we reach<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Quba&#8217;. </span>This should also include the preceding sites in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah Al-Mukarramah, </span>such as Dar<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Arqam ibn Abul-Arqam, </span>the pass where he and his family were boycotted, the pathway he assumed during the Conquest of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Makkah, </span>and then the places he stopped at in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Abtah, </span>and also in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Hudaybiyah, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Hunayn, </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Badr. </span>This also applies to sites he stopped at in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah, </span>the battlefields of the conquests, and his places of presence in their rural areas, then his path to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Khaybar </span>and to<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Tabuk. </span>This is thus meant to provide people with more information about his unique efforts in spreading the Da`wah, and to teach them to follow the Prophet&#8217;s example in that regard.<strong> [End of quote]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Likewise, Dr.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Faruq Akhdar </span>recommended in his article, published in Al-Jazirah newspaper, issue number 3354, dated 13/1/1402 A.H., the development of archaeological sites in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia by the Muslims on a continuing basis, to ensure income; as he alleged that petrol reserves would run out. Maintaining his viewpoint, he stated<em> &#8220;that Christian religious tourism in the Vatican is one of the main sources of income in Italian economy. Israel sold empty bottles to the Jews in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> America, </span>under the claim that such bottles were full of holy air from Al Quds.&#8221;</em> He also pointed out that among the benefits this will bring about is that it will<em> &#8220;Engrave knowledge about Islam in the minds of Muslim children&#8230;&#8221;</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Due to the <strong>bad effects that reviving religious monuments have on the `Aqidah (creed)</strong>, I wanted to clarify the truth and corroborate the writings of scholars on this issue, cooperate with those scholars in righteousness and Taqwa (fear or wariness of offending Allah), advise people for the Sake of Allah, expose suspicious points, and illustrate supporting evidence. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Hence, I would like to say that taking care of monuments in the way mentioned above <strong>would lead to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship)</strong>. This is because people&#8217;s souls are weak and are prone to cling to that which they deems beneficial. Besides, there are many types of Shirk, which are imperceptible for most people. Hence, those who stop at these monuments &#8211; whether they are real or fake monuments &#8211; will realize that ignorant people wipe themselves with the dirt of these places, and with the trees and stones therein. Those ignorant people also pray there and invoke those to whom the sites are attributed, thinking that this is a means of approaching Allah (Exalted be He), attaining Shafa`ah (intercession), and having theirs distresses relieved. Such an ignorance-based approach is maintained by misleading callers whose souls are impregnated with idolatry, and who exploit these monuments to misguide people and encourage them to visit these monuments in order to acquire some financial gains. Regretfully, there is no one at these monuments to inform people that they are meant only for people to derive an example. Rather, the opposite usually takes place. </span><span id="more-243"></span><br />
<span style="color:#000000;">This is evident to the wise people in some countries that are afflicted with the obsessive attachment to shrines, where people are accustomed to worshipping them besides Allah, and circumambulating them in the same way Muslims circumambulate</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Ka`bah, </span><span style="color:#000000;">on the pretext that people entombed therein are Awliya&#8217; (pious people). So, how far worse would it be if they were told that such monuments are attributed to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), knowing that Satan unremittingly seizes the most suitable times to mislead people, and therefore Allah (Exalted be He) says about him: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Sad, 38: 82" target="_blank" name="Ibl%C3%AEs(Satan)]said:ByYourMight,"></a>[Iblîs (Satan)] said:<em> &#8220;By Your Might, then I will surely mislead them all,</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Sad, 38: 83" target="_blank" name="ExceptYourchosenslavesamongst"></a>&#8220;Except Your chosen slaves amongst them (i.e. faithful, obedient, true believers of Islâmic Monotheism).&#8221;</span></em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> He (Exalted be He) also says about Satan, the enemy of Allah: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 16" target="_blank" name="Ibl%C3%AEs)said:BecauseYouhave"></a>(Iblîs) said:<em> &#8220;Because You have sent me astray, surely I will sit in wait against them (human beings) on Your Straight Path.</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-A&#096;raf, 7: 17" target="_blank" name="ThenIwillcometothemfrombefore"></a>&#8220;<em>Then I will come to them from before them and behind them, from their right and from their left, and You will not find most of them as thankful ones (i.e. they will not be dutiful to You).</em>&#8220;</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Satan deceived Adam (peace be upon him) and caused him to be driven out of Jannah (Paradise), although Allah (Exalted be He) had warned Adam against Satan, and showed him that Satan was his enemy, as</span><span style="color:#000000;">Allah (Exalted be He) says in Surah (chapter) Ta-ha: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 121" target="_blank" name="Thentheybothateofthetree,"></a><em>Thus did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went astray.</em></span><em><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 122" target="_blank" name="ThenhisLordchosehim,andturned"></a>Then his Lord chose him, and turned to him with forgiveness, and gave him guidance.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Another example is the <strong>story of</strong></span><strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Children of Israel </span><span style="color:#000000;">with</span></strong><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"><strong> Al-Samiry</strong> </span><span style="color:#000000;">when he molded for them, out of their possessions, a calf to worship instead of Allah. Then, Satan made this act fair-seeming to them, although it was clearly false. It has been authentically reported in Jami` (Hadith Compilation of)</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Tirmidhy </span><span style="color:#000000;">and others through an authentic Isnad (chain of narrators) from</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Abu Waqid Al-Laythy </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="WewentoutwiththeMessenger"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="10630" class="tip"></span>We went out with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) to Hunayn, when we had just recently left Kufr (disbelief). The Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in worship) had a lote-tree which they would frequent and would hang their swords upon. They called it &#8216;Dhat Anwat&#8217;. When we passed by a lote-tree, we said, &#8216;O Messenger of Allah, assign for us a Dhat Anwat just like the one they have?&#8217; The Messenger (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;Allahu Akbar (Allah is the Most Great)! By the One (Allah) in Whose Hand is my soul, you have said what the Children of Israel said to Musa, &#8216;Make for us a god as they have gods.&#8217; Certainly, you will follow the ways of those who came before you.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Thus, the Prophet (peace be upon him) likened their saying: &#8220;Assign for us a Dhat Anwat just like the one they have&#8221; to that of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the Children of Israel </span><span style="color:#000000;">who said: &#8220;Make for us a god as they have gods.&#8221; This indicates that the meanings and purposes are what count, not merely the words. And due to the gravity of the crime of Shirk and its threats in ruining one&#8217;s work, we find the Khalil (beloved, close elect) of Allah, Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham, peace be upon him), invoke Allah to safeguard him and his children against Shirk. Allah (Exalted be He) says: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Ibrahim, 14: 35" target="_blank" name="And(remember)whenIbr%C3%A2h%C3%AEm(Abraham)"></a>And (remember) when Ibrâhîm (Abraham) said: &#8220;O my Lord!

Hence, they should be warned of it, and all the means leading to it should be blocked.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">No matter how much precautions or reservations the followers of the truth take, this will not protect the ignorant people from the corruptions that result from sanctifying monuments</span>. This is because people differ in terms of their understanding,</span><span style="color:#000000;">vulnerability, and their search for the truth to a great extent, and therefore</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the people of Nuh</span><span style="color:#000000;">(peace be upon him) worshipped Wadd, Suwa`, Yaghuth, Ya`uq and Nasra (these are the names of their idols), although the original purpose of hewing them out was to remind people of the good deeds of those individuals and thus encourage them to emulate these persons, not to idolize or worship them besides Allah. However, Satan misguided those who came after those people who carved such sculptures, and led them to worship these idols instead of Allah. This was the reason of Shirk among the Children of Adam, as was reported by</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Al-Bukhari </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be Merciful with him), in his Sahih.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Regarding</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> </span><span style="color:#000000;">the Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings) of Allah&#8217;s saying: </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Nuh, 71: 23" target="_blank" name="Andtheyhavesaid:%E2%80%98Youshall"></a>&#8220;<em>And they have said: ‘You shall not leave your gods: nor shall you leave Wadd, nor Suwâ‘, nor Yaghûth, nor Ya‘ûq nor Nasr’ (these are the names of their idols)</em>.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> Ibn `Abbas was reported to have said that these are names of righteous men from</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> the <strong>people of Nuh</strong>.</span><span style="color:#000000;">He added that when they perished, Satan inspired their people to set statues in the seats where those righteous men used to sit, and to name the statues after the names of those people. Sure enough, they did it. Then, they were worshipped only after those who had made them perished and knowledge was discarded.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">As for examples from the <strong>practices of the Jews and Christians</strong>, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) ordered us to guard against their ways, because it is the path to aberration and loss. It is impermissible to imitate them in their ways since they contradict our Shari`ah. They were also known for their misguidance, following their own whims, distortion of what was revealed to them through their prophets. Due to these reasons and others, we are forbidden to imitate them or to copy their ways. Consequently, the corruption which would result from restoring and reviving monuments are inescapable, and none other than Allah (Exalted be He) can know the extent and types of their evil consequences. Therefore, it is Wajib (obligatory) to prevent the revival of monuments in order to avoid that which could lead to further corruption. It is known that the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him, and may Allah be pleased with them) were the most knowledgeable people regarding the Religion of Allah, the most loved by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the best to give advice to the slaves of Allah. However, they did not revive or sanctify these monuments, or even advise others to revive them.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Rather, when<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Umar </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) saw some people travel to the tree by which the Companions pledged allegiance to the Prophet (peace be upon him), he orderedthat it be rooted out lest people would idolize it and thus stoop to worshipping it besides Allah. The Muslims thanked him for doing so and considered this as one of his commendable acts (may Allah be pleased with him).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">Moreover, if reviving these monuments or visiting them were a lawful act, the Prophet (peace be upon him) would have done so in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">and after the Hijrah (Prophet&#8217;s migration to Madinah) or ordered people to do so, or his Companions would have either done so themselves or recommended others to do it, knowing that it has been previously mentioned that they were the most knowledgeable among people of the Law of Allah, the most loved by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and the best to give advice to the servants of Allah. It has not been proven that he (peace be upon him) or his Companions visited Hira&#8217; Cave when they were in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Makkah </span><span style="color:#000000;">or in</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;">Thawr Cave. </span><span style="color:#000000;">They did not even do so during the `Umrah (lesser pilgrimage), the Year of Conquest, or the Farewell Pilgrimage. Besides, they did not go to the place of the two tents of</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Um Ma`bad </span><span style="color:#000000;">or the place of the tree of the pledge. Therefore, it became known that visiting these places, and paving the roads which lead to them is a newly-invented practice (in religion), which has no basis in the Law of Allah, and is among the gravest things that lead to major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship that takes the Muslim out of Islam). Since establishing buildings on graves and using them as Masjids (mosques) is one of the gravest matters that lead to Shirk, the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade it, and he cursed the Jews and Christians for making the graves of their prophets places of worship, informing us that anyone who does so is the most evil of creatures.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">In addition, the perfect Shari`ah has indicated the obligation of blocking all verbal and practical means leading to Shirk, and scholars corroborated this with countless proofs. Among these proofs, the scholar</span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:#000000;"> Ibn Al-Qayyim </span><span style="color:#000000;">(may Allah be merciful to him) mentioned in his book [I`lam Al-Muwaqi`in] ninety-nine proofs, all of which prove the obligation of blocking all the means leading to Shirk or to sins. Such proofs include Allah&#8217;s saying:</span><span style="color:#000000;"> </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="color:blue;" title="Surah Al-An&#096;am, 6: 108" target="_blank" name="Andinsultnotthosewhomthey"></a>And insult not those whom they (disbelievers) worship besides Allâh, lest they insult Allâh wrongfully without knowledge.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> And the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): </span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;" name="NoSalah(Prayer)istobeoffered"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;"><span id="24568" class="tip"></span>No Salah (Prayer) is to be offered after the Subh (Morning Prayer) until the sun rises, and no Salah is to be offered after `Asr (Afternoon Prayer) until the sun sets.</span><img style="color:#000000;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="color:#000000;"> This is meant to block the means leading to worship of the sun instead of Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">It is also meant to prevent imitation of those who do such acts. Another mentioned proof is that the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade building Masjids over graves, and cursed those who do so. He (peace be upon him) also forbade the plastering of the graves, venerating them, and taking them as places of worship. Moreover, he forbade facing it in Salah or offering Salah there. Likewise, he (peace be upon him) ordered leveling them (to ground), and forbade that people light lamps on them or travel to them, so that this would not be a pretext to taking them as idols or associating them with Allah in worship. Indeed, this is deemed forbidden for all people, those who idolize them and those who do not mean to do so, in order to block the means leading evil.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">What is Wajib for the Muslim scholars and governors is to follow in the footsteps of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them) in this and other matters. They are also obliged to forbid whatever the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade, and to prevent anything which could lead to Shirk, mischief, sin or idolization of the prophets and the Awliya&#8217; in order to protect Tawhid (monotheism) and block the means leading to Shirk. We ask Allah to mend the affairs of Muslims and grant them comprehension of the religion, and to guide Muslim scholars and governors to that which will bring about their prosperity and salvation in this world and the hereafter. We also ask Allah to guide the Muslim to act upon the Law of Allah in all affairs, and to place all Muslims on His Straight Path. Indeed, He is the Patron, Capable of all things. May the Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon His Servant and His Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, and his family and Companions and those who uprightly follow his guidance until the Day of Judgment.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b>Warning against building Masjids over graves</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="ctl00_RedirectContronl1_lblTitle">Fatwas of Ibn Baz :</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">I was asked: Is it permissible to build a Masjid over the site of the People of the Cave? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Name of Allah, all praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have read the article published in the third edition of the Islamic Sciences League magazine in the &#8220;Muslim News in a Month&#8221; section.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;"><span style="color:#808000;">The Islamic Sciences League, in<span id="ContentParagraph"> The Hashemite Kingdom of <strong>Jordan</strong>, </span>intends to build a Masjid over the site of the cave recently discovered in<span id="ContentParagraph"> the village of Al-Rahib, </span>which is said to be the cave where <span id="ContentParagraph">the People of the Cave </span>mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an slept</span>.</span> End Quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As it is my duty to advise for the sake of Allah and His servants, I thought it would be beneficial to say a word in the same magazine of the Islamic Sciences League published in<span id="ContentParagraph"> the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. </span>I must <strong>admonish</strong> the league to give up the intention of building a Masjid over the site of this cave, mainly and solely for the reason that <strong><span style="color:#000000;">building Masjids over the graves and remains of the Prophets and righteous people is utterly forbidden by the Shari`ah (Islamic law) and that those who do so are cursed</span></strong>. This is because such an act <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>may lead to Shirk</strong></span> (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and <strong><span style="color:#000000;">excessive veneration and over praising of the prophets and pious people</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reality bears witness to the validity of the texts of the Shari`ah and proves that it is revealed from Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), and provides decisive proof of the truthfulness of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the message sent down to him which he conveyed to the Ummah (nation). <span style="color:#ff6600;">Whoever is aware of the conditions that exist in the Islamic world and the acts of Shirk, excessive reverence of prophets and the pious that prevail due to establishing Masjids over shrines and glorifying them by means of lavish structures and the presence of custodians to collect money from people unlawfully, will certainly know that they are avenues leading to Shirk</span>. One of the outstanding virtues of Shari`ah is to forbid building of Masjids over graves and to warn sternly against it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Two Shaykhs,<span id="ContentParagraph"> Al-Bukhari </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph"> Muslim </span>(may Allah be merciful to them), narrated some Hadiths to this effect on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph"> `Aishah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="MayAllahcursetheJewsandthe"></a><span style="color:#339966;"><span id="ContentParagraph">May Allah curse the Jews and the Christians; they have taken the graves of their prophets as places of worship</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">`Aishah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) said: <span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;</span><span style="color:#339966;">He warned against what they did and had it not been for this, his grave would have been raised above the ground but he feared that it would be taken as a Masjid</span><span style="color:#000000;">.&#8221; </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim that <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="UmSalamahandUmHabibah(may"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"> </span><span id="ContentParagraph" style="color:#339966;">Um Salamah and Um Habibah (may Allah be pleased with them) mentioned a church they had seen in Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in which there were pictures. When they told the Prophet (peace be upon him) of this, he said, &#8216;When a pious person among these people died they built a place of worship over his grave and painted these pictures therein. They will be the worst of creation in the Sight of Allah</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related in Sahih<span id="ContentParagraph"> Muslim </span>on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jundub ibn `Abdullah </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) that he heard the Prophet (peace be upon him) five days before his death, stating: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a name="IstandfreeofblamebeforeAllah"></a><span style="color:#339966;"><span id="ContentParagraph"></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths in this regard. Imams of Muslim scholars from the four Madh-habs (Schools of Jurisprudence) and others have stated the prohibition of building Masjids over graves. They issued the sternest warning against doing so, urging Muslims to observe the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and advising this Ummah lest it should fall into the same excessiveness and veneration of the prophets and pious people the way its predecessors from the extremist<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jews </span>and<span id="ContentParagraph"> Christians </span>and their like who deviated from the straight path.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is incumbent upon the Islamic Sciences League in<span id="ContentParagraph"> Jordan </span>and Muslims to adhere to the Sunnah and the way of the righteous Imams, and to be cautious not to commit what Allah and His Messenger warned against. It is the only way that leads to people&#8217;s uprightness and happiness in this world and in the Hereafter. <span style="color:#ff6600;">It should be noted that some people formed their opinions based on the misinterpretation of Allah&#8217;s Statement in the story<span id="ContentParagraph"> of the People of the Cave: </span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Kahf, 18: 21" target="_blank" name="AndthusWemadetheircaseknown"></a>(then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): “We verily shall build a place of worship over them.”<img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this is that Allah (Praised and Exalted be He) informed us about the rulers and prominent people who announced this statement. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He told their story not by of expressing content and agreement with what they said, but rather as a kind of dispraise and expressing abhorrence of their action</strong></span>. This is even indicated by the Messenger (peace be upon him) to whom this Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) was revealed and was the most knowledgeable of its interpretation, for he forbade his Ummah from building Masjids over the graves and cursed and dispraised those who do so.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this had been permissible, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) would not have strongly affirmed its prohibition to the extent of cursing those who did it, or describing them as the worst creatures in the Sight of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). This should be sufficient in pointing out the gravity implied in the matter and providing a convincing answer to those who seek the truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Even if we supposed that building Masjids over graves was permissible for those who preceded us, still we are not permitted to follow their example because the Shari`ah (Islamic law) abrogates all previous laws, and our Prophet (peace be upon him) is the Last of the Messengers and the Shari`ah revealed to him is comprehensive</strong>. He (peace be upon him) forbade building Masjids over graves, and as such, we are not permitted to disobey him. We must follow his example and adhere to his Sunnah and abandon what contradicts it regarding the previous Shari`ahs (Divine laws) and favorable customs followed by some people, because Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah is perfect and comprehensive and no guidance is better than that of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah is the One Whom we invoke to grant all Muslims and us success and to keep us firm on the truth and help us adhere to the Sunnah of His Messenger, Muhammad (peace be upon him) in words and deeds, whether manifested or hidden, and in all our daily affairs until we meet Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). Allah is the All-Hearer, Ever-Near and Responsive. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions and those who follow his guidance until the Day of Resurrection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">The fifth question of Fatwa no. 9527<br />
Q 5: <span style="color:#993300;">How many Rak‘ahs (units of Prayer) are there in Salat-ul-Khusuf (Prayer on a lunar eclipse)? And what is to be recited in them?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">A: Salat-ul-Kusuf (Prayer on a solar eclipse) and Salat-ul-Khusuf (Prayer on a lunar eclipse) are each comprised of two Rak‘ahs (units of Prayer). Recitation in both Salahs (Prayers) is performed out loud. <strong>In each Rak‘ah, there are two Ruku‘s (bowing), the second of which is always shorter than the first, and there are also two recitations</strong>. After the Takbirat-ul-Ihram (saying: &#8220;Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]&#8221; upon starting Prayer), Surah Al-Fatihah and a long Surah are recited. After the first Ruku‘, Surah Al-Fatihah and a long Surah are recited, which is shorter than the preceding recitation. There are two Sujuds (Prostrations) in each Rak‘ah. This is the most authentic report mentioned regarding this Salah.</span></p>
<p>May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!<br />

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>How should Salat-ul-Kusuf be done? </strong><span style="color:#888888;">Fatwas of Ibn Baz &#8211; <a title="Salat-ul-Kusuf (Eclipse Prayer)" href="http://www.alifta.net/fatawa/fatawaDetails.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=2223&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><span style="color:#888888;">alifta.net</span></a></span><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: How should Salat-ul-Kusuf (Prayer on a solar eclipse) and Salat-ul-Khusuf (Prayer on a lunar eclipse) be performed? Is there any difference between them? What is your opinion on the reports published by the papers about the timings of a solar or lunar eclipse?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There are authentic Hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) showed how Salat-ul-Kusuf can be performed. He (peace be upon him) ordered that people should be called to it by announcing<strong> as-salatu jami&#8217;ah &#8220;&#8216;Gather for Salah&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The most authentic reports concerning this Salah show that it consists of<strong> two Rak&#8217;ahs</strong> and that in <strong>each Rak&#8217;ah one should make two recitations and perform two Ruku&#8217; (bowings) and two Sujud (prostrations)</strong>. The person should make lengthy recitation, Ruku&#8217; and Sujud. The first recital and Ruku&#8217; should be longer than the second ones. Similarly, the recitation in the second Rak`ah should be shorter than the second recital in the first Rak`ah. The person should make Ruku&#8217; in the second Rak`ah for a shorter time than the two Ruku&#8217; in the first one. During the second Rak`ah, the person should make a second recital and Ruku&#8217; for a shorter time than the first in the same Rak`ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the two Sujud, it is a Sunnah (recommended) to be lengthy providing that this does not cause any difficulty to the Ma&#8217;mums because this was the Prophet&#8217;s (peace be upon him) way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Upon completing Salah, the Imam, if he is knowledgeable, is allowed to give a <strong>sermon</strong> and tell people that the solar and lunar eclipse are two signs of Allah (Exalted be He) by which He frightens His servants. The Muslims, upon seeing it, are prescribed to offer Salah, remember Allah (Exalted be He), make Du`a&#8217; and Takbir, give in charity and emancipate a believing slave until the end of the eclipse. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;Verily the sun and the moon are two signs among the signs of Allah by which He frightens His servants and they do not eclipse on account of the death or birth of anybody&gt;&gt;</span>. So when you see either of them, observe Prayer, and supplicate Allah (may He be Exalted) till it is cleared from you. Another narration reads, &lt;&lt;<span style="color:#339966;">So whenever you see them, haste to remember Allah, invoke Him and ask Him for forgiveness</span>.&gt;&gt; It is narrated in some Hadith that the person should give in charity and emancipate slaves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#800000;">The astronomical reports about the timing of the eclipse must not be taken as the basis for offering Salat-ul-Kusuf</span>. Some people of knowledge, including Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and his knowledgeable disciple Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allah be merciful with both of them, supported this view saying that the astronomers may sometimes be wrong and then these reports are not reliable and people should not offer Salat-ul-Kusuf depending on them. Rather, they have to offer the Salah upon seeing the eclipse when it is happening.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The publications of the astronomers&#8217; reports about the timing of eclipse should be banned by the Ministry of Information lest some people should be deceived by them. These publications may make people feel less fear upon seeing the eclipse. Allah (Exalted be He) has made them to be frightening and hence, people remember, fear, invoke Allah, and treat their slaves well. May Allah grant us success!</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Eclipse Prayer can be done individually or in congregation</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Do we have to pray Salaatul Khusoof (eclipse prayer) even if we do not witness it? And are there any specific ad&#8217;iyah (pl. duâaa) that we have to say in the day or during the eclipse?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Answer: The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم said: &#8220;The sun and the moon are two signs from the signs of Allaah. They do not eclipse for the death of anyone neither their life (i.e. birth). Allaah uses these to strike fear into His slaves. So when you see them offer the prayer and supplicate until the eclipse passes away.&#8221;[1] If someone establishes that an eclipse is present then he should pray the Eclipse Prayer (Salaatul Khusoof), whether he has to pray it individually or in congregation and similarly whether it is a man or a woman. It is performed as described in the Shareeâah (Legislation).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon the Honest Messenger, his family and Companions.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All the implicit and explicit calls to women&#8217;s engagement in men&#8217;s work, which leads to <strong>free intermixing of men and women</strong> under the pretext that it is urgently needed and represents a civilized aspect, is a grave matter that results in fatal consequences. It goes against the texts of Shari`ah (Islamic law) which order women to stay at their houses and carry out their domestic duties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever wants to know the innumerable evil consequences of free intermixing can unbiasedly and impartially observe the societies inflicted with this grave affliction. It is easy to find people expressing their disapproval and grief at women leaving home and subsequent <strong>family breakup</strong>. This is apparent in writings and in the media, as this is the reason behind the destruction of societies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many reliable proofs that prohibit being alone with and looking at an <strong>Ajnabiyyah</strong> (a woman other than a wife or unmarriageable female relatives) and the prohibition of the means that lead to committing what Allah has prohibited. All these indications prove the prohibition of mixing between the two sexes as this leads to evil consequences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Letting a woman leave her house; her kingdom and proper place, is against her <strong>Fitrah</strong> (natural disposition) and the nature created in her by Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Calling women to engage in men&#8217;s work has dangerous effects on the Islamic society. Among these dangerous effects is the<strong> free intermixing of men and women, which is considered one of the greatest means to adultery that destroys the morals and values of society.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) created women with a physique completely different from men, so that women will be able to carry out domestic affairs as well as other feminine duties.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When a woman engages in men&#8217;s work, this is considered <strong>against her physique and nature</strong>. It is a grave crime against women, for it <strong>destroys her character</strong>. The <strong>effect continues to her children</strong>, as they lose love and compassion. This is because no one can perform the role of a mother who, when she dismisses herself from her kingdom, she cannot find rest, stability, or tranquility elsewhere. The reality of these societies is the best example.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam entrusted the two spouses with different duties and each has to undertake their responsibilities to help build up their community both inside and outside home.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A man&#8217;s role is to earn livelihood and support his family financially while a woman&#8217;s role is to raise and love children and show compassion toward them. This is in addition to nursing, breastfeeding, teaching children, administrating female schools, treating women medically, as well as other duties proper for women. <span style="color:#993300;">Abandoning the domestic duties destroys the whole family and, eventually, the society becomes an empty entity, a form without reality or substance</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means</span>.(Surah an-Nisa 4:34).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is Allah&#8217;s Law upon His creation that guardianship is the duty of man who supports the woman financially as mentioned in the previous Ayah. Allah has ordered women to stay in their houses and forbidden them from free intermixing with Ajanib (men other than a husband or permanently unmarriageable male relatives) in the same place, such as in work, markets, trips, and traveling. Women&#8217;s engagement in men&#8217;s work will lead to committing what Allah has prohibited and disobeying Allah&#8217;s Orders and neglecting the legal duties a Muslim woman has to perform.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Free intermixing of men and women and the means leading to it are prohibited by the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And stay in your houses, and do not display yourselves like that of the times of ignorance, and perform As-Salât (Iqamât-as-Salât), and give Zakât and obey Allâh and His Messenger. Allâh wishes only to remove Ar-Rijs (evil deeds and sins) from you, O members of the family (of the Prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم), and to purify you with a thorough purification. And remember (O you the members of the Prophet’s family, the Graces of your Lord), that which is recited in your houses of the Verses of Allâh and Al-Hikmah (i.e. Prophet’s Sunnah &#8211; legal ways, so give your thanks to Allâh and glorify His Praises for this Qur’ân and the Sunnah ). Verily, Allâh is Ever Most Courteous, Well-Acquainted with all things</span>.&#8221; (Surah Al-Ahzaab 33:33-34)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has ordered the Mothers of the Believers (the Prophet&#8217;s wives, may Allah be pleased with them) and all the Muslim believing women to stay in their houses to protect and keep them away from the means of evil. When a woman leaves her house without necessity, this may lead to <strong>Tabarruj</strong> (woman&#8217;s public display of her adornment or charms) in addition to other evils. Allah has ordered women to perform good deeds that protect them, such as Salah (Prayer), Zakah (obligatory charity), and obeying Allah and His Messenger, which protect them from wrongdoing. Then He (Exalted be He) directed them to what benefits them in this worldly life and in the Hereafter, such as reciting the Qur&#8217;an and studying the Hadith frequently, as they both purify the hearts and guide them to the Truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">O Prophet! Tell your wives and your daughters and the women of the believers to draw their cloaks (veils) all over their bodies (i.e. screen themselves completely except the eyes or one eye to see the way). That will be better, that they should be known (as free respectable women) so as not to be annoyed. And Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.</span> (Surah Al-Ahzaab 33:59)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah has ordered His Prophet (peace be upon him) to inform his wives, daughters, and the believing womento cover their bodies completely when they leave their houses when necessary to escape the harm of people with weak faith. How about working in the same places, free intermixing, expressing her demands to them, relinquishing her femininity and losing her shyness so that harmony is achieved between the two sexes who are different in form and content.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;">Tell the believing men to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts). That is purer for them. Verily, Allâh is All-Aware of what they do. And tell the believing women to lower their gaze (from looking at forbidden things), and protect their private parts (from illegal sexual acts) and not to show off their adornment except only that which is apparent (like both eyes for necessity to see the way, or outer palms of hands or one eye or dress like veil, gloves, head-cover, apron, etc.), and to draw their veils all over Juyûbihinna (i.e. their bodies, faces, necks and bosoms) <span style="color:#000000;">(Surah Al-Noor 24:30-31)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:just ify;">Allah orders His Prophet (peace be upon him) to inform the believing men and women to lower their gaze and abstain from committing illicit sexual acts. Allah (Glorified be He) emphasizes the merit of this value. It is known that guarding one&#8217;s private parts can be realized through <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>avoiding the means</strong> </span>that lead to committing adultery. Undoubtedly, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>gazing and free intermixing</strong></span> of men and women in workplaces are dangerous means that lead to committing adultery. A believer cannot fulfill those two requirements while working with an Ajnabiyyah in the same place. It is impossible for the two sexes to lower their gaze, guard their private parts, and purify their soul while working in the same place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah commands the believing women to lower their gaze, guard their private parts, and not show their beauty and adornments. He also orders them to wear Khimar (veil covering to the waist) to cover their heads and faces. How can they lower their gaze, guard their private parts, and not show their beauty and adornments when women work and intermix freely with men at the workplace? Free intermixing of men and women could certainly lead to committing these forbidden acts. How can a Muslim woman lower her gaze while walking with an Ajnaby (a man other than a husband or unmarriageable male relatives) side by side on the plea of being a workmate or that she is equal to him?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam has prohibited all the means that lead to committing prohibited acts. It also prohibited for women to soften their speech while talking to men as this might stir the desires of men with weak faith. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;">O wives of the Prophet! You are not like any other women. If you keep your duty (to Allâh), then be not soft in speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease (of hypocrisy, or evil desire for adultery) should be moved with desire.</span> (Surah al-Ahzaab 33:32)How can this be prevented in an atmosphere where men and women freely intermix?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Undoubtedly, if a woman works with men in the same place, they will exchange talks and soften their speech</strong>. Satan will beautify their deeds and invite them to commit adultery. Allah, All-Wise and All-Knowing, orders women to wear Hijab (veil), for people vary; some are good and some are bad, some are virtuous and some are indecent. By Allah&#8217;s will, Hijab prevents Fitnah (temptation), blocks its means, keeps men and women&#8217;s hearts pure, and shuns suspicions. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: A<span style="color:#008000;">nd when you ask (his wives) for anything you want, ask them from behind a screen: that is purer for your hearts and for their hearts. </span>(Surah al-Ahzaab 33:53)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The best Hijab for women after covering her face is to stay in her house. Islam forbids a woman to intermix freely with Ajnaby men so that she may not be exposed to Fitnah in a direct or an indirect way. It orders her to stay in her house and not leave it without necessity. If a woman leaves her house, she should adhere to the etiquettes of Shari`ah. Allah even called this act of staying in the house as &#8216;<strong>Qarar</strong>&#8216;, i.e. settlement, stay, and composure, to convey the meaning of stability and heart-rest. This is a refined meaning as when a woman stays in her house, her soul becomes stable, feels peace at heart, and has self-assurance. On the contrary, when she goes out of her house, she feels uneasy, irritated, and tense and she may be exposed to evil consequences. Islam forbids Khulwah (being alone with a member of the opposite sex) with an Ajnabiyyah woman without a Mahram (spouse or permanently unmarriageable relative). She should not travel without a Mahram. This is to block the means to corruption, cut off the means that lead to evil, and protect the two sexes from the intrigues of Satan. It was authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I am not leaving behind me any trial more harmful to men than women</strong></span>. And: So beware of (getting infatuated by) this world and women. The first trial of the Children of Israel was due to women.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some advocates of free intermixing of men and women take the superficial meanings of some legal texts to support their claims. However, these legal proofs may only be explored and understood by those whom Allah granted deep understanding of religion. Those who can collect the relevant texts to each other and deal with them all together. For example, they may argue that some women used to go out with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in some battles. In reply, these women accompanied their Mahrams. They went out for many interests, which will not lead to corruption for their faith and Taqwa (fear/wariness of offending Allah), and their Mahrams used to look after them. They were also wearing Hijab unlike women of the present time. It is evident that the case of women going out to work is completely different from the case of the female Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet). It is not appropriate to make an analogy between the two cases as it is not completely corresponding. What is the meaning derived by the Salaf (righteous predecessors) who were the most knowledgeable people in the meanings of the legal texts and their application? What are the statements traced to them in this regard? Did they call for working in the fields that are for men? Did they call for free intermixing of men and women? On the contrary, they understood that those were only special cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Examining the Islamic conquests and the battles unveils that this phenomenon was not there throughout history. As for those who call for women to join the armed forces and fight in battles like men, this is just a call to corrupt the morals of the soldiers in the name of entertainment. Its man&#8217;s nature to incline, feel at ease with, and like to talk with women when being in Khulwah. It is better to block the means that lead to Fitnah than regretting it in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam is keen to bring the benefits and ward off and block the means to corruption. Free intermixing of men and women in the workplace plays a major role in the deterioration and the corruption of nations. It is known that among the reasons behind the fall of the Roman and the Greek civilizations was women&#8217;s engagement in the fields of men that led to men&#8217;s corruption and abandoning the acts that should lead to the prosperity of their nations. <strong>Women&#8217;s work will lead to the unemployment of men, deterioration of the nation, family disorders, and decline of morals</strong>. It also contradicts what Allah has mentioned with regard to men&#8217;s domestic authority over women. Islam is keen to protect women from all that is against her nature. Islam has prohibited her to rule a country or hold the position of a judge. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <strong>Never will succeed such a people who place a woman in charge of their affairs</strong>. (Related by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih) Allowing women to work in the fields of men is against her happiness and stability. Islam forbids women to work in fields that do not befit her. It is proven, especially in societies where the two sexes intermix freely, that men and women are not naturally equivalent. It is clear in the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah that both sexes are different in nature and duties. Those who call for equality between the two sexes; the females who are brought up in adornments and inclined to peaceful life, and males, are ignorant or intentionally ignore the basic differences between them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have mentioned many Shari`ah texts that prove the prohibition of free intermixing of men and women and women&#8217;s engagement in jobs that do not befit her. Howe</p>
<p>ver, some people might benefit from statements by Eastern and Western intellectuals more than the Qur&#8217;an, the sayings of the Messenger (peace be upon him), and Muslim scholars. Therefore, it is more useful to cite the confessions of the intellectuals in the East and the West concerning the negative effects of free intermixing, so the opponents may be convinced and learn that the teachings of Islam are for the protection of women.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">English writer Lady Cook said that men like and prefer a mixed environment. And thus women are lured to something that conflicts with their human nature. The greater the co-ed. Environment (between male and female), the more illegitimate children the society will have. This is the greatest disaster, she said, urging people to learn women that men are luring.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The philosopher Schopenhauer said, &#8220;Hence, with that absurd arrangement which allows them to share the rank and title of their husbands, they are a constant stimulus to his ignoble ambitions. And, furthermore, it is just because they are Philistines that modern society, where they take the lead and set the tone, is in such a bad way.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lord Byron said, &#8220;Thought of the state of women under the ancient Greeks &#8211; convenient enough. Present state, a remnant of the barbarism of the chivalric and the feudal ages &#8211; artificial and unnatural. They ought to mind home &#8211; and be well fed and clothed but not mixed in society.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The British writer Samuel Smiles said, &#8220;The system that has required women to work in factories and industrial areas, regardless of the national wealth it brings, has destroyed the family life. It has attacked, in fact, the basic structure and foundations of the home and destroyed the essential pillars of the family. It has cut and destroyed social ties as well.Stripping the wife from her husband, and depriving children of their rights of proper, tender and maternal care, has resulted in lower moral values for the women. The real job and profession of a woman is to raise a good, sound and moral family. She is mainly required to take care of household responsibilities, home economics and other domestic needs. Work in factories has stripped the woman, as we pointed earlier, of all these responsibilities which changed the looks and the realities of the inner home. Children, as well, were often neglected and raised with no sound standards. The love and affection between a husband and wife were somewhat extinguished. The woman was no longer the sought after, wanted, admired and loved by man, after he got used to seeing her in the factory next to him doing the same thing he does. Women came under many influences and pressures that changed her mentality and thinking pattern on which moral values and virtues were established.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An American professor called Adeline said that the reason for family crises in the United States and the increase in the crime rate is because a woman has abandoned her house in order to double the family&#8217;s income. The income increased but the morals declined. She added that woman&#8217;s return to her house is the only way to save the new generations from deterioration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Congressman said a woman can truly serve her country if she stays at her house which is the essence of a family.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Another Congressman said when Allah granted women the ability to produce children, He made it her duty to stay in her house to take care of children and not leave them to work outside her house.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">German philosopher Schopenhauer also said, &#8220;Grant woman total and absolute freedom for one year only, and check with me after that to see the results of such freedom. Do not forget that you (all), along with me, will feel sad at the loss of virtue, chastity and good morals. If I die (before then) you are free to say either: &#8220;He was wrong!&#8221; or &#8220;He hit the heart of the truth!&#8221; These quotations were mentioned by Dr. Mustafa Husny Al-Siba`y (may Allah be merciful to him) in his book &#8216;Al-Mar&#8217;ah bayn Al-Fiqh wa Al-Qanun.&#8217;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following and gathering the numerous sayings of the unbiased Western writers on the disadvantages of free intermixing of men and women that followed after women&#8217;s participation with men at work may form volumes. However, the above quotations are enough.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In conclusion, it is better for a woman to stay in her house and carry out her domestic duties after performing her religious obligations as it is suitable for her natural dispositions. It is for the sake of her welfare as well as that of society and the youth. She may spend her spare time in fields that are for women, such as teaching, curing, and nursing women. Thus, they cooperate with men in developing society but each in one&#8217;s field. We are not to forget the role of the Mothers of the Believers and those who followed in their footsteps in teaching, directing, guiding the nation, and conveying the Message of Allah (Glorified be He) from His Messenger (peace be upon him). May Allah reward them the best! There are many Muslim women who are following in their footsteps while wearing Hijab and staying away from free intermixing with men in their workplaces.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah help us carry out our duties in the best manner that pleases Him and protect us all from the means to Fitnah and Satanic tricks. He is the Most Generous. May the peace and blessings of Allah be upon His servant and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and his Companions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family, his Companions, and those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>There is, in the present time, a tradition in many Islamic countries that when a king or a leader dies, people must mourn for three days or more or less. Flags are lowered at half-mast and the State departments stop working. </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly, these acts go against Shari`ah (Islamic law) and entail <strong>imitation of the enemies of Islam</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Authentic Hadiths related from the Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibit and warn people, except a <strong>wife</strong>, against mourning. The maximum period of mourning for a woman is four months and ten days, if the deceased is her husband, and three days or less for relatives. The other practices done during mourning a deceased person, whether a king or a leader, are prohibited in Shari`ah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During the lifetime of the Prophet (peace be upon him), his son Ibrahim, his three daughters and others died, but he (peace be upon him) did not mourn them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The leaders who joined the Battle of Mu&#8217;tah, including Zayd ibn Harithah, Ja`far ibn Abu Talib and `Abdullah ibn Rawahah (may Allah be pleased with them) were killed during the Prophet&#8217;s era but he (peace be upon him) did not mourn them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) did not mourn the death of the Prophet (peace be upon him), the best of creation and prophets, nor did they mourn Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him), the best of Sahabah and creation after the prophets. When `Umar, `Uthman and `Aly (may Allah be pleased with them), the best creation after the prophets and Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, were killed, no one mourned them. The same was true with all the Sahabah and the Imams of Islam and guidance of Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) and the next generation including Sa`id ibn Al-Musayyib, `Aly ibn Al-Husayn Zayn Al-`Abidin, his son Muhammad ibn `Aly, `Umar ibn `Abdul-`Aziz,Al-Zuhry, Imam Abu Hanifah, his two companions, Imam Malik ibn Anas, Al-Awza`y, Al-Thawry, Imam Al-Shafi`y, Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, and Is-haq ibn Rahawayh and many others. No Muslim mourned those people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>If this (mourning) were good, the Salaf (righteous predecessors) would have done it. All goodness lies in following them and evil lies in opposing them. Therefore, the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) affirmed that what the Salaf did concerning avoiding mourning any person except for a dead husband, is the right action.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The mourning practiced nowadays for the death of kings and leaders is unacceptable in Islam. These practices entail <strong>imitating the enemies of Islam and result in much harm, such as suspension of public services</strong>. Consequently, the Muslim authorities and rulers must abandon these acts of mourning and follow the conduct of the Salaf.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the people of knowledge have to warn and inform Muslims about the ruling on these acts as they are obliged to advise people and cooperate in righteousness and piety.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I, therefore, for the sake of Allah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) and all Muslims, Imams and ordinary people, find it necessary to write this brief statement. I ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to grant Muslim rulers and subjects success to do what pleases Him and to follow Shari`ah and warn against opposing it. May Allah purify our hearts and deeds for He is the All-Hearer of supplication, the Ever-Near. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><p>Sahih Bukhari : &#8220;Book of Menses&#8221;: No. 311  &#8211; Narrated Um-&#8216;Atiya:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We were forbidden to mourn for a dead person for more than three days except in the case of a husband for whom mourning was allowed for four months and ten days. (During that time) we were <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>not allowed to put kohl</strong></span> (antimony eye powder) in our eyes or to <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>use perfumes</strong></span> or to put on <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>colored clothes</strong></span> except a dress made of &#8216;Asb (a kind of Yemen cloth, very coarse and rough). We were allowed very light perfumes at the time of taking a bath after menses and also we were <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">forbidden to go with the funeral procession</span>. </strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Ruling On Taswir (Painting, Drawing, Sculpture, Photography) Of Any Being With A Soul</strong> </span><br />
Fatwas of Shaikh Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on Taswir (painting, drawing, sculpture, and photography), that is widely common among people? Would you please give us a comprehensive answer about lawful and unlawful Taswir? May Allah reward you!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise is due to Allah alone. Peace be upon the Last Prophet!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadith reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in Sahih (authentic) books of Hadith, Musnad (Hadith compilation), and Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) indicating the <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>prohibition of Taswir of any being with a soul, whether human or not</strong></span>. These texts urge defacing pictures and curse <strong>Musawwirs</strong> (those who make pictures and statues, or photographs of living beings), indicating that they will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following are some of the Sahih Hadith that were reported in this regard. We will cite the scholars&#8217; comments on them and explain the correct opinion concerning this matter In sha’a-Allah (if Allah wills).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhary and Muslim) on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) informed us that Allah (Exalted be He) stated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Who can be more unjust than one who tries to create a creation like Mine. Let them create an atom, a grain of wheat, or a grain of barley</span></em>. This wording reported by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Two Sahih, it is related on the authority of Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be the Musawwirs<strong>.</strong></span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also related in the same books of Hadith on the authority of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with both of them) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Those whomake siwar (pictures, images, statues) will be punished on the Day of Resurrection and it will be said to them: Breathe soul into what you have created</span></em>. This wording is reported by Al-Bukhari.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Al-Bukhari related in the Sahih on the authority of Abu Juhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him): <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade taking payment for blood, a dog, and the earnings of a prostitute. He cursed those who accept or pay Riba (usury/interest), a woman who tattoos others or gets herself tattooed, and the Musawwir.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with both of them) that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saying: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Whoever makes a sura (picture, icon, idol, etc.) in the world will be asked to breathe soul into it (on the Day of Resurrection), but they will not be able to breathe soul (into it).</span></em> (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhary and Muslim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related by Muslim that Sa`id ibn Abu Al-Hasan said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#0000ff;">A man came to Ibn `Abbas and said: I make suras, so tell me about (the ruling on) this. Ibn `Abbas said: Come closer to me. The man did. Ibn `Abbas asked him to come closer again and the man did and he put his hand on the man&#8217;s head and said: I will tell you what I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saying. I heard him saying: Every Musawwir will enter the Fire and a soul will be given to every sura they made so that it would torment them in the Fire. He added: If you have to do this (go on in this profession), then make suras of trees and everything that does not have a soul.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The statement &#8220;If you have to do this&#8230;&#8221; was related by Al-Bukhari in the aforementioned Hadith related by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, it was related by Al-Tirmidhy in his Jami` Book of Hadith on the authority of Abu Al-Zubayr from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him): <span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade having suras in the home and forbade the making of them</em>.</span> He commented that it was a Hadith Hasan Sahih (a valid and authentic Hadith).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who narrated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came to me, and I had screened my alcove with a curtain on which there were suras. When he saw it, he tore it up and the color of his face changed [due to anger] and he said, &#8220;O `Aishah! The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who imitate Allah&#8217;s Creation.&#8221; `Aishah added: So we tore it up and we stuffed a cushion or two with it.</span></em> (Related by Muslim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) who narrated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) returned from a journey and I had covered my alcove with a curtain on which there were suras. No sooner did he see it than he tore it up and said: Those who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who imitate Allah&#8217;s Creation. She said: Thus, we turned it (i.e. The curtain) into one or two cushions.</span></em> (Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). Muslim added, &#8220;his face changed&#8221; after &#8220;he tore it up&#8221;)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">She also narrated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) returned from a journey and I had hung a thick curtain having suras. He ordered me to remove it and I did.</span></em> (Related by Al-Bukhari). Imam Muslim also related it with the following wording: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">I had screened my door with a thick curtain having suras of winged horses. He ordered me to remove it and I did.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Al-Qasim ibn Muhammad from `Aishah who narrated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">I bought a cushion with suras on it. When Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) saw it, he kept standing at the door and did not enter the house. I noticed the sign of disgust on his face, so I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Messenger! I repent to Allah and to His Messenger. (Please let me know) what sin I have done.&#8221; He (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;What about this cushion?&#8221; I replied, &#8220;I bought it for you to sit and recline on.&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Messenger (peace be upon him) said, &#8220;The makers of these suras will be punished on the Day of Resurrection. It will be said to them, &#8216;Breathe life into what you have created.'&#8221; He (peace be upon him) added, &#8220;Angels do not enter a house where there are suras.&#8221;</span></em> (Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). Muslim added from Ibn Al-Majishun that `Aishah said: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;I took it and turned it into two pillows on which he used to recline at home.&#8221;)</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from Ibn `Abbas (may Allah be pleased with both of them) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a sura.</span></em> (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhary and Muslim). This wording is reported by Muslim).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related by Muslim on the authority of Zayd ibn Khalid from Abu Talhah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a statue.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[It is also reported] in Sahih Al-Bukhari from Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;Jibril said: We do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a sura.&#8221;</span></em> The same Hadith was related by Muslim on the authority of `Aishah and Maymunah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Muslim related on the authority of Abu Al-Hayyaj Al-Asady who said: `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him) said to me: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Shall I not order you of the same thing which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) ordered me; leave no sura unspoiled and leave no outstanding grave unleveled</span></em>. It is related by Abu Dawud with a good Sanad (chain of narration) on the authority of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">ordered `Umar ibn Al-Khattab during the time of the Conquest of Makkah while he was in Al-Bat-ha&#8217; to go to the Ka`bah and efface every sura in it.</span></em> The Prophet (peace be upon him) only entered it when all suras were effaced.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, Abu Dawud Al-Tayalisy related in his Musnad on the authority of Usamah who said: I went to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in the Ka`bah and he saw suras. He, thus, ordered to bring him a bucket of water and when I did, he began erasing them, saying: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">May Allah fight those who make Taswir of what they are not able to create.</span></em> Al-Hafizh said: Its Sanad (chain of narrators) is good.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: `Umar ibn Shabbah related from `Abdul-Rahman ibn Mahran from `Umayr, the freed slave of Ibn `Abbas, from Usamah that: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) entered the Ka`bah and ordered me to bring him some water in a bucket. He wet his garment and beat the suras with it, saying: May Allah fight those who make Taswir of what they are not able to create.</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Al-Bukhari related in his Sahih on the authority of `Aishah that she narrated: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) never left in his house anything bearing crosses on it without obliterating it.</span></em> The same Hadith was narrated by Al-Kushmihany using the term <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;Tasawir (i.e. Pictures) instead of crosses</span></em>. Imam Al-Bukhari (may Allah be merciful to him) entitled a chapter in his collection of Hadith: <strong>&#8220;Obliterating Suras&#8221;</strong> where he related this Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Two Sahih Books of Hadith, it is related on the authority of Busr ibn Sa`id from Zayd ibn Khalid from Abu Talhah that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: <span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>Angels do not enter a house in which there is a sura</em></span>. Busr said, &#8220;Zayd then fell ill and we went to visit him but there was a curtain with a sura hanging at his door. I said to `Ubaydullah Al-Khawlany: the stepson of Maymunah &#8211; the wife of the Prophet (peace be upon him): Did not Zayd tell us about (the ruling on) suras the day before? `Ubaydullah said: Did you not hear when he said: Except a design in a cloth.&#8221; In the Two Sahih, it is related on the authority of `Amr ibn Al-Harith from Bukayr Al-Ashaj from Busr that he said, &#8220;I said to `UbaydullahAl-Khawlani: Did he not tell us about (the ruling on) suras? He said: He said, &#8220;Except a design in a cloth. Did you not hear him?&#8221; I said: No and he said: He said, &#8220;He indeed did say that.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is related in the Musnad and Sunan Al-Nasa&#8217;y on the authority of `Ubaydullah ibn `Abdullah who narrated that he went to Abu Talhah Al-Ansary to visit him during his illness and found Sahl ibn Hunayf with him. Abu Talhah asked someone to remove a rug on the floor. Sahl asked: Why do you (want to) remove it? He replied: Because it includes suras and I know what the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said about them (suras &#8211; i.e. the ruling on them). He said: Did he not say: &#8220;Except a design in a cloth&#8221;. He said, &#8220;Yes, but this is more comfortable for me.&#8221; The Sanad of this Hadith is valid. Al-Tirmidhy related it in the same wording and commented, &#8216;It is a Sahih Hasan Hadith.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy, and Al-Nasa&#8217;y related with a good Sanad on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Jibril came to me and said: ‘I came to you yesterday and nothing prevented me from entering except that there were statues by your door, there was a curtain in your house with suras on it, and there was a dog in the house. Tell someone to cut off the head of the statue by your door, so it will look like a tree; tell someone to tear up the curtain and make it into floor-cushions that will be stepped on; and tell someone to put the dog outside.’</span> </em>The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) did that. The dog belonged to Al-Hasan or Al-Husayn and was under their couch. The Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered that it would be taken outside the house. This is the wording of Abu Dawud and a similar wording was reported by Al-Tirmidhy. The following is the wording of Al-Nasa&#8217;y: Jibril asked the Prophet&#8217;s permission to enter his house whereupon the Prophet said, &#8220;Get in,&#8221; but Jibril replied, <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;How could I enter your house and there is a curtain on which there are suras? Either you cut off their heads or make it (the curtain) into a cushion spread out so that the people may tread on. We, angels, do not enter a house in which there are suras.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other Hadith conveying the same meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These Hadith and those which are similar in meaning evidently indicate that Taswir of any being with a soul is prohibited and is one of the major sins entailing the threat of punishment in the Fire.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>This prohibition is applicable to all forms of Taswir, whether the sura has a shadow or not, and whether it is on a wall, a curtain, a garment, a mirror, a paper, etc. This is because the Prophet (peace be upon him) did not differentiate between that which has a shadow and that which has no shadow or between what is drawn on a curtain or not. In fact, he cursed Musawwirs, saying that they will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection and that all of them will enter the Fire, without making any exceptions.</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fact that this prohibition is general is supported by the evidence that when the Prophet (peace be upon him) saw suras on the curtain in the house of `Aishah, he tore it up and the color of his face changed and he said: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The people who will receive the severest punishment on the Day of Resurrection will be those who imitate Allah&#8217;s Creation</span></em>. In another narration, he said when he saw the curtain: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">The makers of these suras will be punished on the Day of Resurrection and it will be said to them: ‘Breathe life into what you have created.&#8217;</span> </em>This narration and similar ones clearly indicate that Musawwirs are included in the general admonishment, whether they make suras on curtains or the like.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for his statement &#8220;except a design in a cloth&#8221; in the Hadith narrated by Abu Talhah and Sahl ibn Hunayf, this is an exception to suras which prevent the entry of angels but not an exception far Taswir as understood by the context of the Hadith. This means that Taswir is only permissible if the design in a cloth or the like is made to be used in a disrespectful fashion, such as the cushion that was made to be sat on as stated in the aforementioned Hadith narrated by `Aishah, in which she tore up the curtain and made it into one or two cushions, and the Hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah in which Jibril said to the Prophet (peace be upon him), &#8220;<em><span style="color:#0000ff;">Tell someone to cut off the head of the statue by your door, so it will look like a tree; tell someone to tear up the curtain and make it into floor-cushions that will be stepped on&#8230;&#8221;</span></em> The Prophet (peace be upon him) did that. It is not permissible to apply this exception to suras in a cloth that is to be hung on a door or a wall or the like because the texts of Hadith narrated by `Aishah in this regard clearly indicate that such curtains is forbidden, and must be removed and torn up as already stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith as narrated by Abu Hurayrah unmistakably means that such curtains prevent the entry of angels unless it is made into something to be treaded on or the head of the statue is cut off so that it takes the shape of a tree. The statements of Prophet (peace be upon him) do not conflict with each other; they confirm the validity of each other.Whenever it is possible to reconcile between various Hadith in a proper manner without any prejudice, it becomes obligatory to do so and to give this precedence over adopting the approach of Tarjih (comparing an opinion with another to choose the most appropriate one) and Naskh (abrogation) as stated in the sciences of Usul-ul-Hadith (principles of Hadith) and Mustalah Al-Hadith (Hadith terminology). Here, it was possible to reconcile between the quoted texts. All praise is due to Allah for this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Al-Fath, Al-Hafizh gave precedence to reconciliation between Hadith in the manner that I have already mentioned. He said, &#8220;Al-Khattaby said: The suras which forbid angels from entering a house are those whose possession is prohibited e.g. The suras of beings with souls whose heads are not cut off or are not treated in a disrespectful manner.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, Al-Khattaby (may Allah be merciful to him) said, <span style="color:#0000ff;">&#8220;In fact, the punishment of a Musawwir is made severe because suras were worshipped besides Allah. Furthermore, looking at them may become a sort of Fitnah (temptation) and some souls might be attached to them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Nawawy (may Allah be merciful to him) stated the following in Sharh Muslim, &#8220;Chapter: The prohibition of Taswir of animate beings and the prohibition of possessing that which has a sura un-trodden in a carpet or the like. In fact, the angels do not enter a house in which there is a sura or a dog&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Our companions and other scholars commented: Taswir of animate beings is extremely prohibited and is a major sin, because severe warnings are made against the Musawwir in the Hadith; whether they make suras to be used in a disrespectful fashion or for other purposes, this profession is prohibited in all cases, because it implies that one is trying to match the Creation of Allah (Exalted be He). There is no difference whether the sura is in a cloth, carpet, coin, vessel, wall or whatever. With regard to making Taswir of trees and camel saddlebags and other inanimate beings, this is not prohibited.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is the ruling on Taswir. As for making Taswir of animate beings, this is prohibited if the suras are to be hung on a wall or worn as clothing or a turban or what is similar to that of things that are not considered to be in a state of degradation or disrespect. On the other hand, if suras are made on carpets, cushions, or similar articles to be used in a disrespectful fashion, it is not prohibited to possess them. There is no difference (in the prohibition) between that which has a shadow and that which has no shadow.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This is our own opinion on this issue and the opinion of Jumhur (dominant majority of scholars) from among the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), the Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet), and those who came after them. It is also the opinion of Al-Thawry, Malik, Abu Hanifah, and others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Some of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) believed that suras which are prohibited are only those which cast a shadow and that there is no harm in the suras which do not cast a shadow. However, this is an invalid opinion because the curtain that the Prophet (peace be upon him) disapproved was undoubtedly disrespected and the sura did not cast a shadow. This is in addition to the general and inclusive Hadith [forbidding] all kinds of Taswir.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After summarizing the opinion of Al-Nawawy, Al-Hafizh said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The opinion that the prohibition of Taswir is general, including that which casts a shadow and that which has no shadow, is supported by the Hadith related by Ahmad on the authority of `Aly (may Allah be pleased with him) who narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: <span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>Anyone of you who goes to Al-Madinah must not leave there any idol without breaking it up nor any sura without obliterating it.</em></span> In another narration, the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: <span style="color:#0000ff;"><em>Whoever returns to make these things (suras) has disbelieved in what was revealed to Muhammad (peace be upon him).</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever looks closely at the previously quoted Hadith will notice that they denote that the prohibition of Taswir is general and inclusive of that which has a shadow and that which has no shadow &#8211; as already explained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It may be claimed that the Hadith narrated by Zayd ibn Khalid from Abu Talhah that Busr ibn Sa`id, the narrator from Zayd, said: &#8220;Zayd then fell ill and we went to visit him but there was a curtain with a sura hanging at his door&#8221; apparently denotes that Zayd believed in the permissibility of hanging curtains including suras.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The answer to this claim is that the aforementioned Hadith narrated by `Aishah and other Hadith conveying the same meaning all serve as evidence on the prohibition of hanging curtains that include suras, the obligation of tearing them up, and the fact that they prohibit the entry of angels. If the Hadith reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) are Sahih (authentic), it is not permissible to contradict them because of a saying or action of any person, whoever they may be. Likewise, believers are obligated to follow these Hadith, hold fast to that which they indicate, and reject whatever contradicts them. Allah (Exalted be He) states: And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it). Allah (Exalted be He) also says: Say: &#8220;Obey Allâh and obey the Messenger, but if you turn away, he (Messenger Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) is only responsible for the duty placed on him (i.e. to convey Allâh’s Message) and you for that placed on you. If you obey him, you shall be on the right guidance. The Messenger’s duty is only to convey (the message) in a clear way (i.e. to preach in a plain way).&#8221; Allah (Glorified be He) has, thus, guaranteed the guidance of those who obey the Messenger (peace be upon him). Allah (Exalted be He) states: And let those who oppose the Messenger’s (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah &#8211; legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant) should befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Perhaps Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) was not aware of the sura which was on the curtain or did not hear about the Hadith on the prohibition of hanging curtains including suras and, thus, his action followed the apparent meaning of the statement of the Prophet &#8220;except a design in a cloth&#8221;. Therefore, he would be free from blame for not having knowledge of the Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for those who know the Sahih Hadith indicating the prohibition of hanging curtains including suras, there is no excuse for them. Whoever contradicts Sahih Hadith in order to follow their whims or to blindly follow others will necessarily deserve the Anger of their Lord and may be tried with deviation and Fitnah of the heart. Allah (Glorified be He) states: And let those who oppose the Messenger’s (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah &#8211; legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant) should befall them</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Exalted be He) says: <em><span style="color:#008000;">So when they turned away (from the Path of Allâh), Allâh turned their hearts away (from the Right Path)</span>.</em> Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <em><span style="color:#008000;">So He punished them by putting hypocrisy into their hearts</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The aforementioned Hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah indicates that it is permissible to keep a sura in a house if its head is cut off, because it would then be in the shape of a tree. This proves that it is permissible to make Taswir of trees and any beings which have no souls. This was already mentioned clearly in the narration of the two Sheikhs (Al-Bukhary and Muslim) on the authority of Ibn `Abbas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The quoted Hadith is also a proof that cutting off anything other than the head of the sura such as cutting off the lower half or the like, is not enough to render it permissible to keep or to allow the entry of angels. This is because the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered it to be torn up and efface the suras, saying that they prevent the entry of angels, with the exception of suras that are to be treated in a disrespectful manner or whose heads have been cut off. Thus, whoever has any claim justifying the permissibility of keeping suras at home other than for these two stated reasons must bring evidence supporting their claim from the Qur&#8217;an or the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) informed us that if the head of the sura is cut off, the remainder of it will be like the shape of a tree, this proves that the factor which permits its possession is its being transformed from the shape of beings with souls to a form similar to inanimate beings. If the lower part of the sura is cut off and the head remains, it will not take the shape of a tree because the face still remains. Furthermore, the face has a beauty and uniqueness of creation that is not found in the rest of the body. Hence, it is not permissible for a person who understands the intended meanings of the quoted Nas (Islamic text from the Qur&#8217;an or the Sunnah) to make Qiyas (analogy) between cutting off any other part of the body and cutting off the head.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, it is clear that making Taswir of the head and other parts of the body of animate beings is prohibited because the ruling stated by the aforementioned Sahih Hadith is generally applied and no one is allowed to make exceptions to this general ruling beyond those stated by the Law-Giver.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">There is no difference in this ruling between corporeal suras and others inscribed on curtains, papers, etc. As there is no difference between suras of humans and other beings with souls and the suras of kings, scholars, etc. In fact, the degree of prohibition regarding the suras of kings, scholars, and other influential people is severer, because the Fitnah that might be caused by them is greater. Also, hanging their suras in sitting areas and elsewhere and revering them are of the most dangerous means leading to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and to the worship of such persons along with Allah as happened to the people of Nuh.</span> </strong>Al-Khattaby pointed to this in his statements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">During Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance), there were many suras that people used to revere and worship other than Allah until Allah sent his Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) who destroyed the idols, obliterated the suras, and removed Shirk and its means. Therefore, anyone who makes Taswir or hangs suras and reveres them has imitated the Kafirs (disbelievers) in their actions and opened the door to Shirk and its means for the people. Likewise, any person who orders the making of Taswir and is pleased with it will have the same ruling of a Musawwir in terms of having done something prohibited and being entitled to the threat. This is because the Qur&#8217;an, the Sunnah, and the scholars&#8217; opinions have all decreed that it is prohibited to order something entailing disobedience and to be pleased with acts of disobedience just as it is prohibited to commit such acts. Allah (Exalted be He) states: <em><span style="color:#008000;">And when you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) see those who engage in a false conversation about Our Verses (of the Qur’ân) by mocking at them, stay away from them till they turn to another topic. And if Shaitân (Satan) causes you to forget, then after the remembrance sit not you in the company of those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers).</span></em> Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <em><span style="color:#008000;">And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Qur’ân) that when you hear the Verses of Allâh being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them</span></em>. The Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) indicates that whoever is present while Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) is being committed and does not turn away from it is like those who are doing it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If the one who remains silent about Munkar, although they are able to reject it or to leave the place where Munkar is committed, is like the doer of Munkar but the one who enjoin the Munkar or is pleased with it will be more sinful than the one who remains silent about it and will be more deserving to be like those who actually commit it. There are several evidences conveying the same meaning and can be easily found by whomever seeks them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the light of the Hadith and the scholars&#8217; opinion mentioned above, it is clear that making Taswir of beings with souls that are widely spread in books, magazines, newspapers, and letters, is a plain mistake and an act of disobedience. People must beware of it and warn each other against it; and must make sincere Tawbah (repentance) for what they have done.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, the aforementioned evidence indicates that it is not permissible to keep such suras without cutting off their heads or effacing them unless they are on a carpetor something similar which is treated in a disrespectful manner. In this case only, is it permissible to possess them as already supported by the Hadith narrated by `Aishah and Abu Hurayrah As for toys in the form of beings with souls, scholars have differed about the permissibility of their possession by little girls.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was authentically reported in the Two Sahih Books of Hadith: On the authority of `Aishah who narrated: I used to play with dolls in the presence of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and I had female friends who used to play along with me. They would hide from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) whenever he entered, but he would call them to join and play with me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafizh said in Al-Fath, &#8220;<strong><span style="color:#000000;">This Hadith has been used as a proof for the permissibility of possessing suras of dolls and toys so that young girls may play with them. This has been an exception to the general prohibition of possessing suras</span></strong>. `Iyad confirmed this opinion and reported that it was the same opinion of the Jumhur who permitted the selling of toys for little girls to train them from childhood for household responsibilities and childrearing. He added that some scholars believed that this permissibility was Mansukh (abrogated). Ibn Battal inclined to this opinion. It is reported from Ibn Abu Zayd from Malik that he disliked that a man buys dolls for his daughter. Accordingly, Al-Dawudy was in favor of the opinion that the permissibility was Mansukh.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;However, Ibn Hibban entitled a chapter: Permissibility for young women to play with dolls. Al-Nasa&#8217;y also entitled a chapter: Man&#8217;s permitting his wife to play with dolls. He did not restrict this to childhood, but this opinion is debatable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;After mentioning the Takhrij (referencing) of Hadith, Al-Bayhaqy said, &#8220;The prohibition of possessing suras has been confirmed.&#8221; Thus, the permission given to `Aishah in this matter was perhaps before rendering it as prohibited. The same opinion was held by Ibn Al-Jawzy.&#8221; He went on to say, &#8220;Abu Dawud, and Al-Nasa&#8217;y related another narration on the authority of `Aishah who said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) returned from the Battle of Tabuk or Khaybar&#8230; And he mentioned the Hadith of tearing up the curtain which `Aishah had hung at her door. She said, &#8220;The side of the curtain which was over dolls of `Aishah was uncovered. He (peace be upon him) asked: What is this, O `Aishah? She answered: My dolls. She, then, said: He saw amongst them a two-winged horse tied up. He asked about it and she replied: A horse having two wings. Did not youhear that Sulayman had horses with wings? Upon this, he laughed.&#8221; He continued to say, &#8220;Al-Khattaby said: This Hadith indicates that playing with dolls is not like having amusement with other suras regarding which warnings have been issued. In fact, `Aishah was given the permission to play with dolls, because she had not reached the age of puberty at that time.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I believe that it is questionable to confirm that she had not reached the age of puberty at that time, though it might possibly be so. This is because `Aishah at the time of the Battle of Khaybar was fourteen years old; she was either past the age of fourteen or was approaching it. In the Battle of Tabuk, on the other hand, she definitely had reached the age of puberty. Thus, the strongest opinion is that of those who said it was in the Battle of Khaybar. Reconciliation is to be made with what Al-Khattaby stated because this is better than assuming that the reports are in conflict.&#8221; This is the end of Al-Hafizh&#8217;s quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you have understood what Al-Hafizh (may Allah be merciful to him) mentioned, then it is safer to avoid possession of toys. This is because their lawfulness is doubtful due to the possibility that the Prophet (peace be upon him) might have approved of `Aishah&#8217;s possession of dolls before the order to efface suras was revealed. In such a case, the permission would be considered Mansukh by the Hadith including the order to efface suras except those whose heads are cut off or those which are degraded, as stated by Al-Bayhaqy, Ibn Al-Jawzy, and Ibn Battal. Another possibility is that this permission could be a special exception to the general prohibition, as the Jumhur (dominant majority of scholars) have stated, for the sake of training girls to be mothers and because playing with dolls entails a kind of disrespect. As this possibilities loom and the doubt is there, it is safer to avoid the possession of toys and dolls. In fact, it is better to train girls using non-corporeal toys in order to be safe from the questionable matter regarding the possession of corporeal dolls. In this way, you will be acting according to the following Hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: Leave what causes you doubt and turn to what does not cause you doubt. Also, it is narrated on the authority of Al-Nu`man ibn Bashir &#8211; as related in the Two Sahih Books of Hadith: <em><span style="color:#0000ff;">What is lawful is evident and what is unlawful is evident, and in between them are doubtful matters which many people do not know. Thus, whoever guards against doubtful matters keeps their religion and honor blameless, and whoever indulges in doubtful matters, indulges, in fact, in unlawful matters, just as a shepherd who pastures their animals round a preserve will soon pasture them in it</span></em>. And Allah knows best!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad and his family</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> <span style="color:#008000;">117- Hadith: Anyone who bathes on the Day of ‘Ashura’ will not be sick during that whole year</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">All the Hadiths mentioned in respect of bathing on the Day of ‘Ashura’ (10th of Muharram), wearing Kuhl (antimony powder eyeliner), dying (with Henna), in addition to other acts observed by Ahl-ul-Sunnah (those adhering to the Sunnah) in opposition to the Shiites are <strong>Mawdu‘</strong> (fabricated Hadith) except for those mentioned about Sawm (Fast).</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him) mentioned in &#8220;Al-Fatawa&#8221; volume (4) page (513) what reads:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Some people among those who claim themselves as followers of the Sunnah narrated many Hadith Mawdu‘ on which they based what they made as a slogan for them on that day &#8211; meaning the day of ‘Ashura’ &#8211; with which they also contradicted with those people &#8211; meaning Al-Rafidah (a Shiitic group). Therefore, <span style="color:#993300;">they confronted a void act with another void act, and refuted a Bid‘ah (innovation in religion) by introducing another</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nevertheless, there was one which was indeed more grievous and supportive of the atheists than the other &#8211; he meant the Bid‘ah of Al-Rafidah &#8211; such as the long Hadith that reads: Anyone who bathes on the Day of ‘Ashura’, will not be sick that year, and anyone who wears Kuhl on the Day of ‘Ashura’, their eyes will not become sore that year. This is in addition to other similar acts on that day such as dying with Henna, shaking hands, and so on. This Hadith and other similar ones are all considered fabricated lies by consensus of those who have knowledge of Hadith Science. Yet, it was mentioned by some Hadith scholars that it is Sahih (authentic). They claim that its Isnad (chain of narration) meets the condition of Sahih. However, this is undoubtedly wrong as clarified in other positions. Furthermore, none of the Muslim Imams (initiator of a School of Jurisprudence) stated it to be Mustahab (desirable) to wash up, wear Kuhl, dye with Henna and suchlike on the Day of ‘Ashura’. It was also not mentioned by any of the reliable Muslim scholars to whom people resort to know Allah’s Commands and Prohibitions. This was neither observed by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) nor by Abu Bakr, `Umar, `Uthman or `Aly, (may Allah be pleased with them). Moreover, there was no mention of these Hadith in any of the Books or Musnads (Hadith compilations) composed by Hadith Scholars such as Musnad Ahmad, Is-haq, Ahmad ibn Mani‘ Al-Hamidy, Al-Dalany, Abu Ya`la Al-Mawsily and others. They were not stated in any of the subject-categorized Hadith books such as the Sihah (pl. of Sahih: Authentic Hadith Book), Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes), or those which comprise the Musnads and Athar (narrations from the Companions) such as Muwatta’ Malik, Waki‘, `Abdul-Razzaq, Sa‘id ibn Mansur, Ibn Abu Shaybah and other like them).</p>
<p>End quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was also mentioned by <strong>Al-Hafizh ibn Rajab</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him) in his book (<strong>Lata’if Al-Ma‘arif</strong>) in regard to observing Sawm on the Day of ‘Ashura’ what reads:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All that which was reported about the merit of wearing Kuhl, dying with Henna, and bathing on the Day of ‘Ashura’ is Mawdu‘ and wrong. Concerning Sadaqah (voluntary charity), it was narrated on the authority of `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As that he said: Anyone who fasts on the Day of ‘Ashura’ it is as if they fasted the entire year. And, anyone who gives Sadaqah on this day it is as if they have given it during the whole year. (Related by Abu Mussa Al-Madiny)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards spending generously on one’s children on this day, Harb said: I asked Ahmad about the Hadith: Anyone who is openhanded with his family on the Day of ‘Ashura’&#8230; he stated that it does not count as a Hadith. Ibn Mansur added: I asked Ahmad: Did you hear anything about the Hadith: Anyone who gives generously to his family on the Day of ‘Ashura’, Allah will give him generously the rest of the year. He answered in the affirmative. It was also related on the authority of Sufyan ibn Huyaynah from Ja‘far Al-Ahmar from Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Al-Muntashir, who was one of the best Hadith narrators at his time, that he was informed that: Anyone who gives generously to his family on the Day of ‘Ashura’, Allah will give him generously the rest of the year. Ibn ‘Uyaynah mentioned that he acted upon this Hadith for fifty or sixty years and the result was all good. As for the statement of Harb that Ahmad did not count it as a Hadith; he meant the Hadith that is narrated as Marfu‘ (a Hadith narrated from the Prophet with a connected or disconnected chain of narration)as its Isnad is unauthentic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Even though it was related from several ways of transmission, they are all unauthentic. An example of this is the one related by Muhammad ibn ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Abdul-Hakam. Furthermore, Al-‘Uqayly stated that it was not authentically transmitted (i.e., among scholars). It was also related on the authority of `Umar according to his saying. However, its Isnad includes an anonymous narrator in its chain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">On the other hand, the acts of mourning that some people like Al-Rafidah offer on this day because of the murder of Al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) are characteristic of those who missed the right path in this life while they think that they are acquiring good by their deeds. This is because neither Allah (Exalted be He) nor His Messenger (peace be upon him) ordained to mourn the death of the prophets or the calamities that befell them, so, in what manner could this be applied in respect of people who are below them in rank?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Based on the cited statement of Ibn Taymiyyah and Al-Hafizh ibn Rajab (may Allah be merciful to them), it is known that the Hadiths mentioned with regard to singling out the Day of ‘Ashura’ for wearing Kuhl, bathing, dying with Henna and so on are all Mawdu‘. Similarly, all the Hadiths mentioned on the merit of openhanded giving to one’s children are also unauthentic. Concerning what was reported by Ibrahim ibn Muhammad Al-Muntashir &#8211; a junior Tabi‘y (one of the follower, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) &#8211; who transmitted it from another person without naming him, and similarly did Sufyan ibn ‘Uyaynah, the renowned Imam; it is not permissible to cite that as an evidence on the validity of openhanded giving (on this day). This is because the proof is to be derived from the Qur’an or the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet), not the acts of the Tabi‘un or those who succeeded them. Accordingly, the command to do that on the Day of ‘Ashura’ is considered an impermissible act of Bid‘ah (innovation in religion).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <em><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who does any action that is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected</span></em>. (Related by Muslim in his Sahih and Al-Bukhari as a Hadith Mu‘allaq [a Hadith missing link in the chain of narration, reported directly from the Prophet] but he affirmed its authenticity) The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: <em><span style="color:#008000;">Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected</span></em>. (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim from the Hadith of `Aishah)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reference to giving Sadaqah (voluntary charity) on that day, there is the Hadith of `Abdullah ibn `Amr that was previously mentioned in the statements of Al-Hafizh ibn Rajab and it is Mawquf (words or deeds narrated from a Companion of the Prophet that are not attributed to the Prophet). It was reported from him by Abu Musa Al-Madiny; however, Al-Hafizh ibn Rajab (may Allah be merciful to him) did not mention anything about its Isnad. But, most of the narrators from whom Abu Musa Al-Madiny transmitted were ranked as weak and unauthentic narrators. Therefore, it is not permissible to act upon such a Hadith unless it is proven to be authentically reported from `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allah be pleased with them both). In case this is proven, it is to be considered Marfu‘ since such a statement cannot be issued as a personal opinion. <span style="color:#993300;">Again, mourning on the Day of ‘Ashura’ is one of the condemned Bid‘ahs introduced by Al-Rafidah, with which they contradicted Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama‘ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body), and the path of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet). Consequently, it is not permissible to imitate them in this matter</span>. Allah is the One sought for Help!</p>

Fatwas of Ibn Baz, Volume 1, Warning against Bid’ahs,<br />
Third Treatise: Ruling on celebrating the night before the fifteenth of Sha’ban,<br />
Page No. 186 – 192, <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=39&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">alifta.net</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allah Who has perfected the religion for us and has completed the favor upon us! Peace and blessings of Allah be upon His Prophet and Messenger Muhammad, the Prophet of repentance and mercy!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed: Allah (Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion</span>”</strong> [al-Maa’idah 5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">Or have they partners (with Allah — false gods) who have instituted for them a religion which Allah has not ordained?</span>”</strong> [al-Shooraa 42:21]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is reported in the two the Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from ‘Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected”</em></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, it is reported in the Sahih of Muslim from Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to address people in the Friday Sermon by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“<span style="color:#008000;">To proceed, the best of speech is the Book of Allah, the best of guidance is the guidance of Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him), the most evil of matters are those which are newly-introduced in religion, and every Bid’ah (innovation in religion) is Dalalah (a deviation from what is right)</span>.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many other Qur’anic verses and Hadiths to the same effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All these verses and Hadiths clearly indicate that Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has perfected for this Ummah (nation based on one creed) its religion and has completed upon it His Favor and did not cause His Prophet (peace be upon him) to die until he had conveyed the clear message, explained to the Ummah all what Allah has legislated for it of sayings and actions and he (peace be upon him) had pointed out that all what the people innovate after him and relate to the religion of Islam of sayings and actions are Bid’ah (innovation in religion) rejected to those who innovate it, even if done with good intention. The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the scholars of Islam after them had realized this matter, and thus, they denied such innovations in religion and warned against them as mentioned by all the scholars who wrote about the great status of the Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) and the denial of Bid’ah, such as Ibn Waddah, At-Tartushy, Abu Shamah and others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff6600;">From the Bid’ah which have been introduced into the religion by people is the Bid’ah of celebrating the Mid-Sha’ban night and fasting on its day, and there is no reliable evidence for such actions. There are weak Hadiths reported with regard to the virtue of the Mid-Sha’ban night, but it is not allowed to rely on them as evidence. As for what is reported regarding the virtue of praying during the Mid-Sha’ban night, they are all fabricated Hadiths as confirmed by many Muslim scholars, and we will, Insha’a-Allah (if Allah wills), mention some of their comments on that.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides, there are some other narrations regarding the virtue of this night reported from the righteous predecessors of the people of Al-Sham (the Levant) and others. What the majority of Muslim scholars agreed upon is that the celebration of this Mid-Sha’ban night is Bid’ah and that the Hadiths reported regarding the virtue of this night are all weak Hadiths and some of them are fabricated Hadiths. From those who drew the attention to the weakness and fabrication of these Hadiths is Al-Hafiz ibn Rajab in his book entitled: (Lata’if Al-Ma’arif) and people other than him. It is to be noted that the weak Hadiths can be applied only in the types of worship, the origin of which have been established by sound and authentic evidence. As for celebrating the Mid-Sha’ban night, there is no sound and authentic evidence supporting it to justify reliance on the weak Hadiths in this regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This great rule has been mentioned by Imam: Abul-’Abbas Shaykhul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy upon him). Dear reader, I will convey for you some of what the people of knowledge say about this issue in order to be on clear evidence regarding it. Moreover, the majority of Muslim scholars (may Allah have mercy upon all of them) said that it is an obligation to refer the issues what the people differ over to the Book of Allah (Exalted be He) and to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and thus, what both these sources or either of them approve, then it is the legislation which should be followed and what contradicts them should be set aside and what is not mentioned in these two sources of worships, then it is Bid’ah which is not allowed to be practiced, let alone inviting people to it and encouraging it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), if you believe in Allah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.</span>”</strong> [al-Nisaa’ 4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allah (He is the ruling Judge)</span>.”</strong> [al-Shooraa 42:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, Allah (Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم to mankind): “If you (really) love Allah then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monotheism, follow the Qur’an and the Sunnah), Allah will love you and forgive you your sins</span>.”</strong> [Aal &#8216;Imraan 3:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>“<span style="color:#008000;">But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.</span>”</strong> [al-Nisaa&#8217; 4:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In addition to that, there are many verses supporting this principle and they are clear evidence of the obligation to refer the debatable issues to the Book of Allah and to the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace be upon him) and the obligation to be pleased and satisfied with their rulings, and to know that this is the natural outcome of faith, the best for the slaves during this lifetime and in the Hereafter and the best in result: namely, the end result.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hafiz ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy upon him) in his book entitled: “Lata’if Al-Ma’arif” with regard to this issue – after previous similar talk – said in wording:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“Regarding the Mid-Sha’ban night, the followers from the people of Al-Sham; such as Khalid ibn Ma’dan, Makhul, Luqman ibn ‘Amir and others used to exalt it and exert their efforts therein to perform more worships and people followed them with regard to its virtue and exaltation. It is said that some Israelite narrations and traditions have reached them regarding the virtue of this night, and when this became widespread in countries, people differed regarding it, and therefore, some of them accepted it and agreed with them with regard to the magnification of this night such as a group from the worshippers of the people of Basra and others. On the other hand, this act was denied by the majority of Muslim scholars of Al-Hijaz such as: ‘Ata and Ibn Abu Mulaikah, and it was transmitted by ‘Abdul-Rahman ibn Zayd ibn Aslam from the jurists of the people of Madinah, and it is the opinion of the disciples of Imam Malik and others. They said that all these acts are mere Bid’ah. However, the scholars of the people of Al-Sham differed regarding the way of celebrating it into two opinions:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First:</strong> It is recommended to celebrate it collectively in the Masajid (Mosques). It is reported that Khalid ibn Ma’dan and Luqman ibn ‘Amir and others used to put on their best clothes, apply incense and kohl (antimony powder eyeliner) and spend the entire night in the Masjid. Their act was approved by Ishaq ibn Rahawyah who said about celebrating it in congregation in the Masjid, that it is not Bid’ah. This is reported by Harb Al-Kirmany in his book titled: “Al-Masa’il” (Religious Issues).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second:</strong> It is reprehensible to gather during that night in the Masjid for prayer, narrating stories and supplication, but is not reprehensible for one to pray individually during that night for himself. This is the opinion of Al-Awza’iy, who was the Imam of the people of Al-Sham, their jurist and their scholar, and this, Insha’a-Allah (if Allah wills), is the closest opinion to the truth, until he said: It is not known if Imam Ahmad said something about the Mid-Sha’ban night. There are two narrations reported from Al-Awza’iy regarding the recommendation to stay up late for prayer during the Mid-Sha’ban night relying on the two narrations reported from Imam Ahmad regarding staying up late for Prayer during the two nights of ‘Eid. In one narration, he did not recommend staying up late in congregational prayer during the two nights of ‘Eid because it was not reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) or from his Companions that they did that. In another narration he recommended staying up late for Prayer during those nights following the act of ‘Abdul-Rahman ibn Yazid ibn Al-Aswad who was one of the Tabi’un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet), in that. By the same token, there is no sound and authentic narration reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor from his Companions regarding staying up late for Prayer during the Mid-Sha’ban night. However, it is reported from a group of the Followers from among the noble jurists of the people of Al-Sham”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the end of the statement of Al-Hafiz ibn Rajab (may Allah have mercy upon him), which <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#800000;text-decoration:underline;">clearly states that no sound and authentic narration was reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) nor from his Companions (may Allah be pleased with all of them) regarding the Mid-Sha’ban night.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the opinion chosen by Al-Awza’iy (may Allah have mercy upon him) regarding the recommendation of staying up late individually for Prayer during the Mid-Sha’ban night and Al-Hafiz ibn Rajab’s preference of this opinion, it is strange and weak, because if something has not been established by the legal evidence that it is legislation, then it is not allowed for a Muslim to introduce it into the religion of Allah, whether one does it individually or in congregation, and whether one practices it secretly or openly, due to the comprehensiveness of the Prophet’s (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) saying:<em><span style="color:#008000;"> Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected</span>.</em> and other evidence indicating the rejection of innovations in religion and warning against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported from Imam Abu Bakr Al-Tartushy (may Allah have mercy upon him) in his book entitled: (Al-Hawadith Wal-Bida’) that he said in wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“It is reported by Ibn Waddah from Zayd ibn Aslam that he said: ‘We have not found anyone from our Shaykhs or our jurists paying attention to the Mid-Sha’ban night. Moreover, they did not pay attention to that Hadith reported by Mak-hul and they did not consider any special virtue for this night to the exclusion of other nights.’ Moreover, it was said to Ibn Abi Mulaikah : Indeed, Ziyad An-Numairiy says: ‘Verily, the reward of the Mid-Sha’ban night is like the reward of Laylat-ul-Qadr (the Night of Decree)’, then he said: ‘If I hear him saying that and I have a staff in my hand, I will hit him’. It is noteworthy that Ziyad was a narrator of stories.” End of the statement of Abu Bakr Al-Tartushy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, the erudite scholar: Al-Shawkany (may Allah bestow His mercy upon him), in his book entitled: (Al-Fawa’id Al-Majmu’ah), said in wording:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Hadith: O ‘Ali, whoever prays a hundred Rak’ah (a unit of the prayer) during the Mid-Sha’ban night and reads in every Rak’ah (unit of Prayer) Al-Fatihah (the Opening Chapter of the Book) and Surah Ikhlas ten times, Allah will fulfil all their needs etc., is a <span style="color:#ff0000;">fabricated Hadith</span>, and within the words of the Hadith talking about the great reward for the one who performs this Prayer there is something which does not leave any doubt for a sound-minded person to know that it is a fabricated Hadith. Moreover, its narrators are unknown and it has been reported through a second and third narrations, all of which are inserted fabrications and their narrators are unknown. It is also said in “Al-Mukhtasar” (The Concise Book of Hadith) that the Hadith of performing Prayer during the Mid-Sha’ban night is null. and what is reported by Ibn Hibban from the Hadith of ‘Ali : When the Middle Night of Sha’ban comes, observe night vigil prayer during it and fast the following day is a weak Hadith. It is said in (Al-La’ali’, “Perals”) that Praying one hundred Rak’ahs with sincerity during the Mid-Sha’ban night ten times. along with the rest of the details about its virtue, which is reported by Ad-Daylamiy and others, and this is a false Hadith, and all its narrators in the three different narrations are unknown and thier narrators are weak. He said that the Hadith: And twelve Rak’ahs in which Surah Al-Ikhlas is recited thirty times. is a fabricated Hadith, and the Hadith: and fourteen Rak’as. is also a false Hadith.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is noted that a group of jurists had been deceived by this Hadith, such as the author of the book entitled: (Al-’Ihya’) and others, as well as some Exegetes of the Qur’an. Performing prayer on this night – namely, the Mid-Sha’ban night- has been reported in different ways, all of which are null and fabricated narrations. This does not contradict the narration reported by Al-Tirmidhiy from the Hadith of ‘Aishah regarding his (peace be upon him) going to Al-Baqi’ and the descending of the Lord to the nearest sky during the Mid-Sha’ban night and that He forgives for more than the number of the hairs of the sheep of Banu Kalb, since we are talking about this prayer which has been falsely established in that night. Moreover, the Hadith reported by ‘Aishah has weakness and its chain of transmission is interrupted and the Hadith reported by ‘Ali which has been previously mentioned with regard to staying up late during that night for Prayer does not contradict the ruling that a special Prayer during that night is falsely established, in addition to the weakness in that Hadith according to the what we have mentioned.” End of Al-Shawkany’s comment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported from<strong> Al-Hafiz Al-’Iraqy</strong> that he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“The Hadith of performing prayer during the Mid-Sha’ban night is falsely related to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and is lying about him. Moreover, it is reported by Al-Imam Al-Nawawy that he said in the book entitled: (Al-Majmu’): ‘The Prayer known as Salat-ul-Ragha’ib (Prayer for great bounties or wishes), which is twelve Rak’ahs performed between the Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer and ‘Isha’ (Night) Prayer during the night of the first Friday of the Month of Rajab and the Prayer during the Mid-Sha’ban night, which is a hundred Rak’ahs, are two evil Bid’ahs (innovations in religion) and no one should be deceived by their mentioning in the book entitled: (Qout A-Qulub), the book entitled: (Ihya’ ‘Ulum Ad-Din) nor by the Hadith reported regarding these two nights, since all this is void and no one should be deceived by some of the Imams who got confused about their ruling and wrote some papers regarding the recommended practices during these two nights, because they made a mistake in that”.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, Shaykh Imam Abu Muhammad ‘Abdul-Rahman ibn Isma’il Al-Maqdisy wrote a very valuable book regarding the falsification of the special virtues of these two nights and he did a good job in this book. Moreover, people of knowledge talked very much about this issue, and if we trace all what has been said regarding this subject and try to convey it, then we will have a very long explanation, but we hope that what we have mentioned regarding this issue will be sufficient and convincing for the seeker of truth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From what has been previously mentioned of verses, Hadith and the opinions of Muslim scholars, it becomes clear to the seeker of the truth that celebrating the Mid-Sha’ban night through performing Prayer and other activities and singling out the following day with Fast is an evil Bid’ah according to the opinion of the majority of Muslim scholars. It has no foundation in the purified Islamic Shar’ (law), but it has been newly introduced into Islam after the epoch of the Companions (may Allah be pleased with all of them). It is sufficient for the seeker of truth, about this subject and other subjects, to read Allah’s (may He be Exalted and Sublime) Saying: <strong>“This day, I have perfected your religion for you”</strong> and to read other Qur’anic verses confirming this meaning, as well as the Prophet’s (peace be upon him) saying: <em>“Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected”</em>, in addition to what has been reported of the Hadiths confirming this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, it is reported in the Sahih of Muslim from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“<span style="color:#008000;">Do not single out the night (preceding) Friday among the nights for prayer and do not single out Friday among days for fasting but only when anyone among you is accustomed to fast (on dates) which coincide with this day (Friday).</span>” </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If it is allowed to single out a certain night with a special worship, then the night of Friday will be more deserving of this special worship, because its day is the best day on which the sun rises according to the sound and authentic Hadith reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Since the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) warned against singling out this night with special Prayer to the exclusion of other nights, then it is evidence that other nights should not be singled out with a certain type of worship unless there is a sound and authentic evidence indicating such specification.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since it is ordained to stay up late for Prayer during Laylat-ul-Qadr (the Night of Decree) and during other nights of Ramadan, the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) drew the attention to that, encouraged the Ummah to do that and did it himself as reported in the two Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>“<span style="color:#008000;">Whoever observes Optional Night Prayer during the month of Ramadan out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his past sins will be forgiven, and whoever stands for prayers in the night of Qadr out of sincere Faith and hoping for a reward from Allah, then all his previous sins will be forgiven</span>.”</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, if the Mid-Sha’ban night, the night of the first Friday of Rajab or the night of Isra’ (Night Journey) and Mi’raj (Ascension to Heaven) were singled out with a certain type of worship, then the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) would guide the Ummah to it or would do it himself and if something like this had happened, the Companions (may Allah be pleased with all of them) would have transmitted it to the Ummah and would not conceal it from the following generations since they were the best people and the best in giving advice after the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allah be upon all of them) and may Allah be pleased with the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) and may they be pleased by Allah. You have already known from the opinions of Muslim scholars that nothing has been established from the Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) nor from his Companions (may Allah be pleased with all of them) regarding the virtue of the night of the first Friday of Rajab or of the Mid-Sha’ban night, and therefore, it becomes clear that celebrating both of them is a Bid’ah, newly introduced in the religion. By the same token, singling them out with a special worship is an evil Bid’ah. The same ruling applies to the twenty-seventh night of Rajab, which some people believe is the night of Al-Isra’ and Mi’raj, that it should not be singled out with a certain worship and it is not allowed to celebrate it due to the above-mentioned evidence. This is the ruling if we know when Al-Isra’ and Mi’raj happened, how will it be if this night is unknown, according to the true view of Muslim scholars, and the saying of those who claim that it is the twenty-seventh night of Rajab is a false opinion having no basis within the sound and authentic Hadith. Indeed, he is good in speech the one who says:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;"><em>The best affairs are those previously established on true guidance<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: If Ramadan comes and someone still has days of Sawm (Fasting) to make up for from the previous Ramadan, are they considered sinful for not having made up the days before the start of the next Ramadan? Do they have to make a Kaffarah (expiation) or not?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Everyone who has days to make up from previous Ramadan has to make up for those days before the next Ramadan. They may delay making up for them until Sha‘ban, <span style="color:#ff0000;">but if the next Ramadan comes and they still have not made up for those days, <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">without an excuse</span></strong>, they are considered sinful for that. They should make up for these days later and also feed a needy person for each missed day</span>. This was the Fatwa (legal opinion) given by a group of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet). The required amount of food is half a Sa‘ (1 Sa‘ = 2.172 kg) of the staple food of your country to be given to some or just one needy person for every day not fasted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">If you are excused for the delay by reason of illness or travel, you just have to make up for the Sawm; you do not have to feed needy people</span></strong>. This is according to the general rule in the Saying of Allah (Glorified be He):<em> &#8230;and whoever is ill or on a journey, the same number [of days which one did not observe Saum (fasts) must be made up] from other days&#8221;.</em> Allah is the Grantor of success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explaining the truth of the possibility of Jinn entering the human body and refuting the claims of those denying this [1]</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Source</strong> :  Fatwas of Ibn Baaz rahimahullaah &#8211; <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/fatawaDetails.aspx?languagename=en&amp;BookID=14&amp;View=Page&amp;PageNo=1&amp;PageID=208" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">alifta.net</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) also said in (vol.24, pp. 276-277) the following: The existence of Jinn is affirmed in the Book of Allah, the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace be upon him), and according to the consensus of the Salaf (Righteous Predecessors) of this Ummah and its leading scholars. Similarly the fact that the Jinn can enter human bodies is confirmed by the consensus of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah. Allah (the Exalted states) says: <img alt="" align="middle" border="0" />&#8220;<strong>Those who eat Ribâ (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitân (Satan) leading him to insanity.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Safiyyah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"><span id="24546" class="tip"></span><strong>Satan circulates in the human body as blood does.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p>`Abdullah the son of Al-Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;I told my father that some people claim that Jinn can never enter the body of a person. He said, &#8216;O my son, they tell lies. Satan can even speak on the tongue of those whom he possesses.'&#8221; </strong></p>
<p>The Shaykh of Islam<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Ibn Taymiyyah</span> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;What he [Imam Ahmad] said is self-evident. The Jinn may possess someone and cause them to speak a language he does not even know. A possessed person may be violently beaten, in a way that even a camel may not endure, yet he neither feels the beating nor is aware of the words he says.&#8221; Furthermore, the possessed person may drag a non-possessed person and or the mat he is sitting on, moves things from a place to another, and other practices that confirmed to those who witnessed such behavior that the one who spoke or moved was not a human being.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: &#8220;None of the leading Muslim scholars denied the ability of Jinn to enter the body of a human being. Whoever denies this fact and assumes that Shari`ah denies it has fabricated lies against Shari`ah, as there is no Shari`ah-based evidence that denies this fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>(End of quote)</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong></span> (may Allah be merciful to him) mentioned the following in his book, Zad Al-Ma`ad fi Hadiy Khayr Al-`Ibad, vol. 4, pp. 66-69:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;There are two types of Jinn&#8217;s possession of human beings:</p>
<p>&#8211; Possession caused by earthly malicious spirits; and<br />
&#8211; the other caused by filthy mixtures.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the second type, it is the domain of physicians to find what causes it and how to treat it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning the possession by spirits, the knowledgeable persons among them acknowledge its existence and do not deny it. They also admit that its treatment should be by confronting the celestial, benevolent and honorable spirits with that wicked and malicious ones to ward off the evil they cause and forestall their acts. This is even stated by Hippocrates in some of his books, as he mentioned some cures for possession. However, he said that his cure is only beneficial in case of possession caused by mixture of filthy blends, but not for that caused by evil spirits.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas, ignorant, worthless and disreputable physicians deny the possession by spirits and do not admit that they affect the body of the possessed person relying on no evidence to support their claims. They are only ignorant, as there is no medical proof to prove the impermissibility of this matter. The Jinn&#8217;s possession of human beings is an established fact and reality attests to it. However, the physicians&#8217; denial of possession and ascribing this to the occurrence of some filthy blends is partially, not completely true.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ignorant and atheist doctors started to attribute the possession of human beings as caused only by filthy blends, but anyone with the least knowledge of such spirits and how they affect the body of the possessed will be astonished at the ignorance of such people and the weakness of their perception of such matters.</p>
<p><strong>In the same article Shaykh Ibn Baaz refutes the one who denies Jinn Possession  as below</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family, his Companions, and those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some short and long articles were published in local newspapers and others in the month of Sha`ban of this year (1407 A.H.) regarding the declaration of some Jinn (creatures created from fire) who possessed Muslim women in<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Riyadh. </span>They declared that they had become Muslims before me after they had declared this before brother<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Abdullah ibn Mushrif Al-`Umary </span>who lives in <span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody">Riyadh. </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-`Umary recited some Adhkar (invocations) on the Jinn-possessed lady and talked to the Jinni, reminding him of Allah (Exalted be He) and His Omnipotence as well as frightening him with the grievous sin of injustice. After the Jinni said that he is a Buddhist disbeliever, the shaykh called him to Islam and to come out of the woman whom he was possessing. Accordingly, the Jinn complied and declared his conversion to Islam before Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> Al-`Umary. </span>Then, Shaykh Al-`Umary<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> </span>and the guardians of the woman wanted to come to me with the woman to hear the Jinni&#8217;s conversion to Islam. When they were all present, I asked the Jinni about the reason for embracing Islam. He spoke on the tongue of the woman but in a manly voice. All this happened in the presence of the woman who was sitting in the chair next to me beside her brother, sister,<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> and </span>Shaykh Al-`Umary as well as some shaykhs who witnessed and heard the speech of the Jinni while openly declaring his conversion to Islam. He said he was a Buddhist from India. On my part, I advised him to observe Taqwa (fear or wariness of offending Allah) and to leave the body of this woman as he is making her suffer. The Jinni submitted to my order and said that he embraced Islam willingly. Therefore, I advised himto call his people to Islam after Allah (Exalted be He) had guided him to the right path. He came out of the woman&#8217;s body and his last word was &#8220;As-salamu `alaykum&#8221; (peace be upon you). Then the woman spoke with her normal voice and felt comfortable and relaxed from the pain he was causing to her. After the lapse of a month or more, she visited me again with her brothers, maternal uncle, and sister and told me that she was very well, her condition was stable and the Jinni had never returned to her. When I asked her about how she felt when she was possessed by this Jinni, she said that she always had deviant ideas contradicting the Shari`ah (Islamic law), in addition to an inclination to the Buddhist religion, and a desire to read its books. However, after this Jinni was cast out of her, she no longer had such ideas, as she returned to her normal state away from such abominable ideas.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I was told that Shaykh<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody"> `Aly Al-Tantawy </span>denied the occurrence of such matters, claiming that this is a kind of charlatanism and mere lies. He said that the speech that was mentioned on the tongue of the woman might have been recorded, not real. I asked for the tape in which the Jinni had declared that, and was confirmed that such opinions are really his. However, I could not imagine how he could think that what the woman said was recorded even though I, myself, asked the Jinni some questions and he replied. Then how could a person having the least degree of wisdom imagine that a recorded tape can be asked and give answers. This is one of the ugliest abominations and a way of permitting falsehood.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">General advice  Some of the Major Sins</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#993300;"> <strong>[1] Backbiting</strong>,  <strong>[2] Tale-bearing</strong>,  <strong>[3]</strong> <strong>Envy</strong>,  <strong>[4] Injustice</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From <strong>`Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz</strong> to those who see it of my Muslim brothers, may Allah grant me and them success in fulfilling what pleases Him, and keep us away from disobeying Him, Amen!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!), to continue:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I advise every Muslim to have Taqwa (fearing Allah as He should be feared) in all circumstances and guard his tongue from saying anything other than that which is useful, because Mubah (permissible) talk may lead to what is Haram (prohibited) or Makruh (reprehensible), and this is common among people, Allah the Exalted says: <span style="color:#008000;">Not a word does he (or she) utter but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it)</span>. Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <span style="color:#008000;">And follow not (O man i.e., say not, or do not or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge. Verily! The hearing, and the sight, and the heart, of each of those one will be questioned (by Allâh)</span>. The Prophet (may Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon him) also says in the Hadith agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim and narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him): <span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;He who believes in Allah and the Last Day should either utter good words or stay silent&#8230;&#8221;</span> .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are things that may be a topic of talks but should not be spoken and one should be warned against talking about them, for they could lead to major sins, which would lead to displeasing Allah and to His Punishment. These things have become commonly widespread in some communities:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>1- <span style="color:#ff0000;">Backbiting</span></strong> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is talking about your brother or sister in a way that they would dislike, if they heard about it, whether it be talking about their body, family, character, actions, sayings or about their religion or life, or even talking ill about their clothes, home or car.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Do you know what backbiting is? They (the Companions) said: Allah and His Messenger know best. Thereupon, he (the Prophet) said: Backbiting is talking about your brother in a manner which he does not like. It was said to him: What is your opinion, if I actually find (that failing) in my brother that which I made a mention of? He said: If (that failing) is actually found (in him) what you assert, then you in fact, backbit him, and if it is not in him, it is a slander against him</span>. Reported by Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Backbiting is Haram (prohibited), no matter what the reason behind it; whether it is to calm down rage, or to compliment those present and make conversation with them, or reconciling or courtesy of companions. Or to encourage others to speak or to envy others or just for fun, or to waste time or if a person speaks ill of others to make those present laugh. Allah the Exalted forbade this, and warned His slaves against it, He the Exalted says: <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion; indeed some suspicions are sins. And spy not, neither backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would hate it (so hate backbiting). And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In a Hadith by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The Muslim is inviolable by his Muslim brother, with regard to his blood, wealth and honor</span> Reported by Muslim. He (peace be upon him) said in his final Khutbah (sermon) in his Farewell Hajj: <span style="color:#008000;">Your blood, your properties and your honors are as sacred to one another as the sanctity of this day of yours in this month of yours in this town of yours. (Listen) Have I not conveyed Allah&#8217;s message to you?</span> Reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim. It is also narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The worst kind of usury is indulging in evil talk about the honor of your Muslim brother</span>. Reported by Al-Bazzar and Abu Dawud. The authentic Hadiths of the Prophet (peace be upon him) that refer to the prohibition of backbiting and warning against it are so many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2- Among vices that should be avoided, kept away from and warned against is <span style="color:#ff0000;">tale-bearing</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It refers to the act of transferring conversations from one person to another, or from one group to another, or from one tribe to anotherwith the intention of causing corruption and driving people away from each other. It includes disclosing what people dislike no matter if the person reported, the person informed, or even others may dislike it. This act of disclosing may be done verbally, written, or by using code, or gestures regardless of the subject reported whether it is a saying or an action and whether it is a defect or imperfection in the person reported or not. A person must refrain from talking about what he knows or sees in people, unless there is some benefit to Muslims in transferring information or that it will eliminate evil.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Motives behind tale-bearing is either to cause evil to the person being spoken about or to show love to the person who is being informed, or to engage in ones advantages and disadvantages; all of which is forbidden. No one should believe rumor mongers; because a person who gossips is considered a Fasiq (someone openly and flagrantly violating Islamic law), whose Shahadah (testimony of faith) is rejected. Allah the Exalted says:<span style="color:#008000;"> O you who believe! If a Fâsiq (liar — evil person) comes to you with any news, verify it, lest you should harm people in ignorance</span> , one must forbid him from doing so, advise him against it, and condemn the act, for Allah (Exalted be He) says: &#8230;enjoin (on people) Al-Ma‘rûf &#8211; (Islâmic Monotheism and all that is good), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief in the Oneness of Allâh, polytheism of all kinds and all that is evil and bad) One should dislike him for Allah&#8217;s sake and should not think negatively of his brother, who is being spoken about. He should think good of his brother, Allah (Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;">O you who believe! Avoid much suspicion; indeed some suspicions are sins</span>. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8216;<span style="color:#008000;">Beware of suspicion, for it is the worst of false tales</span>. Agreed upon its authenticity i.e. reported by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He should not spy on the person who was spoken about or defame his self by committing the same forbidden act that the gossiper committed by repeating the gossip which he heard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence for the prohibition of tale-bearing in the Quran and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) are many; for example, Allah (Exalted be He) says: And (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) obey you not everyone Hallaf Mahîn (the one who swears much and is a liar or is worthless). [Tafsir At-Tabari] A slanderer, going about with calumnies, Allah (Exalted be He) also says: Woe to every slanderer and backbiter. It is narrated by Hudhayfah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">The story-teller will not enter Paradise</span> (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> Should I inform you what slandering is? It is tale-carrying, which creates dissension amongst people</span>. Reported by Muslim. Tale-bearing is one of the reasons of punishment in the grave, for Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) passed by two graves and said: <span style="color:#008000;">“These two people are being tortured not for a major sin (to avoid).” The Prophet (peace be upon him) then added, “Yes! (they are being tortured for a major sin). Indeed, one of them never saved himself from being soiled with his urine while the other used to go about with calumnies (to make enmity between friends).”</span> (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Backbiting and tale-bearing are forbidden due to the damage they cause, the corruption between people and the divisions and chaos which it creates, igniting the fire of hatred, envy and hypocrisy, and eliminating all affection and fatality. Also causing quarrels and discord among brothers who were once close. It also involves lying, treachery, betrayal, deception and accusations of the innocent, which lead one to curse, abuse and insult. They are sings of cowardice, and pettiness and defect. In addition to this, the sinners who make these accusations will bear many sins, which will lead to the wrath of Allah, and indignation and painful punishment.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>3- That which should be avoided and kept away from, a reprehensible trait, which is known as <span style="color:#ff0000;">envy</span>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is, a person wishing that a certain bounty and grace be removed from his brother in Islam, whether this grace and bounty is related to religion or is worldly. This is objecting to what Allah has destined and granted His slaves. This is injustice by the envious person to himself for his Iman (faith) is decreased due to this, causing calamities and concerns for himself, ruining him in a great way. Allah (Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;">Or do they envy men (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم and his followers) for what Allâh has given them of His Bounty?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Do not be envious of one another; do not artificially inflate prices against one another; do not hate one another; do not shun one another; and do not undercutone another in business transactions; and be as fellow-brothers and servants of Allah</span>. Reported by Muslim. Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) also narrated that the Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> Avoid envy, for envy devours good deeds just as fire devours fuel.</span> Reported by Abu Dawud.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>4- A person is also required to stay away from <span style="color:#ff0000;">injustice</span>, which is being <span style="color:#ff0000;">unfair and legal misbehavior</span>.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The biggest of these is Shirk (associating others in worship with Allah) of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) through violation and sins. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;">And (remember) when Luqmân said to his son when he was advising him: “O my son! Join not in worship others with Allâh. Verily joining others in worship with Allâh is a great Zûlm (wrong) indeed</span>. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: <span style="color:#008000;">And it is the disbelievers who are the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers)</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This also includes taking other people&#8217;s property without the right to do so, or taking something from one&#8217;s land or attacking or abusing them, which is also a major sin and disobedience of Allah. This is &#8211; we seek refuge in Allah- a result of the darkness of ones heart, for if one&#8217;s heart was lit with the light of guidance, then he would have reconsidered, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <span style="color:#008000;">There will be no friend, nor an intercessor for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers), who could be given heed to</span>. Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <span style="color:#008000;">&#8230;and for the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers, polytheists and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) there is no helper</span>. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says:<span style="color:#008000;"> Consider not that Allâh is unaware of that which the Zâlimûn (polytheists, wrong-doers) do, but He gives them respite up to a Day when the eyes will stare in horror</span>. Allah (Exalted be He) also says: <span style="color:#008000;">And whoever among you does wrong (i.e. sets up rivals to Allâh), We shall make him taste a great torment</span>. It is reported in Sahih (authentic book) Muslim, from Abu Dhar (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:<span style="color:#008000;"> Allah (the Exalted) says: &#8220;O My servants, I have forbidden injustice upon Myself and have forbidden it for you, so do not wrong one another&#8230;&#8221;</span> It is also narrated by Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Be on your guard against committing oppression, for oppression is a darkness on the Day of Recompense</span> Likewise, `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As (may Allahbe pleased with them) narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#008000;">A Muslim is the one who avoids harming Muslims with his tongue and hands. And a Muhajir (emigrant) is the one who gives up (abandons) all that Allah has forbidden.</span> (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). These Hadiths and others with the same meaning are evident that one should be warned of injustice in matters related people, their honor, and property, due to the great evil and great corruption and their dire consequences. They also indicate the obligation of Tawbah (repentance to Allah) to Allah, the Exalted, of past sins and advising others to leave all that Allah has forbidden of injustice and all other sins.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant me and you good attitude and good deeds and keep us away from bad deeds and attitudes! May He guide us to His Straight Path, for He is All-Gracious and The Generous.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!).<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Reply given by Ibn Baz to written questions posed by a Shaykh from outside the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Abdul-`Aziz ibn `Abdullah ibn Baz to my esteemed brother, may Allah guide you to useful knowledge and to act upon it! Amen. Peace be upon you! I have received your letter dated 2/3/1394 A.H. May Allah guide you and grant you success! It included three questions about Wahhabism. Following is my answer:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 1: <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>You asked about Wahhabism and whether it is a fifth Madh-hab (School of Jurisprudence) or follows one of the four Madh-habs.</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The term Wahhabism is used by many people to refer to the call initiated by Imam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab ibn Sulayman Al-Tamimy Al-Hanbaly (may Allah be merciful to him). He is called along with his followers &#8216;Wahhabis&#8217;. Every knowledgeable person must have heard about Shaykh Muhammad ibn `Abdul-Wahhab&#8217;s movement (may Allah be merciful to him). He called for pure Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and warned people against all forms of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), such as supplicating to the dead, trees, rocks or the like. He (may Allah be merciful to him) followed in creedal matters the Madh-hab (School of Jurisprudence) of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) while in subsidiary matters he followed the Madh-hab of Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal Al-Shaybany (may Allah be merciful to him). This is clear in the books and Fatwas (legal opinions) of Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab and in the books of his followers and offspring which are published. Imam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab appeared at a time when Islam was alienated, the Arabian Peninsula and other areas were engulfed in ignorance and worshiping idols was widespread. So the Shaykh took it upon himself to strive and struggle, and devoted himself to destroying all means of misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He employed all the possible ways leading to the spread of Tawhid free from any kind of superstition. Allah, out of His Bounty, made Imam Muhammad ibn Su`ud, Prince of Al-Dir‘iyyah at that time, accept the call. Thus, the Prince, his sons, those under his authority and his followers supported the Imam, may Allah reward them, forgive them and grant their offspring success to all that pleases Him and to what sets right the affairs of His Servants! All regions of the Arabian Peninsula have lived under this righteous call to the present day. Thus, Imam Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab’s call was in accordance with the Qur’an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#333399;">Wahhabism is not a fifth Madh-hab as some ignorant and prejudiced people claim; rather, it is a call to the ‘Aqidah (creed) of Salafiyyah (those following the way of the righteous predecessors) and a way of reviving the main aspects of Islam and Tawhid which was forgotten in the Arabian Peninsula.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Explanation of the Ayah whose meanings say: <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;The Hand of Allâh is over their hands&gt;&gt;</span> (Surah Al Fath 48:10)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From `Abdul `Aziz Bin `Abdullah ibn Baz to the respected brother, As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!) To proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">With reference to your Fatwa request registered in the Department of Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217; no. 3137 dated 11/7/1408 A.H., it reads:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">We attended a Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an) seminar held in a Masjid (mosque) called Abu Al-Haytham ibn Al-Tayhan and located in Salibiayh district in Kuwait. The Shaykh interpreted the Saying of Allah (whose meanings translated as): <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;The Hand of Allâh is over their hands&gt;&gt;</span> (Surah Al Fath 48:10). He said that this Ayah has more than one meaning. It can be Allah&#8217;s Help given to them, Allah&#8217;s Power with them, or Allah&#8217;s Knowledge of their conditions and intentions. After the seminar finished, one brother told the Shaykh that his interpretation of this Ayah goes against `Aqidah (creed) of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) and complies with the views of Asha`irah (a Muslim group that bases its creedal issues on logic). The Shaykh was annoyed and replied that Al-Mawardy and Ibn Kathir mentioned this interpretation in their books. The man corrected him saying that Ibn Kathir did not state that, but it is Al-Mawardy who advocated Asha`irah. The debate heated and people behaved aggressively labeling the man a Christian and Buddhist and they were about to beat him but some protected him. Allah knows that this man wanted to explain the truth out of his jealousy for the Muslim `Aqidah and the impermissibility to delay the declaration beyond the time of need. The man suggested that the issue be referred to you and they agreed. Would you please enlighten us. May Allah reward you the best. Waiting for your reply.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Please be informed that our creed is to affirm Allah&#8217;s Attribute of having a Hand and the other attributes stated by Him in His Noble Book or by His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) in the purified Sunnah. However, this Hand is such as befits Allah&#8217;s Majesty without <strong>Takyif</strong> (descriptive designation of Allah&#8217;s Attributes) or <strong>Tamthil</strong> (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation) or <strong>Tahrif</strong> (distortion of the meaning) or <strong>Ta`til</strong> (negation of the meaning or function of Allah&#8217;s Attributes). We believe that there is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer. We do not deny any of His Attributes with which He described Himself. We do not change the words from their (right) places. We do not discuss the nature of His Attributes, or liken His Attributes to those of His creation, because there is nothing that can be compared to Him, and He has no peer, equal or rival. Just as He (Glorified be He) has a true &#8220;Self&#8221; which is not similar to that of His creatures, He does not resemble any of His creatures in any of His Attributes. Confirming the Attributes of the Creator does not entail comparing them to those of the created. This is the doctrine of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) including Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) and their followers from the best three generations of Islam and their successors to this day.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong> (may Allah be merciful to him) stated: <strong><span id="more-363"></span></strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">More than one scholar reported that the Salaf unanimously agreed that the literal meanings of the Attributes of the Creator (Glorified and Exalted be He) should be accepted according to their apparent implication without any Takyif or Tashbih to the created. Discussing the Attributes comes under the heading of discussing the Divine Self. Whatever is said about the Divine Self, the same can in all respects be said about the Divine Attributes. If the Self is affirmed to exist without descriptive designation, the same applies to the Attributes. We affirm the existence of every Attribute without describing its manner. We say that Allah (Exalted be He) has a Hand and Eyes, but we do not say that His Hand implies Power and His Hearing implies having knowledge. Then he (may Allah be merciful to him) quoted as evidence affirming Allah&#8217;s Attribute of having a Hand the following Ayah:<span style="color:#339966;"><em> &lt;&lt;The Jews say: “Allâh’s Hand is tied up (i.e. He does not give and spend of His Bounty).” Be their hands tied up and be they accursed for what they uttered. Nay, both His Hands are widely outstretched. He spends (of His Bounty) as He wills&gt;&gt;</em> (Surah Al-Maidah 8:64)</span>. Allah (Exalted be He) also has said to Iblis (Satan): <span style="color:#339966;"><em>&lt;&lt;What prevents you from prostrating yourself to one whom I have created with Both My Hands &gt;&gt;</em>(Surah Sa&#8217;d 38:75)</span>. He (Glorified be He) also says: <span style="color:#339966;"><em>&lt;&lt;They made not a just estimate of Allâh such as is due to Him. And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand.&gt;&gt;</em> (Surah Al-Zumar 39:67)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <span style="color:#339966;">&lt;&lt;Blessed be He in Whose Hand is the dominion Allah</span>&gt;&gt; (Glorified be He) also says: In Your Hand is the good. Verily, You are Able to do all things. Then in commentary on these Ayahs, Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) said: These Ayahs mean that Allah (Exalted be He) has two Hands in a manner which suits His Majesty and that He created Adam with them unlike the angels and Iblis. Also, Allah (Exalted be He) will grasp the earth and fold the heavens in His Right Hand and that His both Hands are widely outstretched. The word outstretched implies generosity and free giving, for acts of generosity are often with the hand stretched out, whereas when holding back the hands are clasped close to the neck, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: And let not your hand be tied (like a miser) to your neck, nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach (like a spendthrift), so that you become blameworthy and in severe poverty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Conventionally, when someone is described as having widely outstretched hands, it is understood that the person has hands in a true literal sense. Ibn Taymiyah (may Allah be merciful to him) stated that the plural form of hand, i.e. hands is used to imply neither bounty nor power. Using the singular form to express numerous things or the plural form to express one thing is baseless in the Arabic language in which the Qur&#8217;an was revealed. Thus, Hands in His Saying: &#8230;to one whom I have created with Both My Hands cannot mean power because the latter is one attribute. It is incorrect to use the plural form (hands) to express one thing (power). Nor do they imply bounty because we cannot use two hands to denote Allah&#8217;s Bounties which are countless. Then he (may Allah be merciful to him) quoted evidence from the Sunnah that affirms Allah&#8217;s Attribute of having a Hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The just will be with Allah on pulpits of light on the right Hand of the Most Merciful (Glorified and Exalted be He), and both His Hands are right &#8211; those who are just in their judgment and are fair with their families and those of whom they are in charge. (Related by Muslim) He (peace be upon him) also said: Allah&#8217;s Hand is full; never diminishes no matter how much is given, generously and unceasingly spending, night and day. Do you see what He has spent since He created the Heavens and the Earth? Yet all that has not decreased what is in His Hand.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His Throne was over the water; and in His Other Hand there is the Balance; He raises and lowers (whom He wills). (Related by Muslim) It is also reported in the Sahih (Authentic Hadith Book) on the authority of Abu Said Al-Khudry (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: The earth will be one single bread on the Day of Resurrection which the Almighty will turn in His Hand as one of you turns a loaf while on a journey. It is also reported in the Sahih on the authority of Ibn `Umar (may Allah be pleased with them) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8216;The Lord (Glorified and Exalted be He) will take in His Hand His heavens and earth and say, &#8216;I am Allah &#8211; the Prophet (peace be upon him) clenched and opened his fingers (and continued narrating) &#8211; I am the King.&#8217; So much so that I looked at the Minbar (pulpit) and saw it moving underneath the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and thought that it would cause him (peace be upon him) to fall. According to another narration: While on the Minbar (pulpit), the Prophet (peace be upon him) recited the Ayah: They made not a just estimate of Allâh such as is due to Him. And on the Day of Resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by His Hand and the heavens will be rolled up in His Right Hand. Glorified be He, and High be He above all that they associate as partners with Him! He (peace be upon him) said, &#8216;Allah &#8211; glorifying Himself &#8211; will say: I am the Almighty.&#8217; It is also reported in the Sahih on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Allah will hold the earth and fold the Heaven in His right Hand, and say, &#8216;I am the King! Where are the kings of the earth?&#8217; Another authentic Hadith says: (When Allah created Adam) Allah, keeping His Two Hands closed, said to him (Adam), &#8216;Choose whichever you will.&#8217; Adam said, &#8216;I choose the Right Hand of My Lord and both Hands of my Lord are blessed.&#8217; Then Allah spread out His Hand, and there were Adam and his offspring.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported in the Sahih: When Allah created the creation He wrote with His Hand on Himself: Verily, My Mercy overcomes My Wrath.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also reported in the Sahih: There was an argument between Adam and Moses, in which Adam said to Moses, &#8216;You are Moses! Allah chose you (above mankind) by His speaking (to you) and wrote with His own Hand the Torah for you.&#8217; Moses said, &#8216;You are Adam! Allah has created you with His Hand and breathed into you the soul He created for you.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reported that Allah (Exalted be He) says: By My Majesty and Glory, I will not make the righteous offspring of those whom I created with My Hands like those (other creatures) to whom I said, &#8216;Be&#8217; and they were. It is reported in the Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes): Allah created Adam and wiped his back with His Right Hand,and brought forth from it an offspring, saying, &#8216;I have created these for Paradise and the deeds of the people of Paradise they will be doing.&#8217; He then wiped his back and brought forth from it an offspring, saying, &#8216;I have created these for Hellfire, and the deeds of the people of Hellfire they will be doing.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh-ul-Islam stated that these Hadiths and others stand as decisive texts closed to Ta&#8217;wil (allegorical interpretation). They were accepted and authenticated by the Muslim Ummah. The Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah many times mention Allah&#8217;s Attribute of having a Hand including that He (Exalted be He) created with His Hand, His Hands are widely outstretched and the dominion is in His Hand. Also, the Sunnah is replete with mention of this attribute. It is impossible that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and the Imams omitted to explain to people that these texts do not imply the apparent meaning or should not be interpreted in the literal sense.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That this continued until <strong>Jahm ibn Safwan</strong> came a long time after the era of Sahabah to explain to people what was revealed to their Prophet (peace be upon him)! Then <strong>Bishr ibn Ghiyath</strong> followed his path as well as others accused of hypocrisy imitated him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) taught us everything; even how to make Istinja&#8217; (cleansing the private parts with water after urination or defecation). He (peace be upon said) said: I have left nothing which can lead you to Paradise except that I explained it to you. I have left you on white (clear) proof; its night is like its day. None shall deviate from it after me except that he is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is illogical after that the Prophet (peace be upon him) would ignore the claim that apparent meanings of the texts contained in the Book and Sunnah imply <strong>Tajsim</strong> (anthropomorphism) and <strong>Tashbih</strong> and that whoever believe in the apparent meanings is misguided without explaining or manifesting the truth. It is also impossible that the Salaf say we should pass these texts as they were revealed while they intend the metaphorical meaning. If they had implied metaphorically certain attributes, the Arabs would have realized this. Persians and Romans cannot be more knowledgeable of Arabic language than the sons of Muhajirun (Emigrants from Makkah to Madinah) and Ansar (Helpers, inhabitants of Madinah who supported the Prophet).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><br />
Q: There is a frightening nightmare haunting me frequently. While sleeping I dream that there is something within my mouth resembling dough. It makes it difficult for me to breathe and speak. Many times I try to remove or take out of it with my hand but it comes again, which breaks my sleep. I am frightened of this nightmare that disturbed my life and obsessed my thinking. I do not know the reason behind this, knowing that I observe performing Prayer and Fast and performed Pilgrimage. I often ask for Allah&#8217;s Forgiveness and repent to Him. Yet it haunts me within a period of two, four, or five months. I ask Allah (Exalted be He) that you will give me an explanation for this frightening dream. May Allah guide you to what brings out the good of this life and the Hereafter. Allah is in the help of a servant as long as he is in the help of his brother.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This nightmare is from Satan. It is ordained for you and for every Muslim man and woman seeing what he hates to spit dryly to his left side thrice and to seek refuge with Allah from Satan and from the evil of what he saw (three times). Then he should resume sleeping on the other side. This way, what he sees cannot harm him. One should not tell anyone about this because it was authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon him):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#800080;">&#8220;A good dreamis from Allah and a bad dream is from Satan. Anyone who sees something (in a dream) that they hate, should spit to their left three times and seek refuge with Allah three times from the evil of Satan and of what they have seen. Then they should turn on the other side and it will not harm them. They should tell no one about ii.&#8221;</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This authentic Hadith relieves both the believing man and woman seeing what they hate. Praise be to Allah, it is a great remedy available.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O brother, you should put this into action and relieve your heart with this Prophetic remedy. May Allah grant us all success!</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Question</strong> : A Muslim sister asks about the ruling on turning one&#8217;s head during Salah to seek refuge in Allah from the devil called Khanzab (a devil that distracts a servant at the time of prayer)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: There is no harm in turning the head during Salah seeking refuge in Allah from the accursed Satan when casting his insinuations. Rather, it is desirable when there is a dire need for it on condition that it is done by moving one&#8217;s head only, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered ‘Uthman ibn Abul-‘As Ath-Thaqafi (may Allah be pleased with him) to do so when he complained to the Prophet about the insinuating thoughts that Satan casts during prayers, so he ordered him <strong>to spit (dryly) to his left side three times and seek refuge in Allah from Satan</strong><span style="color:#ff6600;">.</span>[1] He did so and Allah granted him recovery.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for turning one&#8217;s head during performing Salah without a due reason, this is undesirable. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about this, he said: It is a quick stealing by which Satan takes away (a portion) from the prayer of a person (By making him glance left and right). May Allah guide us all to what pleases Him! He is All-Hearing and Responsive.</p>

<p>From ‘Abdul ‘Aziz Bin ‘Abdullah Ibn Baz to those who receive this among Muslims. May Allah guide all Muslims and increase their knowledge and faith, amen!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As-salamu ‘alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!) It gives me pleasure to remind my Muslim brothers that &#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is of the Sunnah for a Muslim to say after each obligatory Salah, whether one is the Imam (the one who leads the congregational Salah), Ma&#8217;mum (a person being led by an Imam in Prayer) or Mufarid (a person who performs prayer alone) to say, <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>three times</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>أَسْـتَغْفِرُ الله </strong><span style="color:#808000;"><strong><br />
&#8220;Astagfir Allah&#8221; </strong></span>[#1]<br />
(I ask Allah forgiveness)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> and then say,</p>
<p><strong>اللّهُـمَّ أَنْـتَ السَّلامُ ، وَمِـنْكَ السَّلام ، تَبارَكْتَ يا ذا الجَـلالِ وَالإِكْـرام</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#ff6600;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>&#8220;Allahumma Anta Al-Salam Wa Minka Al-Salam, Tabarakta Wa Ta’alayta Ya-dhal-Jalali Wal-Ikram&#8221; </strong></span><span style="color:#000000;">[#1]</span><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">(O Allah, You are Al-Salam [the One Who is free from all defects and deficiencies] and from You is all peace, blessed are You, Possessor of majesty and honor!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If one is Imam, one should turn facing the people. The Imam, those praying behind him, or a person offering Salah individually should say,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>لَا إِلهَ إِلَّا اللهُ وَحْدَهُ لَا شَرِيكَ لَهُ، لَهُ الْمُلْكُ وَلَهُ الْحَمْدُ وَهُوَ عَلَى كُلِّ شَيْءٍ قَدِيرٌ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>لَا حَوْلَ وَلَا قُوَّةَ إِلَّا بِاللهِ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ، وَلَا نَعْبُدُ إِلَّا إِيَّاهُ، لَه النِّعْمَةُ وَلَهُ الْفَضْلُ وَلَهُ الثَّنَاءُ الْحَسَنُ، لَا إِلَهَ إِلَّا اللهُ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ الدِّينَ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ الْكَافِرُونَ</strong></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It is recommended for the Imam, Ma&#8217;mum, and Munfarid to recite these supplications <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>audibly</strong> </span>after each obligatory Salah in a low voice without disturbing others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is authentically reported in the two Sahih on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) <span style="color:#808000;"><strong>that raising one&#8217;s voice in supplication after concluding the obligatory Salah was during the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him). Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them) said, &#8220;I used to know when they finished the Salah by this (supplications as they were said aloud) if I heard them.&#8221; </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">not permissible to say these supplications collectively</span>. Each worshipper should recite them individually without observing the voice of others, because reciting supplications collectively is Bid’ah and has no basis in the divine Shari’ah (law) of Allah.</p>
<p>It is recommended for Imam, Ma&#8217;mum, and Munfarid to recite</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Ayat-ul-Kursy</strong></span> (the Qur’anic Verse of Allah’s Foot stool, Surah Al-Baqarah, 2:255<strong>)  </strong>[#3]  <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>inaudibly</strong></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After that,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Surah-Al-Iklas </strong></span>(the Qur&#8217;an, Surah 112),</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Surah-Al-Falaq </strong></span>(the Qur&#8217;an, Surah 113), and</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>Surah-Al-Nas </strong></span>(the Qur&#8217;an, Surah 114)</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">inaudibly</span> </strong>after each obligatory Salah and <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>repeat them three times</strong> after the Maghrib (Sunset) and Fajr (Dawn) Salahs</span>. [#4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is preferable, for the authenticity of what we have mentioned above.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;"><strong>Copying the Divine Characteristics</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From <strong>`Abdul `Aziz Bin `Abdullah Ibn Baz</strong> to the honorable brother Shaykh: `A. S. H.; may Allah protect him! As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!). To commence: <span style="color:#ff0000;">I received your noble letter dated 23/3/1386 A.H., may Allah guide you! It included a question regarding what a Khatib (preacher) mentioned in the Friday Khutbah (sermon) on urging Muslims to acquire Allah&#8217;s Attributes and Characteristics. Is this acceptable? Was this acknowledged by any notable scholar?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This expression is improper, but it has a true meaning, which is urging people to acquire the good meanings of the Names and Attributes of Allah which befit them, not those peculiar to Allah (Glorified be He) such as the Creator, the Sustainer and the God. Such characteristics cannot be acquired by human beings, and it is impermissible for people to claim them. The same applies to similar Names.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, Muslims can acquire the Attributes which Allah likes His Servants to acquire, such as being knowledgeable, powerful, merciful, patient, generous, forgiving, etc. He (Glorified be He) is Knowledgeable and He likes knowledgeable people; He is Powerful and He likes powerful people more than the weak; He is Generous and He likes the generous; He is Merciful and He likes the merciful; He is Forgiving and He likes the forgiving.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, Allah&#8217;s Attributes are incomparable, greater and more perfect than those acquired by people, as there is nothing like Him (Glorified be He) in His Attributes and Actions, just as there is nothing like Him in His Entity. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">A person can only have a share of the meaning of these Attributes that befits them in a Shar`y (Islamic legal) way</span>. Accordingly, if a person becomes too generous, they are considered spendthrifts. If they become too merciful, they will hinder the execution of Hudud (pl. of Had i.e. an ordained punishment for violating Allah’s Law) and Ta`zir (discretionary punishment). If they become too forgiving, they will show forgiveness when it should not be shown.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The foregoing was stated by the prominent scholar Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah be merciful with him) in his two books entitled `Uddat Al-Sabirin and Al-Wabil Al-Sayyib. He might have also mentioned it in other books such as Al-Madarij, Zad Al-Ma`ad, and others.Following are his exact words on this regard in the two books mentioned above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Al-`Uddah p. 310, he said: &#8220;As Allah (Glorified be He) is the Thankful One in reality, the most beloved to Him among His creatures are the thankful, and the most hated to Him are those who acquire the opposite trait. This example also applies to the rest of Allah&#8217;s Most Beautiful Names. Allah thus detests the Kafir (disbelievers), the oppressor, the ignorant, the cruel, the miser, the coward, and the humiliated. He (Glorified be He) is Graceful and He loves grace; He is Knowledgeable and He loves knowledge; He is Merciful and He loves mercy; He is Bountiful and He loves Bounty; He is Concealing and He loves concealment; He is Powerful and He hates weakness, for a Mu&#8217;min (believer) of strong faith is nearer to Him than a weak one; He is Forgiving and He loves forgiveness; and He is Odd (One) and He loves odd numbers. Anything He loves is one of the meanings of His Names and Traits; and anything He detests is their opposite.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Ibn Al-Qayyim</strong> said in (p. 543) of the Hadith Collection of Al-Wabil Al-Sayyib:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Generosity is one of the Attributes of Allah (Exalted be He); He gives and does not take; He feeds and is not fed; and He is the Most Generous One. The most beloved to Him is whoever acquires the same traits; He is Generous and He loves the generous; He is Knowledgeable and He loves the knowledgeable; He is Powerful and He loves the courageous; and He is Beautiful and He loves beauty. End of quote.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I hope that what we have mentioned is sufficient. May Allah guide us all to understand His religion and fulfill His rights. He is All-Hearer, Ever Near. As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Merits of memorizing Allah&#8217;s Names</strong></p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: What is meant by the word &#8220;Ahsa'&#8221; in the Hadith that is related to the Messenger of Allah on the Names of Allah &#8220;Anyone who enumerates (Ahsa&#8217;) them will be admitted to Paradise.&#8221; ?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Ihsa&#8217; means to memorize, contemplate, understand and act according to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <span style="color:#993300;">Truly, Allahhas Ninety-nine Names. Anyone who enumerates them will be admitted to Paradise</span>.&#8221; and in another wording: &#8220;<span style="color:#993300;">Anyone who memorizes them by heart, will be admitted to Paradise</span>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This means to memorize these Names by heart and understand their meaning as this entails goodness and useful knowledge. It also leads to the uprightness of the heart and the more a person will fear Allah and fulfill His Rights.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Your Eminence Shaykh! Some people may count on such Hadiths and think that memorizing the Most Beautiful Names of Allah without effort is sufficient to be admitted to Paradise?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: This is a misunderstanding as such a Hadith urges Muslims to act according to what the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) prescribed and called for such as: &#8220;<span style="color:#993300;">Anyone who memorizes them by heart, they will be admitted to Paradise</span>.&#8221; with regard to the MostBeautiful Names of Allah, and: <span style="color:#993300;">&#8220;Fasting the Day of `Arafah (9th of Dhul-Hijjah) expiates the sins of two years: past one and coming one</span>.&#8221; Fasting on the Day of `Ashura’ (10th of Muharram) atones for the sins committed in the preceding year. All these Hadiths urge the Muslims to obey Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). It is one of the reasons of forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">When a Muslim pursues the means of forgiveness and does not insist on comitting major sins, this will be a reason for his forgiveness</span>. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">If a Muslim does not avoid committing major sins, these will not take effect</span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;The Five Obligatory Daily Prayers and from Friday Prayer to Friday Prayer, and from Ramadan to Ramadan, are expiations for what happened between them, provided the major sins were avoided.&#8221; And in another wording: &#8220;unless major sins are committed.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">The Jumhur (dominant majority of scholars) holds the view that the promise of forgiveness that is stated in Hadith on the merits of such and such, such as the favor of Salah (Prayer) and how they erase one&#8217;s sins, or the favor of Wudu&#8217; (ablution), fasting on the Day of `Arafah (9th of Dhul-Hijjah), fasting on the Day of `Ashura’ (10th of Muharram) or Ihsa&#8217; the Most Beautiful Names of Allah, etc., is conditional upon avoiding major sins and uprightness</span>. These acts are reasons for having one&#8217;s sins forgiven in addition to the other reasons which Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) had legislated and avoiding major sins which prevent forgiveness.Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, And those who, when they have committed Fâhishah (illegal sexual intercourse) or wronged themselves with evil, remember Allâh and ask forgiveness for their sins; &#8211; and none can forgive sins but Allâh &#8211; and do not persist in what (wrong) they have done, while they know. One of the reasons for having sins not forgiven is insisting on committing sins and not repenting, there is neither might nor power except with Allah!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>To sum up</strong>: The Promise of Allah to admit anyone who memorizes the Beautiful Names of Allah to Paradise, anyone who fasts on the Day of `Ashura&#8217; to atone the sins committed in the preceding year, and fasting on the Day of `Arafah are all conditional upon abandoning major sins. This is also mentioned in a Hadith related to Tawhid (monotheism) such as: &#8220;Give the good news of entering Paradise to anyone who honestly testifies that there is no god but Allah.&#8221; This is conditional upon abandoning sins. If a person insists on doing sins, they are left to the Will of Allah; He may forgive him or He may throw them into Hell-Fire because of their sins and because they did not repent. When a person is purified of their sins, they will come out of Hell-Fire and will be admitted to Paradise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every Muslim should not rely on the Hadiths encouraging and promising good and refrain from the Hadiths and Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) of threatening. They should act according to both and beware of the things which Allah prohibited.They should remember the Hadiths and Ayahs that threaten those who transgress the limits set by Allah and disobey His Commands and at the same time they should anticipate good from Allah, hope for His Mercy and remember His Promise to forgive anyone who performs good deeds. A person should combine between Khawf (fear) and Raja&#8217; (hope). A Muslim should not despair or feel secure. This is the way of the scholars and the believers. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says about His prophets: Verily, they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on Us with hope and fear , i.e., hope and fear and used to humble themselves before Us. And Those whom they call upon [like ‘Isâ (Jesus) &#8211; son of Maryam (Mary), ‘Uzair (Ezra), angel] desire (for themselves) means of access to their Lord (Allâh), as to which of them should be the nearest; and they [‘Isâ (Jesus), ‘Uzair (Ezra), angels and others] hope for His Mercy and fear His Torment. This is the path of the believers who follow the Messengers. They believe in Allah Alone, fear Him, perform His obligatory acts, refrain from the things which He has prohibited, put their hopes in Him, and fear His Punishment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ruling on Ta’wil (</strong><strong>Figurative Interpretation) </strong> of Allah’s Attributes</p>
<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q 4: What is the ruling on ta’wil (allegorical interpretation) of Allah’s Attributes?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Ta’wil of Allah’s Attributes is <strong>Munkar</strong> (disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and is not permissible. In fact, it is obligatory for the Attributes of Allah to be accepted as stated, according to their apparent meaning that befits Allah’s Glory (Glorified and Exalted be He), without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), Ta‘til (denial), Takyif (describing how), or Tamthil (likening His Attributes to those of His Creation).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) informs us of His Names and Attributes, saying: [<span style="color:#993300;">There is nothing like Him</span>]; and [<span style="color:#993300;">He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer</span>]. As Muslims, we have to accept them as they are, according to the opinion of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama‘ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body). They advise Muslims to acknowledge Allah’s Attributes as they are, without Takyif. They should be accepted as they are, without Tahrif, Ta’wil or Takyif. Muslims should attest to Allah’s Attributes as they were revealed, according to their apparent meaning and as befits Allah’s Stature, without any Takyif or Tamthil. For example, Allah says: [<span style="color:#993300;">The Most Gracious (Allâh) rose over (Istawâ) the (Mighty) Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty)</span>]. In this Ayah (Qur’anic verse) and similar ones, we are told that Allah rose over the Throne, which is in a manner that suits His Majesty and Grandeur, and the manner of this cannot be compared to that of any of His creatures. The scholars who follow Al-Haqq (the Truth) see this as signifying His Highness and Exaltedness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same applies to other Attributes of Allah, such as His Eye, Hearing, Sight, Hand, Foot, and other Attributes that are authentically reported in Nas (Islamic texts from the Qur’an or the Sunnah). All of these Attributes are as befits Allah (Exalted be He) and are not comparable to those of any creature. This is the opinion of the scholars from among the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) and those after them from the Imams (initiators of a School of Jurisprudence), such as Al-Awza‘y, Al-Thawry, Malik, Abu Hanifah, Ahmad, Ishaq, and other Muslim Imams (may Allah be merciful to them all).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah says, when relating the story of Prophet Nuh (Noah, peace be upon him): [<span style="color:#993300;">And We carried him on a (ship) made of planks and nails, Floating under Our Eyes</span>] He (Glorified be He) also says when relating the story of Prophet Musa (Moses, peace be upon him): [<span style="color:#993300;">in order that you may be brought up under My Eye</span>]. Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama‘ah explained the Ayah where Allah says: Floating under Our Eyes by saying that He (Glorified be He) let the ship float under His Care until it rested on Mount Judy. Similarly, when Allah says: in order that you may be brought up under My Eye. they say that He (Glorified be He) means that Musa (peace be upon him) will be brought up under His Care and with His Guidance to those in charge of raising him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the same manner, when Allah (may He be Praised) says to the Prophet (peace be upon him): [<span style="color:#993300;">So wait patiently (O Muhammad Sallalaahu Alahi wa Sallam) for the Decision of your Lord, for verily, you are under Our Eyes</span>] He means that Muhammad is under Allah’s Protection and Care. <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#666699;text-decoration:underline;">These interpretations do not fall under the prohibited Ta’wil; rather, they fall under Tafsir (explanation/exegesis) well-known in the Arabic language and its styles</span></span>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A third example is in a Hadith Qudsy (Revelation from Allah in the Prophet’s words)where Allah (Glorified be He) says: “<span style="color:#993300;">[Anyone who comes nearer to Me by a span, I come nearer to them by a cubit; and anyone who comes nearer to Me by a cubit, I come nearer to them by a fathom; and anyone who comes to Me walking, I come to them running</span>].” These words are accepted as they were revealed from Allah (may He be Praised and Exalted) without Tahrif, Takyif, or Tamthil, but in the way that is wanted by Allah. The same thing can be said about Allah’s Descent at the end of the night, His Hearing, Sight, Anger, Pleasure, Laughter, Happiness, and other authentically established Attributes of Allah. They all must be accepted as they were revealed, in the manner that befits Allah, without any Takyif, Tahrif, Ta‘til or Tamthil. This is because Allah says: <span style="color:#993300;">[There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer]</span>. and many Ayahs to the same effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">As for Ta’wil of Allah’s Attributes and diverging them from apparent meaning, this is the methodology of those who follow Bid‘ah (innovations in religion)</span>, such as the Jahmiyyah and the Mu‘tazilah (deviant Islamic sects), and those who follow them. Their Madh-habs (Schools of Jurisprudence) are Batil (null and void), and have been denied and renounced by Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama‘ah, who have warned people against their promoters. And Allah is the Grantor of success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;">Source : <a href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=95&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">alifta.com</a> &#8211; Fatwas of Ibn Baz</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) mentions two types of Maiyyah (Allah being with His creation): general and particular.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first is mentioned in the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse): <span style="color:#008000;">And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be</span>. The second is mentioned in the Ayah: <span style="color:#008000;">Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allâh is with us</span>. and: <span style="color:#008000;">I am with you both, hearing and seeing</span>. There are other Ayahs to the same effect.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) are of the opinion that <strong>Ma`iyyah</strong> is one of the Attributes of Allah (Glorified be He) as befits His Glory. Moreover, they attest to Allah&#8217;s <strong>Istiwa</strong>&#8216; (Allah&#8217;s rising over the Throne in a manner that befits Him), His `<strong>Uluw</strong> (Allah being high above His creation) and His Glorification above mixing with His creations. Allah (Glorified be He) is the Most High despite His Nearness and the Most Near despite His Highness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two Attributes of Ma`iyyah and `Uluw &#8211; in a manner that befits Allah &#8211; do not involve <strong>Tashbih</strong> (comparison) to one of His creations or negate one another.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jahmiyyah and Mu`tazilah</strong> (deviant Islamic sects) uses the Ayahs to prove Allah&#8217;s Ma`iyyah, deny Allah&#8217;s `Uluw and claim that He is Omnipresent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Salaf (righteous predecessors)</strong> denied these claims and agreed that Allah&#8217;s Ma`iyyah entails His Knowledge of His servants&#8217; affairs despite His Istiwa&#8217;. That is why Allah begins and ends the Ayahs referring to general Ma`iyyah by mentioning His Knowledge in order to inform His servants that His Ma`iyyah entails His encompassing Knowledge of their affairs. Based upon this, the majority of the Salaf scholars have interpreted the Ayahs which mention Ma`iyyah as referring to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge. Other scholars have discussed Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah&#8217;s consensus on interpreting Ayahs talking about Ma`iyyah as referring to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge and denying the claims of Jahmiyyah and Mu`tazilah, who say Allah is Omnipresent and who deny His Attributes of `Uluw and Istiwa&#8217; (May Allah curse them! How can they deny the Truth).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, we know that interpreting the word &#8220;Ma`iyyah&#8221; as Knowledge is not only the opinion of <strong>Shaykh Taqiy Al-Din</strong> only, but is also the opinion of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah. The Shaykh (may Allah be merciful with him) wrote in his book &#8220;<strong>Al-Wasitiyyah</strong>&#8221; what supports the obligation of believing in the two Attributes of Allah, namely `Uluw and Ma`iyyah without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning) and false claims. You can refer to the book if you are interested. In general, the Shaykh (may Allah be merciful with him) meant that it is obligatory to confirm the Ma`iyyah and `Uluw of Allah above the Throne in a manner that befits Him and does not compare Him to any of His creations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Al-Hafizh ibn Kathir</strong> (may Allah be merciful with him) while interpreting the Ayah: There is no Najwâ (secret counsel) of three but He is their fourth (with His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the Throne, over the seventh heaven) he said, &#8220;The majority of scholars agree that what is meant in this Ayah,regarding Ma`iyyah, is Allah&#8217;s Knowledge and there is no doubt in this&#8221;. These words do not negate interpreting Ma`iyyah as knowledge, since it is what is meant and intended by it. This is the true meaning of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ma`iyyah refers to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge of all things related to the affairs of His servants, as for its manner, it is only known to Allah just as the rest of His Attributes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah believe in the Names and Attributes of Allah and understand their meanings but do not know their manner. Only Allah knows the exact manner of assuming His Attributes, as He alone knows His Dhat (Essence). Exalted and Glorified be He above the false claims of those who deny or compare His Attributes to those of humans.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Imam Malik</strong> (may Allah be merciful with him) and other scholars among Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;Allah&#8217;s Istiwa&#8217; is known, its manner is unknown, and believing in it is obligatory.&#8221;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the adopted view in relation to all of Allah&#8217;s Attributes and Allah knows best.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">True Meaning of &#8216;Laa ilaaha illa Allaah&#8217; is :  <strong><span style="color:#993300;">There is no deity truly worthy of worship except Allah</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise is due to Allah alone and may peace and blessings be upon the Noblest of the messengers, our Prophet Muhammad, his family, his Companions, Tabi`un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) and those who followed them in the best manner until the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I have read the article written by our brother in Islam, the eminent Shaykh `Umar ibn Ahmad Al-Millibary on the meaning of &#8216;La ilaha illa Allah&#8217;. I read the explanation of the shaykh thoroughly on the three points of view regarding its meaning. The definitions are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>, it means that there is no deity truly worthy of worship except Allah.<br />
<strong>Second</strong>, that there is no deity truly worthy of obedience except Allah.<br />
<strong>Third</strong>, that there is no god but Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The correct definition, as he stated, is the first which is clarified in the Book of Allah (may He be Praised) many times. For instance, Allah (may He be Praised) states, You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything). and, And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. He (may He be Praised) also states, And I (Allâh) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone). and, That is because Allâh — He is the Truth (the only True God of all that exists, Who has no partners or rivals with Him), and what they (the polytheists) invoke besides Him, it is Bâtil (falsehood).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) to this effect. Moreover, this is the meaning that the polytheists understood from &#8216;La ilaha illa Allah&#8217;, when the Prophet (peace be upon him) called them to it, saying: O my people, say &#8216;La ilaha illa Allah&#8217;, to succeed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They denied it and haughtily rejected to accept him because they understood that it contradicts their forefathers&#8217; worship of idols, trees and stones and their deification, as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) mentions in Surah (Qur&#8217;anic chapter) Sad, And they (Arab pagans) wonder that a warner (Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) has come to them from among themselves. And the disbelievers say: &#8220;This (Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) is a sorcerer, a liar. &#8220;Has he made the âlihah (gods) (all) into One Ilâh (God &#8211; Allâh). Verily, this is a curious thing!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Surah Al-Saffat (ayat 35 and 36), Allah states concerning the polytheists: <span style="color:#0000ff;">Truly, when it was said to them: La ilaha illa Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah), they puffed themselves up with pride (i.e. denied it). And (they) said: &#8220;Are we going to abandon our alihah (gods) for the sake of a mad poet?&#8221;</span> This indicates that the polytheists understood that the meaning of &#8216;La ilaha illa Allah&#8217; superseded their deities and necessitated dedicating their acts of worship to Allah Alone. Thus, when one of them embraced Islam, he gave up Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and dedicated acts of worship to Allah Alone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#0000ff;">Had &#8216;La ilaha illa Allah&#8217; meant only that there is no god but Allah, or that there is none worthy of obedience but Allah, they would have never rejected it. That is because they already knew that Allah is their Lord and Creator Who must be obeyed in the orders they believed to come from Him. Rather, they believed that worship of idols, prophets, angels, righteous people, trees and the like were their intercessors with Allah and brought them closer to Him</span></strong>. Allah says in Surah Yunus, aya 18: And they worship besides Allah things that harm them not, nor profit them, and they say: &#8220;These are our intercessors with Allah.&#8221;  Say: “Do you inform Allâh of that which He knows not in the heavens and on the earth?” Glorified and Exalted is He above all that which they associate as partners (with Him)! He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also states: The revelation of this Book (the Qur’ân) is from Allâh, the All-Mighty, the All-Wise. Verily We have sent down the Book to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) in truth: So worship Allâh (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allâh’s sake only. Surely the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allâh only. And those who take Auliyâ’ (protectors, helpers, lords, gods) besides Him (say): “We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allâh.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The pagans admitted that they worshiped others only to bring them near to Allah, but Allah (may He be Praised) responded to this, Verily, Allâh will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Truly, Allâh guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Praised) declared that they are both liars in the claim that their deities bring them near to Allah, and disbelievers because of committing this act. There are many Ayahs that support this meaning.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise be to Allah, Lord of the worlds. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, his Companions, Tabi`un and those who followed them in the best manner until the Day of Resurrection!</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#888888;">Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds. May peace and blessings be upon the Servant of Allah, His Messenger, the best of His Creatures, and His Trustee over His revelation, our Prophet, Imam, Muhammad ibn `Abdullah. May Allah&#8217;s Peace and Blessings be upon his family, Companions, and those who adopt his way and follow his guidance until the Day of Resurrection!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear honorable brothers, my address to you will be on the <span style="color:#666699;">fundamentals of Iman</span>. This topic was chosen by the university and I agreed to deliver this speech because it is an <span style="color:#666699;">exceptionally important matter</span>. It is acknowledged that our Deen (Islam) is established upon these tenets, as our Ummah (nation) cannot succeed, live in a state of happiness, security, and glory above other nations except through holding fast to these tenets and acting accordingly in terms of its statements, actions, general conduct, Jihad, and all its affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Qur&#8217;an makes these fundamentals clear in many Ayahs (Qur&#8217;anic verses) and are also explained in the Prophet&#8217;s Hadiths (peace be upon him). <strong><span style="color:#666699;">The six fundamentals of Iman</span></strong> are themselves the tenets of the Islamic faith, for preaching Iman in Allah is the foremost objective of this Deen which awakens people&#8217;s inclination towards piety, guidance, and Taqwa (fearing Allah as He should be feared). It is the essence of the Message of the Prophet (peace be upon him) who propagated beneficial knowledge and practicing good deeds. All this falls under the realm of Iman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These six fundamentals have been explained in the Noble Book in different Ayahs, and highlighted in the Prophet&#8217;s Hadiths. Allah (may He be Praised) states in His Book: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 177" target="_blank" name="ItisnotAl-Birr(piety,righteousness,"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to Allâh, etc.) that you turn your faces towards east and (or) west (in prayers); but Al-Birr is (the quality of) the one who believes in Allâh, the Last Day, the Angels, the Book, the Prophets</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (may He be Praised and Exalted) mentions in this Ayah fivefundamentals of Iman: To believe In Allah, the Last Day, His angels, Books, and Messengers. These are five matters upon which Islam is based in all its aspects. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 285" target="_blank" name="TheMessenger(Muhammadصلىالله"></a>The Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) believes in what has been sent down to him from his Lord, and (so do) the believers. Each one believes in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers. (They say), &#8220;We make no distinction between one another of His Messengers</span>&#8220;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span id="more-277"></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this Ayah, Allah mentions four matters in His statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 285" target="_blank" name="TheMessenger(Muhammadصلىالله"></a>E<span style="color:#0000ff;">ach one believes in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, and His Messengers</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah makes no mention of the Last Day although He mentioned it in the previous Ayah and others. This is Allah&#8217;s Law in His Book, as He variegates the discourse about His omnipotence (Glorified and Exalted be He), His Names, and Attributes, the tenets of this Deen, the events of the Day of Resurrection, about Jannah (Paradise) and Hellfire, His messengers and their nations, for the purpose of increasing the Iman and knowledge of those who ponder over the Ayahs of His Book and seek more knowledge with every Surah, even every Ayah of this Glorious Book or every Hadith narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). However, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) mentions the Last Day at the end of the Ayah, as He states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#0000ff;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 285" target="_blank" name="TheMessenger(Muhammadصلىالله"></a>(We seek) Your Forgiveness, our Lord, and to You is the return (of all)</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 136" target="_blank" name="Oyouwhobelieve!BelieveinAllâh,"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">O you who believe! Believe in Allâh, and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and the Book (the Qur’ân) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him); and whosoever disbelieves in Allâh, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far away</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah explains in this Ayah so that whoever disbelieves in these fundamental articles of Iman has strayed far from the Straight Path. There are many Ayahs to the same effect. At some places of the Qur&#8217;an, Allah mentions independently believing in Him alone, because all the articles of faith are part and parcel of having Iman in Allah, while in others He mentions belief in Him and His Messenger, or in Him and the Last Day.This is because believing in Allah naturally includes other matters of Iman mentioned in the other Ayahs, such as believing in angels, Books, messengers, and the Last Day. In this regard, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 136" target="_blank" name="Oyouwhobelieve!BelieveinAllâh,"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Believe in Allâh, and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and the Book (the Qur’ân) which He has sent down to His Messenger, and the Scripture which He sent down to those before (him)</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah confined this Ayah to having Iman in Allah, His Messenger, the Book sent down upon Muhammad (peace be upon him), and the Book revealed before. He did not mention the other articles of Iman because they are included in the belief in Allah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) further states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Taghabun, 64: 8" target="_blank" name="Therefore,believeinAllâhand"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Therefore, believe in Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and in the Light (this Qur’ân) which We have sent down</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> He mentioned believing in Allah, His Messenger, and the light revealed to Muhammad, namely the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah, because the other matters are contained in that light, and so are all that Allah and His Messenger informed about regarding what was and will be. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hadid, 57: 7" target="_blank" name="BelieveinAllâhandHisMessenger"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Believe in Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and spend of that whereof He has made you trustees. And such of you as believe and spend (in Allâh’s Way), theirs will be a great reward</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />Here, Allah only mentions Iman in Allah and His Messenger because other essential requirements of Iman are basically included in believing in Allah and His Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[Islam and Iman]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah also provides support for this. For example, the well-known Hadith of Jibril (Gabriel) when he asked the prophet (peace be upon him) about Islam, Iman and Ihsan (the perfection of Faith). He first asked about Islam, and in another narration he began by asking about Iman then mentioned Islam and Ihsan. The point is that he first asked about the requirements of Iman because it purifies the Muslim inwardly in a way that is reflected upon his outward behavior. This is why Allah defined Islam as outward submission because it has to do with a Muslim&#8217;s submissiveness to Allah (may He be Praised). The word &#8220;Islam&#8221; indicates submission to Allah (Exalted be He), and obeying His Commands. For that reason, Allah called the outward matters of worship &#8216;Islam&#8217; as they include humbling oneself and worshipping Him, obeying His Commands and abiding by His laws.It is said &#8220;A person submitted and surrendered to another i.e. he humbled himself to someone and followed his commands. Likewise, submission to Allah means humbling oneself to Him and observing His Shari&#8217;ah (may He be Praised and Exalted).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Islam means outward submission to Allah while Iman combines inward and outward submission to Him as in observance of the teachings of Allah&#8217;s Purified Shar`ah (Law).</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That is why they were coupled in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) explained Islam as outward deeds which testify to one&#8217;s submission that includes verbal testimony that there is no God worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger, performance of the five daily prayers, payment of Zakah, fasting the month of Ramadan, and performing Hajj to the Sacred House in Makkah. Also, Iman has to do with inward submission that includes believing in Allah and His Angels, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sahih Hadith reads: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="OMessengerofAllahwhatarethe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">O Messenger of Allah, what are the best acts? He said: to feed the food and send regardings to whom you know and to whom you know not.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> According to another Hadith: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="WhoseIslamisthebestiewho"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Whose Islam is the best i.e. who is a very good Muslim? He replied: One who avoids harming the Muslims with his tongue and hands.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, the word &#8220;Islam&#8221; refers to the outward deed which demonstrates a servant&#8217;s submission to Allah&#8217;s commands, obeying His Shari`ah, and abiding by it while Iman is akin to the inward Iman in one&#8217;s heart such as believing in Allah, His Angels, Books, Messengers, the Last Day, and Qadar (predestination) whether good or bad. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about Iman, he said, <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="TohavefaithinAllahHisAngels"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">To have faith in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and the Divine destiny whether good or bad.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> He explained Iman as believing in these six matters which are essentially the fundamentals of Faith and the Deen of Islam, for whoever lacks Iman has no share in Islam, and whoever lacks Islam is not a Mu&#8217;min (believer). Accordingly, believing in these essential requirements of Iman is a prerequisite for the validity of one&#8217;s Islam. However, a Muslim&#8217;s Iman might be perfect or not, as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) stated about the Bedouins: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hujurat, 49: 14" target="_blank" name="Thebedouinssay:^Webelieve.^"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Say: “You believe not but you only say, ‘We have surrendered (in Islâm)&#8221;</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Because their Iman was not perfect and did not fulfill the essential requirements to be true believers, Allah denied them the perfect Iman as this cannot be associated with those who neglect religious obligations, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Thereisnofaithforaperson"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">There is no faith, for a person who does not have patience</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Similarly, he (peace be upon him) said: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="“Noneofyouwillbelieveuntil"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">“None of you will believe until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself.”</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="HewhobelievesinAllahandthe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">He who believes in Allah and the Last Day should either utter good words or better keep silent; and he who believes in Allah and the Last Day should show hospitality to his guest. He who believes in Allah and the Last Day should keep good relation with his Kith and kin. He who believes in Allah and the Last Day should not hurt his neighbors.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> To explain it further, Iman entails practicing good deeds. Thus, Islam without Iman is the act of hypocrites. The perfect Iman necessitates abiding by what Allah and His Messenger commanded and refraining from what they forbade. If a Muslim falls short in adhering to this, then he is not a believer as Allah negated Iman from the Bedouins in His statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hujurat, 49: 14" target="_blank" name="Thebedouinssay:^Webelieve.^"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Say: “You believe not but you only say, ‘We have surrendered (in Islâm)</span>&#8220;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />and as negated also by the previous Hadiths.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To summarize, Allah (may He be Praised) and His Messenger denied the Iman of those who neglected some obligations of faith, although they remained within the fold of Islam. These six tenets are the core of the Deen of Islam; whoever fulfills them along with the outward matters of Iman, then they are believing Muslims. But those who neglect these tenets have no share either in Islam or Iman. Their status is like that of hypocrites who pretentiously adopted Islam, identified themselves as believers, offered Salah (Prayer) with Muslims, performed Hajj, and even fought in the cause of Allah but they are inwardly not with the Muslims, let alone those who antagonize them for nothing except their detesting the Deen of Allah and His Messenger and they belie and deny what was revealed to the messengers. They claim to be Muslims to fulfill their own wicked desires. Allah has exposed their matter and declared their Kufr (disbelief) and misguidance; they become even more disbelieving than those who openly declare their Kufr, and that is why they will go to Hell and abide there eternallyin the lowest place of the Fire. This is what they deserve because their evil towards the Islamic faith is emphatically confirmed and Muslims can be deceived by their pretension of being brothers and some important secrets might be disclosed to them which they exploit to harm Muslims and betray them. That is why their Kufr is more severe and their evil is more harmful. The same applies to whomever claims to believe in these fundamentals of Iman and does not offer the outward obligations of Islam such as testifying that there is no deity except Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger, offering Salah, Sawm (Fast), paying Zakah, performing Hajj or neglecting other outward practices of Islam which Allah has enjoined. This is evidence of their lacking Iman or its weakness. They are ar risk for Allah may reject their Faith as it is unanimously agreed upon that Iman is denied by not offering the two testimonies of Faith. However, Iman cannot be completely rejected from a Muslim, rather their Iman is not perfect owing to their falling short in certain obligations such as observing Sawm, performing Hajj and paying Zakah; although having the ability to do so and other matters defined by the majority of scholars. Whoever abandons such obligations, then he is Fasiq (someone flagrantly violating Islamic law) and devoid of guidance, but not a Murtad (apostate) according to the majority of the scholars as long as he does not deny such obligations. As for the obligation of Salah, some scholars held the view that neglecting it is a form of apostasy from Islam even if a person does not deny its obligation in accordance with the soundest opinion among scholars based on many proofs including the Prophet&#8217;s statement: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Thatwhichdifferentiatesusfrom"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">That which differentiates us from the disbelievers and hypocrites is our performance of Salat. He who abandons it, becomes a disbeliever.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Compiled by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Al-Imam Ahmad </span>Ahl-ul-Sunan (authors of Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) with a Sahih Sanad (chain of narrators) on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Buraydah ibn Al-Haseeb </span>(may Allah be pleased with him). Others ruled that the abandonment of Salah is Kufr, but not Kufr Akbar (a major disbelief that takes one out of the religion of Islam) if the person does not deny its obligation. This matter is an independent realm of study but our goal here is to explain that there is no Islam for one without Faith and no faith for one without Islam. They mutually define each other. As previously mentioned, the word &#8220;Islam&#8221; means submission and humbleness to Allah and His Omnipotence (may He be Praised) which is in relation to the outward submission of the servant to His Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Similarly, the word &#8220;Iman&#8221; is a term refers to the Muslim&#8217;s inward belief which Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) knows. It is also called so because it has to do with the belief of the heart which is associated with outward obligations that reflect this believing heart. They are, when adhering to and practicing,an indication of the validity of Iman. Conversely, whoever does not observe these outward obligations, this designates that they have no Iman or weak Iman. According to Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body), Iman in its generality includes Islam and vice verse, as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-&#096;Imran, 3: 19" target="_blank" name="Truly,thereligionwithAllâh"></a>Truly, the religion with Allâh is Islâm.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> This Iman is included according to the main stream Muslims. No Islam without Iman and Iman means guidance, God-fearing, and righteousness. These terms, even different, refer to the same meaning i.e. believing in Allah and His Messengers, following His Guidance, abiding by the teachings of His Deen. Furthermore, the word &#8220;Ihsan&#8221; in general implies both Iman and Islam because it is confined to Allah&#8217;s servants who have perfected their faith. In the same way, if one of the three words were said generally, the other two are naturally implied. Thus, if it is said that the Muhsinon (good-doers) are the most beloved servants to Allah, then this implies that they have perfected their Islam and Iman, as Allah (Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 195" target="_blank" name="AndspendintheCauseofAllâh"></a>and do good. Truly, Allâh loves Al-Muhsinûn (the good-doers).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 128" target="_blank" name="Truly,Allâhiswiththosewho"></a>Truly, Allâh is with those who fear Him (keep their duty unto Him), and those who are Muhsinûn (good-doers. See the footenote of V.9:120).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />The Muslim who reaches the degree of Ihsan must manifest this by their strong Islam and Iman, piety and observance of Allah&#8217;s orders. It is only then that he deserves to be ranked as Muhsin, for Ihsan is not reached unless preceded with sound Islam and perfect Iman.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dear brother, you should know that the word Mu&#8217;minon (believers) implies the word Muslims, because it is more specific, as Allah (Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 19" target="_blank" name="(Odisbelievers)ifyouaskfor"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">and verily, Allâh is with the believers</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 72" target="_blank" name="Allâhhaspromisedthebelievers"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Allâh has promised the believers, men and women, Gardens under which rivers flow</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> .The word &#8220;Mu&#8217;min&#8221; refers only to those who believe with their hearts and act accordingly with their bodily organs to demonstrate belief in the Oneness of Allah&#8217;s Lordship. The Mu&#8217;minon deserves to be called so because of their belief with the heart, their true Islam, their observance of Allah&#8217;s commands and not transgressing His Limits. This meaning is indicated by the Hadith of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Sa`d ibn Abu Waqas </span>(may Allah be pleased with him) <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="whenheaskedtheProphetpeace"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">when he asked the Prophet (peace be upon him) why he gave the bounties to certain people and excluded others, Sa`d said: O Messenger of Allah, you gave such-and-such and excluded such-and-such, and I think they are believers. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Or Muslims. Sa`d repeated his question and the Prophet kept saying: Or Muslims.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />To explain it further, if coupled together, Iman and Islam have two meanings: a specific meaning and a general one. The word &#8220;Muslim&#8221; is more general than the word &#8220;Mu&#8217;min&#8221;, accordingly every Mu&#8217;min is a Muslim but not vice verse. Yet, when generally and separately speaking, both terms may be used interchangeably as previously stated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also indicated in the Prophet&#8217;s statement: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Faithhasoverseventybranchesor"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Faith has over seventy branches,or over sixty branches, the most excellent of which is the declaration that there is none worthy of worship (in truth) but Allah, and the humblest of which is the removal of what is injurious from the path: and modesty is the branch of faith.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). This Hadith carries the general implication that Iman includes Islam (submissiveness to Allah), Huda (guidance), Ihsan, Taqwa. Iman, whose most excellent expression is that there is no deity but Allah, and humblest of which is the removal of what is injurious from the path; this is the essence of our Deen and it is Islam and Iman. That is why the Prophet stated: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Theuppermostofalltheseisthe"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">The uppermost of all these is the Testimony of Faith: &#8220;La ilaha illallah&#8221; (there is no true God except Allah).</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />It is known that the Shahadah (Testimony of Faith) that there is no deity but Allah is the first pillar of Islam along with testifying that Muhammad is His Messenger. Allah made this Shahadah the highest rank of Iman, and as such, it includes in its generality Islam, its pillars, and the obligations related to it. Similarly, when referring only to the Iman in Allah or in Him and His Messenger, this includes all what Allah Prescribed and His Messenger conveyed with regard to Salah, Zakah, Sawm, Hajj, belief in Angels, Books, the prophets,the Last Day, and Qadar whether good or bad. All of these pillars of faith goes within the realm of believing in Allah. This also entails believing in His Names, Attributes, and His Existence as the Lord of the Worlds and the Only One deserving worship. Not only this, but such Iman is not separated from believing in what Allah revealed or legislated, what He prescribed for His Servants, as it also encompasses believing in all Messengers, Angels, Books, Prophets, and all that Allah and His Messenger revealed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sunnah also confirm this meaning when the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="SayIaffirmmyfaithinAllahandthenbeupright"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Say, &#8220;I affirm my faith in Allah&#8221; and then be upright.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> It encompasses All what Allah revealed or legislated for His Servants. Allah (Glorified be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Fussilat, 41: 30" target="_blank" name="Verily,thosewhosay:^OurLord"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Verily, those who say: “Our Lord is Allâh (Alone),” and then they stand firm</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />i.e. they acknowledged that their Lord, Creator, Sustainer is Allah and their belief in Him urged them to adhere to His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him). It a Divine Way to mention narratives and parables in the Qur&#8217;an describing them in depth in certain verses and in brief in others, so that whoever seeks knowledge of such narratives will read them either in detail or brief with no confusion for he knows that each position has its own implications.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Iman is mentioned separately in some Ayahs, and in others along with some of its prerequisites or branches to designate their importance and greatness, as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 277" target="_blank" name="Trulythosewhobelieve,anddo"></a>Truly those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness, and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât, they will have their reward with their Lord.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah&#8217;s saying: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 277" target="_blank" name="Trulythosewhobelieve,anddo"></a>and perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give Zakât</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> are essentially included in the realm of Iman and good deed but He mentioned them specifically to highlight their importance. The same applies to His statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Taghabun, 64: 8" target="_blank" name="Therefore,believeinAllâhand"></a>Therefore, believe in Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and in the Light (this Qur’ân) which We have sent down.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Believing in Allah and His Messenger naturally includes the belief in the revealed light but again Allah mentioned it to emphasize its great rank. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-&#096;Asr, 103: 1" target="_blank" name="ByAl-‘Asr(thetime)."></a>By Al-‘Asr (the time).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-&#096;Asr, 103: 2" target="_blank" name="Verily,manisinloss,"></a>Verily, man is in loss,</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-&#096;Asr, 103: 3" target="_blank" name="Exceptthosewhobelieve(inIslâmic"></a>Except those who believe (in Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al-Ma‘ruf) which Allâh has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al-Munkar which Allâh has forbidden], and recommend one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allâh’s Cause during preaching His religion of Islâmic Monotheism or Jihâd).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Following the truth and recommending one another to patience are forms of good deeds which reflect one&#8217;s Iman. Therefore, Allah mentions offering good deeds preceded by the prerequisite of Iman as a way of apposition of the specific to the general. Similarly, He mentioned enjoining one another to the truth and patience after good deeds in the same opposition, because they are kinds of good deeds. Thus, they were not mentioned in another Ayahs. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Luqman, 31: 8" target="_blank" name="Verily,thosewhobelieve(inIslâmic"></a>Verily, those who believe (in Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, for them are Gardens of Delight (Paradise).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> He did not mention recommending one another to the truth and patience, as they are included in His statement &#8220;and perform righteous good deeds&#8221; and in Iman generally. When referring to Iman in general, it includes all that Allah and His Messenger told of the past and the future until the end of time, on the Day of Resurrection, and about Jannah (Paradise) and Hellfire. It also encompasses all that Allah and His Messenger enjoined and what they forbade. Yet, Allah (may He be Praised) may make special mention of some specific good deeds or special mention of abandoning some sins as a way of emphasizing the particular after the general. The same goes to the fundamentals of Iman, as they are sometimes mentioned altogether as in Allah&#8217;s statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 177" target="_blank" name="ItisnotAl-Birr(piety,righteousness,"></a>It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, and each and every act of obedience to Allâh, etc.) that you turn your faces towards east</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Here He mentioned five articles of faith and mentioned believing in Al-Qadar in other Ayahs. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Qamar, 54: 49" target="_blank" name="Verily,Wehavecreatedallthings"></a>Verily, We have created all things with Qadar (Divine Preordainments of all things before their creation as written in the Book of Decrees Al-Lauh Al-Mahfûz).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> and <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hadid, 57: 22" target="_blank" name="Nocalamitybefallsontheearth"></a>No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al-Lauh Al-Mahfûz)</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />Other Ayahs stress the same meaning. At other positions of the Qur&#8217;an, Allah mentions only some of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Prophet&#8217;s Sunnah also mention some of these articles of faith although they were detailed in the Hadith of Jibril (Gabriel). In other Hadiths, only belief in Allah was mentioned such as the following Hadith: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="SayIaffirmmyfaithinAllahandthenbeupright"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Say, &#8220;I affirm my faith in Allah&#8221; and then be upright.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Likewise, some Hadiths included only the mention of Iman in Allah and the Last Day, as believing implies believing in all that Allah and His Messenger informed us of. He who has faith in Allah and the Last Day, this Iman will lead him to hasten to fulfill all the commands of Allah and His Messenger and to refrain from what they prohibited. Therefore, in some Ayahs and Hadiths no mention was made with regard to believing in Allah and the Last Day, because whoever believed truly and sincerely in Allah and the Last Day will be steadfast in fulfilling what Allah has obligated, abandoning what He forbade, and observing His Limits. For example, Allah says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 62" target="_blank" name="Verily!Thosewhobelieveandthose"></a>Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allâh and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, believing in the essential prerequisites of Iman mentioned in the Ayah is obligatory. Those who do not do this are disbelievers in Allah regardless of their professed Islam and Iman. Disbelieving in one of these six essential pillars of faith or any established matters of Islam renders one a disbeliever even if they adhere to some of its rulings and tenets. Complete Iman in this Deen (Islam) with all its laws and teachings is obligatory; otherwise those who have incomplete or imperfect Iman will be considered disbelievers, as Allah (Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 150" target="_blank" name="Verily,thosewhodisbelievein"></a>Verily, those who disbelieve in Allâh and His Messengers and wish to make distinction between Allâh and His Messengers (by believing in Allâh and disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, &#8220;We believe in some but reject others,&#8221; and wish to adopt a way in between.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 151" target="_blank" name="Theyareintruthdisbelievers."></a>They are in truth disbelievers. And We have prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating torment.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Hence, a believer knows the seriousness of these great and necessary fundamentals, and that believing in Allah encompasses believing in what Allah and the Prophet (peace be upon him) informed us about Himself, His Names, and Attributes. Similarly, this also includes the belief in Allah as the Lord of the Worlds, the Creator, the Sustainer, and that He is perfect in Himself, His Names, His Attributes and His acts. The believer must have firm Iman that Allah sent Messengers, revealed Books, predestined all matters, and that all things are known to Him (Exalted be He) before their existence as He is the Omnipotent and His Knowledge encompasses everything. Among the most concise Ayahs in this regard is Allah&#8217;s saying: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 1" target="_blank" name="Say(OMuhammadصلىاللهعليهوسلم):"></a>Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): &#8220;He is Allâh, (the) One.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 2" target="_blank" name="^Allâh-us-Samad(السيدالذييصمد"></a>&#8220;Allâh-us-Samad (السيد الذي يصمد إليه في الحاجات) [Allâh the Self-Sufficient Master, Whom all creatures need, (He neither eats nor drinks)].</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 3" target="_blank" name="^Hebegetsnot,norwasHebegotten."></a>&#8220;He begets not, nor was He begotten.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Ikhlas, 112: 4" target="_blank" name="^Andthereisnoneco-equalor"></a>&#8220;And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.&#8221;</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Shura, 42: 11" target="_blank" name="TheCreatoroftheheavensand"></a>There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 74" target="_blank" name="Soputnotforwardsimilitudes"></a>So put not forward similitudes for Allâh (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor He resembles anything).

As Allah informed us about Himself and as His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) told us that He has the Most Beautiful Names and Most Lofty Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is precribed upon every Mu&#8217;min to believe in everything stated by Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) with regards to Allah&#8217;s Names and Attributes and accept them as they are without any modification, increase or decrease ; rather, Muslims must accept themas stated by Allah and His Prophet without Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), Ta`til (denial of Allah&#8217;s Attributes), Takyif (questioning Allah&#8217;s Attributes or Tamthil (likening Allah&#8217;s Attributes to those of His Creation). A Muslim must follow the example of the righteous Salaf (righteous predecessors) in this regard.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This includes the Attributes that Allah has proven for Himself, such as that of Istiwa&#8217; (Allah&#8217;s rising over the Throne in a manner that befits Him), Allah&#8217;s descending to the lower Heaven [in a manner that befits Him], Face, Hands, Mercy, Knowledge, Wrath, Will, and other Attributes which Allah established for himself as mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an or the Sunnah of His Prophet (peace be upon him). We are obliged to ascribe such Attributes to Allah as did the righteous Salaf from Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) and the Messengers (peace be upon them). Accordingly, we should believe that Allah has risen over the Throne in a way that befits His Glory and Majesty, not as claimed by the sect of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Jahmiyyah (a deviant Islamic sect denying some Attributes of Allah, claiming they are ascribed to people and cannot be ascribed to Allah) </span>that He seized it, as Allah does not struggle against other deities; rather He is Omnipotent (Glorified and Exalted be He) and Dominant over all . However, Istiwa&#8217; is an attribute unique to the Throne that means rising above and high, as Allah is high above His Creation and has raised Himself above the Throne in a manner befitting His Sublimity. None of His Creation resembles Him in His Creation, for His rising above the Throne is an established matter, as said by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Malik </span>(may Allah be merciful with him): The Istawa&#8217; is known and the manner is untold; to believe in it is obligatory and to ask about it is a Bid`ah (innovation). This was also said by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Rabi`ah Sheikh Al-Imam Malik </span>(may Allah be merciful with them) and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Um Salamah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) and believed by Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah. The Attributes are known but the real manner is unknown whereas believing in them is obligatory. This is the rule applied to all Attributes such as Knowledge, Mercy, Wrath, Face, Hands, Foot, Fingers, etc. All the Ayahs and Hadiths conform with this fact. Likewise, we should believe in Al-Nuzul, i.e. the Hadith that deals with Allah&#8217;s descending to the lower Heaven [in a manner that befits Him] and ascribes it to Allah in a way that befits Him and its reality is known only to Him. Hence, we must believe that Allah descends to the lower heaven as He wills in a manner known only to Him, and His descending does not contradict His Loftiness and His Istiwa&#8217;, since He (Exalted be He) is not similar to His creation in any of His Attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same applies to His Istiwa&#8217; on the Throne which does not contradict that His Knowledge encompasses everything and that He is among His believing creatures with His knowledge and nothing is concealed from Him, as He Allah ( the Exalted andGlorified) states <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hadid, 57: 4" target="_blank" name="HeitisWhocreatedtheheavens"></a>And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> This does not contradict His Loftiness and rising above His Throne, for Allah is with us with His knowledge as He informed us without Tahrif or Takyif. Furthermore, Allah is with those who obey Him with His Knowledge, protection, support and by granting them victory over their enemies. This means that Allah&#8217;s Ma`iyyah (accompaniment) is of two types; a general one which means that everyone is equal with regard to Allah&#8217;s Knowledge as He surrounds them all in His Knowledge, not only the believers; and a special accompaniment which is confined to the prophets and messengers (peace be upon them) and those who have Taqwa (fearing Allah as He should be feared), Iman, patience, and endurance in obeying Allah and obeying His commands and abstaining from His prohibitions, as Allah (may He be Praised) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 46" target="_blank" name="He(Allâh)said:^Fearnot,verily"></a>I am with you both, hearing and seeing.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah At-Tawbah, 9: 40" target="_blank" name="Ifyouhelphim(Muhammadصلىالله"></a>Be not sad (or afraid), surely Allâh is with us.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified be He) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 46" target="_blank" name="AndobeyAllâhandHisMessenger,"></a>and be patient. Surely, Allâh is with those who are As-Sâbirûn (the patient).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> and the like Ayahs. This special Ma`iyyah includes protection, support from Allah, and also His Knowledge that surrounds everything, as He (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hadid, 57: 4" target="_blank" name="HeitisWhocreatedtheheavens"></a>And He is with you (by His Knowledge) wheresoever you may be.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In utter contrast to what is claimed by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Al-Jahmiyyah </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> and the Mu`tazilah (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that those who commit major sins are in a state between belief and disbelief) </span>and the like who maintain that Allah is everywhere (exalted be He far above any such thing). Allah (may He be Praised and Exalted) is above His creatures and is seated on His Throne as He stated. His Knowledge encompasses everywhere and He is not mixed with His Creation (may He be Praised and Exalted). Thus, Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah believe that Iman in Allah entails believing in all what Allah and His Messenger informed us about Him with regard to His Names and Attributes. This forms an essential pillar of their `Aqidah (creed), and accordingly, they believe in Allah as their Lord and the only One Who deserves to be worshipped and that He is perfect in Essence, Names, Attributes, and Actions. For them, He is the Creator, the Sustainer, the Giver, Al-Khafid (the Abaser), Al-Rafi` (the Exalter) and other Attributes of Perfection. Allah is the only One worthy of worship and He is All-Knowing, the Supreme Creator, and is the One that sustains His Servants for He is Omnipotent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All such Attributes are not similar to those of His Creatures, rather they are unique to Him in a manner that suits His Sublimity as our attributes befit us. Allah&#8217;s Attributes are everlasting and perfect whereas the servant&#8217;s are imperfect and vanishing. All this is related to believing in Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) and believing in in the Angels generally and in detail.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">[<strong>Angels:</strong>]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Specifically speaking, angels are of two types; the first is known to us because they were mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an and accordingly we are obliged to believe in them and their names, such as Jibril (Gabriel), Mikha&#8217;il (Michael) and Israfeel (Seraph) and the angel of death. The second type are angels that we must believe in although Allah did not mention them or their names, for Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Anbiya', 21: 26" target="_blank" name="Andtheysay:^TheMostGracious"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">but honoured slaves</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Anbiya', 21: 27" target="_blank" name="TheyspeaknotuntilHehasspoken,"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">They speak not until He has spoken, and they act on His Command.</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These angels are groups of which some are assigned to record our deeds, others travel throughout the earth attending circles of Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah), others take turns among us by day and by night, and some hold the Throne etc. It is reported in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Everydayseventythousandangels"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Everyday, seventy thousand angels visit Al-Bayt Al-Ma`mur (the house over the heavens parallel to Ka`bah), and never come again.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> This indicates their great numbers and that only Allah Knows how many they are. Hence, we must believe in them generally and specifically as honored servants, not humans or Jinn, but as creatures created from light as narrated in the Sahih Hadith: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Angelswerecreatedfromlight"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Angels were created from light, jinns were created from a smokeless flame of fire, and Adam was created from that which you have been told (i.e. sounding clay like the clay of pottery).</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Related by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Muslim </span> in his Sahih on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> `Aishah </span>(may Allah be pleased with her) from the Prophet (peace be upon him). They were formed as Allah willed. Furthermore, they have their own deeds and Attributes which befit them; some of which are known through reports in the Sunnah, such as the appearance of Jibril in different forms or in the form with which Allah created him having six hundred wings, and at other times in the form of an unknown person who came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) to inquire about matters of Islam and Iman, etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To explain further, they are formed according to Allah&#8217;s Will and their appearance is only known to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) although they are known to have wings as mentioned by Allah in His noble Book in Surah Fatir and other matters which Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) told about in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah. Thus, we should completely believe in them as far as their mentioned names and attributes are concerned, and generally accept that they are unknown to us, as are their affairs and attributes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[Revealed Books]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same goes to believing in all the Books sent down by Allah, as the believer generally believes in all Allah&#8217;s books and that they are Books which Allah revealed upon His messengers and prophets we do not know about but we generally believe in them and that what was revealed in such Books refers only to Allah (may He be Praised and Exalted). However, some of these Books were made known to us such as Al-Tawrah (Torah), Injil (Gospel), Zabur (Book revealed to Prophet Dawud [David]) as well as scriptures of Ibrahim (Abraham) and Musa (Moses) and the Glorious Book, the Qur&#8217;an. We should believe in all these Books which were mentioned to us, and with regard to those, which were not mentioned to us, we have to believe that Allah sent them down to His messengers and prophets which He only knows unless there is evidence or a text from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that provides clarification of such books.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[Messengers]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We must believe generally in the Messengers of Allah that were sent to people to call them to Allah and on particular those mentioned in the Qur&#8217;an. He (Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nahl, 16: 36" target="_blank" name="Andverily,Wehavesentamong"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): “Worship Allâh (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Tâghût (all false deities i.e. do not worship Tâghût besides Allâh).”</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Anbiya', 21: 25" target="_blank" name="AndWedidnotsendanyMessenger"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) but We revealed to him (saying): Lâ ilâha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allâh)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).&#8221;</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Exalted be He) has sent the messengers as bearers of glad tidings and warners, but knowing exactly the number of such messengers and their names is a matter only known to Allah. Yet, it is authentically reported in the Hadith of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Abu Dharr, </span>which has some evidence from the Hadith of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Abu Umamah </span>and others that indicate the number of the messengers is more than three hundred and ten but the Isnad of such Hadiths is open for questions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the prophets, it was reported in some narrations that their number amounts to one hundred and twenty four thousand messengers. In another narration: one hundred and twenty thousand but some of the Isnads of such narrations are not authenticated. To distill, the specific number of prophets and messengers is only known to Allah (Exalted be He) alone (may He be Praised and Exalted). Therefore, we have to generally believe that there are messengers and prophets whom Allah sent to make the truth known and guide people to it, as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hajj, 22: 52" target="_blank" name="NeverdidWesendaMessengeror"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Never did We send a Messenger or a Prophet before you but when he did recite the revelation or narrated or spoke, Shaitân (Satan) threw (some falsehood) in it.</span></span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 40" target="_blank" name="Muhammad(صلىاللهعليهوسلم)is"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allâh and the last (end) of the Prophets</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also said: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hadid, 57: 25" target="_blank" name="IndeedWehavesentOurMessengers"></a><span style="color:#0000ff;">Indeed, We have sent Our Messengers with clear proofs, and revealed with them the Scripture and the Balance (justice) that mankind may keep up justice</span>.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />Such Ayahs make it absolutely clear that there were many messengers and prophets whom Allah sent and He is the only One that knows their exact number.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This should form the basis of our Iman, whether generally or in detail, as they were so many and their mission was so great. They called to Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism); forbade Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship); elucidated Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah (Islamic Law); enjoined what Allah commanded and forbade the violation of His prohibitions. This is the sole goal of their mission. We should believe in those who were named in the Qur&#8217;an such as Nuh (Noah), Ibrahim, Musa,`Eisa, Dawud, Sulayman, Hud, Salih, and others including Adam, for it is reported in some narrations from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Abu Dharr </span>and others that he is a prophet while other narrations tell that he is a messenger. There is no doubt that it a Shari`ah was revealed to him from Allah, but it is not known whether he is a prophet sent to people or just a prophet with no message. The narrations differed in this regard. It is known that Adam is one of the prophets and that its Shari`ah was revealed to him. This is supported by the Hadith of the gathering of people on the Day of Resurrection when the believers approach Nuh saying: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="ONuhyouarethefirstmessenger"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">O Nuh, you are the first messenger Allah sent tohumankind.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />This is evidence in support of the mission of Nuh and that he is the first messenger and that Adam is a prophet. Yet, even if he was a messenger, this means that he was a messenger to his children unlike Nuh who was sent to his people who were by then the entire population of the earth. As for Adam, he was sent to his offspring with a specific Shari`ah before Shirk prevailed. By contrast, Nuh was sent to his people who were the whole people on earth after Shirk dominated and prevailed. Thus, there is no conflict when Adam is a messenger, if the Hadith is sahih, and Nuh is the first messenger to the people of the earth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[Last Day]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This could be said about the fifth pillar of Iman i.e. believing in the Last Day generally and in detail. We should believe in the existence of the events of the Last Day such as Jannah, Hellfire, Sirat (the bridge over the Fire), Mizan (the Scales for weighing deeds) and others which were not mentioned in detail in the Ayahs or the Hadiths but we are obliged to believe in it generally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[Qadr]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same is said about believing in Al-Qadar (Predestination), which is the sixth fundamental of Iman, as we should believe in it according to the texts on this regard. It should be noted that believing in Al-Qadar includes <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">four things</span></strong> as regards the creed of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>First</strong>: Knowing that Allah (may He be Praised) predestined everything and that His Knowledge encompasses everything, as He (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Anfal, 8: 75" target="_blank" name="Andthosewhobelievedafterwards,"></a>Verily, Allâh is the All-Knower of everything.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> This refutes the claim of extremists of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Qadariyyah (a deviant sect that claims Allah has no power over His Creation and humans are independent of Him) </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> and Mu`tazilah </span>who deny such Knowledge.<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Al-Shafi` </span>(may Allah be merciful with him) said, &#8220;Debate them with knowledge; if they acknowledge it, they are overcome and if they deny it, they disbelieve. That is because Al-Qadar means that Allah&#8217;s Knowledge encompasses everything, as matters cannot take place outside of His Knowledge. Once Allah predestined and decreed all things and matters, there is no way that they can take place in a way contrary to His Will; otherwise this would indicate Allah&#8217;s ignorance of their occurrence (Highly Exalted is Allah above their claims!)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, if they deny this and say that Allah (may He be Praised) does not know things except after theyalready exist, this is blatant Kufr (disbelief) and a form of disavowal to Allah (may He be Praised) and a description of Him with lack of knowledge, and therefore, whoever says this is a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Second</strong>: Pre-writing and recording of what was and what will happen, as Allah (may He be Praised) predestined everything. He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hadid, 57: 22" target="_blank" name="Nocalamitybefallsontheearth"></a>No calamity befalls on the earth or in yourselves but it is inscribed in the Book of Decrees (Al-Lauh Al-Mahfûz) before We bring it into existence. Verily, that is easy for Allâh.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> He (may He be Praised) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Hajj, 22: 70" target="_blank" name="KnowyounotthatAllâhknowsall"></a>Know you not that Allâh knows all that is in the heaven and on the earth? Verily, it is (all) in the Book (Al-Lauh-al-Mahfûz). Verily that is easy for Allâh.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> This means that Allah decreed all things as indicated by the two mentioned Ayahs. This was also expressed by the Prophet (peace be upon him) in the Hadith narrated by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> `Abdullah ibn `Amr ibn Al-`As </span> <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Allahhadrecordedthedecrees"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Allah had recorded the decrees of the creation fifty thousand years before He created the heavens and the earth, as His Throne was upon water.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Related by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Muslim </span>in his Sahih.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah&#8217;s Predestination of matters that were and that will be is supported by the texts of the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah. We have to believe that Allah ordained everything. Nothing is hidden from Him, His Knowledge encompasses everything, and He is omnipotent over all things. He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Talaq, 65: 12" target="_blank" name="ItisAllâhWhohascreatedseven"></a>that you may know that Allâh has power over all things, and that Allâh surrounds all things in (His) Knowledge.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Third</strong>: Allah&#8217;s Mashi&#8217;ah (Will), namely whatever He wills happens and whatever He does not will never happens, and that nothing takes place without His Mashi&#8217;ah (Divine Will) that wanted it to happen regardless of people&#8217;s will and their desire for a certain matter to occur or not. This Belief is a prerequisite for the validity of one&#8217;s Iman. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Takwir, 81: 28" target="_blank" name="Towhomsoeveramongyouwhowills"></a>To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Takwir, 81: 29" target="_blank" name="Andyoucannotwillunless(it"></a>And you cannot will unless (it be) that Allâh wills &#8211; the Lord of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (may He Be Glorified) also says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Muddathir, 74: 55" target="_blank" name="Sowhosoeverwill(lethimread"></a>So whosoever will (let him read it), and receive admonition (from it)!</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Muddathir, 74: 56" target="_blank" name="Andtheywillnotreceiveadmonition"></a>And they will not receive admonition unless Allâh wills; He (Allâh) is the One, deserving that mankind should be afraid of, and should be dutiful to Him, and should not take any Ilâh (god) along with Him, and He is the One Who forgives (sins).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Allah (may He be Praised) has the absolute and perfect Mashi&#8217;ah, as He states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Ya­Sin, 36: 82" target="_blank" name="Verily,HisCommand,whenHeintends"></a>Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, &#8220;Be!&#8221; &#8211; and it is!</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />(may He be Praised and Exalted).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Fourth</strong>: The belief in Allah&#8217;s Power to create and make them exist as He has power over everything, the Supreme Creator, the All-Knower; He created all things and brought them into existence. This applies to the present and the future. He is the Omnipotent with no partner, the Creator, the Sustainer, and has power over all things. He (may He be Praised) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 62" target="_blank" name="AllâhistheCreatorofallthings,"></a>Allâh is the Creator of all things, and He is the Wakîl (Trustee, Disposer of affairs, Guardian) over all things.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Believing in al-Qadar includes all the aforementioned prerequisites. It includes Iman in Allah&#8217;s Knowledge of everything and His Predestination; that whatever He wills happens, and whatever He does not will does not happen. Iman includes also the belief that Allah is the Supreme Creator Who created and caused all things to exist (may He be Praised). This refutes whoever claims otherwise from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Mu`tazilah </span>and others. Whoever denies Allah&#8217;s Mashi&#8217;ah and claims that things happen beyond Allah&#8217; Will, then he refuses to accept the Omnipotence of Allah and does not give Him His due respect. Hence, every believer should have unquestionable Iman that Allah is potent over everything and that events occur according to His Cosmic Will. Yet, some people are inattentive of such articles of Iman with which the messengers were sent. Therefore, they should be educated about them with evidence and they should know the difference between Allah&#8217;s Divine Predestined Universal Will mentioned in His statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Ya­Sin, 36: 82" target="_blank" name="Verily,HisCommand,whenHeintends"></a>Verily, His Command, when He intends a thing, is only that He says to it, &#8220;Be!&#8221; &#8211; and it is!</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> andDivine Legal Will which is not applicable to all people such as the disbelievers which it is meant by Allah&#8217;s statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 26" target="_blank" name="Allâhwishestomakeclear(what"></a>Allâh wishes to make clear (what is lawful and what is unlawful) to you, and to show you the ways of those before you, and accept your repentance</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is known that some people have died while being ignorant of some basic tenets of Iman and without offering Tawbah (repentance to Allah). Allah (Exalted be He) says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 28" target="_blank" name="Allâhwishestolighten(theburden)"></a>Allâh wishes to lighten (the burden) for you</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> This is the Legal Will, because Allah eased matters for some people and left others. This means that Allah willed, loved and satisfied with it but some people were made to succeed in that while others failed. This is expressed in the sahih Hadith: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="AllahtheExaltedwillsaytosome"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">Allah, the Exalted will say to some pagans on the Day of Resurrection: Would you like to go as ransom if you had all what equals to earth in gold? He would say: Yes. Allah would say to him: When you were in the loins of Adam, I asked you for something easier than this that you should not associate anything with Me. But you associated with Me others.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />All messengers conveyed this message of worshipping Allah alone and forbidding associating others with Him but most people refused and took partners with Allah in worship and did not accept the Divine Will. Therefore, whoever believes in these four matters of Iman; Allah&#8217;s knowledge of all things; He predestined them to happen; He willed them to happen; and He is the Supreme Creator of all things, then he fully believes in Qadar but whoever falls short in this, his Iman is imperfect and is not following the creed of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah due to imperfect belief in all matters of Qadar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This belief in Qadar does not necessarily mean that the servant is predestined without a free will or Mashi&#8217;ah as a feather moved helplessly by the wind as claimed by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Qadariyyah </span>who hold the view of Predestination from<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Jahmiyyah </span>and others, rather Human beings have choice, will, and volition,to discern truth from falsehood. Human beings have choice, will, and volition, but these are only realized through Allah&#8217;s Will (Glorified and Exalted be He), as He (Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Takwir, 81: 28" target="_blank" name="Towhomsoeveramongyouwhowills"></a>To whomsoever among you who wills to walk straight.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Takwir, 81: 29" target="_blank" name="Andyoucannotwillunless(it"></a>And you cannot will unless (it be) that Allâh wills &#8211; the Lord of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Humans have free will and are predestined; free because Allah (may He be Praised) gave them minds, hearing, the ability to choose and the will to manage their spiritual and worldly affairs. They have wills by which they can avoid sin, obey Allah&#8217;s commands or disobey Him, and give in charity or not. In regard to being predestined, this occurs because humans cannot escape, due to their words and deeds, the Divine Decree and the Will of Allah (may He be Praised).They have a will but which can only be realized through Allah&#8217;s Will (Glorified and Exalted be He), and that is why Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Yunus, 10: 22" target="_blank" name="HeitisWhoenablesyoutotravel"></a>He it is Who enables you to travel through land and sea</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> By that, it could be said that human beings are predestined and also have free will and each person is led to that for which he has been created. Allah gives him the mind and the free will to act as he so likes. Similarly, he is predestined as far as Allah&#8217;s Knowledge is concerned and led to doing good or bad according to Allah&#8217;s Predestined Will, and as such, he cannot do anything contrary to what Allah decreed for him. In this regard, the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Nodoperformgooddeedsforeveryone"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">No, do perform good deeds, for everyone is facilitated in that for which he has been created; For the good deeds are made easy for the blessed, and bad deeds are made easy for the wretched.&#8221; Then he recited the Ayahs: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Layl, 92: 5" target="_blank" name="Asforhimwhogives(incharity)"></a>As for him who gives (in charity) and keeps his duty to Allâh and fears Him,</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Layl, 92: 6" target="_blank" name="AndbelievesinAl-Husnâ."></a>And believes in Al-Husnâ.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al-Layl, 92: 7" target="_blank" name="Wewillmakesmoothforhimthe"></a>We will make smooth for him the path of ease (goodness).</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> </span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> and the next verse. (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the Hadith of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> `Ali ibn Abu Talib </span>(may Allah be pleased with him). This makes it clear for a believer to differentiate between the creed of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) and that of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> the Mu`tazilah </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> and Qadariyyah </span>who denied the creed of Predestination, and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Al-Qadariyyah </span>who held it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> As for the first sect of Qadariyyah, </span>they went so far in proving the Predestination that they said: The servant has no free willor Mashi&#8217;ah at all. Definitely, they were wrong about that although they were right in their proving of Al-Qadar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Concerning<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> the second sect of Qadariyyah </span>who denied Predestination, they also went far in that regard although they acknowledged that the human being has a free will and free choice but they separated it from Allah&#8217;s Will. Combining the merits of both sects, Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah hold the true opinions and abandoned their false thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hence, it is incumbent upon those who seek Al-Haqq (the Truth) if they refute the claims of their adversaries to be fair in declaring what they benefited from them and what they avoided, telling them that you said so-and so and we agree with you in this regard and you said so-and-so and we do not accept that. They should say that they agree with them in believing in Al-Qadar but oppose their saying that the human being is predestined, as he has a free will and a free choice. It should be said to these sects of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Mu`tazilah </span>and their likes that we agree with the saying that the human being has a free will, but not confirming that this will is not realized through Allah&#8217;s Will and that His Mashi&#8217;ah is related to His Servant&#8217;s.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This should be said to the<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Shi`ah (Shi&#8217;ites) </span>that we are with you in your love Ahl-ul-Bayt (members of the Prophet&#8217;s extended Muslim family) and<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> `Ali </span>(may Allah be pleased with him), and that all goodness lies in following his way as one of the best companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him); rather he was the best after<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Al-Siddiq, </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> `Umar </span><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> and `Uthman </span>(may Allah be pleased with them all). However, we contradict you in your claim of his infallibility or his precedence to the Caliphate after the Messenger of Allah as there are three persons before him more deserving of this honor. We are not with you with regard to your deifying him, seeking his help, making vows for him, and the like. Our dispute with you is because you went far from the righteous path, although we stand shoulder with shoulder with you in loving and revering Al-ul-Bayt who were committed to Allah&#8217;s Shari&#8217;ah, invoking Allah&#8217;s pleasure on them, and we believe that they are the best of Allah&#8217;s Creation as stated in the Messesnger of Allah&#8217;s will, as he said in the Hadith narrated by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Zayd ibn Arqam </span>compiled in sahih<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Muslim: </span> <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Iamleavingamongyoutwoweighty"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">I am leaving among you two weighty things: First: the Book of Allah in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it&#8230; He then said: Second: the members of my household! I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The same applies to all other sects, as we accept their opinions that agree with the truth and admit that for them, and at the same time refute theirdeviance and falsehood through textual and rational evidence. Thus, it becomes so clear that these six fundamentals are themselves the pillars of this Deen and which include the essential tenets of Islam and Iman that whoever abides by their creed, in word and deed, then they have perfected their Iman and are saved from hypocrisy. This is because such articles of faith oblige the Mu&#8217;min to fulfill what Allah has obligated upon them and their belief in all that Allah informed us of in His Book or through the Prophet (peace be upon him) Sunnah. Whoever denies these articles or some of them is indeed not a Mu&#8217;min.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>[Summary]</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In short, these fundamentals are great ones and basic rules for this Din and should be observed and abided by in all conditions avoiding what contradicts them. Whoever claims an opinion or does an act of disbelief proves his lack of true Iman in these prerequisites of faith or some of them, such as abandoning Salah (Prayer), as those who neglect Salah is utterly without faith, according to the soundest scholarly opinion; if he has true faith, it will hold him back from this sin. According to the most preponderant opinion, the person who neglects Salah commits kufr Akbar, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Whatmakesoneadisbelieverand"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">What makes one a disbeliever and a polytheist is abandoning prayers.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Recorded by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Muslim </span>in his sahih. The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: <img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><a style="color:blue;cursor:auto;text-decoration:none;" name="Thatwhichdifferentiatesusfrom"></a><span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="color:blue;font-size:10pt;">That which differentiates us from the disbelievers and hypocrites is our performance of Salat. He who abandons it, becomes a disbeliever.</span><img style="cursor:auto;" src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /> Recorded by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Al-Imam Ahmad </span>and Ahl-ul-Sunan (authors of Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) with a sahih (authentic) Sanad (chain of narrators) on the authority of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Buraydah ibn Al-Haseeb </span>(may Allah be pleased with him). Likewise, whoever shows disrespect to Allah (may He be Praised) or His Messenger (peace be upon him) or does not believe in what Allah told with regard to the existence of Jannah, Hellfire, and the Qur&#8217;an, then they are disblieversaccording to the Ijma` (consensus), because such mocking and disrespect reflect their false Iman or that they have no Iman at all in them due to such deviance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is also applicable to whoever desecrates the Mus-haf (Arabic Qur&#8217;an), blemishes it with impurity, or sits upon it knowing that it is the Book of Allah. This indicates that he has no faith at all; rather he only claims that; otherwise he would never commit such acts which render one a disbeliever.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who mock the messengers or do not believe in them are disbelievers because by doing so, they admit their lack of true Iman and their falsely claiming to be believers. This applies to the other matters which people do, such as the people of<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Musaylimah </span>who believed the call of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and offered Salah and Sawm (Fast), but at the same time they claimed that<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Musaylimah </span>is a partner with the Prophet in his mission. Accordingly, they were unanimously rendered disbelievers according to the scholars among the Sahabah and those who came after them, even though they offered Salah, Sawm, and said that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Once they believed that<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Musaylimah </span>is a partner with Muhammad in his message, this alone entailed their Kufr, as they afterwards denied Allah&#8217;s statement: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" /><span style="text-align:left;"><a id="ContentAnchor" class="Mofty" style="font-size:10pt;" title="Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 40" target="_blank" name="Muhammad(صلىاللهعليهوسلم)is"></a>Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allâh and the last (end) of the Prophets.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0" />and denied the sahih and Mutawatir Hadiths that prove our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as the Seal of prophets and messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> the Qadiyanis </span>and those among them who believed that Ghulam<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Ahmad </span>was a prophet to whom there was a certain message revealed by Allah, were regarded as having committed Kufr Akbar, because they are disbelievers of Allah and His Messenger, even if they offered Salah, Sawm and claimed themselves as Muslims. Those who also did not believe that the Jannah or Hellfire exist, and that the Hellfire is not a place of torment for its dwellers but a blessing for them as stated by<span id="ContentParagraph" class="HarfBody" style="font-size:10pt;"> Ibn `Arabi, </span>the deviant who is known for pantheism. Undoubtedly, this is a rejection of what Allah&#8217;s Book or the Sunnah of His Prophet mentioned as well as the Ijma` of scholars that the Hellfire is a place of torment, not pleasure, as a punishment for their neglect of what Allah enjoined upon them and committing what He forbade in addition to disbelieving in what the messengers called to. The Qur&#8217;an has many Ayahs indicating that the disbelievers will be punished with torment in the Hellfire. Nobody can deny this except a stubborn, arrogant, and ignorant person who is totally unaware of what the messengers were sent with or with no mind at all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This makes it clear that evidence of Islamic matters is derived from the Qur&#8217;an and the Sunnah according to what Allah and His Messenger told as well as the authentically reported words from the Salaf of this Ummah (nation). Whoever refuses this and claims what contradicts these fundamentals of Iman deviates from the Straight Path and their claim is false.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to grant us a good understanding of His Book and the Sunnah of His Prophet, and to bestow upon us and all Muslims the blessing of true Iman and good deed. May Allah make us steadfast in adhering to the Truth until we meet Him (may He be Praised)! Indeed, He is All-Hearer and Responsive! May peace and blessing be upon His Servant and Messenger, our Prophet, his Family, Companions, and those who followed him in righteousness!</p>

<p><span style="color:#ff0000;">&#8220;Is it obligatory upon new Muslims to change their previous names such as George, Joseph, and others?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Answer: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It is not obligatory to change the name unless it means worshipping other than Allah. However, changing one‎s name to something better is permissible. Accordingly, changing one‎s name from a foreign name to an Islamic name is proper and good, but as to whether it is obligatory, no it is not.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But if a person‎s name is Abd Al-Masih (slave of the Messiah) or similar names that indicate servitude to other than Allah, it becomes obligatory to change it. It falls under the ruling of worshipping other than Allah by the Ijma‎ (consensus) of scholars as reported by Abu Muhammad ibn Hazm (may Allah be merciful to him). Allah is the Grantor of success.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Impressions of Shaykh Safiur Rahman Mubarakpooree about Maududi.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A view of Maududi upon which he stood with firmness and the truth is that he laid the foundation for his Jamaat (group, i.e Jamat e islami) upon this view. And presented this view with such strength that even great scholars were influenced by him and they even accepted it, even though they did not enter him Jamaat, but they were influenced by his thoughts and accepted them. When these views came before me, even I was confused for a few days. But after that Allaah Ta&#8217;la opened this matter (mas&#8217;ala) in such a clear way that no type of doubt or confusion remained . Now I will present it before you, then there will be no doubt or confusion for you too Insha&#8217;Allaah. So clearly Allaah Ta&#8217;ala has opened it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The view of Maulana (Maududi) was that if there is continuous following (Ita&#8217;ah) of someone, then this is the worship (Ibadah) of that person .the Muslim is in continuous following (Ita&#8217;ah) of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala and he follow (Ita&#8217;ah) the Prophet SalAllaahu alaihiwasallam because Allaah Ta&#8217;ala ordered to follow him. Thus the following (Ita&#8217;ah) of the Prophet salAllaahu alaihiwasallam is in accordance to the following (Ita&#8217;ah) of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala, therefore when he SalAllaahu alaihiwasallam is followed it is the following of Allaah Ta&#8217;ala and this worship (Ibaadah) becomes the  worship (Ibaadah) of Allaah. Now from here he (Maududi) has raised another problem that if a government does not govern according to the law laid by Allaah Ta&#8217;ala then following that government will be worshipping  that government and this is Shirk. And this is where he (Maududi) took his view of Shirk in Haakimiyyah and presented it strongly, and many a people are busy in it till date. Now I will present its truth before you, I mean t say that books of about a hundered, two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, six hundred and in some cases eight hundred pages have been written by many people on this topic. The matter has been confused in such a way and with such long debates that it becomes difficult to imagine. That is why I present this matter before you in a few clear and firm way.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span id="more-2315"></span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is Ita&#8217;ah (following) the same as Ibaadah(worship). Or is Ibaadah something else and Ita&#8217;ah something else? Understand this well! To explain it I will present one or two examples before you. A youth of Jamaat-e-Islami came to me and started talking, I was also talking to him. Now he came to his Da&#8217;awah (Call) that Sir(Saheb), this is our Da&#8217;awah. I said: Yes, I know that. He wanted me to accept it so I said Look this Da&#8217;awah (Call) of yours is not Saheeh (right). He asked How is it not right? I said: If this quote of yours is right that if someone follows (Ita&#8217;ah) a government and that government does not govern according to the law laid down by Allaah then this following (Ita&#8217;ah) becomes worship (Ibaadah). If this is right then please do me a favour, go out and watch any muslim on the road, that if he is riding a bicycle on the left hand side of the road (in India vehicles need to keep left- keep left rule&#8217;) then tell him O Brother! do not ride your bicycle this way, it is shirk to ride your bicycle by left side of the road.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now he got violently irritated and asked Maulana (Shaikh) what are you saying ?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said: I am saying the same thing you said , I am just showing you the consequences of your da&#8217;awah. He asked How? I said: this government of India.., ..is it&#8217;s governance in accordance to the laws laid down by Allaah or not? He said Its is not, it is being governed without accepting the law of Allaah. Then I said then this following its laws (of the Indian Governement) is Shirk, is&#8217;nt it? He said It will be (Shirk) then I said, The riding of bicycle on the left side is the part of the same law, therefore if someone rides a bicycle on the left side then he is following the government, and you call its following (Ita&#8217;ah) to be worship(Ibaadah). And Ibaadah (worship) of Ghayr Allaah (other than Allaah) is supposed to be shirk, therefore it (this following) becomes Shirk. Now he got extremely worried. He then said Sir (Saheb) now you show me what is right then and what is&#8217;nt right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said &#8211; Now see Itaa&#8217;ah (following) is something else and Ibaadah(worship) is something else. <span style="color:#0000ff;">It is possible that sometimes a  deed (amal) is Ita&#8217;ah (following) and also Ibadah (worship) but it is also possible that a deed is Ita&#8217;ah but not ibaadah, and it is also possible that a deed is Ibaadah but not Ita&#8217;ah, all of this is possible.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He asked How come?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I said You listen I will show you, Ibraheem alaihisalaam came to his people and asked what do you worship? the people said we worship idls and to them we are ever devoted. Now tell me that the idols the people were worshipping were they also following these idols? These idols were unable from the beginning  that they could order to do or not to do something, then these people who were worshipping it does mean worship but does no mean following over here. It must be agreed that these pople were not following but were worshipping.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He agreed to this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now a little more ahead, Allaah ta&#8217;ala has mentioned regarding Christians at many places ( meaning verses) in Al Qura&#8217;an Al Majid. Allah Ta&#8217;ala will ask Eesa alaihisalaam on the day of resurrection  Did you say to men: Worship me and my mother as two gods (Ilaah) besides Alaah so Eesa alaihisalaam will immediately deny this and will say I was a witness over them while I dwelt  amongst them, but when You took me up You were the watcher  over them and You are a Witness to all things:. This way he will deny all knowledge about their actions and will declare himself free from what they used to do. Well, and in the same Al Qura&#8217;an, it is shown regarding the Christians and those who used to worship Eesa alaihisalaam, that these people used to worship such a person who canot give them any gain nor any loss. So it is known that they used to worship Eesa alaihisalaam and Eesa alaihisalaam cannot givem them gain or loss. Now the matter is that, is their worship of Eesa alaihisalaam to be considered his following also? I asked him Their worship is proved, Al Qura&#8217;an also calls this action of theirs as worship. So  the Christians who worship Eesa alaihisalaam  were they also following him?  They were not following Eesa alaihisalam , as Eesa alaihisalaam never ordered them to worship him on the contrary he has ordered them not to worship him. So they were exaggerating in this matter, and instead of following him they were rebelling against him and it was worship. So for worship it is not necessary that the one being worshipped is being followed worship can be done without following and even on the condition of rebellion, will it not be worship?.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the matter which becomes thoroughly clear. Now that it is clear. What must you know? To accept someone&#8217;s orders and put them in action, this is  Ita&#8217;ah(following). And to seek nearness to someone I mean by pleasing him. And his pleasure is  not conditional upon reasons. Then to do something for his pleasure is Iba&#8217;dah (worship). So those people (Christians) used to work for the pleasure of Eesa alaihisalam , therefore this is worship (as they thought this would please him). Yet they were not obedient to him, so this is not Ita&#8217;ah (following). When we pray (offer salaah), we seek Allaah ta&#8217;ala&#8217;s pleasure and nearness in that sense this (Salaah) is worship. And we are acting upon the orders of Allaah in that sense this (salaah) is following. Ita&#8217;ah(following) is in a different meaning and ibaadah (worship) is in a different meaning. Salaah is a single act but it is a combination of both Ibaadah and Ita&#8217;ah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Now as Maulana Maududi has raised this point that continuous Ita&#8217;ah o f someone is Ibadah. Therefore he says that if a slave lives his life in following Allaah Ta&#8217;ala then the whole life becomes Ibadah. But it is apparent by relying on the view of Al Qura&#8217;an this whole life will not be Ibaadah whatsoever, but will be Ita&#8217;ah of the slave acts upon the orders of Allaah ta&#8217;ala, then he has followed for his whole life and this is worthy of being rewarded for which he will be rewarded (Insha&#8217;Allaah). But it will not be called Ibaadah, This is the right conclusion of meaning.</p>

Urdu post made by brother Tariq Ali in noortv mailing list (which is transcript of speech made by Shaykh SafiurRahman Mubarakpuri rahimahullah).</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>An extract from letter of Shaykh Ibn Baz to Al-Mawdudy rahimahumullah concerning the difference between &#8216;Ibadah (worship) and obedience</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the name of Allah, the most Gracious, the most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An extract from my letter I sent to His Excellency Shaykh Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy concerning the difference between `Ibadah (worship) and obedience</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On 2/4//1392 AH, Abu Al-A`la Al-Mawdudy sent me a letter no. 1526, dated 2 Safar, 1392 A.H. explaining his case and Tufayl&#8217;s, his successor in the leadership of Islamic Group. I replied in the same year when I was the president of the Islamic university in Medinah and the following is some of my reply:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some brothers from Milbar living in the country told me that Your Eminence see that `Ibadah is clarified by obedience and that when someone obeys another, he worships him. `Ibadah is also interpreted as enslavement and idolization. Furthermore, Sheikh `Umar ibn Ahmad Al-Millibary, owner of Al-Salsabil Magazine, wrote to me concerning this issue asserting what is mentioned about you and the Group. He sent me a copy of a survey pertaining to this question. You will find an enclosed copy of it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This question appears strange for me so I determined to write to you before I receive your letter to know whether these statements which are attributed to you are true. So, please let me know your opinion. I see that obedience has a wider scope than `Ibadah. Every act of `Ibadah a person does in compliance with Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah is seen as obedience, but not every act of obedience to anything other than Allah (may He be Exalted) is seen as `Ibadah. This matter needs more elaboration. Obedience to Allah (may He be Exalted) is seen as `Ibadah when a person seeks to please Him. However, it may be valid or corrupt depending on whether the requirements of `Ibadah are met.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Please tell me in details your view on this question. It adds further explanation that `Ibadah may be denied by when tainted with Shirk as Allah says concerning Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship),(Surah Al-Kafirun, 109: 3) Nor will you worship that which I worship. `Ibadah is negated because of their acts of Shirk. It is known that they worship Allah (may He be Exalted) during times of hardships through showing Tawhid, performing Hajj and `Umrah, offering Sadaqah and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since these acts of `Ibadah are spoiled by Shirk, disbelief in the Hereafter and other kinds of disbelief during times of prosperity, it is permissible to negate the `Ibadah of people who show it. Furthermore, I would like to explain another point. The person who obeys the authorities or rulers in something forbidden by Allah (may He be Exalted) is not seen worshipping them when he does not believe in the permissibility of obedience to anyone in something opposing Allah&#8217;s Shari`ah. They rather obey these rules out of fear of their evils or vain desires while they know that they are sinful. Due to their act of obedience, such persons are sinners, not Mushriks, unless they obey such rulers in matters which involve Shirk. Examples of these matters include striking, killing, and taking someone&#8217;s money unjustly. There are many other examples that come under this heading. I think this view is known by the people of knowledge whose status is below yours. I find it imperative to ask you about this and know your detailed opinion so that I can refute any claim against you and support you with sure knowledge and show the truth concerning the Islamic Group to any one who seeks it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If what is attributed to you is true, we can discuss it thoroughly and examine the problematic issues using the evidence. The truth is the long-sought aim of everyone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah (may He be Exalted) to grant us success to do what pleases Him and to comprehend His Religion and to adhere to it. May Allah purify our hearts and deeds and make the truth our long-sought aim wherever we are, for He is the Most Generous! As-salamu `alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah&#8217;s Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 5: What is meant by Al-Siyasah Al-Shar`iyyah (Shari`ah-based policy)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Al-Siyasah Al-Shar`iyyah is that policy which is based on the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah by the ruler applying justice and the ruled giving their loyalty and obedience. It is explained by the Saying of Allah (Exalted be He): <span style="color:#008000;">Verily, Allâh commands that you should render back the trusts to those to whom they are due; and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice until His Saying: O you who believe! Obey Allâh and obey the Messenger (Muhammad), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 9: what is your view on those who say that there are no politics in Islam and no Islam in politics?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Shari`ah (Islamic law) has prescribed the correct policies between Muslim countries and other countries in times of peace and war. It has also prescribed the correct and successful policies that Muslim rulers must adopt when dealing with or governing Muslims all over the Islamic Ummah (nation) with respect to their spiritual and worldly life.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for evil politics that are based on corruption, delusion, lies, violating covenants, deceit and breaking promises, this was not prescribed by Shari`ah, and whoever looks into the texts of The Book, the Prophetic Sunnah and the biography of the Prophet (peace be upon him) will find that they are abundant in truthful and just policies observed with allies and enemies.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May Allah grant us success! May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>
<p>Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is taken from the Fatwa of <strong>Shaikh Ibn Baz</strong> (source: <a href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Page&amp;PageID=9137&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">alifta.com</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The perfection which Allah (Exalted be He) granted the Islamic Shari`ah of Muhammad (peace be upon him) is clear in its commands, prohibitions, and other rulings, which meet both the needs of souls and the demands of societies, despite the new variables and inventions that have come to light.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those who observe world religions that contradict Islam would find that their doctrines do not suit the requirements and aspects of this life and do not satisfy souls, so the adherents of these religions feel a desire to keep religion separate from politics. They say things like &#8220;Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In Islam, it is very different; for souls, when stricken by crises and problems, find in Islam and its legislation a way out and peace of mind. The more the souls keep away from the religion of Islam, the weaker Iman (Faith/belief) grows, the more they are disturbed by anxiety, and the more the society&#8217;s problems increase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Ibn Baaz</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Muslims help their brothers among the jinn to obey Allaah and His Messenger just as they help their human brothers. Humans may help them in some matters without realizing it. They may help them to obey Allaah and His Messenger by teaching and reminding other humans, for the jinn may attend the lessons of humans in the mosques and elsewhere and benefit from them. Humans may also hear some things from the jinn which benefit them; they may wake them up to pray or draw their attention to things which may benefit them or harm them. All of this happens even though the jinn do not make themselves visible to humans. A jinn may make himself visible to some people when pointing them towards something good or something evil. This may happen, although it is rare. Usually they do not appear to humans, although their voices may be heard on some occasions when they wake a person for prayer or tell him of some things. In conclusion, the believing jinn help the believers even though the believers may not realize it, and they love everything good for them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They may attend lessons, and they love to listen to the Quraan and knowledge, as stated above. The believers among the jinn attend the lessons of humans, at some times and in some lands, and they benefit from the lessons of humans. All of this happens and is well known. This has been clearly stated by many of the scholars whom the jinn contacted and asked about some issues; they told them that they had attended their lessons. All of this is well-known, and Allaah is the One Whose help we seek.</p>

&#8211; Ud-hiyah offered by your father is not sufficient for you if you are living with your family in a separate house</p>
<p><a href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Tree&amp;NodeID=1&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fatwas</a> &gt; <a href="http://alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Tree&amp;NodeID=126&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=10" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dhul-Hijjah Fatwas</a> &gt; What is the ruling on Ud-hiyah?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: I am married, praise be to Allah, and I have children. I live in a city other than the city in which my family lives, but on holidays I go to the city where my family is. On ‘Eid-ul-Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice), my children and I came five days before the ‘Eid but we did not offer the Ud-hiyah (sacrificial animal offered by non-pilgrims) even though I am able to, praise be to Allah.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Is it permissible for me to offer Ud-hiyah? Is my father’s Ud-hiyah valid on behalf of myself and my wife and children? What is the ruling on Ud-hiyah for the one who is financially able? Is it obligatory on the one who is not able? Is it permissible to take a loan in order to offer the Ud-hiyah? A.A.Sh. Rafha’ the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: The Ud-hiyah is a Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet), not Wajib (obligatory), and one sheep is sufficient on behalf of a man and the members of his household, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to sacrifice two-horned rams that were white speckled with black, every year; one on behalf of himself and the members of his household, and the other on behalf of those among his Ummah (nation based on one creed) who believe in the Oneness of Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you, dear questioner, are living in a separate house, then the Ud-hiyah offered by your father on behalf of himself and the members of his household is not sufficient for you, because you are not living with them in the same house. It is prescribed for you to offer Ud-hiyah on behalf of yourself and your family. There is nothing wrong with a Muslim taking a loan to offer Ud-hiyah if he is able to repay it. May Allah grant us all success</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q: When I was a young man, I committed some sins. Alhamdu lillah [All praise is due to Allah], for having guided me to make Tawbah (repentance to Allah). However, I still have doubts about whether Allah has accepted my Tawbah or not. Kindly enlighten me regarding Salat-ul-Tawbah (Prayer of Repentance). May Allah reward you with the best!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Alhamdu lillah, Tawbah wipes out all one&#8217;s past sins. Therefore, you should give up your doubts that Allah has turned your Tawbah away. Rather, you have to expect good from your Lord and have firm belief that He has accepted your heartfelt Tawbah. This is based on the Ayah (Qur&#8217;anic verse) in which Allah says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَتُوبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ جَمِيعًا أَيُّهَ الْمُؤْمِنُونَ لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ</span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And all of you beg Allâh to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful</strong> </span><br />
(Surah Al-Nur, 24: 31)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above Ayah, Allah has made success contingent upon making Tawbah. Anyone who turns in Tawbah to Allah, will achieve success. Allah (Glorified be He) says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِنِّي لَغَفَّارٌ لِّمَن تَابَ وَآمَنَ وَعَمِلَ صَالِحًا ثُمَّ اهْتَدَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And verily, I am indeed forgiving to him who repents, believes </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(in My Oneness, and associates none in worship with Me)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> and does righteous good deeds, and then remains constant in doing them,</span></strong><span style="color:#008000;"> (till his death)</span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">. </span></strong>(Surah Ta­Ha, 20: 82)</p>
<p>Allah is the Ever-Truthful Who never breaks His Promises.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (Glorified be He) also says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا تُوبُوا إِلَى اللَّهِ تَوْبَةً نَّصُوحًا عَسَىٰ رَبُّكُمْ أَن يُكَفِّرَ عَنكُمْ سَيِّئَاتِكُمْ وَيُدْخِلَكُمْ جَنَّاتٍ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;"> O you who believe! Turn to Allâh with sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will expiate from you your sins, and admit you into Gardens under which rivers flow (Paradise)</span> </strong>(Surah Al-Tahrim, 66: 8)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the above Ayah Allah&#8217;s Promise, as indicated by the words &#8220;It may be &#8230;&#8221;, should be understood to mean that He will surely fulfill His Promise.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you have to expect good from Allah and assume that He has accepted your Tawbah provided that you are sincere and full of remorse for committing these past sins. You also have to be determined not to return to doing them again. You have to be aware of incitements of Satan. In one Hadith Qudsy (Revelation from Allah in the Prophet&#8217;s words) Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;I am near to the thought of My Servant as he thinks about Me.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you ought to have firm belief that Allah has accepted your Tawbah. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Let none of you die without expecting good from Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted)</strong> (Related by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith)<br />
<span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="color:#008000;text-decoration:underline;"><br />
</span></span><span style="color:#993300;">As for Salat-ul-Tawbah, it was authentically reported on the authority of Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anyone who commits a sin, performs Wudu&#8217; (ablution) properly, and then offers two Rak&#8217;ahs (units of Prayer) wherein he asks Allah to forgive his sins, Allah will accept his Tawbah</strong>. (Related by Ahmad)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Sunnah for a person during Salah is to look at the place of Sujud</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Where should a person look while offering Salah (Prayer)?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is an act of the Sunnah to look at the place of Sujud (Prostration during Prayer) while standing and during Ruku` (bowing) but while sitting for Tashahhud (a recitation in the sitting position in the second/ last unit of Prayer) or between the two Sujuds one should look at his fingers as mentioned in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;">Q: Which is better for a man offering Salah in Al-Haram; to look at Al-Ka`bah or at the place of Sujud?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: It is prescribed in all Prayers and in every place to look at the place of Sujud because this is more beneficial in bringing about submission and concentration except during Tashahhud. Therefore, it is an act of the Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) to look at the fingers. May Allah grant all success!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>We always hear the Hadith:</strong><strong> Women are lacking in their capacity to reason and in deen i.e. religion. </strong>Some people even use it to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">offend</span> women. Could you kindly explain the meaning of this Hadith? </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Answer by shaykh ibn baz rahimahullah: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Hadith reads:<a rel="nofollow"> &#8220;I have not seen anyone more deficient in ability to reason and deen than you. A cautious sensible man can be led astray by some of you.” It was said: “O Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon him)! What is the deficiency in our reasoning and deen?” He said: “Is not the testimony of two women equal to the witness of one man?” It was said: &#8220;What is deficient in her deen?&#8221; The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: &#8220;Is not it true that a woman can neither pray nor fast during her menses?” </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (peace be upon him) explained that the deficiency in woman&#8217;s reasoning means their weak memory. Therefore, their testimony must be verified and supported by another woman to confirm their testimony, because they may forget and thus add or omit some of the testimony. Allah (He may be Praised) states:Surah Al-Baqarah, 2: 282<a rel="nofollow"> And get two witnesses out of your own men. And if there are not two men (available), then a man and two women, such as you agree for witnesses, so that if one of them (two women) errs, the other can remind her. </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the deficiency of their deen, it means they abandon Salah and Sawm (fasting) during their menses and post-partum period. They are not commanded to repeat Salah (prayer). This is the meaning of their being lacking in deen. They will not be called to account for this shortcoming, because it is the will of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) Who legislated this for their comfort. If they were to observe Sawm during their menses and post-partum period, it would be difficult for them. Therefore, Allah commands them to abandon Sawm during their menses and post-partum period, and make up for it later. As for Salah, there is something which prevents them from ceremonial purity. Therefore, it is out of the Mercy of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) that He commands them to abandon Salah during their menses and post-partum period. However, they are commanded not to compensate for Salah because there is great hardship in this, as Salah is repeated five times a day  and night, and menses may last for many days; seven, eight or more and post-partum may last for forty days. So, it was of Allah&#8217;s Mercy and Benevolence not to hold them accountable for Salah or oblige them to make up for it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This does not mean that the lack of their deficiency to reason and deen extends to every aspect of life. The Prophet (peace be upon him) explained that the lack of their ability to reason is because of their weak memory when giving testimony, and the shortcoming in their worship is because they abandon Salah and Sawm during their menses and post-partum period. This does not mean that they are lower in rank than men in all things, or men are better than them in everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Generally speaking, males excel females for many reasons. Allah states:Surah Al-Nisa&#8217;, 4: 34<a rel="nofollow"> Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other, and because they spend (to support them) from their means. </a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, some women may excel men. There are many women whose reason is better than men, and are stronger in deen and memorization. The report of the Prophet (peace be upon him) only indicates that the male gender is generally better in reasoning and deen than the female gender in the two aspects specified by the Prophet (peace be upon him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Women may perform more righteous deeds than men, their piety may be more than men, and thus their rank in the Hereafter may be better than the rank of men. They may focus on some matters and memorize them better than men. They exert effort in memorization and focus, so they established a reference in Islamic history as well as other things which are clear to those who consider the conditions of women during the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) and later. It is now evident that this deficiency does not mean that we cannot rely on her in narration or testimony, if she is supported by another woman. Anyway, this report does not prevent her from being of the best servants of Allah  if they perform righteous deeds; although Sawm is overlooked during their menses and post-partum, and even if they are exempt from performing Salah. This does not mean that they are lower in everything. Men and women are equally required to observe the standards of piety, good actions, and careful performance of things in their charge. This specific lack of reason and deen is limited to what the Prophet (peace be upon him) explained. <strong>So, a Muslim must not offend women by attributing deficiency to them in everything, but it is a flaw in their worship and weakness in reasoning with regard to accuracy of testimony. Thus, the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him) should be properly understood. Allah knows the best.</strong></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>[ A discipline that searches for answers to creedal issues using Logic ]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ilmul-Kalaam (argumentation based on Greek philosophy) is among such innovations in the religion that created intellectual schisms in the Muslim nation and initiated deviant trends. One of the sects that indulged in Ilmul-Kalaam were the Mu&#8217;tazilah. They gave precedence to intellect over the revealed texts of the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah &#8211; when they perceived the two conflicted. This attitude set an evil precedent for all later groups who sought to make intellect and desire decisive over the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah</p>
<p><strong>Ibn Baz Fatwa on this topic:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q 3: Some people read many intellectual and scientific books and think that they have become a scholar or a Da&#8217;y (caller to Islam), although they may have poor knowledge in Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and have not read any books about Shari&#8217;ah (Islamic law). What is Your Eminence&#8217;s opinion in this regard?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A: Knowledge of Shari&#8217;ah is derived from what Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) have said, and not from someone else&#8217;s words. The first source of Islamic knowledge is the Word of Allah and His Messenger, then the views of Muslim scholars who explain and interpret them for people. These scholars are Allah&#8217;s successors on earth after the messengers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah (may He be Glorified and Exalted) says:(Surah Al-`Imran, 3: 18) Allýh bears witness that Lý ilýha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), and the angels, and those having knowledge (also give this witness). Here, knowledge refers to knowing Allah and His Religion. Allah (may He be Exalted) says:(Surah Fatir, 35: 28) It is only those who have knowledge among His slaves that fear Allýh. They are the messengers and their insightful followers, who follow this truthful religion and abide by the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). Muslim scholars are the heirs of Messengers, since they explain the religion and guide others to Allah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Moreover, a true knowledge seeker studies and reflects on the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah and learns from Muslim scholars. This is the way of acquiring knowledge of Shari`ah which involves doing acts of obedience, meditating and benefiting from others. A knowledge seeker should read a lot, with the aim of attaining as much knowledge as possible. They should reflect on knowledge and look for answers to unclear matters in trustworthy books of Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings of the Qur&#8217;an) such as Tafsir by Ibn Kathir, Al-Baghawy and others, in addition to paying great attention to books of Hadith. Furthermore, <strong>knowledge of Shari`ah should be taken from knowledgeable scholars among <em>Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama&#8217;ah</em> (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim main body) and not scholars of &#8216;Ilm-ul-Kalam (a discipline that searches for answers to creedal issues using logic), innovators in religion or ignorant people.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anything that is not included in the Qur&#8217;an and Sunnah cannot be considered Islamic knowledge, even if it is useful in worldly affairs. Here, we are concerned about knowledge that is useful in the Hereafter, which eliminates ignorance, clarifies the religion and shows people what Allah has made lawful and unlawful to them. Indeed, this is the true knowledge of Shari`ah.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Alifta.net</strong> <a href="http://www.alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Tree&amp;NodeID=1&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=10" rel="nofollow">Fatwas</a> &gt; <a href="http://www.alifta.com/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?View=Tree&amp;NodeID=157&amp;PageNo=1&amp;BookID=10" rel="nofollow">Al-Muharram Fatwas</a> &gt; Which is better: Sawm on the 10th with the 9th or the 10th with the 11th of Muharram?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Observing Sawm on the ninth and tenth of Muharram is better than on the tenth and eleventh</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What is the ruling on observing Sawm (Fast) on the Day of ‘Ashura’ (10th of Muharram)? Is it better to observe Sawm on the day that precedes it, the day that succeeds it, all the three days, or on the Day of ‘Ashura’ only? Please clarify the matter. May Allah reward you with the best! </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> Answer: </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is a Sunnah (supererogatory act of worship following the example of the Prophet) to observe Sawm on the Day of ‘Ashura’ for the authentic Hadiths in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated so. The Prophet (peace be upon him) mentioned that the Jews used to observe Sawm on that Day because it was the day on which Allah (may He be Exalted) rescued Prophet Musa (Moses, peace be upon him) and his people and destroyed Pharaoh and his people. Our Prophet Muhammad thus, observed Sawm on the Day of ‘Ashura’ to express his gratitude to Allah, advised Muslims to do so, and directed us as well to observe Sawm on the day preceding or succeeding it. However, observing Sawm on the ninth and tenth of Muharram is better than doing so on the tenth and eleventh. The latter form is also sufficient for it contradicts the practice of the Jews as well. One may also observe Sawm on all three days, i.e. the ninth, the tenth, and the eleventh of Muharram as is reported in some narrations:<img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H2.GIF" alt="" /><a> Fast a day before (the Day of ‘Ashura’) and a day after it. </a><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.com/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-H1.GIF" alt="" />But, it is Makruh (reprehensible) to observe Sawm on the Day of ‘Ashura’ only, i.e. without accompanying it by the preceding or the succeeding day. May Allah grant us success!</p>
