										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Would it be disbelief to study at a kaafir school (i.e. public school system in Canada), knowing that we live in a kaafir country, and that we also need an education? This is in addition to the fact that these schools have free-mixing environments where the women do not cover properly. And if studying at these schools is not permissible, is there any exception for those who wish to study at these schools so as to attain some certificate or degree so as to facilitate their plans for hijrah?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Ans</strong>: First of all, any of the schools which contain <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>free mixing environments and intermingling of the genders</strong></span>, then attendance in these schools and studying in them is not allowable for whatever reason. And if the schools are free of free mixing and intermingling, then it is allowable to study in this schools if what is being taught does not contain <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>ideology of kufr or systems of kufr</strong></span>. And if it does not contain what promotes kufr, nor does it call to it. So if a Muslim was to study for example engineering, be that of planes or cars or computers (or other than them), and all these being from the inventions of mankind, in order that he may benefit himself and benefit the Muslims, then this is allowable and it is desired that the Muslims may benefit from this type of knowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is upon the Muslims to cooperate upon righteousness and fearing of Allaah (subhaana wa ta’laa). Allaah’s statement:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;Help you one another in Al Birr and AtTaqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety.&#8221;</strong> (Al-Ma&#8217;idah 5:2)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So studying in schools which are free from intermingling of men and women, then this is allowable as long as it is free from those things which are muharram (not allowable) in the deen. And also with the condition that what is being studied does not contain disbelief in it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the shaykh mentioned the order of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) to Zayd bin Thaabit to study the language of the Jews. And Zayd bin Thaabit (radiyAllaahu anhu) went on and mentioned that he had mastered the language of the Jews in fifteen days. And this was of benefit to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم), as Zayd bin Thaabit was able to translate the letter of the Jews for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and also write to them. And Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that the language was studied so that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and the Muslims may be safe from the planning and the plotting of the Jews.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation Of The Text In Al-Qawl-ul-Mufeed Fee Adillatit Tawheed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Benefit (Faa’idah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>ash-Shaykh al-‘Allaamah al-Faqeeh Muhammad ibn Saalih ibn ‘Uthaymeen (rahimahullaahu ta’aalaa) said:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In his valuable book ((al-Ibdaa’ fee Kamaal ash-Shara’ wa Khatar al-Ibtidaa’)) [Innovations in the Perfect Legislation and the Hazards of Innovations] pages 21 –23:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( … Oh my brother, verily following and adherence does not become a reality until the action is in agreement with six issues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The First (al-Awwal): <strong>as-Sabab (Reason)</strong>. Like the one who prays two Raka’at for the reason of the descending of the rain (Nuzool al-Matar).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Second (ath-Thaanee): <strong>al-Jins (Type)</strong>. Like the one who brings his Zakaat al-Fitr in the form of money.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Third (ath-Thaalith): <strong>al-Qadar (Number)</strong>. Like the one who prays four Raka’at for Maghrib intentionally.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fourth (ar-Raabi’): <strong>al-Kayfiyyah (How)</strong>. Like the one who makes Wudoo’ (ablution) and starts with his feet and ends with his face.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Fifth (al-Khaamis): <strong>az-Zamaan (Time)</strong>. Like the one who performs the ‘Udhiyah (slaughtering) in Ramadhaan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Sixth (as-Saadis): <strong>al-Makaan (Place)</strong>. Like the one who makes I’tikaaf in places other than the Masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Oh my brother: Bite unto the Sunnah of the Messenger ( صلى الله عليه و سلم) with your molar teeth (an- Nawaajidh). And tread the path of as-Salafus-Saalih (the righteous predecessors), and be on what they were upon, and see if this harms you in any way?!). End of his (rahimahullaah) speech with abbreviation (Tasarruf) and summarization (Ikhtisaar).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Explanation Of The Text By Shaykh Ahmed Al-Wasaabee (Hafidhahullaah):</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The above six conditions that have been mentioned, they are the conditions for which every action must be in agreement to them. And the examples that ash-Shaykh al-‘Uthaymeen has mentioned for each of the six conditions are the actions that are opposite to and do not satisfy these conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in regards to the first condition, and it is as-Sabab (reason), then the example mentioned, which is of the one who prays two Raka’at for the descending of the rain, then it has no Daleel (evidence) from the Kitaab or the Sunnah, and the Book and the Sunnah have not legislated and given us permission to pray two Raka’at for the reason of the descending of the rain.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the second example, of the one who brings his Zakaat al-Fitr in the form of money, then this is in opposition to the Ahaadeeth of the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم) when he ordered the people that they should bring out their Zakaat at the end of Ramadhaan in the form of foodstuff, such as raisins or dates.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the third condition, which is al-Qadar (number), and the example mentioned is of the one who prays four Raka’at for Salaatul-Maghrib intentionally, and we know the number legislated for Salaatul-Maghrib is three Raka’at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the fourth example is of the person who makes Wudoo’ and starts with his feet first and ends with his face, and this is also in opposition to the Sunnah of the Prophet ( صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So al-‘Allaamah ibn ‘Uthaymeen has mentioned the examples which oppose and go against the Sunnah in these six conditions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the sixth condition, which is al-Makaan (place), and the example mentioned is of the one who makes I’tikaaf in places other than the Masjid. So the one who makes I’tikaaf in his house, or in a cave, or in any place other than the Masjid, then his I’tikaaf is not accepted. And the best places to make I’tikaaf are the three Masaajid: Masjid al-Haraam, Masjid an- Nabawee, and Masjid al-Aqsa. And there is a Hadeeth in which we find the wording: ((<em><span style="color:#008000;">There is no I’tikaaf except in the three Masaajid</span></em>)) [Laa I’tikaaf Illaa fil-Masaajid ath-Thalaathah] [1]. And Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that this Hadeeth is weak in its chain, and the meaning of the Hadeeth is that the best and more perfect type of I’tikaaf is in these three Masaajid, even though it is allowable for a person to make I’tikaaf in other than these three Masaajid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#999999;"><em>[1] 1 Sa’eed ibn Mansoor said in his Sunan as is stated in al-Muhallaa (5/195, issue: 633): Sufyaan ibn ‘Uyaynah narrated to us from Jaami’ ibn Abee Raashid from Shaqeeq ibn Salamah that he said: “Hudhayfah said to ‘Abdullaah ibn Mas’ood: ‘I have come to know that the Messenger of Allaah ( صلى الله عليه و سلم ) said: ((There is no I’tikaaf except in the three Masaajid)).’”</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By Shaykh Ahmed al-Wasaabee<br />

</a>The Ninth Invalidator: Believing That Some Have The Choice To Leave Of The Sharee&#8217;ah Of Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Translation Of The Text In Al-Qawl-ul-Mufeed Fee Adillatit Tawheed:</strong></span></p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever believes that some of the people have been given the choice to leave off the Sharee&#8217;ah of Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), just as al-Khidr was given the choice to go outside the jurisdiction of the Sharee&#8217;ah of Moosa (alayhi assalam), then he has disbelieved. That is because every Prophet was sent specifically to his own people, so it is not obligatory for all the people to follow them. As for our Prophet, Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam), then he was sent for all peoples, so it is not lawful for anyone to oppose him, not to leave off his Sharee&#8217;ah.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Say (O Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam): &#8220;O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allâh</span> (Al-A&#8217;raf 7:158)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Glorified and Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And We have sent you (O Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) not but as a mercy for the &#8216;Alamîn (mankind, jinns and all that exists).</span> (Al-Anbiya 21:107)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the statement of Allaah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Blessed be He Who sent down the criterion (of right and wrong, i.e. this Qur&#8217;ân) to His slave (Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) that he may be a warner to the &#8216;Alamîn (mankind and jinns).</span> (Al-Furqan 25:1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And We have not sent you (O Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) except as a giver of glad tidings and a warner to all mankind, but most of men know not</span>. (Saba&#8217; 34:28)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From Jaabir Ibn &#8216;Abdullaah al-Ansaaree (radiyallaahu &#8216;anhumaa), that the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I was given five things that no one before me was given: [i] I was aided by causing intimidation for a months time; [ii] the entire earth was made a masjid (place of prostration) and pure for me, so regardless of where a man from my Ummah is, whenever the Prayer reaches him, he may pray; [iii] and the spoils of war have been made lawful for me and they were not made lawful for anyone before me; [iv] and I have been given the intercession (shafaa&#8217;ah); [v] and <strong>every Prophet was sent specifically to his people and I have been sent to all of mankind</strong>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(al-Bukhaaree no. 328 &amp; Muslim no. 521)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Truly, the religion with Allâh is Islâm.</span> (Aali Imran 3:19)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And whoever seeks a religion other than Islâm, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.</span> (Aali Imran 3:85)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion.</span> (Al-Ma&#8217;idah 5:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah the Glorified and Exalted says,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do they seek other than the religion of Allâh (the true Islâmic Monotheism worshipping none but Allâh Alone), while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned. (Aali Imran 3:83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And there occurs in a hadeeth,</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>&#8220;By Allaah if Moosaa was living, he would have no choice but to follow me&#8221; </strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(Da&#8217;eef &#8211; Shaykh Muqbil &amp; Hasan by al-Albaanee al Irwaa&#8217; no. 1589 &amp; mentioned in Ibn Katheer of this verse)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Explanation Of The Text By Shaykh Al-Wasaabee:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmed (hafidhahullaah) mentioned to us that this ninth invalidator has a connection to the third invalidator, which is not stating the Christians and the Jews as disbelievers as Allaah has mentioned them as being disbelievers. The Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) has certain things that are specific to him, no other Prophet were given these things; one of these is that Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) was sent for all the people. This is unlike the other Prophets who were sent specifically for their people and this is mentioned directly in the text from the Hadith from Jaabir Ibn &#8216;Abdullaah al- Ansaaree (radiyAllaahu &#8216;anhu).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh then mentioned to us that Allaah (subhaana wa ta&#8217;laa) has completed the revelation with Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and that there remains no deen after Muhammad except Islaam and whoever holds onto anything other than Islaam then it will not be accepted from him. Also, his works will be refuted and not accepted. Whoever, from the people who have had news of this deen reach them, and verily the news of this deen of Islaam and Muhammad (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) has reached all the people, and they do not believe in it they will be the people of the fire.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh also mentioned, concerning the verse in Sooratul Ma&#8217;idah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion.</span> (Al-Ma&#8217;idah 5:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That it was revealed in the farewell pilgrimage of the Prophet (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) and that after he (Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) returned from the hajj to Medina he lived for a few days. Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that this ayah is a great verse and that it explains the greatness of Islaam until:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated Tariq bin Shihab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A Jew said to &#8216;Umar, &#8220;O Chief of the Believers, if this verse: &#8216;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favors upon you, and have chosen for you, Islam as your religion.&#8217; (5.3) had been revealed upon us, we would have taken that day as an &#8216;Id (festival) day.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I know definitely on what day this Verse was revealed; it was revealed on the day of &#8216;Arafat, on a Friday.&#8221; (al-Bukhaaree no. 6800)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh then mentioned to us that the Muslims to do not take their celebrations and their &#8216;Eid from themselves. The Muslims have 3 &#8216;Eids, &#8216;Eid of fitr and the &#8216;Eid of adha, which are the two &#8216;Eids that come yearly and the third &#8216;Eid which is yawmul Jum&#8217;ah. The Muslims do not take their &#8216;Eids like the Jews and Christians, who take their &#8216;Eids at every single matter, like for example the celebration of the birthday.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that anyone who takes a deen other than Islaam it will not be accepted from them and that there is no excuse that we enter is Islaam and that we don&#8217;t pray, hear and obey. Our return is to Allaah (subhaana wa ta&#8217;laa) using the explanation of the verse,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Do they seek other than the religion of Allâh (the true Islâmic Monotheism worshipping none but Allâh Alone), while to Him submitted all creatures in the heavens and the earth, willingly or unwillingly. And to Him shall they all be returned.</span> (Aali Imran 3:83)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our deen, the deen of Islaam, has abrogated all of the deens, and that there remains no other deen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh mentioned to us the statement of Allaah,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad Sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam) the Book (this Qur&#8217;ân) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Mohayminan (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures).</span> (Al-Ma&#8217;idah 5:48)</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">These were lessons conducted on the book &#8216;<strong>al-Qawl-ul- Mufeed Fee Adillatit-Tawhid&#8217; [Beneficial Speech in Establishing the Evidences of Tawhid] </strong>written by one of the major scholars of the Sunnah in Yemen, <strong>Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi</strong> (may Allah preserve him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were explained live via a telephone conference calling system by the Imam of the Masjid in Dar-ul-Hadith, Dammaj (Yemen), who is one of the senior scholars of the center of learning in Dammaj, <strong>Shaikh Ahmad al-Wasabi</strong> (may Allah preserve him). These lessons were conducted every Saturday from the period of April 2005 to June 2006. The .pdf files also contain questions which were asked in relation to the topic of the lesson in question.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The reviver of the Sunnah in Yemen, <strong>Shaikh Muqbil ibn Hadi al-Wadi&#8217;ee</strong> (rahimahullah) [d.1422H], said regarding this book:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;This treatise deserves to be instilled in students in centres of learning due to the much good in contains since it is small in size and large in benefit&#8230;I also advise all the scholars of the Sunnah in Yemen to increase in their efforts in spreading knowledge, writings and lectures. And by the Praise of Allah this book has benefitted much and it has been recommended as a syllabus for students in many of the centres for learning the Sunnah. And few will you find on the Sunnah except that this book is in their homes.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Shaikh Muqbil (rahimahullah) goes on to praise the author of the book by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;The Shaikh Abu Ibrahim Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi al-Abdali established upon teaching, writing and calling to Allah. Allah has given him patience and full comprehension in all the branches of hadith and therefore the ability to judge the authenticity and weakness of the hadith&#8230;Our brother, Abu Ibraheem is assisted upon continuation of the journey in seeking and spreading knowledge by his Zuhd and by his concentration on knowledge and teaching until he became a reference and his fatawa and his statements became dependable, and that is by the Grace of Allah upon him. And Allah is the only one to bestow this Grace.&#8221;</p>

by Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi (may Allah preserve him).</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>TRANSLATION OF THE TEXT IN AL-QAWL-UL-MUFEED FEE ADILLATIT TAWHEED:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Du’aah Ilaa Bid’atihim (Caller to the innovation).</li>
<li>Ghayr Du’aah Ilayhaa (Those who do not call to it).</li>
</ol>
<p>See Hadee as-Saaree of al-Haafidh Ibn Hajar (rahimahullaah) page 385.</p>
<p><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AHMED AL-WASAABEE (HAFIDHAHULLAAH):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that the majority of the scholars are upon this division of the people of innovation:</p>
<ol>
<li>those who call to their innovation and</li>
<li>those who do not call to their innovation.</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And it is mandatory upon us that we take caution from both categories. And the first category of people are more hazardous to the general people than the second category. And even the second category, those who do not call to their innovation, then caution must still be taken from them, for verily a person can be fooled by a particular persons’ statements and actions, because even though he may not be calling to his innovation directly and explicitly, but his actions and deeds are calling to his innovation, and this is very harmful to the slaves of Allaah, and they must take caution from this. And from the way of the Salaf was that they used to have complete caution from all types of people of innovation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">From Sa’eed ibn ‘Aamir who said: “I heard Ismaa’eel [i.e. Ibn Khaarijah] narrate, saying: ‘Two men from the people of the innovated sects came to Muhammad Ibn Seereen and said: “O Aboo Bakr we want to narrate something to you.” He said: “No.” They said: “Then may we recite an Aayah from Allaah’s book to you?” He said: “No, not even half of an Aayah!” He said: “Either you two get up and leave or I will get up.” So the two men stood up and left. So one of the people said: “What harm would it do to you for him to recite an Aayah?” He said: “I hated that he should recite an Aayah and that they would distort it and then it would enter my heart.”</span> [Reported in Sharh Usool I’tiqaad Ahlis-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah of Imaam al-Laalikaa’ee, no. 242.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Shaykh Ahmed mentioned that Ibn Seereen (rahimahullaah) was scared that something might fall into his heart from the beautiful words of that person of innovation, even though he was not calling to his innovation. So the way of the Salaf is that the people of innovation, the Ahlul-Bid’ah, are not to be sat with, and they are not to be listened to, and Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) has made Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa’ah in sufficiency, and there is no need for the people of innovation, whether they are calling to their innovation or are not calling to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And from the people are those who say concerning the people of innovation that we take from them [i.e. the Ahlul-Bid’ah] that which is good, and we leave off the evil that is with them. And Shaykh Ahmed (hafidhahullaah) mentioned that this is a false statement, and it is an incorrect statement. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And what is correct is that we do not take from the people of innovation in entirety</strong></span>. And there are great dangers in this [i.e. this false statement that we take the good and leave the bad], and the Shaykh mentioned a story that one of the early Salaf wanted to marry a woman who was known to be from a sect of the Khawaarij. And he hoped that by marrying her he might win her over to the Sunnah, but when he did marry her, it turned out that in fact she had pulled him to the beliefs of the Khawaarij.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaikh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab al-Wasabi </strong>(may Allah preserve him).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That the religion of al-Islaam can be summarized into two basic important and mighty principles, and they are as follows:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The First (al-Awwal):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That we do not worship anyone except Allaah alone, having no partner in that<br />
[An-laa Na’budu illa-Allaah Wahdahu laa Shareeka lah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (ta’aalaa) said:<br />
Say (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam): &#8220;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians): Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allaah, and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allaah.&#8221; Then, if they turn away, say: &#8220;Bear witness that we are Muslims.&#8221; (Aali Imraan 3:64)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said: And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him. (Al-Israa’ 17:23)<br />
And this is the meaning of: (I bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah) [Ash-hadu an-laa Ilaaha illa-Allaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>And The Second (ath-Thaanee):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That we do not worship Him except by what He legislated in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Messenger Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), without innovations and desires [An-laa Na’budahu illaa bimaa Shara’ fee Kitaabihi aw fee Sunnati Rasoolihi Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) laa bil-Bida’i wal-Ahwaa’].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (ta’aalaa) said:<br />
[Say (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) to these idolaters (pagan ‘Arabs) of your folk:] Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord (the Qur’aan and Prophet Muhammad&#8217;s Sunnah), and follow not any Awliyaa&#8217; (protectors and helpers, etc. who order you to associate partners in worship with Allaah), besides Him (Allaah). Little do you remember! (Al-A&#8217;raaf 7:3)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) gives you, take it, and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it), and fear Allaah. Verily, Allaah is Severe in punishment. (Al-Hashr 59:7) And this is the meaning of: (I bear witness that Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) is the Messenger of Allaah) [Ash-hadu anna Muhammadar-Rasool-ullaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykhul-Islaam ibn Taymiyyah (rahimahullaah) said in his valuable book ((Iqtidaa’ as- Siraatul-Mustaqeem Mukhaalifat Ashaab al-Jaheem)) [The Requirements of the Straight Path in Opposing the Companions of the Fire] page 451:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">( And these two fundamentals: are the essence of the religion (Jimaa’ ad-Deen): That we do not worship anyone except Allaah and that we do not worship Him except with what He has legislated, and we do not worship Him with innovations … and these two fundamentals, they are the realization and the perfection of the two testimonies (ash-Shahaadatayn), which are the head of al- Islaam … ). End of quote. And see at-Tahqeeq wal-‘Eedaah of ash-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (rahimahullaah) page: 63.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AHMED AL-WASAABEE (HAFIDHAHULLAAH):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the first fundamental principle, which is the Tawheed of Allaah, the Shaykh mentioned that in the Kitaab of Allaah and the Sunnah of His Messenger we find many Aayaat and Ahaadeeth that point to this great fundamental principle. And it was for this cause that Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) sent His Messengers, and He ordered them to call the people first and foremost to this fundamental principle, which is the Tawheed of Allaah, and the oneness of Allaah in His worship (Tawheed al-Ulooheeyah), and the oneness of Allaah in His Names and Attributes (Tawheed al- Asmaa was-Sifaat), and the oneness of Allaah in His Lordship (Tawheed ar-Ruboobeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) said:<br />
And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): &#8220;Worship Allaah (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Taaghoot (all false deities, etc. i.e. do not worship Taaghoot besides Allaah).&#8221; (An-Nahl 16:36)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He (ta’aalaa) said:<br />
And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam)) but We inspired him (saying): Laa Ilaaha Illaa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allaah)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).&#8221; (Al-Anbiyaa’ 21:25)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if a person worships Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) and obeys these commands of Allaah, then this is the realization of Tawheed, and this is the first fundamental which this religion of al-Islaam is based upon.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the second fundamental principle, and it is that we do not worship Allaah except by what He has legislated in His Book or in the Sunnah of His Messenger Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), and that we do not worship Him with innovations and desires. The Shaykh mentioned that those who beautify and make beautiful to themselves innovations and desires, and from the innovations is celebrating the Mawlid (birthday) of the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam), which is an innovation of the Soofiyyah, and the Shaykh mentioned that this is not allowable in our religion and it is not legislated, and the people who perform this, they are under a severe threat. Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) has issued a severe warning against those who oppose and go against the commandments of the Messenger:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And let those who oppose the Messenger&#8217;s (Muhammad (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam)) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them. (An-Noor 24:63)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We have been ordered to be followers and we have been ordered to take firm hold of the Sunnah. So that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has given us, then it is upon to take it and firmly hold on to it, and that which he prohibited us from then it is upon us to prohibit ourselves from it. And the one who goes against the clear orders of the Messenger (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) is in opposition to the Messenger, and he is on a great level of jeopardy, and if Allaah (subhaanahu wa ta’aalaa) does not give him the Tawfeeq to repent, and he dies upon this, then he is in a dangerous state. And many of the people in this day and age have fallen into numerous types of innovations, such as the Soofiyyah and the Raafidhah, and other than them. And they have not prohibited themselves from that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has prohibited them from, and they have not enjoined upon themselves that which the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has enjoined upon them and ordered them with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in the valuable book of Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah is the warning to the Believers of following the path of the people whose destination is the Fire, the people of the Book, the Jews and the Christians. And in this day and age we find many of the Muslims following the Kuffaar in all levels of life. And verily we have been ordered to oppose the Kuffaar in all actions and in all levels of life, such as our speech, and our character, and in our dress, and in our actions of worship, so much so that even in the prayer, as the Prophet (Sallalahi Alaihi wa Sallam) has said: ((Pray in your shoes, for verily the Jews do not pray in their shoes)). A Hadeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And many of the Muslims have invented various holidays following in the footsteps of the Kuffaar, such as labor day, and workers holiday, and mothers day, and other holidays like this, all of which are alien to al-Islaam and all of which are innovations.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">Whosoever The Qur’Aan And The Sunnah Does Not Suffice,Then May Allaah Not Suffice Him (Man-Lam Yakfih Alqur’Aan Was-Sunnah Falaa Kafaahul-Allaah)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Translation Of The Text In Al-Qawl-Ul-Mufeed Fee Adillatit Tawheed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Benefit (Faa’idah):<br />
al-‘Allaamah Ibnul-Qayyim has mentioned in Zaad al-Ma’aad: 4/352:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His (ta’aalaa) statement:<br />
Is it not sufficient for them that We have sent down to you the Book (the Qur&#8217;aan) which is recited to them? (Al-&#8216;Ankaboot 29:51)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said: ((Whosoever the Qur’aan does not heal, then may Allaah not heal him. And whosoever the Qur’aan does not suffice, then may Allaah not suffice him)) [Faman lam Yashfih al- Qur’aan, Falaa Shafaahul-Allaah, wa man lam Yakfih Falaa Kafaahul-Allaah]. End of quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Aboo Ibraaheem [2] said: Whosoever the Book and the Sunnah does not suffice, then may Allaah not suffice him. And whosoever the Book and the Sunnah does not satisfy, then may Allaah not satisfy him [Wa man lam Yakfih al-Kitaab was-Sunnah Falaa Kafaahul-Allaah, wa man lam Yaqna’ bil-Kitaab was-Sunnah Falaa Aqna’hul-Allaah].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>EXPLANATION OF THE TEXT BY SHAYKH AHMED AL-WASAABEE (HAFIDHAHULLAAH): </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We find many of the people of innovation following the statements of their leaders in misguidance, and beautifying this to themselves and to the people, and leaving off the guidance of the Kitaab and the Sunnah. So the phrases that are mentioned in this chapter are supplications against these people and their likes, from the people of innovations and desires, those who are not satisfied, and do not find comfort in the Kitaab and the Sunnah, then these are supplications against them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] And he is the writer, ash-Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab al-Wasaabee (hafidhahullaah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Posted from Class 43 this Excellent Book:</strong></p>
