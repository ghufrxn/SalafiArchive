<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Settling in al-Madeenah and the Coming Down of the Rest of the Religious Duties and the Completion of the Religion</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">فلما استقر بالمدينة أمر ببقية شرائع الإسلام ، مثل الزكاة والصوم والحج والجهاد ، والأذان ، والأمر بالمعروف والنهي عن المنكر ، وغير ذلك من شرائع الإسلام ، أخذ على هذا عشر سنين ، وبعدها توفي صلوات الله وسلامه عليه ، ودينه باق وهذا دينه ، لا خير إلا دل الأمة عليه ، ولا شر إلا حذرها منه ، والخير الذي دلها عليه التوحيد وجميع ما يحبه الله ويرضاه ، والشر الذي حذر منه الشرك وجميع ما يكرهه الله ويأباه ، بعثه الله إلى الناس كافة ، وافترض الله طاعته على جميع الثقلين الجن والإنس </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">When he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> settled in al-Madeenah, he was ordered with the rest of the prescribed duties of <em>Islaam</em>, such as the <em>zakaat</em>; fasting (<em><u>S</u>awm</em>); <em>Hajj</em>; <em>Jihaad</em>; the <em>adhaan</em>; commanding good and forbidding evil; and the rest of the prescribed duties of <em>Islaam</em>.  He spent ten years establishing that, after which he passed away, may Allaah extol and send blessings of peace upon him. His religion remains and this is his religion.  There is no good except that he directed his nation to it and there is no evil except that he warned them against it.  The good that he guided them to is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and all that Allaah loves and is pleased with. The evil which he warned against was <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and everything that Allaah hates and rejects.  Allaah sent him as a prophet to the whole of mankind, and Allaah made it obligatory upon all of the jinn and mankind to obey him.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُمْ جَمِيعًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof is His saying, the Most High: «<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Say: O people! I am the Messenger of Allaah to you all</strong></span>.» [7:158]<sup> [<span style="color:#ff0000;">67</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">67</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This, as has already been explained, means that the <em><u>sh</u>aree`ah</em> came down in stages until it was completed &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah &#8211; before the death of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and before Allaah sent down to him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you, perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with Islaam as your Religion</strong></span>.» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A short period after this <em>aayah</em> came down, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> passed away; and his religion remains until the establishment of the Hour.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah completed the religion through him and the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you, perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong></span>.» [5:3]<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">68</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">68</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> did not pass away until after Allaah had completed the religion and the favour through him and had sent down to him His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you, perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong></span>.» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> came down to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> whilst he was performing the standing in <em>`Arafah</em> during the Farewell Hajj on the Day of <em>Jumu`ah</em>. And he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> lived after it for a short time and then moved on to the highest company (of angels).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he left his nation upon <strong><span style="color:#000000;"><em>al-ma<u>h</u>ajjah al-baydaa</em></span></strong> (the clear white path) whose night is the same as its day; no one deviates from it except that he is destroyed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> contains a testimony from Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, that this religion has been completed and that it covers everything of benefit to the servants and that it contains a solution for all of their issues and problems until the Establishment of the Hour. And that is suitable for every time and place; they do not need any other legislation after it or any other book to come down or any other messenger to be sent after the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.<strong>            </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, there is no matter to be found and there is no event that will occur until the Day of Resurrection except that in the Legislation revealed to Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> there is a solution for it and the ruling concerning it. However, the matter relates back to who is competent to extract evidence and to derive proof, rulings and issues. If there are to be found <em>ahlul-`ilm</em> (people of knowledge) and people qualified to make <em>ijtihaad</em> (personal deductions in rulings) who fulfill the conditions of <em>ijtihaad</em>, then indeed, this legislation is complete and contains a solution for all problems. Deficiency only comes about from us from the aspect of deficiency in (our) knowledge and inability to fully understand what Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, has sent down &#8211; or from the aspect of desires, that there occurs a case of following of desires which diverts a person away from the Truth. Otherwise this religion is fully suitable and comprehensive and complete. Allaah has sufficed the <em>Islaamic</em> nation with it until the establishment of the hour if it acts upon it (the religion) correctly and refers back to it in its affairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَإِن تَنَازَعْتُمْ فِي شَيْءٍ فَرُدُّوهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ وَالرَّسُولِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So if you disagree about anything then refer it back to Allaah and the Messenger</strong></span>.» [4:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Referring back to Allaah is to refer back to the Book of Allaah, and referring back to the Messenger after his passing away is to refer back to his <em>Sunnah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا اخْتَلَفْتُمْ فِيهِ مِن شَيْءٍ فَحُكْمُهُ إِلَى اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">« <span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And whatever you disagree about then its judgment is to be referred to Allaah</strong></span>.» [42:10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> (from <em>Soorah al-Maa.idah</em>) contains a refutation of those who make accusations against the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation of its having shortcomings or of its being deficient, (these accusations coming) from the atheists and the evil heretics, or from the “semi students” whose understanding falls short in being able to understand the hidden wisdoms of the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation. Therefore, these (foolish people) ascribe deficiency to the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation and they do not know that the deficiency is with themselves alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it (this <em>aayah</em>) contains a refutation against those who accuse the <em>Islaamic</em> Legislation of deficiency and that it does not cover all needs of the servants and all matters of welfare of the servants until the Establishment of the Hour.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or those who say: &#8220;It was specific to a certain olden times,&#8221; &#8211; because there are many ignorant people who, when it is said to them, &#8220;This is the <em>Islaamic</em> ruling,&#8221; they say, &#8220;That was in the time of the Messenger and the initial time. As for now, conditions have changed and the matters have altered; and the legislated rulings were for people who have now passed away and for problems that have come to an end.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They say this, and this is disbelief in Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and it is a denial of His Saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you</strong></span>.» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah completed the religion for this nation until the Hour is established for every time and place and for every generation of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also contains a refutation of the innovators, those who introduce worship from themselves and ascribe it to the religion, when it has no proof from the Book of Allaah and the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. Rather they just introduce it in accordance with what they deem to be good or based upon blindly following others whom they have good thoughts about from the people of false ideas and people with their own goals and desires. So therefore, they introduce worship into the religion, which Allaah has sent down no proof for. He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» <strong>من أحدث في أمرنا هذا ما ليس منه فهو رد </strong>«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Whoever introduces into this affair of ours that which is not from it, then it is rejected</strong></span>.»</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree no. 2697 and Muslim no. 1718 from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Aa.ishah, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhaa</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasallaam</em> said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» <strong>وإياكم ومحدثات الأمور فإن كل محدثة بدعة وكل بدعة ضلالة </strong>«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>And beware of newly introduced matters, for every newly introduced matter is an innovation, and every innovation is misguidance</strong>.</span>»</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by Aboo Daawood, A<u>h</u>mad, at-Tirmi<u>th</u>ee, and Ibn Maajah from the famous <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Irbaad ibn Saariyyah, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhu</em>. (al-Albaanee declared it <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em>) ].</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever introduces acts of worship which have no proof from the Book of Allaah nor from the <em>Sunnah</em> of the Messenger of Allaah, then he is accusing this religion of not being complete and he wishes to complete the religion himself. He is not actually acknowledging the fact that Allaah has completed it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whatever was not religion in the time of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> will never be religion after him. So this contains a refutation of these groups: The group who say that <em>Islaam</em> is not suitable for every time, or those who innovate newly invented innovations which have no proof from the Book of Allaah nor the <em>Sunnah</em> of His Messenger, and who ascribe them to the religion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>aayah</em> (from <em>Soorah al-Maa.idah</em>) contains a refutation of them because the religion was completed by Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. So there is no scope for addition in it nor for reduction from it. And there is no scope for raising doubts nor seeking to obscure the issue by saying that it is not suitable for the people in these later times.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">الْيَوْمَ أَكْمَلْتُ لَكُمْ دِينَكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>This day, I have completed your religion for you</strong>.</span>» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the Speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High. He is the Most Truthful One of those who speak.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَأَتْمَمْتُ عَلَيْكُمْ نِعْمَتِي وَرَضِيتُ لَكُمُ الْإِسْلَامَ دِينًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And I perfected My blessings upon you, and am pleased with <em>Islaam</em> as your Religion</strong></span>.» [5:3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the last of that which came down to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and it is a testimony from the Lord of the whole of the Creation for this religion that it is complete, comprehensive, and fully suitable for every time and place.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So His saying (in this <em>aayah</em>) is an address to this nation, from the first of it to the last of it, and it is not just an address to the first generation alone. Rather it is an address to the whole of the nation until the Hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for <em>ijmaa`</em> (consensus), then the whole nation are agreed in consensus that he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> passed away. No one disagrees about this except the people of false beliefs, those who say that the Messenger did not die. They negate death from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. This is baseless speech and speech which is clearly rejected. It is refuted by what has been experienced and what is clearly the case, for the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> indeed passed away amongst his Companions. He was bathed, shrouded, had the funeral prayer prayed over him and he was buried. Can these actions be carried out on a person who is still alive?  He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was treated as one who had died. He was washed and shrouded and prayed over and then he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was buried in his grave.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the way of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, with regards to His Creation. And then where are the Messengers who came before him? What occurred to him occurred to the Messengers who came before him. They died. And he is one of them, so he died. This is by consensus of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jamaa`ah</em>. No one disagrees about this except the people of false beliefs, those who seek to attach themselves to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and seek deliverance through him besides Allaah, and say: &#8220;He is still alive.&#8221;</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof that he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>died is His saying, the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ وَإِنَّهُم مَّيِّتُونَ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">ثُمَّ إِنَّكُمْ يَوْمَ الْقِيَامَةِ عِندَ رَبِّكُمْ تَخْتَصِمُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O </strong>(Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>)<strong>! You will certainly die and they will certainly die. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will all dispute before your Lord</strong>.</span>» [39:30-31]<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">69</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">69</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, when Allaah completed the religion through him and perfected His Favour through him, caused him to die, as is the way of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, with His creation:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَائِقَةُ الْمَوْتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Every soul shall taste death</strong>.</span>» [3:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophets and the Messengers enter within this generality:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">كُلُّ نَفْسٍ ذَائِقَةُ الْمَوْتِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Every soul shall taste death</strong></span>.» [3:185]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>passed away and moved on from this world to his Lord, He the Mighty and Majestic. This is established by the text, by consensus, and by analogy.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the textual (proof), then it is His statement, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">إِنَّكَ مَيِّتٌ وَإِنَّهُم مَّيِّتُونَ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>You will certainly die and they will certainly die</strong></span>.» [39:30]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is information from Allaah to His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>that he will soon die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: You are going to die.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is said to a person who is going to die: &#8220;This is a <em>mayyit</em> (person who is going to die).&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the person who has actually already died, then it is said about him: &#8216;<em>mayt</em>,&#8217; with a <em>sukoon</em> (on the letter <em>yaa</em> in the middle of the word), because of His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَوَمَن كَانَ مَيْتًا فَأَحْيَيْنَاهُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Or one who was <em>mayt </em>(dead) and We gave life to him</strong></span>.» [6:122]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the <em>mayt</em> is the one whose soul has left his body. As for <em>al-mayyit</em>, then he is the one who will die in future.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>Hijrah</em></strong><strong> to al-Madeenah</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وبعدها أمر بالهجرة إلى المدينة</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">After that, he was commanded to perform <em>hijrah</em> to al-Madeenah.</span></strong><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">62</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">62</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>): «<strong>After that, he was commanded to perform <em>hijrah</em> to al-Madeenah</strong>»: When the harm from the Quray<u>sh</u> became severe and their evil increased on account of their blocking (people) from Allaah’s path, persecuting the Muslims and torturing those who had no group of people to defend them from the Muslims, who were in a state of weakness – then Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, gave permission for the Muslims to make <em>hijrah</em> to Abyssinia &#8211; the first <em>hijrah</em>, because there was a king with whom no one would be oppressed. He was a Christian, however he was just, so a large group of them migrated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Quray<u>sh</u> came to know of their migration to Abyssinia, they sent two representatives from the wise men of Quray<u>sh</u> to seek (that they be brought back). One of them was `Amr ibn al-`Aas. They had with them gifts for an-Najaa<u>sh</u>ee (the ruler of Abyssinia). They said: &#8220;These people have run away from us and they are relatives of ours. We want them to return to us &#8211; and they are evil doers – so that they do not cause corruption in your land,&#8221; to the end (of what they said). They gave him the gifts that they had with them in order to change his mind, however, he (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) called the <em>muhaajireen</em> and listened to what they had to say and he gave them a choice, so they chose to remain in Abyssinia. Therefore, the two representatives went back frustrated. And the <em>muhaajiroon</em> in Abyssinia remained there.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah favoured an-Najaa<u>sh</u>ee and he accepted <em>Islaam</em> and made his <em>Islaam</em> good. When he died, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and his Companions prayed the funeral prayer for him with the prayer of one whose body is absent. So in migrating to him there was good for him as well; by means of them, Allaah guided him, so he entered into <em>Islaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> met a group from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> (the Muslims from al-Madeenah) in <em>Minaa</em> during the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>; and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi was allam</em> used to present himself to the tribes during the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>. He would go to the different camping places of the Arabs in <em>Minaa</em> and call them to Allaah. And it happened that he met some men from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>, so he called them to Allaah and he explained his call to them. They accepted the call from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and gave him a pledge upon <em>Islaam</em>. They went back to their people from the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> and called them to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. Then in the next pilgrimage, a larger number came than those who were in the first. Some men from the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em> came and gave the pledge to the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi was allam</em>, the second pledge of <em>al-`Aqabah</em>, meaning: at the stoning place of <em>al-`Aqabah</em>. They gave a pledge upon the basis of <em>Islaam</em> and upon the basis of aiding him if he made the migration to them and that they would defend him just as they defended themselves and their (own) children.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then, after this &#8211; meaning, after this blessed pledge &#8211; the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> commanded those Muslims who were in Makkah to perform <em>hijrah</em> (migration) to al-Madeenah; and whoever migrated, migrated to al-Madeenah. And the Messenger and some of his Companions remained. Then Allaah permitted His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> to migrate.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Quray<u>sh</u> became aware of the migration of his Companions to al-Madeenah and they knew of the pledge that had occurred between him and the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>, they feared that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> would join up with his Companions in al-Madeenah and would therefore, attain power and gain strength.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On this night, when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> wanted to depart to make <em>hijrah</em>, they came and surrounded his house. They stood outside the door with their weapons, intending to attack Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. So, Allaah informed His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> (and) the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> commanded `Alee to sleep upon his bed so that the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> could see him and think that he was the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. So `Alee <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhu</em> slept upon the bed of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and covered himself with the blanket of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, the <em>mu<u>sh</u>riks</em> were waiting for him to come out, thinking that he was the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> when in actuality, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> had already come out between them and they were unaware. Allaah blinded their sight from him, and he took some dust and scattered it upon their heads, and departed from amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He went to Aboo Bakr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhu</em> and the two of them departed and went to the Cave of <u>Th</u>awr and hid there for three days. The Quray<u>sh</u> were asking the people to catch him by whatever means; alive or dead. So, when they despaired of finding him after looking and searching, they offered rewards for whoever could bring him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> alive or dead. When they had totally despaired, Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and his Companion left the cave and rode their riding camels and went to al-Madeenah.<em> </em></p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">والهجرة : الانتقال من بلد الشرك إلى بلد الإسلام </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong><em>Hijrah</em> is to move from the land of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> to the land of <em>Islaam</em></strong></span>.<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">63</span>] :<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>al-Hijrah</em> in the (Arabic) language means &#8220;<strong>to abandon something</strong>.&#8221; As for <em>hijrah</em> in the legislation, then it is just as the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> defined it: &#8220;<strong>to depart from the land of <em>kufr</em> and go to the land of <em>Islaam</em></strong>.&#8221; This is <em>hijrah</em> in the legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And <em>hijrah</em> is a tremendous deed; Allaah has joined it along with <em>jihaad</em> in many <em>aayaat</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> made the <em>hijrah</em> to al-Madeenah, the <em>Muhaajiroon</em>, who had been in Abyssinia, then came to al-Madeenah and the Muslims gathered in al-Madeenah &#8211; and all praise is for Allaah. A state was formed for the Muslims in al-Madeenah, comprising the <em>muhaajiroon</em> and the <em>An<u>s</u>aar</em>; and whoever had accepted Islaam would come to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah legislated the remaining duties of the religion, so He made the fasting obligatory upon His Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, and the <em>Zakaat</em> in the second year after the <em>hijrah</em> and He made obligatory upon him the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> in the ninth year after the <em>Hijrah</em> according the correct saying. With that, the pillars of <em>Islaam</em> were completed, the first of them being the two testimonies and the last of them being the <em>Hajj</em> to Allaah’s Sacred House.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So in summary, we know from this that <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is the first requirement in calling to Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, and that the caller begins with it before he begins with the prayer, the fasting, the <em>zakaat</em> or the <em><u>H</u>ajj</em>, because the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> remained for ten years calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and forbidding <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>. He was not commanded with prayer and he was not commanded with <em>zakaat</em> nor pilgrimage nor fasting. Rather these obligatory duties were made obligatory after <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> was established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So when he would send out callers, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> would command them to call the people with the first thing they would call to being <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, just as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of Mu`aadh:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">» إنك تأتي قوما من أهل الكتاب ، فليكن أول ما تدعوهم إليه  شهادة أن لا إله إلا الله وأن محمدا رسول الله ، فإن هم أجابوا لذلك فأعلمهم أن الله افترض عليهم خمس صلوات «<strong> </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>You are going to a people from the People of the Book. So let the first thing that you call them to be the testimony that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah and that Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah. If they accept that from you, then inform them that Allaah has made five prayers obligatory upon them&#8230;» </strong>to the end of the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>.</p>
<p><span style="color:#999999;">[Reported by al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree no. 1395 and Muslim no. 19 from a <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of `Abdullaah ibn `Abbaas, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anhumaa</em>.]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, this proves that a person is not commanded with the prayer nor with the <em>zakaat</em> nor with fasting until <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is established and <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is present – and that whoever begins with other than <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, then his call will fail and his methodology is contrary to the methodology of the Messengers, all of them <em>`alaihumassalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of the Messengers began by calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and to the correction of <em>`aqeedah</em>. It is important for those who proceed to be aware of this methodology, for there are many people today, who confuse this methodology and change this methodology and choose a different methodology for themselves from their own ideas or from other people who are ignorant. There must be a return to the methodology of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. This is the benefit of having awareness of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and his <em>seerah</em> and of making this one of the three fundamental principles. You know how he called the people and what was his <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> methodology in calling them, so you can proceed upon it because he <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em> is the example to be followed.</p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Time Period of the Call in Makkah</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">أخذ على هذا عشر سنين يدعو إلى التوحيد</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He carried this out for ten years calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em></strong></span>. <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">60</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">60</span>] :<strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His statement: «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>He carried this out for ten years calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em></strong></span>» meaning: He called the people to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and warned against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> for ten years in Makkah. He was calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and forbidding <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, because they used to direct worship to the idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the wisdom in Allaah&#8217;s sending him as a prophet in Makkah was that Makkah is <em>Umm al-Quraa</em> (the mother of all the cities), that to which all the cities relate back to. Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا كَانَ رَبُّكَ مُهْلِكَ الْقُرَىٰ حَتَّىٰ يَبْعَثَ فِي أُمِّهَا رَسُولًا</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And your Lord would not destroy the townships until He sent a Messenger in their original one</strong></span>.» [28:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The &#8216;<em>Umm</em>&#8216; is the source to which something relates back to and the foundation which it relates back to; this is the <em>Umm</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">هُنَّ أُمُّ الْكِتَابِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are the foundation of the Book</strong>.</span>» [3:7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: The source to which the <em>aayaat</em> which are <em>muta<u>sh</u>aabihah</em> (unclear) are referred back to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise Makkah has been honored by Allaah, in that it is the original place to which the whole of the people of the Earth resort back, and Muslims in the different regions of the Earth return to Makkah. So it is <em>Umm al-Quraa</em> with the meaning that it is the place of return. Allaah sent His Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> in Makkah because it is <em>Umm al-Quraa</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He remained in it for thirteen years forbidding the people of Makkah from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and commanding them with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, because the people of Makkah are the example for others besides them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, it is binding that Makkah should remain, until the establishment of the Hour, as an abode of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and a beacon for the call to Allaah, and everything which conflicts with that must be kept away from it. So, <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, innovations, and false superstitions must be kept away from it, because the people always look towards it. What is done in it is propagated around the world. So, if what is done in it is good, then good will spread about and if the opposite is the case, then evil will spread.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory that Makkah be kept pure always and for this reason, He, the Majestic and Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَعَهِدْنَا إِلَىٰ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَإِسْمَاعِيلَ أَن طَهِّرَا بَيْتِيَ لِلطَّائِفِينَ وَالْعَاكِفِينَ وَالرُّكَّعِ السُّجُودِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We enjoined Ibraaheem and Ismaa`eel that they should purify My House for those people who make <em>tawwaaf</em>, and those who stay there for worship and those who bow and prostrate</strong>.</span>» [2:125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So it is obligatory that Makkah be purified from everything that conflicts with <em>Islaam</em>, so that the religion can emanate from it and the call to the East and Western parts of the Earth, because Allaah sent His Prophet in it and he began his call <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> from it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> remained in Makkah for thirteen years; from them were ten years in which he called to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and forbade from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> (only) and he was not commanded with anything other than that. He was not commanded with the prayer nor with the <em>zakaat</em> nor with fasting nor with <em><u>H</u>ajj</em> (the Pilgrimage). Rather his call was restricted to warning against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and to commanding <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He would say to them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>Say that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, you will be successful!</strong>&#8220;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And they would say:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَجَعَلَ الْآلِهَةَ إِلَٰهًا وَاحِدًا ۖ إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَشَيْءٌ عُجَابٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Does he make all the objects of worship a single object of worship? Indeed this is something very strange!</strong></span>» [38:5]</p>

<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He lived for sixty-three years: forty before Prophet-hood and twenty-three as a Prophet and Messenger. He was sent as a Prophet through </strong>[the revelation of]<strong> &#8220;<em>Iqra</em>&#8220;</strong></span>  <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">58</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">58</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in Makkah <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>and breastfed amongst the tribe of Banoo Sa`d with <strong><u>H</u>aleemah as-Sa`diyyah</strong>. His father, `<strong>Abdullaah</strong>, died whilst he was still in the womb and his mother died a short time after his birth. So he was taken care of by <strong>Umm Ayman al-<u>H</u>abashiyyah</strong> whom he inherited from his father. He came to be under the guardianship of his grandfather, `<strong>Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib</strong>, then `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib died and his guardianship moved to his paternal uncle, <strong>Aboo <u>T</u>aalib</strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>lived for forty years before prophet-hood being well-known for trustworthiness, truthfulness, generosity, for avoiding the worship of idols and avoiding the drinking of <em><u>kh</u>amar</em> (alcohol). He had not used to do what the people of the day of ignorance did, rather he<em> `alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam </em>used to go out to the cave of <u>H</u>iraa and worship in it for days at a time. He would worship Allaah upon the religious way of Ibraaheem upon <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. Then, when he reached the age of forty  <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>, the revelation came down upon him such that Jibreel came to him whilst he was in the cave of <u>H</u>iraa, and said to him: &#8220;Recite!&#8221; He said: &#8220;I cannot recite,&#8221; &#8211; meaning: I am not able to read. So he pressed him very tightly and then released him and said: &#8220;Recite!&#8221; He said: &#8220;I am not able to recite!&#8221; Then, he pressed him a second time and released him and said: &#8220;Recite!&#8221; He said: &#8220;I cannot recite!&#8221; So, he pressed for third time and  said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">اقْرَأْ بِاسْمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ &#8211; خَلَقَ الْإِنسَانَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Recite! In the Name of your Lord Who created, who created man from a clot of blood</strong>.</span>» [96: 1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was his <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam </em>prophet-hood. Allaah made him a prophet through [the <em>aayah</em>] &#8220;<em>Iqra</em>.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, he went to his house shaking from fear, because he had encountered something which he had not known before, an extremely frightening matter. So, he found his wife <u>Kh</u>adijah <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu`anha</em>, and she covered him up and calmed him down. She said to him: &#8220;<strong>Know! By Allaah! Allaah will not humiliate you for indeed you maintain the ties of kinship, you show hospitality to the guest, you look after the orphans, and you help people who have been struck by calamities</strong>.&#8221; So, she prepared him and took him to her paternal uncle, Waraqah ibn Nawfal. He was a man who devoted himself to worship and who read the previous scriptures and who worshipped Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. When he informed him of what he had seen, he said: &#8220;This was the spirit who used to descend to Moosaa,&#8221; meaning: Jibreel <em>`alaihisalaam</em>.<strong> </strong></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Coming Down of the Revelation to him (<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>)</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>He was sent as a Messenger with <em>al-Mudda<u>th</u>ir</em>. His land was Makkah and he made migration to al-Madeenah. Allaah sent him to warn against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and to call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. The proof is His saying:</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ &#8211; قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ &#8211; وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ &#8211; وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ &#8211; وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ  &#8211; وَلَا تَمْنُن تَسْتَكْثِرُ &#8211; وَلِرَبِّكَ فَاصْبِرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">«<strong>O you wrapped </strong>(in garments)<strong>! Arise and warn! And exalt your Lord! And purify your garments! And shun the idols! And do not give anything in order to receive more in return! And patiently persevere for the sake of your Lord!</strong>»</span> [74:1-7] <sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">59</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">59</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There came down to him, His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ &#8211; قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you wrapped </strong>(in garments)<strong>! Arise and warn!</strong></span>» [74:1-2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was him being sent as a Messenger and this is the meaning of the saying of the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>He was sent as a Prophet through [the revelation of] <em>Iqra</em>. and he was sent as a Messenger with <em>al-Mudda<u>th</u>ir</em></strong>.»</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The difference between a prophet and a Messenger is that a prophet (<em>nabiyy</em>) is one to whom Allaah has revealed way, but he was not commanded to convey it, whereas a <em>rasool</em> (Messenger) is one to whom a revealed way was sent and he was commanded to convey it. The clarification of that is that the Messenger is one to whom a revealed law comes down and a book, so he (<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>) was sent as a prophet through <em>Iqra.</em> and he was sent as a messenger through <em>al-Mudda<u>th</u>ir</em> at the age of forty. This was the case with the prophets. A prophet is sent with a revealed law and book from before him and he is entrusted with certain duties like the prophets of Banoo Israa`eel who came after Moosaa.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>al-Mudda<u>th</u>ir</em></strong></span>» means the one who is wrapped up, because he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>was struck by alarm, so he said: &#8220;Cover me up with garments! Cover me up with garments!&#8221; Meaning: Cover me up. Therefore, Allaah sent down to him:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">يَا أَيُّهَا الْمُدَّثِّرُ &#8211; قُمْ فَأَنذِرْ &#8211; وَرَبَّكَ فَكَبِّرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>O you wrapped (in garments)! Arise and warn! And exalt your Lord!</strong></span>» [74:1-3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> </strong>Meaning: Exalt and venerate Him.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَثِيَابَكَ فَطَهِّرْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And purify your garments!</strong></span>» [74:4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: Purify your deeds from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, because a person&#8217;s actions are garments. Allaah, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلِبَاسُ التَّقْوَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ خَيْرٌ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And the clothing of dutifulness to Allaah, that is better</strong></span>.» [7:26]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Dutifulness is called clothing.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالرُّجْزَ فَاهْجُرْ </span></h3>
<p><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>«And keep away from <em>Ar-Rujz</em> (the idols)! »</strong></span>[74:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong><em>ar-Rujz</em></strong></span>» <em>ar-Rujz</em> (filth) means the idols.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shun </strong>[the idols]</span>» meaning: abandon and keep well away from them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah raised him as a Prophet at the age of forty and he remained in Makkah for thirteen years, calling the people to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and to the abandonment of the worship of idols. There were many discussions which he had with the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>. He suffered harm upon himself and upon those who believed in him and his followers. The people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> caused many difficulties throughout the thirteen years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Three years before the migration, he was taken on the Night Journey to Jerusalem. He was taken up through the heavens and the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him. So, he prayed in Makkah for three years. Then, the Quray<u>sh</u> plotted to kill and attack him, so Allaah permitted him to migrate to al-Madeenah. So, he migrated to al-Madeenah after he had met with the An<u>s</u>aar in the first and second pledge of al-`Aqabah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He migrated to al-Madeenah and remained there for ten years. So, altogether, it was twenty-three years [of prophet-hood]. After the prophet-hood, he <em><u>s</u></em><em>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam </em>lived twenty-three years, thirteen years in Makkah laying the foundations of the call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, and for ten years in al-Madeenah. Then, Allaah took his soul at the age of sixty-three years. So, his life-span in Messenger-ship was twenty-three years.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This blessing which Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, sent down upon him, this abundant knowledge, this <em>jihaad</em>, and this establishment which He granted him upon the earth was all in this short time of twenty-three years. This is one of the signs of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and from the blessings given to the prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, the blessings of his call and the blessings of the revelation which was sent down to him. And before all of this, it came about through the aid of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. He is the One who helped him. He is the One who defended him and aided him until he conveyed His call to the East and the West. All praise is for Allaah, the Lord of the whole of creation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: «<span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Allaah sent him to warn against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and to call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em></strong></span>» This is his call <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>, warning against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. And this is what is obligatory for the <em>du`aat</em> (callers) to precede upon in their call, that they should focus upon warning against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> before everything, otherwise their call will not be upon the <em>manhaj</em> (methodology) of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> with warning against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, so it is essential to lay this foundation down first of all. After that, the person can direct his attention to the rest of the matters, since matters will not be correct and sound except with the presence of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. If all of the people were to abandon <em>zinaa</em> (fornication), intoxicants, stealing, and they took on every virtuous quality from deeds and behavior, but did not abandon <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, there would be no benefit in these matters and it will not benefit them. Whereas, if the people were to remain free of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, but had major sins less than <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>, then there is hope for such a person that Allaah will either forgive him or punish him in accordance with the level of his sins. But his final destination will be to Paradise because he is a person of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>.<em> </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So <em>Taw<u>h</u>eed</em> is the fundamental basis and foundation. There is no salvation except with the presence of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> firstly. Therefore, it is obligatory to concentrate and always give attention to it and to call the people to it and to teach it to the people and to explain it to them, what is the meaning of <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and what is the meaning of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>. The Muslim must be aware of this matter and attain certainty concerning it. He should check himself so that he does not fall into anything from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> or infringe <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. This matter is essential and the <em>da`wah</em> must proceed upon this basis.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">The meaning of «<strong>Arise and warn</strong>!» is to warn against <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and call to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. «<strong>And exalt your Lord</strong>!» meaning: venerate Him with <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>. «<strong>And purify your garments</strong>!» meaning: purify your deeds from <em><u>sh</u>irk</em>. «<strong>And shun <em>ar-rujz</em></strong>» <em>ar-rujz</em> means the idols and «<strong>shunning</strong>» meaning: abandoning them and disassociating from them and their people.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The Third Fundamental Principle:<br />
Knowledge About Our Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad &#8211;<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam<br />
</em><strong>His Name, His Lineage, and His Early Life </strong></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">الأصل الثالث : معرفة نبيكم محمد صلى الله عليه وسلم </span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">The third fundamental principle: Knowledge about your Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em></span></strong>.<sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">56</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">56</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying: «<strong>The third fundamental principle</strong>» meaning: from the three fundamental principles, because the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) has mentioned at the start of the treatise that it is obligatory upon every Muslim male and female to have knowledge of these three fundamental principles, and they are: knowledge of Allaah, knowledge of the religion of <em>Islaam</em>, and knowledge about His Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> with the evidences.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the first and second fundamental principles, then a clarification of them has preceded and an explanation of their evidences.<strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The third fundamental principle</strong>: It is knowledge about the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>, because of the fact that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> is an intermediary between Allaah and His creation with regard to conveying His Religion and His Message. Therefore, it is obligatory to know about him, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>.  Otherwise, how could you follow a person whom you do not know of?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, you must know about him with regard to his name, the land he was born and grew up in, the land to which he migrated and that you know the extent of his lifespan <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>. And the phases of his life, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em> and the phases of the time period which he was sent in this world. That you also know what occurred before Prophet-hood and after it and before the migration, and after it. That you know how the revelation first came to him, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em> and when the revelation began, and what is the <em>aayah</em> which proves his Prophet-hood and the <em>aayah</em> which proves His Messenger-ship. That you can quote the <em>aayahs </em>which prove His Prophet-hood and the <em>aayahs </em>which prove His Messenger-ship. You must know this; that you know his lineage and which tribe he was from, because the Arabs are made of tribes and he was an Arab without any doubt. So, knowledge of these matters is essential about the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> through studying the <em>aayahs</em> and the <em>a<u>h</u>aadee<u>th</u></em> which are connected to these matters.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And you look into the life of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alayhi wa sallam</em> and his call, in order that you should know these matters about your Prophet whom you are commanded to follow and take as an example.</p>

<h3><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>His Name, His Lineage</strong></span></h3>

<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">57</span>] <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is his name and lineage. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>His name is Mu<u>h</u>ammad</strong> </span><em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>. He has other names besides Mu<u>h</u>ammad. However, the most famous one of his names is Mu<u>h</u>ammad and Allaah mentioned that in the Qur.aan in a number of <em>aayahs</em>.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مُّحَمَّدٌ رَّسُولُ اللَّهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Mu<u>h</u>ammad is the Messenger of Allaah</strong></span>» [48:29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَمَا مُحَمَّدٌ إِلَّا رَسُولٌ قَدْ خَلَتْ مِن قَبْلِهِ الرُّسُلُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And Mu<u>h</u>ammad is not except a Messenger, Messengers have passed away before him</strong></span>.» [3:144]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">مَّا كَانَ مُحَمَّدٌ أَبَا أَحَدٍ مِّن رِّجَالِكُمْ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Mu<u>h</u>ammad is not the father of any of your men</strong></span>.» [33:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those who have <em>eemaan </em></strong>(truly believe)<strong> and perform righteous deeds, and believe in that which was sent down upon Mu<u>h</u>ammad </strong>(<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>)<strong>, for it is the truth from their Lord</strong></span>.» [40:2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, Allaah mentioned his name Mu<u>h</u>ammad in a number of <em>aayaahs</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">From his names is A<u>h</u>mad</span></strong>. Allaah mentioned in His saying regarding the glad tidings given by al-Masee<u>h</u> <em>`alaihissalaam</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَإِذْ قَالَ عِيسَى ابْنُ مَرْيَمَ يَا بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ إِنِّي رَسُولُ اللَّهِ إِلَيْكُم مُّصَدِّقًا لِّمَا بَيْنَ يَدَيَّ مِنَ التَّوْرَاةِ وَمُبَشِّرًا بِرَسُولٍ يَأْتِي مِن بَعْدِي اسْمُهُ أَحْمَدُ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And remember when `Eesaa ibn Maryam, said: &#8220;O Children of Israa.eel! I am Allaah&#8217;s Messenger to you confirming what came before me from the <em>Tauraat</em>, and giving glad tidings of a Messenger who will come after me, whose name will be A<u>h</u>mad</strong></span>.» [61:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he is Mu<u>h</u>ammad and A<u>h</u>mad. The meaning of that is one abundant in praise, `<em>alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wa salaam</em>, and abundant in attributes for which he is to be praised.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>From his names are: the Prophet of Mercy (نبي الرحمة), the Prophet of Great War (نبي الملحمة)</strong></span> &#8211; meaning <em>jihaad</em> in Allaah&#8217;s Cause &#8211; <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the one after whom the people will be resurrected (الحاشر)</strong></span>, and <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>the final Prophet (والعاقب)</strong></span>, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>. The one who is such that the people will be resurrected after his being sent as a Prophet, because he is the last of the Messengers, <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. So, there is nothing after him except for the establishment of the Hour. After his Messenger-ship, the Hour will be established and the people will be resurrected for recompensing and accounting.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whoever wants to get knowledge of these matters (Names and Meanings) , let him refer back to the Book <em>Jalaa.ul-Afhaam fee a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>alaati was-Salaam `alaa <u>Kh</u>ayril-Anaam</em> of the <em>Imaam</em> Ibnul-Qayyim (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for his lineage:</strong></span> He is Mu<u>h</u>ammad, the son of `Abdullaah, the son of `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, the son of Haa<u>sh</u>im, the son of `Abdul-Manaaf, the son of Qusay, the son of Kilaab.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was from the tribe of Quray<u>sh</u> which is the noblest of the tribes, and Quray<u>sh</u> are from the descendants of Ismaa`eel <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabs are of two categories upon the most famous saying:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The original Arabs: They were the descendants of <strong>Qah<u>t</u>aan</strong>.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">The assimilated Arabs: They were the descendants of `<strong>Adnaan</strong> from the descendants of Ismaa`eel `<em>alaihissalaam</em>, the son of Ibraaheem, <em>al-<u>Kh</u>aleel</em>,<em> `alaihissalaam</em>. They were called <em>al-Musta`rabah</em> (the assimilated Arabs) because they learned the Arabic language from the original Arabs.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the tribe of <em>Jurhum</em> came and settled in Makkah beside Haajir, the mother of Ismaa`eel and her son Ismaa`eel whilst he was young &#8211; when they found the well of <em>Zamzam</em>, they settled there and made an agreement with Haajir that they should settle beside her and that she should permit them to take water from the well. Ismaa`eel <em>`alaihissalaam </em>was a suckling infant at that time, then he grew older and took the Arabic language from the tribe of Jurhum, and they were from the original Arabs. He married from the tribe of Jurhum and descendants came from him who learnt the Arabic language. They grew up with the Arabs and became Arabs themselves by assimilation. They are the descendants of `Adnaan. As for the original Arabs, then they are the descendants of Qah<u>t</u>aan whose origin was from Yemen.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of the scholars said: The original Arabs themselves were of two categories: Arabs who became extinct and Arabs who remained.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Arabs who became extinct were the ones who were destroyed. They were the people of Noo<u>h</u>, `Aad, and <u>Th</u>amood, and <u>Sh</u>u`ayb.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the remaining Arabs, then they are those who are divided into the original Arabs and the assimilated Arabs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was from the descendants of Haa<u>sh</u>im (the tribe of Haa<u>sh</u>im), and Haa<u>sh</u>im was from the descendants of Ismaa`eel, <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wa salaam</em>. His name was Mu<u>h</u>ammad, the son of `Abdullaah, the son of `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And [regarding] `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, this was not his name, his name was <u>Sh</u>aybah. However, he was called `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib because his paternal uncle, al-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, the son of Manaaf, brought him from al-Madeenah whilst he was little from his maternal uncles, Banoo an-Najaar. So, when the people saw him being dark from travelling, they thought he was a slave owned by al-Mu<u>tt</u>alib. So, they said: `Abdul-Mu<u>tt</u>alib (the slave of Mu<u>tt</u>alib), the son of Haa<u>sh</u>im, the son of `Abdul-Manaaf. `Abdul-Manaaf had four sons: Haa<u>sh</u>im who was the grandfather of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>, al-Mu<u>tt</u>alib, `Abd-<u>Sh</u>ams, and Nawfal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Banoo Haa<u>sh</u>im are called the <em>Haa<u>sh</u>imiyyoon</em> and Banoo Mu<u>tt</u>alib are called the <em>Mu<u>tt</u>allibiyyoon</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for  `Abd-<u> Sh</u>ams, then from them was `U<u>th</u>maan &#8211;<em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu `anh</em> and Banoo `Umay-yah. They were all from `Abd-<u> Sh</u>ams.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Nawfal, he had descendents, from them: Jubayr bin Mut`im and <u>H</u>akeem ibn <u>H</u>izaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibraaheem <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam </em>had Ismaa`eel and he was the eldest. He is the grandfather of the Arab descendants of `Adnaan. And Is<u>h</u>aaq is the grandfather of the children of Israa.eel, and all of the Prophets were from the descendants of Is<u>h</u>aaq, except for our Prophet <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wasalaam</em>, he was from the descendants of Ismaa`eel, he was the final prophet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>As for his birth:</strong> </span>He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> was born in the year of the elephant. It is the year when Abrahah, the King of Yemen came towards Makkah. He was sent on a mission by the (christian) King of the Abyssinians to demolish the <em>Ka`bah</em>. With him, there was a very large elephant, so when he reached the place which is called <em>al-Mu<u>gh</u>amas</em>, nothing remained except for him to enter Makkah and demolish the <em>Ka`bah</em>. The people of Makkah had already separated and climbed into the mountains because they had no strength to oppose him. So, he wanted to go on to the <em>Ka`bah</em>, but the elephant was held back and it refused to get up from the ground. Allaah held it back. When he turned it in the direction other than the direction of Makkah, it would get up and trod. And when he pointed it in the direction of Makkah, it was prevented and unable to walk, and whilst they were in that condition, they saw two flocks of birds coming from the direction of the ocean and they had with them stones. Each bird had two stones with it, a stone in its beak and a stone between its feet. They threw these little stones down and they would strike the head of the man and it would come out from his anus and split him in two halves. So, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, destroyed him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent down, with regard to that, reminding the Quray<u>sh</u>, <em>Sooratul-Feel</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">أَلَمْ تَرَ كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ بِأَصْحَابِ الْفِيلِ &#8211; أَلَمْ يَجْعَلْ كَيْدَهُمْ فِي تَضْلِيلٍ &#8211; وَأَرْسَلَ عَلَيْهِمْ طَيْرًا أَبَابِيلَ &#8211; تَرْمِيهِم بِحِجَارَةٍ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Do you not see how your Lord dealt with the Companions of the Elephant? Did He not make their plan go astray? And He sent against them birds, in flocks, striking them with stones of clay</strong></span>.» [105:1-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[The stones were] from Hell, and Allaah&#8217;s refuge is sought.</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولٍ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So He made them like straws of corn devoured</strong>.</span>» [105:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They became like dry straw which have been eaten by animals and excreted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was the story of the elephant, so Allaah defended His Sacred House and destroyed this tyrant Abrahah, and in this year, Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was born. There appeared along with his birth signs; light appeared along with him which caused the castles of <u>Sh</u>aam to shine. In the night of his birth, the idols shook. The throne room of <em>Kisraa</em> (the emperor of Persians) shook and some balconies from it fell down in the night the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was born. These were signs of the descending of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> as a Prophet. The devils were thrown into commotion in that tremendous night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was born in the mountain-pass of `Alee, he was born in Makkah (close to the Ka&#8217;bah) . However, the precise location of the house is not confirmed.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 55: Point 97</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And acknowledge the excellence of the Banu Haashim due to their kinship to Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and acknowledge the excellence of the Quraysh and of the Arabs and of the branches of the tribes. Acknowledge their station and their rights in Islaam. And the freed slave who belonged to a people is one of them. And acknowledge the rights of the rest of the people in Islaam.</strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#333333;"><strong>Shaykh Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong>“<span style="color:#993300;">acknowledge the excellence of the Banu Haashim (clan of Haashim)</span></strong>,<strong>” </strong>the Banu Haashim; clan of Haashim ibn `Abd Manaaf (the son of `Abd Manaaf) because `Abd Manaaf had a number of sons and they were:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(1)Haashim who is the grandfather of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and (2)`Abdu-Shams who is the grandfather of `Uthmaan ibn Affaan <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and (3) Nawfal ibn `Abd Manaaf who is the grandfather of <u>H</u>akeem ibn <u>H</u>izaam <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and (4) al-Mu<u>tt</u>alib ibn `Abd Manaaf who is the grandfather of Banu Mu<u>tt</u>alib.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They are all the sons of `Abd Manaaf. And the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was raised amongst the Banu Haashim (clan of Haashim), the son of `Abd Manaaf; so he was a Haashimee Qurayshee (larger tribe of Quraysh from the clan of Haashim; children of Haashim). And he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Allaah chose Kinaanah from the descendants of Ismaa’eel and he chose from Kinaanah, the Quraysh and he chose from the Quraysh, Banu Haashim and he chose me from the Banu Haashim.”</strong></span><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So they are the <em>qaraabah</em> (kinfolk) of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>; the believers from Banu Haashim. They are the <em>qaraabah</em> (kinfolk) who have the right upon the Muslims. It is forbidden for them to accept charity (<em><u>s</u>adaqah)</em> but it is permissible for them to accept a gift (<em>hadiyyah)</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for other than the believers then they have no worth even if they are from Banu Haashim. Rather, it is only when <em>qaraabah</em> (close kinship) comes along with <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) then in that case, there is no doubt that they have distinction over other people and they have the right that they be shown honour and respect and they have the right to be respected and given precedence since this is a part of the respect of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. However, if they are not believers (<em>mu&#8217;mineen)</em> then all that is the case is that they are from Banu Haashim and they are disbelievers so there is no honour for them. And the same goes to everyone who ascribes themselves to the Banu Haashim who is not upon the way of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah W`al Jamaa`ah</em> and not upright then he has no worth. So, it is not just being merely closely related on its own that brings about the right. Rather, it is kinship along with having <em>eemaan</em> (true faith). He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>قُل لَّا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, I do not ask you for any reward for conveying the truth to you but I enjoin you to show love towards me by respecting my close relatives (qurbaa).</span> </strong>(Sooratush-Shoorah (42), <em>aayah</em> 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the close relatives of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in one saying. And Allaah appointed for them a share of the <em>khumus</em> (fifth part of booty). He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَاعْلَمُوا أَنَّمَا غَنِمْتُم مِّن شَيْءٍ فَأَنَّ لِلَّهِ خُمُسَهُ وَلِلرَّسُولِ وَلِذِي الْقُرْبَىٰ </strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you should know that whatever you take as booty then one fifth of it is assigned for Allaah, the Messenger and the close relatives of the Messenger.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Anfaal (8), <em>aayah </em>41)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><u>Th</u></em><em>il-Qurbaa</em>-The close relatives of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“<strong>and acknowledge the excellence of the Quraysh and of the Arabs,” </strong></span>after the Banu Haashim (clan of Haashim) is the virtue of the Muslims from the Quraysh. They have excellence over the rest of the Arabs; then the Arabs have excellence over the `<em>ajam (</em>non-Arabs). Why? Because Allaah sent down the Qur&#8217;aan in their language and He sent the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> from them and He chose them to convey His message and therefore, He, the Majestic and Most High, said in the Qur&#8217;aan:</p>
<p><strong>فَاسْتَمْسِكْ بِالَّذِي أُوحِيَ إِلَيْكَ ۖ إِنَّكَ عَلَىٰ صِرَاطٍ مُّسْتَقِيمٍ</strong><br />
<strong>وَإِنَّهُ لَذِكْرٌ لَّكَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(<em>In an address to the Prophet <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>So hold fast to this Qur&#8217;aan that has been sent down to you. Indeed you are upon a straight and true path and it will be an honour for you. </strong></span>(Sooratuz-Zukhruf (43), <em>aayah </em>43-44)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning, the Qur·aan will be an honour for you and for your people; meaning the Arabs and you shall soon be questioned concerning it. You people will soon be questioned about the implementation of this Qur·aan and about the call to it and about having conveyed it, because Allaah gave them the duty of bearing it and conveying it to the rest of the world. So this is the aspect for which the Arabs have superiority. They were not given excellence just because they were Arabs alone; rather, they were given superiority on account of what they are specified with by Allaah with regard to the Qur·aan and the Sunnah and the sending of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and because they carry out the duty of conveying this religion. He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>كُنتُمْ خَيْرَ أُمَّةٍ أُخْرِجَتْ لِلنَّاسِ تَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَتَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ وَتُؤْمِنُونَ بِاللَّهِ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">You are the best nation that has been brought out for mankind, you command the good and you forbid the evil and you truly believe in Allaah.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>110)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He said:</p>
<p><strong>وَلْتَكُن مِّنكُمْ أُمَّةٌ يَدْعُونَ إِلَى الْخَيْرِ وَيَأْمُرُونَ بِالْمَعْرُوفِ وَيَنْهَوْنَ عَنِ الْمُنكَرِ ۚ وَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْمُفْلِحُونَ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And let there be from amongst you a group who call the people to the good and they command the good and they forbid the evil and they are the ones who will be successful.</span> </strong>(Soorah Aali `Imraan (3), <em>aayah </em>104)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the aspect in which the Arabs have specific excellence. When they adhere to this religion and they convey it, then they have virtue over others. As for those who do not adhere to this religion then he has no excellence because Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ إِنَّا خَلَقْنَاكُم مِّن ذَكَرٍ وَأُنثَىٰ وَجَعَلْنَاكُمْ شُعُوبًا وَقَبَائِلَ لِتَعَارَفُوا ۚ إِنَّ أَكْرَمَكُمْ عِندَ اللَّهِ أَتْقَاكُمْ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">O mankind! We have created you all from a single male and female and we made from you nations and tribes so that you should become acquainted with each other. Indeed the most honourable of you with Allaah are those who have the most <em>taqwaa</em> (the most dutiful to Allaah).</span> </strong>(Sooratul-<u>H</u>ujuraat (49), <em>aayah </em>13)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“There is no excellence for an Arab over a non-Arab nor for a white person over a black person except on account of taqwaa (dutifulness to Allaah). All of you are from Aadam and Aadam was from earth.” </strong></span><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is the angle from which the Arabs have superiority. If they establish the duty that Allaah has given to them to propagate this religion and to call to it and to explain it to mankind then they will be more excellent than others.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and likewise all the branches of the tribes,” </strong></span><em>Al-Afkhaa<u>th</u></em> means a subsection of the tribes. So first there is the tribe meaning the large unit of the tribe then there are the <em>Afkhaa<u>th</u></em>; branches of the tribe so it is a part of the tribe.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“So</strong> </span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">acknowledge their station and their rights in Islaam.”</span> </strong>Each one in accordance with his own virtue and right.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;">“</span><strong><span style="color:#993300;">And the freed slave who belonged to a people is from them&#8221;</span>. </strong>This is a <em><u>h</u>adeeth</em> from the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> Meaning <em>al-`ateeq</em>; meaning a slave who has been set free. So a person who has been set free by the Haashimiyyeen (clan of Haashim), he will have the ruling of being from the clan of Haashim; or somebody who was a slave who had been set free by anybody else, he will have the same ruling as them.</p>
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Muslim (2,276) from a <u>h</u>adeeth of Waathilah ibn al-Asqa` <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> Translator’s side point: With regard to this narration, they don’t mention any reference here in the footnotes but Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentioned this narration occurs in the explanation of At-<u>T</u>a<u>h</u>aawiyyah and Shaykh al-Albaaniyy mentioned in his notes, note no. 461 that this narration is <em><u>s</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u></em> and that it occurs in the <em>Musnad</em> of Imaam A<u>h</u>mad especially the first part of the narration and the latter part you can find it also in the <em>Mu`jam al-Awsa<u>t</u></em> of A<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>abaraaniyy and in the <em>Musnad</em> of Al-Bazdaar.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy <u>(</u>6761) from Anas ibn Maalik <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> from the Prophet<em> <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> that he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“The slave set free by a people is from them themselves.”</strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> As for the explanation of <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong></span> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> then he said starting off with the point with regard to Banu Haashim he said, “I say Banu Haashim (the clan of Haashim), they have virtue on account of their being close relatives of Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, said to His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>:</p>
<p><strong>قُل لَّا أَسْأَلُكُمْ عَلَيْهِ أَجْرًا إِلَّا الْمَوَدَّةَ فِي الْقُرْبَىٰ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, I do not ask you for any reward for conveying the truth to you but I enjoin you to show love towards me by respecting the rights of my kinsfolk</span>. </strong>(Sooratush-Shoorah (42), <em>aayah</em> 23)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So his saying, <span style="color:#808000;">“<strong>I enjoin you to show love towards me by respecting the rights of my close relatives.” </strong></span>Meaning that that is not counted as taking reward but rather that the Messenger of Allaah <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> sought from the nation that they should recognise the rights of his kinsfolk and respect them from their respect for him and that they should show honour to them as a part of their showing honour to him for indeed a Muslim has rights upon the Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So then a Muslim who is from the Banu Haashim who clings to his religion will have the right of Islaam and he will have the right that is due to a close relative of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and likewise the rest of the branches of the Quraysh except that Allaah has not put the duty upon us to love those who are not upon the correct `<em>aqeedah</em> and who are not upright upon Islaam. And indeed the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> freed himself from those who are contrary to his way. So he <em><u>s</u>alawaatullaahi wa salaamuhu `alayh</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“Indeed the people of the father; meaning so and so, they are not my awliyaa </strong>(friends and allies)<strong>. Rather my guardian Lord is Allaah and my allies are the righteous believers.”</strong><strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Reported by Muslim and Al-Bukhaariyy.]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the rest of the branches,” </strong></span>meaning, the rest of the branches of the Quraysh and the tribes of the Arabs. Their rights in Islaam should be recognised and Allaah grants success.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 44: Point 68</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was taken by night up through the heavens and he came to the Throne and he spoke to Allaah, the Exalted and Most High. And he entered Paradise and he saw the Fire and he saw the angels and he heard the speech of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic and the Prophets were brought out for him. And he saw the drapery of the Throne and the Footstool and everything within the heavens and everything within the earths whilst awake. Jibreel took him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> until he took him through the heavens and the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him that night. And he returned to Makkah that same night and that was before the <em>Hijrah</em> (migration). </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#808080;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying,<strong><span style="color:#993300;"> “And to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) that Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was taken by night up through the heavens,”</span> </strong>this is from the <em>mu`jizaat</em> (miracles) of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. So a part of having <em>eemaan</em> in the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is to have <em>eemaan</em> in his miracles, which prove the truthfulness of his messengership <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and the greatest of his miracles are the Qur&#8217;aan and the Sunnah. This is the greatest of the miracles of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and is the miracle which will remain until the Hour is established.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise from his miracles <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is <em>al-Israa· w’al Mi`raaj</em> (the night journey and the ascent through the heavens). The word <em>al-Israa</em>· (the night journey) is to make a journey by night and the word <em>al-Mi`raaj</em> is to <em>asu`ood</em> (ascend). And he was taken on a journey by night from the sacred mosque in Makkah to the farthest mosque <em>al-Masjid ul-Aq<u>s</u>a</em> in Palestine in a single night in the company of Jibreel <em>`alayhissalaam</em> and he was taken up through the heavens from Jerusalem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And how he was taken in a single night from Makkah to Jerusalem and then taken up through the heavens and then descended from the heavens and then returned to Makkah in a single night, how did this occur? This was through the ability of Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, which is such that nothing can render it incapable. It was not by his own ability <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>, rather it came about through the ability of Allaah, which is such that nothing can render it incapable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Al-Buraaq</em> was brought to him and it is an animal, which moves very fast. Its step from one step to the next is as far as it can see. So, the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> rode it and Jibreel accompanied him to <em>Bayt ul-Maqdis;</em> to Jerusalem. This is the <em>Israa</em>· (night journey) from Makkah to Jerusalem.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for <em>al-Mi`raaj</em> (the ascent) then he was taken up from Jerusalem to the heavens and he passed beyond the seven levels and reached <em>Sidrat ul-Muntahaa</em> (farthest lote tree) and he heard the speech of Allaah, the Perfect and Most High, and He commanded him with the <em><u>S</u>alah</em> (prayer). And on this night he saw Paradise and the Fire and on this night he saw the Messengers and the Prophets in the heavens and Allaah gathered them together for him and he led them in prayer to make manifest his virtue over them. And Allaah made obligatory upon him the five daily prayers whilst he was in the heaven. Then he <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> descended to Jerusalem then he went from Jerusalem to Makkah in a single night and he entered the morning in Makkah <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the <em>Israa·</em> and the <em>Mi`raaj</em> (night journey and the ascent) <strong>occurred with his body and his soul</strong>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1] </a>And it was not just with his soul alone as is said by some of those deniers or some of those who find this matter to be something strange and who say that he was taken on the night journey with his soul but not his body. And the <em>Israa·</em> (night journey) <strong>was not a dream</strong>, rather it occurred whilst he was awake and it is a miracle from he <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> miracles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>.. سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى الَّذِي بَارَكْنَا حَوْلَهُ</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Glorified and Perfect is He Who took His servant by night from the sacred mosque to the farthest mosque, the area around which We have blessed …</strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For what purpose?</p>
<p><strong> لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا ۚ إِنَّهُ هُوَ السَّمِيعُ الْبَصِيرُ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… to show him Our signs. Indeed Allaah is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing.</strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And he saw on this night amazing things. Just as He, the Most High, said:</p>
<p><strong>لَقَدْ رَأَىٰ مِنْ آيَاتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَىٰ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">He </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(the Prophet </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">certainly saw some of the greatest signs of his Lord.</span> </strong>(Sooratul-Najm (53), <em>aayah</em> 18)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said:</p>
<p><strong> لِنُرِيَهُ مِنْ آيَاتِنَا ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… to show him from Our signs. </strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah</em> 1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he (<em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>) saw from the signs of Allaah on this blessed journey that which he saw. So, it is obligatory upon the Muslim to have <em>eemaan</em> (true faith) in that and to believe in it and that he should not have the slightest doubt about it. And whoever denies it he is a disbeliever (<em>kaafir)</em> since he is denying the truth of what has been said about Allaah and denying the truth about what has been said about the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and denying the consensus (<em>Ijmaa</em>`) of the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he entered Paradise and he saw the Fire,” </strong></span>he entered Paradise (<em>Jannah)</em> and he saw the bliss that was within it and he saw the Fire and he saw the torment that there is within it because Allaah wished to show him from His signs.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and he saw the angels,” </strong></span>he saw Jibreel in his angelic form having 360 wings, each wing filling the whole horizon. So an angel, his creation is tremendous, his size is tremendous and Jibreel is the greatest one of the angels and the noblest one of the angels, <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. So he saw the angels and he saw the Messengers (<em>Rusul)</em> and they are deceased. Allaah gathered them for him and Allaah has full ability over everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he saw the drapery of the Throne (<em>Arsh)</em> and the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool),” </strong></span>and he saw what was around the `<em>Arsh </em>(Throne) and what was around the <em>Kursee</em> (Footstool) and they are two tremendous created things; the greatest, most tremendous of the created things and what was around them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <strong><span style="color:#993300;">“and everything within the heavens whilst he was awake.”</span> </strong>This is a refutation of those who say that it was a dream. And if it had been a dream, the disbelievers would not have denied it because dreams are not denied. Rather, they denied it happened whilst he was awake.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<p><strong>..  أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ ..</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>… He took His servant on a journey … </strong></span>(Sooratul-Israa· (17), <em>aayah </em>1)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this word <em>al-`abd</em> (the servant) is a term for the soul and body together. So, the soul alone is not called <em>`abd</em> (servant). The body alone without a soul is not called <em>`abd</em> (servant). So it is not called servant unless it is a body and a soul together.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Jibreel carried him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em>,” </strong></span><em>al-Buraaq</em> was an animal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“and the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him that night.” </strong></span>This is a proof of the tremendousness of these five daily prayers that they were made obligatory upon the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> in heaven between him and Allaah without any intermediary as opposed to the rest of the revealed laws for they came down to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> whilst he was upon the earth by means of Jibreel <em>`alayhissalaam</em>. So, this shows the tremendous importance of these five daily prayers with Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. And the time of the night journey was before the <em>Hijrah</em> (migration) to al-Madeenah and he prayed the five daily prayers in Makkah <em>`alayhi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“And he returned to Makkah on that night and that was before the <em>Hijrah</em> (migration).” </strong></span>And he returned to Makkah on that same night and therefore the disbelievers found it something very unlikely and they became overjoyed at this event so that they could belittle the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and ridicule him and mock him. So, Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, rebutted their plot and attested to the truthfulness of His Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and sent down some Qur&#8217;aan with regard to that.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p><span style="color:#000080;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> <strong>Translator’s side point:</strong>  The night journey and the ascent (<em>Israa</em>· and <em>Mi`raaj</em>) occurred bodily; the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> with his body and his soul together. You can refer to the <em>Tafseer</em> of Ibn Katheer and <em>Fat<u>h</u> ul-Baaree</em> of Al-<u>H</u>aafidh ibn <u>H</u>ajar and <em>Sharh</em> <em>ul-`Aqeedah</em> <em>a<u>t</u>&#8211;<u>T</u>ahaawiyyah</em> of Ibn Abee al-`Izz.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2] </a><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> There’s a <u>h</u>adeeth that Shaykh al-Albaaniyy authenticates in <em>A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>a<u>h</u>ee<u>h</u>ah</em> as no. 306 that describes what happens the next morning after the night journey; how the disbelievers of Makkah reacted. <u>H</u>adeeth that Al-<u>H</u>aakim reported in his <em>Mustadrak</em> volume 3, page 62 from `Aisha <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhaa</em> that she said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“When Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> was taken on the night journey to Al-Aq<u>s</u>a mosque, he entered the morning telling the people about that. So some people who had believed in him and affirmed his truthfulness turned apostate and they hastened with that news to Aboo Bakr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em> and said, “What do you think of your companion, he claims he was taken on a night journey this night to Jerusalem?” So he said, “Did he say that?” They said, “Yes.” He said, “If he said that then he has spoken the truth.” They said, “Will you believe him when he said he went to Jerusalem last night and came back before he entered the morning?” He said, “Yes, I believe him in something which is even harder than that. I believe him with regard to reports which come all the way from heaven, which come down in a single morning or a single evening.” So, therefore, he became known as A<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>iddeeq (the truthful one) who attested to the truth, <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.”</span> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the explanation of <strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah,</em> then he said on this point:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“To have eemaan that the Messenger of Allaah; his chest was split open and the portion of Satan was taken out and it was filled with eemaan (true faith) and wisdom. And he was taken on a night journey by Jibreel upon Al-Buraaq whose step is as far as it could see and he reached Jerusalem and the Prophets were gathered for him and he led them in prayer as their Imaam. Then Jibreel took him up to the lowest heaven and requested that it be opened and each heaven was opened for him and in the first heaven that he found; Aadam and in the second heaven; Ya<u>h</u>ya and `Eesaa and in the 3<sup>rd</sup> heaven; Yoosuf and in the 4<sup>th</sup> heaven; Haaroon and in the 5<sup>th</sup> heaven; Idrees and in the 6<sup>th</sup> heaven; Ibraaheem and in the 7<sup>th</sup>; Moosaa and in one narration the other way around (with regard to Ibraaheem and Moosa) and that Jibreel took him up to Sidrat ul-Muntahaa (farthest lote tree). Then he took him up to a place where he could hear the scratching of pens and he heard the speech of his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic when the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him. So then he went back to Moosaa and informed him so he said, “Go back to your Lord and ask him for a reduction.” And finally his Lord said to him, “They are five and they are 50 (in reward), the saying will not be altered with Me.”</strong></span><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Agreed upon]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You can find this narration mentions details reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (3,342) and Muslim (163) from a narration of Abu Tharr <em>ra<u>d</u>iyAllaahu `anhu</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the Shaykh says mentioning that <u>h</u>adeeth, “Meaning 5 with regard to their performance and 50 with regard to the reward and each good deed has the reward of 10 times over and that he entered Paradise and he saw in it domes or mounds made of pearl and other than that from the events, which occur in the <em>Israa·</em> and the <em>Mi`raaj.</em> And this was a matter of extra virtue bestowed upon him granted specifically by Allaah to His Prophet and to the last of His Messengers Muhammad <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam,</em> no-one else shared with him in it. And he entered the next morning in Makkah and when he informed Quraish of what had happened, they rejected what he had said. Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, said:</p>
<p><strong>وَمَا جَعَلْنَا الرُّؤْيَا الَّتِي أَرَيْنَاكَ إِلَّا فِتْنَةً لِّلنَّاسِ وَالشَّجَرَةَ الْمَلْعُونَةَ فِي الْقُرْآنِ ۚ وَنُخَوِّفُهُمْ فَمَا يَزِيدُهُمْ إِلَّا طُغْيَانًا كَبِيرًا </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And We did not make that which We showed to you except as a trial for the people a</strong></span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">nd the accursed tree mentioned in the Qur&#8217;aan and We caused them to fear but it does not increase them except in great transgression.</span>  </strong>(Sooratul-Israa (17), <em>aayah</em> 60)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the saying of the author, <span style="color:#993300;"><strong>“Jibreel took him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> until he took him through the heavens,” </strong></span>this is a matter requiring inspection (meaning something doubtful) since he did not carry him upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> except when he took him to Jerusalem. What’s correct is that he travelled upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> from Makkah to Jerusalem only, then <em>al-Buraaq</em> was left in Jerusalem then he was taken by Jibreel up through the heavens. As for him ascending from Jerusalem to the heavens then what is apparent that it was upon the <em>Mi`raaj</em> (the heavenly stairway) and not upon <em>al-Buraaq</em> as was said by the author, may Allaah have mercy upon him and success is granted by Allaah.</p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Sharh as-Sunnah : Lesson 40 : Point 61</strong><br />
<strong>Shaykh Fawzan | Dawud Burbank [Audio|English]</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Imaam Barbahaaree <em>rahimahullaah</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>And to have <em>eemaan</em> that when Allaah’s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> spoke to those thrown into the abandoned well on the day of Badr, meaning the People of <em>Shirk</em> that they heard his words. </strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left;"><strong>[<a href="https://soundcloud.com/abdurrahmanorg/allaahs-messenger-spoke-to-those-thrown-into-the-abandoned-well-on-the-day-of-badr" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Souncloud Audio Link</a>] </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Transcribed Audio:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>has <em>mu`jizaat</em> (miracles) and a <em>mu`jizah</em> (miracle) is a matter, which is extraordinary and a person is not able to bring them about himself. Rather, they are things created by Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p><strong>وَقَالُوا لَوْلَا أُنزِلَ عَلَيْهِ آيَاتٌ مِّن رَّبِّهِ ۖ قُلْ إِنَّمَا الْآيَاتُ عِندَ اللَّهِ </strong> &#8211; 29:50</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And they </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(People of </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Shirk</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">said, “If only miraculous times were to be sent down to him </span></strong><span style="color:#008000;">(Prophet </span><span style="color:#008000;"><em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em></span><span style="color:#008000;">) </span><strong><span style="color:#008000;">from his Lord.” Say, “The miraculous times are only with Allaah.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-`Ankaboot (29), <em>aayah</em> 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were demanding that he should himself bring miraculous times to prove his Messengership as they said. But the miraculous times are with Allaah. The Messenger did not bring any sign except from Allaah, the Majestic and Most High.</p>
<p><strong> قُلْ إِنَّمَا الْآيَاتُ عِندَ اللَّهِ </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Say, “The signs are only with Allaah.”</span> </strong>(Sooratul-`Ankaboot (29), <em>aayah</em> 50)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So He is the one Who manifests miracles, the Perfect and Most High. And He causes them to happen at the hands of His Messengers to attest to their truthfulness. And an example of that is &#8211; the dead person, if you speak to him, he will not hear you and he will not know what you are saying. However, the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>spoke to those who had been killed at Badr from Quraysh, those who used to harm him and harm the Muslims in Makkah and who haughtily rejected true faith and disobeyed and who tyrannized the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> and expelled him and who expelled his companions and harmed them. So, Allaah caused them to be overpowered at Badr and they were killed. And their leaders and their eminent people were killed; Shaybah Ibn Rabee`ah and `Utbah ibn Rabee`ah (his brother) and Aboo Jahl Ibn Hishaam and a large number of the eminent ones of the Quraysh were killed at Badr. Then the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> ordered that they should be thrown into an old well from the wells of Badr and the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> stood over them and addressed them:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#808000;"><strong>“O so and so, son of so and so! O Aboo Jahl Ibn Hishaam! O `Utbah! O Shaybah! O Umayyah!” He addressed them one by one, saying “Have you found what your Lord promised you to be true for I have indeed found what my Lord promised me to be true?” So then Umar said to him “O Messenger of Allaah, how can you speak to them when they have started to decay and they cannot hear.” So he <u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam responded, “You people cannot hear any better what I am saying than they can. However, they cannot talk.”</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was a miracle from the miracles of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, which Allaah caused to happen at his hand.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Footnotes:</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Reported by Al-Bukhaariyy (3,976) and reported by Muslim (2,873, 2,874 and 2,875).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Translator’s side point:</strong> Narration mentions this happened three days after the battle. In one narration it mentioned when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> conquered a people then he would remain at that place for three days.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This report that he did likewise at Badr, he stayed there for three days and just before he was going to travel and go back to Madeenah, on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day then he stood over the old well and said this saying, he spoke to them, he said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#808000;">“Did you find what your Lord promised you to be true? Indeed, I found what my Lord promised me to be true&#8230;”</span> </strong>To the end of the <u>h</u>adeeth.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh A<u>h</u>mad an-Najmee</strong> <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">“I say &#8211; the disagreement that there is amongst the People of Knowledge about whether the people in the <em>Barzakh</em> (period in between this life and the hereafter, those in the grave and the like), can they hear those people who address them or is that just specific to the people of that well at Badr?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Some of them extend this matter and claim that all the people in that life (the <em>Barzakh)</em> can hear the speech that is said to them and some of the People of Knowledge restrict it to the place where the text is mentioned and that is what is apparent from the established texts.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And as for the people of <em>Sufism</em> then they extend this matter in a reprehensible manner to the extent that they claim that a dead person even knows what happens amongst his family whether good or bad. And Ibn ul-Qayyim <em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em> reported in his book <em>Ar-Rooh</em>, some reports from them, which are suspect and Allaah is the one who grants success.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh <u>S</u>aalih as-Suhaymee</strong> had said on this same point, he mentioned that there are some people who say the dead in general can hear. However, upon verification from the sayings of the people of the <em>Ahlus-Sunnah</em>, what is correct is that we restrict ourselves in the matter of the dead hearing because it is a matter of the <em>ghaib</em> (hidden and unseen) and in matters of the hidden and the unseen, we do not increase upon them upon what occurs from the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>. And what’s established is two cases where the dead hear:</p>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Firstly</strong>, the leaders of the Quraysh who were killed at Badr that they heard the words of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>when he addressed them,</li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align:justify;">
<li><strong>Secondly</strong>, the deceased, who has died and been buried; they hear the footsteps of his family going away after they are buried.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Beyond that we do not extend the matter any further. Rather, the rest of it falls under the general <em>aayah</em>:</p>
<p> وَمَا أَنتَ بِمُسْمِعٍ مَّن فِي الْقُبُورِ &#8211; 35:22</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">And you cannot cause those who are in the graves to hear.</span><br />
</strong>(Soorah Faa<u>t</u>ir (35), <em>aayah </em>22)</p>

—</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[4] <strong>Translator’s (Dawud Burbank) Side Point</strong>: As for the lineage of the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em>, he was:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Mu<u>h</u>ammad</strong> (محمد) <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> ibn `<strong>Abdillaah</strong> (عبد الله) ibn `<strong>Abdil-Mu<u>tt</u>alib</strong> (عبد المطلب) [this was a title and his name was <u>Sh</u>aybatul-<u>H</u>amd (شيبة الحمد)] ibn <strong>Haa<u>sh</u>im</strong> (هاشم) [this was a title and his name was `Amr (عمرو)] ibn <strong>`Abd Manaaf</strong> (عبد مناف) ibn <strong>Qu<u>s</u>ay</strong> (قصي) [this was a title and his name was Zayd (زيد)] ibn <strong>Kilaab</strong> (كلاب)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">ibn <strong>Murrah</strong> (مرة) ibn <strong>Ka`ab</strong> (كعب) ibn <strong>Lu.ay</strong> (لؤي) ibn <strong><u>Gh</u>aalib</strong> (غالب) ibn <strong>Fihr</strong> (فهر) ibn <strong>Maalik</strong> (مالك) ibn <strong>An-Na<u>d</u>r</strong> (النضر) ibn <strong>Kinaanah</strong> (كنانة) ibn <strong><u>Kh</u>uzaymah</strong> (خزيمة) ibn <strong>Mudrikah</strong> (مدركة) [this was a title and his name was `Amr (عمرو)] ibn <strong>Ilyaas</strong> (إلياس) ibn <strong>Mu<u>d</u>ar</strong> (مضر) ibn <strong>Nizaar</strong> (نزار) ibn <strong>Ma`ad</strong> (معد) ibn <strong>`Adnaan</strong> (عدنان)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This list is taken from the Abridged Seerah of Ibn Ka<u>th</u>eer: <em> </em>الفصول في سيرة الرسول صلى لله عليه وسلم<em>.  </em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam An-Nawawee said in Tah<u>dh</u>eeb al-Asmaa. wal-Lu<u>gh</u>aat (تهذيب الأسماء واللغات), “This lineage here, there is consensus of the Ummah of these names here.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, Al-Bu<u>kh</u>aaree in a chapter heading of his book brings the lineage of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam </em>with these same names here.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So this is by consensus; the lineage of the Prophet <em><u>s</u></em><em>allAllaahu `alayhi wa sallam</em> is preserved, back to `Adnaan.  With regard to the lineage after `Adnaan then there are different sayings.  Some of the scholars withhold and say that they don’t know the lineage in detail any further than that.  Others mention different names with different numbers of names in the list and the verifiers from the scholars say that after `Adnaan, the lineage is not authentic.  All that we know after `Adnaan, is that `Adnaan was a descendent of the Messenger of Allaah, Ismaa.eel <em>`alayhis-salaam,</em> who was the son of the Messenger of Allaah, Ibraaheem <em>`alayhis-salaam,</em> who was the son of Aazar.  And beyond that we don’t know; except that Ibraaheem <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> was a descendent of the Messenger of Allaah, Noo<u>h</u> <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> and that Noo<u>h</u> <em>`alayhis-salaam</em> was a descendent of Aadam <em>`alayhis-salaam.</em></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>The Night Journey and the Ascent through the Heavens</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhaab (<em>rahimahullaah</em>) said:</strong></p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">وبعد العشر عرج به إلى السماء ، وفرضت عليه الصلوات الخمس ، وصلى في مكة ثلاث سنين</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#993300;">After the ten years, he was taken up through the heavens and the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him and he prayed in Makkah for three years. </span></strong><sup>[<span style="color:#ff0000;">61</span>]</sup></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align:justify;">[<span style="color:#ff0000;">61</span>] : <strong>Shaykh Saalih al-Fawzan&#8217;s Explanation :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His saying «<strong>After the ten years, he was taken up through the heavens</strong>» He <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> remained for ten years upon this &#8211; forbidding <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> and calling to <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em>, laying down this foundation. Then, in the eleventh year, he was taken by night from <em>Masjid al-<u>H</u>araam</em> (the Sacred Mosque) to <em>Masjid al-Aqsaa</em> (the farthest mosque, i.e. the mosque in Jerusalem).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He, the Most High, said:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ لَيْلًا مِّنَ الْمَسْجِدِ الْحَرَامِ إِلَى الْمَسْجِدِ الْأَقْصَى</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Perfect and Exalted is He who took His slave on a journey by night from the Sacred Mosque to the farthest mosque</strong></span>.» [17:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whilst he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was sleeping in the house of Umm Haani, Jibreel <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> came to him and had with him an animal called <em>al-Buraaq</em>, which was smaller than a mule and larger than a donkey. Its steps were as far apart as the distance which it could see. So, he <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> was caused to ride upon it and he was taken to Jerusalem at night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">(أسرى) is from (السرى) which means: &#8216;to travel by night.&#8217; This was something special to him <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and from the miracles given to him <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em>. So there, he met the prophets in Jerusalem, then he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was taken up through the Heavens. Meaning: he was raised up from Jerusalem to the heavens in the company of Jibreel &#8211; and the meaning of (العروج) is &#8216;to ascend.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, he was taken on a night journey from Makkah to Jerusalem and he was taken up from Jerusalem to the heavens &#8211; meaning: Jibreel <em>`alaihissalaam</em> took him up and he passed by the inhabitants of the heavens. At each level, Jibreel requested that it should be opened for him until he came to the seventh heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, he ascended over the heavens to the farthest lote tree and there Allaah spoke to him with whatever He wished from His revelation and He made obligatory upon him the five daily prayers. So, He obligated for each day and night fifty prayers. However, Moosaa <em>`alaihissalaam</em> advised our Prophet Mu<u>h</u>ammad <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> to ask his Lord for a reduction, for his nation would not be able to bear fifty prayers in each day and night. So, Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> kept going back to his Lord asking for a reduction until they came to be five.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, said, as occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em> of the <em>Israa.</em> and the <em>Mi`raaj</em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»أمضيت فريضتي ، وخففت عن عبادي ، وأجزي الحسنة عشرا«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>I have established My obligatory duty and I have made it easy upon My servants, and I will reward a good deed ten times over</strong></span>.»<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Anas from Aboo <u>Dh</u>arr, He said:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»هي خمس وهي خمسون«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>They are five and they are fifty</strong></span>.»<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Meaning: They are five with regards to the action and fifty in the balance (of good deeds).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Five prayers in each day and night are equal to fifty prayers upon the balance, because a good deed is rewarded with ten times its like. So a single prayer takes the place of ten prayers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Night Journey is mentioned at the beginning of <em>Soorah Sub<u>h</u>aan</em> (the 17<sup>th</sup> <em>soorah</em>) [also known as] <em>Soorah</em> <em>Banee Israa.eel</em>; and the <em>Mi`raaj</em> is mentioned at the beginning of <em>Sooratu-Najm</em>:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَلَقَدْ رَآهُ نَزْلَةً أُخْرَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">عِندَ سِدْرَةِ الْمُنتَهَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">عِندَهَا جَنَّةُ الْمَأْوَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">إِذْ يَغْشَى السِّدْرَةَ مَا يَغْشَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">مَا زَاغَ الْبَصَرُ وَمَا طَغَىٰ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">لَقَدْ رَأَىٰ مِنْ آيَاتِ رَبِّهِ الْكُبْرَىٰ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And he saw Jibreel on another occasion. By the farthest lote tree. Near it is the Garden of Refuge. When the lote tree was covered by that which covered it! His </strong>(<em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em>) <strong>sight did not deviate to the right or left nor did it go beyond that with which he was commanded. He certainly saw tremendous signs of his Lord</strong>.</span>» [53:13-18]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This was with regard to the <em>Mi`raaj</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He descended from the heaven to Jerusalem, then he returned to Makkah in the same night. So, in the morning he informed the people about that. The believers increased in <em>eemaan</em>, but as for the disbelievers, then their evil increased and they became happy at this and went about broadcasting it: &#8220;How can your companion claim that he went to Jerusalem and came back in a single night when we have to exert ourselves upon camels to reach it, taking a whole month to go there and a month to come back?!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, they made analogy between the ability of the Creator and the ability of the creation, for the <em>Israa.</em> and the <em>Mi`raaj</em> were a test from Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, for the people. The people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> increased in mockery and their evil and their belittlement of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> whereas the believers increased in <em>eemaan</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore when the people of <em><u>sh</u>irk</em> said to Aboo Bakr a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>iddeeq <em>ra<u>d</u>iyallaahu`anhu</em>: &#8220;Look at your companion &#8211; what he is saying!&#8221; He said: &#8220;What is he saying?&#8221; They said: &#8220;He is claiming that he went to Jerusalem (and that he was taken up through the heavens) and that he came back in a single night!&#8221; Aboo Bakr a<u>s</u>&#8211;<u>S</u>iddeeq said: &#8220;If he said it, then it is just as he said. He has spoken the truth.&#8221; They said: &#8220;How can that be?&#8221; He said: &#8220;I attest to the truth of what he says with regard to something greater than that. I attest to the truth with regard to the news coming down from the heavens upon him. So, how should I not attest to the truth of what he says with regard to his being taken at night to Jerusalem?&#8221;<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This [night journey and ascension] came about through the ability of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic, not through the ability of the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em>. It was only through the ability of Allaah, the Mighty and Majestic. This was one of the miracles given to the Messenger <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> and is a case of Allaah showing his honorable status with his Lord, the Mighty and Majestic.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It must be held as a person&#8217;s creed and belief that he <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> was taken on the Night Journey and taken up through the Heavens with his soul and his body together whilst awake and not as a dream;, because some people say: &#8220;He was taken on the Night Journey with his soul, and as for his body, then it did not go outside Makkah. And he was only taken on the Night Journey and taken up through the heavens with his soul.&#8221; This is false and futile speech. Rather he was taken on the Night Journey with his soul and his body <em>`alaihi<u>ss</u>alaatu wassalaam</em> and he was carried upon <em>al-Buraaq</em>. And this was in a state of being awake, not asleep, since if it had happened with his soul only or if it had been a dream, then what would have been the difference between it and (other) dreams?.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whereas Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, says:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">سُبْحَانَ الَّذِي أَسْرَىٰ بِعَبْدِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>Perfect and Exalted is He who took His <em>`abd</em> on a journey by night</strong></span>.» [17:1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The <em>`abd</em> is used to apply to the soul and the body together. It is not used for just the soul alone that it be described as <em>`abd</em>, nor is it applied to the body alone that is an <em>`abd</em>. It is not used except to apply to the soul and the body combined, for He did not say: &#8220;Perfect and Exalted is He who took the soul of His <em>`abd</em>.&#8221; Rather He said: «&#8230;<strong>took His <em>`abd</em> on a journey by night</strong>.» The <em>`abd</em> is the combination of the soul and the body. And Allaah, the Majestic and Most High, is not rendered incapable by anything and He is the One who has full power over everything.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (<em>ra<u>h</u>imahullaah</em>) said: «<strong>And the five daily prayers were made obligatory upon him and he prayed in Makkah for three years</strong>» He used to pray them as two <em>rak`ahs</em>. When the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> migrated, the four <em>rak`ah</em> prayers were completed and became four <em>rak`ahs</em> – except for <em>Fajr</em> prayer, for in that he lengthened the recitation so it remained as two <em>rak`ahs</em> just as it was, and except for the <em>ma<u>gh</u>rib</em> prayer, for indeed it is three from the first period when it was made obligatory, because it is the <em>witr</em> (prayer with the odd number of <em>rak`ahs</em>) of the daytime. As for the <em><u>Dh</u>uhr</em>, <em>`Asr</em> and the <em>`Ishaa</em> prayers, then in Makkah they were two <em>rak`ahs</em> each but when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihiwasallam</em> made <em>Hijrah</em>, they were made complete as four <em>rak`ahs</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As occurs in the <em><u>h</u>adee<u>th</u></em>:</p>
<h3 style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">»أول ما فرضت الصلاة ركعتين فلما هاجر النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم   أتمت صلاة الحضر وبقيت صلاة السفر«</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<strong>The prayer was first made obligatory as two <em>rak`ahs, </em>then when the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> made <em>Hijrah</em>, the prayer for the resident was completed and the prayer of the traveler remained as it was</strong>.»<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is by consensus of the people of knowledge, that the prayer was obligatory in Makkah and that the Prophet <em><u>s</u>allallaahu`alaihi wa sallam</em> prayed it in Makkah. However, they differ about whether it was made obligatory three years before the <em>Hijrah.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is more correct, just as the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> mentioned here. Or it is otherwise said that it was made obligatory five years before the <em>Hijrah</em>, or it is said one year before the <em>Hijrah</em>, or it is said a year and a half. However the most correct saying is what the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> mentioned is that it was three years before the <em>Hijrah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And was anything else from the pillars of Islaam made obligatory along with the prayer? This is an area of disagreement amongst the scholars; some of them held that the <em>Zakaat</em> was also made obligatory in Makkah, and that only its applicable limits, its amounts and those eligible to receive it were made clear in al-Madeenah. But as for the origin of its being made obligatory, then that was in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the proof is His saying, He the Most High:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;"> وَآتُوا حَقَّهُ يَوْمَ حَصَادِهِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And give the right due from the crops on the day when it is harvested</strong>.</span>» [6:141]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The meaning of the «<strong>due</strong>» here is the <em>Zakaat</em>. And the whole <em>soorah</em> came down in Makkah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And likewise in His statement:</p>
<h3><span style="color:#000000;">وَالَّذِينَ فِي أَمْوَالِهِمْ حَقٌّ مَّعْلُومٌ &#8211; </span><span style="color:#000000;">لِّلسَّائِلِ وَالْمَحْرُومِ</span></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;">«<span style="color:#008000;"><strong>And those whose wealth has a known portion for the beggar who asks and for the deprived</strong>.</span>» [70:24-25]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>soorah</em> also came down in Makkah. And what is meant by the «<strong>known portion</strong>» is the <em>Zakaat</em>. So, it was in origin made obligatory in Makkah, however, its details were made clear in al-Madeenah. This is one saying.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second saying: what is apparent from the speech of the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em> here, is that the <em>Zakaat</em> was only made obligatory in al-Madeenah and nothing was made obligatory in Makkah, except for the first pillar which is <em>taw<u>h</u>eed</em> and the second pillar which is the prayer. This is what is apparent from the speech of the <em><u>Sh</u>ay<u>kh</u></em>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;">Lesson 20 &#8211; Explained by Dawud Burbank rahimahullaah</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[78]<span style="color:#008000;"> And the Mi`raaj (the ascent through the Heavens) is true; and the Prophet sallAllaahu `alayhi wa `alaa aalihi wa sallam, was taken on a Night-Journey</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[79] <span style="color:#008000;">And he was taken bodily, whilst awake, up to the Heavens.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[80] <span style="color:#008000;">Then, to whatever higher places Allaah wished. And Allaah bestowed honour upon him with whatever He wished.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[81] <span style="color:#008000;">And He revealed to him what He revealed to him, {And the heart did not lie about what it saw.}</span> (Sooratun-Najm (53) aayah 11)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[82] <span style="color:#008000;">So may Allaah extol him and grant him peace and security in the Hereafter and in this life.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What about the Prophet&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Marriage to Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her) after her Divorce from Zayed bin Haarithah (may Allah be pleased with him)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zayed bin Haarithah (radhi Allaahu anhu) was a slave of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) before he freed and adopted him. His name was Zayed bin Muhammad until Allah revealed the command:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allah.</em></span> [Qur&#8217;aan 33: 5].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards people called him Zayed bin Haarithah. As to Zaynab, she was Zaynab bint Jahsh bin Rabaab Al-Asdiyyah. Her mother was Umaymah bint &#8216;Abdul Mutalib, the aunt of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). It was the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) who worked for her to get married to Zayed when he was his adopted son. She initially refused and said she was better than him in lineage. It is reported that Allah صلى الله عليه و سلم revealed the following verse concerning this matter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in a plain error.</span></em> [Qur&#8217;an 33: 36].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So she accepted and submitted in obedience to the command of Allah and as a fulfillment of the wish of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). She stayed one year in marriage with Zayed. They encountered some marital problems. So Zayed complained to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), and he, Zayed, hinted that he may divorce her. So the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told him to hold on to the marriage and be patient despite the fact that he knew by inspiration from Allah that Zayed will divorce her and that she will be his (the Prophet&#8217;s wife). He, however, feared that people might insult him as someone who marries his adopted son&#8217;s wife, something forbidden in the pre-Islamic traditions. Allah (Azza wa Jal) blamed the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And (remember) when you said to him (Zayed bin Haarithah; the freed slave of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on whom Allah has bestowed Grace (by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم too) have done favour (by manumitting him) &#8220;Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allah.&#8221; But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allah has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e., Muhammad married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him</span></em>. [Qur&#8217;an 33: 37].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you hid in yourself what Allah informed you already of that which will actually take place (divorce of Zaynab from Zayed) and your marriage of her in accordance with Allah&#8217;s plan and as manifestation of His Wisdom. Moreover, that you feared people&#8217;s sayings and their insults while Allah deserves to be feared most. Thus, you should have declared what was inspired to you from the details related to you, Zayed and Zaynab, without any consideration of people&#8217;s attitudes.<br />
As to the Prophet&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) marriage from Zaynab, he conducted the marriage contract on her after she finished her waiting period following her divorce from Zayed. Allah gave her in marriage to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) without a guardian on her behalf or witnesses, for he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the guardian of all believers. Rather he is closer to them than their ownselves, as Allah described him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم is closer to the believers than their ownselves, and his wives are their (believers&#8217;) mothers (as regards respect and marriage).</span></em> [Qur&#8217;aan 33:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Though this marriage, Allah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) nullified adoption as practiced in the pre-Islamic era, and made it lawful for Muslims to marry the wives of adopted sons after divorce or death of the husbands. This is from Allah&#8217;s Mercy and a removal of any unease regarding such relations. Allah clearly stated in the following decree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">So when Zayed had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them). And Allah&#8217;s Command must be fulfilled.</span> </em>[Qur&#8217;aan 33: 37-40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the story claiming that the Prophet&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) heart became attached to Zaynab after he saw her from behind a veil, and he fell in love and desired her, and that when Zayed knew of this he disliked her and decided to divorce her, then this has not been verified in any authentic way. The Prophets are far removed from such base manners and are in high and noble rank in their characters and behaviors. Not to forget that it was the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) himself who wanted her to get married to Zayed in the first place. Had he been attached to her, and in love with her, he would have preferred her for himself, especially when she refused to marry Zayed in the beginning. The reality, therefore, is that it is the pre-decreed plan of Allah and His judgment in order to nullify the habits and traditions of the pre-Islamic days of ignorance, and to have Mercy and Clemency on mankind.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Book of Medicine of his Sahih, <strong>Al-Bukhari</strong> recorded that `A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah was bewitched until he thought that he had relations with his wives, but he had not had relations with them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyan said, &#8220;This is the worst form of magic when it reaches this stage.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O `A&#8217;ishah! Do you know that Allah has answered me concerning that which I asked Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two men came to me and one of them sat by my head while the other sat by my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who was sitting by my head said to the other one, `What is wrong with this man&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other replied, `He is bewitched.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one said, `Who bewitched him&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other replied, `Labid bin A`sam. He is a man from the tribe of Banu Zurayq who is an ally of the Jews, and a hypocrite.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one asked, `With what (did he bewitch him)&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other replied, `With a comb and hair from the comb.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one asked, `Where (is the comb)&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other answered, `In the dried bark of a male date palm under a rock in a well called Dharwan.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;So he went to the well to remove it (the comb with the hair).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the well that I saw. It was as if its water had henna soaked in it and its palm trees were like the heads of devils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he removed it (of the well). Then I (`A&#8217;ishah) said, `Will you not make this public&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied, (Allah has cured me and I hate to spread (the news of) wickedness to any of the people.)&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>
<p><strong>How come that the Messenger of Allah was bewitched? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 6: <span style="color:#993300;">How come that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was bewitched when Allah addresses him saying: <span style="color:#008000;">Allâh will protect you from mankind</span>. How could he suffer the influence of magic at the time when he was responsible for conveying the Divine Revelation to the Muslims? Kindly explain the statement of the Mushriks (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) in the Qur&#8217;an: <span style="color:#008000;">You follow none but a bewitched man</span>. Please, clarify and answer the misconceptions! </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A 6: According to an authentic Hadith, this incident of bewitching took place in Al-Madinah. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) started to receive Divine Revelation regularly, proofs of the truthfulness of his prophethood were established and Allah&#8217;s victory was granted to him over the disbelievers who felt disgraced. At that time, a man from the Jews called Labid ibn Al-A`sam bewitched him by sticking one of the Prophet&#8217;s hairs to a comb. The Prophet (peace be upon him) started imagining that he had done a thing, which in fact he had not done. Despite being affected by magic, the Prophet (peace be upon him) was conscious of every single word he spoke to people. He would speak the words inspired to him by Allah (Exalted be He). However, the spell that was cast on him affected his intimate relation with his wives. `Aishah (may Allah be please with her) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Once the Prophet was bewitched so that he began to imagine that he had done a thing which in fact he had not done</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was only when Jibril (Gabriel) (peace be upon him) told him about what had happened to him that the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent someone to bring the spell out from a well belonging to one of the Al-Ansar (the Helpers, inhabitants of Madinah who supported the Prophet). When he was rid of it, the spell was broken by Allah&#8217;s grace. <strong>It was then that Allah (Exalted be He) revealed the two Surahs, which came to be known as Al-Mu`awwidhatayn (Surahs Al-Falaq and Al-Nas)</strong>. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) recited them, he was cured. Praising these two Surahs, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:<strong> <span style="color:#008000;">No one can use anything that is equal to these two Surahs in seeking refuge in Allah</span></strong>. The fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was bewitched did not affect his conveying of the Islamic Message nor were the people around him affected by that. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) protected him from failing to convey the Message of Islam to people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like all other prophets, Muhammad (peace be upon him) suffered several types of physical pain. For example, in the battle of Uhud, his face was wounded by the rings of his helmet that pierced his temples, his lower lip bled, and one of his teeth was broken. He also fell into a pit. The disbelievers also tightened a net around him in Makkah. He suffered pain like all the prophets who preceded him. Allah (Exalted be He) raised him to greater ranks and doubled his reward for his patient endurance of suffering and oppression at the hands of the disbelievers. Regarding the Ayah which reads: (<strong>Allâh will protect you from mankind&#8230;</strong>), it means that Allah (Exalted be He) will protect the Prophet (peace be upon him) from the disbelievers&#8217; conspiracy to kill him and from their attempt to prevent him from conveying the Message of Islam.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://abdurrahman.org/translations/al-istiqaamah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Al-Istiqaamah</strong></a> Issue No.3 &#8211; Rabî&#8217;ul-Awwal 1417H / August 1996</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE YEAR OF HIS NOBLE BIRTH</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">According to the most correct opinion of the Scholars, the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was born in the city of Makkah in the year of the Elephant (in the year 570 or 571CE), in the month of Rabee&#8217;ul-Awwal. [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>THE DAY OF HIS NOBLE BIRTH</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is an agreement amongst the Scholars that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was born on a Monday, since he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was asked about fasting on a Monday, and he said: <i>&#8220;On that day I was born and on that day Revelation descended upon me.&#8221; </i>[2] However, as regards the exact date of his birth, then the Scholars have differed about this, although the majority of Scholars say that he <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was born on the 12th of Rabee&#8217;ul-Awwal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam an-Nawawee (d.676H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i>&#8211; said: &#8220;There is on agreement that he was born on Monday in the month of Rabee&#8217;ul-Awwal. There is a difference of opinion whether this day was the 2nd, 8th, 10th or 12th day of the month &#8211; and these ore the four most well-known opinions concerning this.&#8221; [3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>EVENTS AT THE TIME OF HIS BIRTH</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Certain miraculous events are reported to have occurred at the time that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> was born. However, most of them are not authentically related, rather they are <i>da&#8217;eef</i> (week) or <i>mawdoo&#8217;</i> (fabricated) and therefore cannot be relied upon as decisive proof; such as the narration which relates that some of the galleries of Kisraa&#8217;s palace broke-up and collapsed, that the sacred-fire of the Magians died-out and that some of the churches on Lake Saawah collapsed and sank down.[4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, it is authentically related that the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayi wa sallam</i> said.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;<strong>I am a result of the supplication of my father Ibraaheem and the glad-tidings brought by &#8216;Eesaa <i>&#8216;alayhimus salaam</i>. And my mother &#8211; when she bore me &#8211; saw that a light shone out from her, which lit up the palaces in Syria &#8230;</strong> &#8221; [5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><b>CELEBRATING THE DAY OF HIS NOBLE BIRTH</b></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam al-Faakihaanee (d.734H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> -said: [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Celebrating his birthday has no basis in the Book nor the Sunnah, nor is this action recorded from any one of the Scholars of this Ummah; those who are taken as examples to be followed and who cling to the narrations. Rather it is a <em>bid&#8217;ah</em> (innovotion), which was introduced by the (deviated) <em>Battaaloon</em> sect.[7]&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As regards to the origins of this newly-invented celebration, then some of the research Scholars have stated that the first person to innovate this practice was &#8216;Umar ibn Muhammad al-Mulaa in the city of Mawsil in Iraaq, during the fourth century, as is mentioned by the Imaam Abu Shaamah (d.665H).[8] He was followed in this by the likes of Abul-Khattaab &#8216;Umar ibn Dihyaa: &#8220;who was employed in the west, then traveled to Syria, then he traveled to the city of Irbil in &#8216;Iraaq, during the fourth century, where he found its king Mudhaffarud-Deen ibn Zaynud-Deen showing a keen interest in the milaad (birthday) of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>. So he composed a book for him called <i>at-Tanweer fi Mawlidis-Siraajil-Muneer</i>; so he recited this to the king who then rewarded him with one thousand deenaars.&#8221; [9]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Maalik (d.179H) &#8211; <i>rahimahullaah</i> &#8211; said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8216;Whosoever introduces into Islaam an innovation, and holds it to be something good, has indeed alleged that Muhammad <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> has betrayed his message. Read the saying of Allaah &#8211; the Most Blessed, the Most High:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><b>&#8220;This day I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you and I have chosen for you Islaam as your religion.&#8221;</b></span> [Soorah al-Maa&#8217;idah 5:3].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So that which was not part of the religion at that time, cannot be part of the religion today. And the last part of this Ummah cannot be rectified, except by that which rectified its first part.&#8221; [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thus, had the practice of celebrating <i>milaadun-Nabee</i> (the birthday of the Prophet <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i>) been something praiseworthy then: &#8220;the <i>Salaf</i> (the Pious Predecessors) &#8211; may Allaah be pleased with them all &#8211; would have instituted it. For they were the ones having a greater love and honour for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger <i>sallallaahu &#8216;alayhi wa sallam</i> and a greater zeal for doing good. Indeed, the most perfect expression of love and honour for him is by following him, obeying him, carrying out his commands, upholding and reviving his Sunnah (guidance and example) &#8211; both inwardly and outwardly &#8211; and in spreading his message and striving in this, with the heart, the hand and the tongue. Such was the path of the Companions and those who followed them in goodness (i.e. beliefs and actions).&#8221; [11]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from the “The Sealed Nectar” book</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 1. Khadijah Bint Khuwailid:</strong> In Makkah — prior to Hijra — the Prophet’s household comprised him (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and his wife Khadijah bint Khuwailid. He was twenty-five and she was forty when they got married. She was the first woman he married. She was the only wife he had till she died. He had sons and daughters with her. None of their sons lived long. They all died. Their daughters were Zainab, Ruqaiya, Umm Kulthum and Fatimah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zainab was married to her maternal cousin Abu Al-‘As bin Al-Rabi‘ and that was before Al-Hijra. Ruqaiya and Umm Kulthum were both married to ‘Uthman bin ‘Affan &#8211; may Allah be pleased with him &#8211; successively (i.e. he married one after the death of her sister). Fatimah was married to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib; and that was in the period between Badr and Uhud battles. The sons and daughters that Fatimah and ‘Ali had were Al-Hasan, Al-Husain, Zainab and Umm Kulthum.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is well-known that the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) was exceptionally authorized to have more than four wives for various reasons. The wives he married were thirteen. Nine of them outlived him. Two died in his lifetime: Khadijah and the Mother of the poor (<em>Umm Al-Masakeen</em>) — Zainab bint Khuzaima, besides two others with whom he did not consummate his marriage.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>2. Sawdah bint Zam‘a:</strong> He married her in Shawwal, in the tenth year of Prophethood, a few days after the death of Khadijah. Prior to that, she was married to a paternal cousin of hers called As-Sakran bin ‘Amr.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 3. ‘Aishah bint Abu Bakr:</strong> He married her in the eleventh year of Prophethood, a year after his marriage to Sawdah, and two years and five months before Al-Hijra. She was six years old when he married her. However, he did not consummate the marriage with her till Shawwal seven months after Al-Hijra, and that was in Madinah. She was nine then. She was the only virgin he married, and the most beloved creature to him. As a woman she was the most learnèd woman in jurisprudence.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 4. Hafsah bint ‘Umar bin Al-Khattab:</strong> She was <em>Aiyim</em> (i.e. husbandless). Her ex-husband was Khunais bin Hudhafa As-Sahmi in the period between Badr and Uhud battles. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in the third year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 5. Zainab bint Khuzaimah:</strong> She was from Bani Hilal bin ‘Amir bin Sa‘sa‘a. Was nicknamed <em>Umm Al-Masakeen</em>, because of her kindness and care towards them. She used to be the wife of ‘Abdullah bin Jahsh, who was martyred at Uhud, was married to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) in the fourth year of Al-Hijra, but she died two or three months after her marriage to the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) .</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 6. Umm Salamah Hind bint Abi Omaiyah:</strong> She used to be the wife of Abu Salamah, who died in Jumada Al-Akhir, in the fourth year of Al-Hijra. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in Shawwal of the same year.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 7. Zainab bint Jahsh bin Riyab:</strong> She was from Bani Asad bin Khuzaimah and was the Messenger’s paternal cousin. She was married to Zaid bin Haritha — who was then considered son of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . However, Zaid divorced her. Allâh sent down some Qur’ânic verses with this respect:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e., divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage.&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">About her, Allâh has sent down some verses of <em>Al-Ahzab</em> Chapter that discussed the adoption of children in detail — anyway we will discuss this later. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her in Dhul-Qa‘dah, the fifth year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>8. Juwairiyah bint Al-Harith: </strong> Al-Harith was the head of Bani Al-Mustaliq of Khuza‘ah. Juwairiyah was among the booty that fell to the Muslims from Bani Al-Mustaliq. She was a portion of Thabit bin Qais bin Shammas’ share. He made her a covenant to set her free at a certain time. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) accomplished the covenant and married her in Sha‘ban in the sixth year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 9. Umm Habibah:</strong> Ramlah, the daughter of Abu Sufyan. She was married to ‘Ubaidullah bin Jahsh. She migrated with him to Abyssinia ( Ethiopia). When ‘Ubaidullah apostatized and became a Christian, she stoodfast to her religion and refused to convert. However ‘Ubaidullah died there in Abyssinia ( Ethiopia). The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) dispatched ‘Amr bin Omaiyah Ad-Damri with a letter to Negus, the king, asking him for Umm Habibah’s hand — that was in Muharram, in the seventh year of Al-Hijra. Negus agreed and sent her to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) in the company of Sharhabeel bin Hasnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 10. Safiyah bint Huyai bin Akhtab:</strong> From the Children of Israel, she was among the booty taken at Khaibar battle. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) took her for himself. He set her free and married her after that conquest in the seventh year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong> 11. Maimunah bint Al-Harith:</strong> The daughter of Al-Harith, and the sister of Umm Al-Fadl Lubabah bint Al-Harith. The Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her after the Compensatory <em>‘Umrah</em> (Lesser Pilgrimage). That was in Dhul-Qa‘dah in the seventh year of Al-Hijra.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those were the eleven women that the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) had married and consummated marriage with them. He outlived two of them — Khadijah and Zainab, the <em>Umm Al-Masakeen.</em> Whereas the other nine wives outlived him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The two wives that he did not consummate marriage with were, one from Bani Kilab and the other from Kindah and this was the one called Al-Jauniyah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides these, he had two concubines. The first was Mariyah, the Coptic (an Egyptian Christian), a present gift from Al-Muqauqis, vicegerent of Egypt — she gave birth to his son Ibrâhim, who died in Madinah while still a little child, on the28 th or29 th of Shawwal in the year 10A.H., i.e.27 th January, 632 A.D. The second one was Raihanah bint Zaid An-Nadriyah or Quraziyah, a captive from Bani Quraiza. Some people say she was one of his wives. However, Ibn Al-Qaiyim gives more weight to the first version. Abu ‘Ubaidah spoke of two more concubines, Jameelah, a captive, and another one, a bondwoman granted to him by Zainab bint Jahsh.[]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Whosoever meditates on the life of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) , will conceive that his marriage to this great number of women in the late years of his lifetime, after he had almost spent thirty years of his best days of youth sufficing himself to one old wife — Khadijah and later on to Sawdah, was in no way an overwhelming lustful desire to be satisfied through such a number of wives. These marriages were in fact motivated by aims and purposes much more glorious and greater than what normal marriages usually aim at.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The tendency of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) towards establishing a relationship by marriage with both Abu Bakr and ‘Umar and his marriage to ‘Aishah and Hafsah — and getting his daughter Fatimah married to ‘Ali bin Abi Talib, and the marriage of his two daughters, Ruqaiyah and Umm Kulthum to ‘Uthman — indicate clearly that he aimed at confirming the relationship among the four men — whose sacrifices and great achievements in the cause of Islam are well-known.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Besides this, there was that tradition of the Arabs to honour the in-law relations. For them a son or a daughter-in-law was a means by which they sought the consolidation of relationship and affection with various phratries. Hostility and fights against alliances and affinities would bring an unforgettable shame, disgrace and degradation to them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By marrying the Mothers of believers, the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) wanted to demolish or break down the Arab tribes’ enmity to Islam and extinguish their intense hatred. Umm Salamah was from Bani Makhzum — the clan of Abu Jahl and Khalid bin Al-Waleed. Her marriage to the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) produced good results. Khalid’s deliberately undecisive attitude at Uhud — for instance — was due to the Messenger’s marriage to Umm Salamah. Khalid went even further than that, in a short time he willingly became a keen obedient Muslim.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">After the Messenger of Allâh’s marriage to Umm Habibah, Abu Sufyan, her father, did not encounter him with any sort of hostility. Similarly his marriage to Juwairiyah and Safiyah made the two tribes stop all sorts of provocation, aggression or hostility against Islam. Better still, Juwairiyah, herself, was one of the greatest sources of blessing to her own people. On the occasion of her marriage to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) , his Companions set a hundred families of her people free. They said: &#8220;It is for their affinity with the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) .&#8221; No need to say what great good impression this gratitude had on everybody’s soul. One of the greatest motives of all is Allâh’s bidding his Prophet to educate and purify the souls of people who had known nothing whatsoever about courtesy, education and culture. He had to teach them to comply with the necessities of civilization and to contribute to the solidification and the establishment of a new Islamic society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An essential fundamental rule of the Muslim society is to prohibit mixing of men and women. Providing direct education for women, though highly compelling, is impossible in the light of this Islamic norm. Therefore, the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) had to select some women of different ages and talents, and indoctrinate them systematically in order to educate she-bedouins and townswomen, old and young, and thus furnish them with the instruments of propagating the true faith. The Mothers of believers (i.e. wives of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) ) were in such a convenient position that they could convey the state of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and his affairs to people (men and women). Being educated and taught the teachings and rules of Islam, his wives, especially those who outlived him, played a very important role in conveying Prophetic traditions <em>Ahadith</em> to the Muslims. ‘Aishah, for instance, related a large number of the Prophet’s deeds and statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His marriage to his paternal cousin Zainab bint Jahsh was a peculiar case which aimed at eradicating a deeply rooted pre-Islamic tradition — i.e. the adoption of children. In <em>Al-Jahiliyah</em> the Arabs used to consider an adopted person exactly like a real son or daughter as far as rights and sanctities are concerned. That <em>Jahiliyah</em> tradition had been so deeply rooted in their hearts that it was not easy to remove or uproot it. This tradition in fact affronts the basic principles of Islam; especially those concerned with marriage, divorce and inheritance and some other cases, and brought about lots of corruptions and indecencies. Naturally Islam stands against such deeds, and attempts to remove them from the Islamic society.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">For the eradication of this tradition, Allâh, the Exalted, bid His Messenger (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to marry his cousin Zainab bint Jahsh, who was an ex-wife to Zaid. She was at variance with Zaid to an extent that he intended to divorce her — that was at the time when the Confederates (<em>Al-Ahzab</em>) were making an evil alliance against the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and against the Muslims. The Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) feared that the hypocrites, the idolaters, and the Jews would make a propaganda out of it and try to influence some Muslims of weak hearts. That was why he urged Zaid not to divorce her, in order not to get involved into that trial.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Undoubtedly this hesitation and partiality were alien to the character of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . They did not apply to the power of determination and will with which he had been sent. Allâh, the Exalted, blamed him for that by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;And (remember) when you said to him (Zaid bin Haritha may Allah be pleased with him &#8211; — the freed slave of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) on whom Allâh has bestowed grace (by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) too) have done favour (by manumitting him), ‘Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allâh.’ But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allâh has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allâh will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e. Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allâh had a better right that you should fear him.&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Finally Zaid divorced Zainab and the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) married her at the time he laid siege to Bani Quraiza. That was after she had finished her <em>Iddat</em> (i.e. period during which a widow or a divorcee may not remarry). Allâh Himself had already ordained it, and so gave him no other alternative. Allâh had even started the marriage Himself by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them).&#8221; [33:37]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And that was in order to break down the tradition of child adoption in practice after He had done it in words:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just near Allâh.&#8221; [33:5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Muhammad ( saw) is not the father of any man among you, but he is the Messenger of Allâh, and the last (end) of the Prophets.&#8221; [33:40]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Lots of deeply-rooted traditions cannot be uprooted or demolished or even adjusted by mere words. They must be matched and associated with the action of the advocate of the Message himself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This could be perceived through the deeds practised by the Muslims at Al-Hudaibiyah <em>‘Umrah</em> (Lesser Pilgrimage) during which ‘Urwah bin Mas‘ud Al-Thaqafi saw certain Muslims tend to pick up any expectoration that fell down from the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) . He also saw them race to the water of his ablution and they almost quarrelled for it. There were others who competed to pledge allegiance to death and some others pledged not to flee from (the battlefield). Among those people, were eminent Companions like ‘Umar and Abu Bakr, who although dedicated all their lives to the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and to the cause of Islam, but refused to carry out the Messenger’s ordres with respect to slaughtering sacrificial animals after the ratification of Al-Hudaibiyah Peace Treaty, the thing that perturbed and caused the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to feel anxious. However, when Umm Salamah &#8211; may Allah be pleased with her &#8211; advised that he take the initiative and sacrifice his animals, his followers raced to follow his example; a clear evidence in support of the saying: Actions speak louder than words, in the process of exterminating a deeply-established tradition.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Hypocrites aroused a lot of suspicions and made a broad false propaganda against that marriage. Their acts and talks about that marriage had ill-effects on those Muslims whose Faith was still weak, particularly that Zainab was the fifth wife — and the Noble Qur’ân limited the number up to four only; Zaid was traditionally his son, and so a father marrying his son’s divorcee was a heinous sin in the eyes of the Arabians.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em> Al-AhzabSurah</em> was revealed to shed full light on the two issues, i.e. Islam does not recognize adoption of children, and the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is given (by Allâh) more freedom as regards the number of wives he can hold than other Muslims in order to achieve noble and honourable purposes.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, the treatment of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) to his wives was of honourable, noble, and superb nature. His wives were on tops in respect of honour, satisfaction, patience, modesty, and service (that is to say the performance of housework and marriage duties). Although the Messenger’s house-life was hard and unbearable, none of his wives complained. Anas said about the Prophet’s life: &#8220;According to my knowledge, the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) has never tasted a thin flattened loaf in all his lifetime, nor has he ever seen with his own eyes roasted mutton.&#8221;[]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aishah said: &#8220;Over two months have elapsed — during which we have seen three crescents — and yet no fire has been kindled in the houses of the Messenger of Allâh (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) (i.e. they did not cook food).&#8221; &#8220;What did you eat to sustain yourselves?&#8221; ‘Urwah asked. She said &#8220;The two blacks: dates and water&#8221;[]. Lots of information about the hard life of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam) were told.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In spite of these hardships, straits and adversity of life in the house of the Prophet (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam), none of his wives uttered a word of complaint worthy of reproach — but once. This exception was required by human instinctive inclinations. However, it was not so important and consequently it did not require the decree of a legislative rule. Allâh has given them an opportunity to choose between two things, as clearly stated in the following verses:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;O Prophet (Muhammad (Sallalaahu alaihi wa Sallam)! Say to your wives: ‘If you desire the life of this world, and its glitter, — then come! I will make a provision for you and set you free in a handsome manner (divorce). But if you desire Allâh and His Messenger, and the Home of the Hereafter, then verily, Allâh has prepared for <em>Al-Muhsinat</em> (good doers) amongst you an enormous reward.’&#8221; [33:28,29]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They were so noble and honest that none of them preferred ‘the life of this world and its glitter’ to the abode in the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Although they were many in number, nothing of the dispute occurrences that normally happen among co-wives, took place in their houses. Very few cases could be the only exception; but they were quite normal. Allâh reproached them for that, so they ceased to do such a thing. This incident is mentioned in <em>At-Tahreem</em> Chapter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> &#8220;O Prophet! Why do you ban (for yourself) that which Allâh has made lawful to you …&#8221; [66:1] (to the end of the fifth verse).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Discussing polygamy — in my opinion — is not a necessity; since a person who is familiar with the Europeans, and indecent practices, sufferings, wickedness, their sorrows and distresses, the horrible crimes they commit in this respect as well as the trials, the disasters that they are involved in, and which emanate directly from their disregard of the principle of polygamy form a good reason (to justify the soundness of polygamy). The distorted picture of life in Europe with the ill-practices featuring it, could truthfully justify the existence and practice of polygamy. In this, there are Divine signs for all people possessed of lucid mind.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Uploaded by <span style="color:#993300;">LearntoReadTheKuran</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The following is taken from Tafsir Ibn Kathir</strong>:</p>
<p>In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">(1. The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.) (2. And if they see an Ayah, they turn away and say: &#8220;This is magic, Mustamir.&#8221;) (3. They denied and followed their own lusts. And every matter will be settled.) (4. And indeed there has come to them news wherein there is Muzdajar.) (5. Perfect wisdom, but warners benefit them not.) <span style="color:#993300;">(Surah Qamar 1-4)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Anas bin Malik said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The people of Makkah asked the Prophet for a miracle and the moon was split into two parts in Makkah. Allah said, (The Hour has drawn near, and the moon has been cleft asunder.)&#8221; </span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim also collected this Hadith. Al-Bukhari recorded that Anas bin Malik said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The people of Makkah asked the Messenger of Allah to produce a miracle, and he showed them the splitting of the moon into two parts, until they saw (the mount of) Hira&#8217; between them.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahihs with various chains of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Ahmad recorded that Jubayr bin Mut`im said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>&#8220;The moon was split into two pieces during the time of Allah&#8217;s Prophet ; a part of the moon was over one mountain and another part over another mountain. So they said, `Muhammad has taken us by his magic.&#8217; They then said, `If he was able to take us by magic, he will not be able to do so with all people.&#8221;&#8217;</em> </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Only Imam Ahmad recorded this Hadith with this chain of narration. Al-Bayhaqi used another chain of narration in a similar Hadith he collected in Ad-Dala&#8217;il.</p>
<p>Al-Bukhari recorded that Ibn `Abbas said, &#8220;The moon was split during the time of the Prophet .&#8221; Al-Bukhari and Muslim collected this Hadith. Ibn Jarir recorded that Ibn `Abbas commented on Allah&#8217;s saying:</p>
