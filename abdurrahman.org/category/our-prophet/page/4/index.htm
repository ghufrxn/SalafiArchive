		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As to the often-raised question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why did Allah permit the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) more than four wives while limiting the number to four for the rest of the Muslim men (Qur&#8217;aan 4: 3)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is from the particularities that Allah gave him. In contrast, there are certain rulings that are allowed for the general Muslims but not permitted for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), like taking charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, many things pertaining to rulings and/or miracles were made particular to Prophets and Messengers before. Of all the Prophets and Messengers, five were distinguished the most (Noah, Abraham. Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, peace be upon them all), and Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was further distinguished as the leader of all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that there are great and noble wisdoms for such particularizations. We are not commanded, however, to search and find them, especially if such search arises from objection to the decree of Allah or due to certain doubts concerning it. This often comes from deviants and/or enemies of Islam. Nothing of this of course occurs from the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The position of the Muslims regarding the wisdoms behind matters of Islam should be as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If they see any clear wisdom(s) relevant to these matters, then they take by it and thank Allah for that, and if not</span></strong></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">then they ask the people of knowledge, and</span></strong></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">in case there is no apparent wisdom reached at by the people of knowledge, then they say: &#8220;Allah Knows Best,&#8221; and they should not resort to any speculation lest they end up forging lies against Allah.</span></strong></li>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">What about the Prophet&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) Marriage to Zaynab (may Allah be pleased with her) after her Divorce from Zayed bin Haarithah (may Allah be pleased with him)</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Zayed bin Haarithah (radhi Allaahu anhu) was a slave of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) before he freed and adopted him. His name was Zayed bin Muhammad until Allah revealed the command:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>Call them (adopted sons) by (the names of) their fathers, that is more just with Allah.</em></span> [Qur&#8217;aan 33: 5].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Afterwards people called him Zayed bin Haarithah. As to Zaynab, she was Zaynab bint Jahsh bin Rabaab Al-Asdiyyah. Her mother was Umaymah bint &#8216;Abdul Mutalib, the aunt of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). It was the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) who worked for her to get married to Zayed when he was his adopted son. She initially refused and said she was better than him in lineage. It is reported that Allah صلى الله عليه و سلم revealed the following verse concerning this matter:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision. And whoever disobeys Allah and His Messenger, he has indeed strayed in a plain error.</span></em> [Qur&#8217;an 33: 36].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So she accepted and submitted in obedience to the command of Allah and as a fulfillment of the wish of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم). She stayed one year in marriage with Zayed. They encountered some marital problems. So Zayed complained to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), and he, Zayed, hinted that he may divorce her. So the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) told him to hold on to the marriage and be patient despite the fact that he knew by inspiration from Allah that Zayed will divorce her and that she will be his (the Prophet&#8217;s wife). He, however, feared that people might insult him as someone who marries his adopted son&#8217;s wife, something forbidden in the pre-Islamic traditions. Allah (Azza wa Jal) blamed the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on that:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;And (remember) when you said to him (Zayed bin Haarithah; the freed slave of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) on whom Allah has bestowed Grace (by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم too) have done favour (by manumitting him) &#8220;Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allah.&#8221; But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allah has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e., Muhammad married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him</span></em>. [Qur&#8217;an 33: 37].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Therefore, you hid in yourself what Allah informed you already of that which will actually take place (divorce of Zaynab from Zayed) and your marriage of her in accordance with Allah&#8217;s plan and as manifestation of His Wisdom. Moreover, that you feared people&#8217;s sayings and their insults while Allah deserves to be feared most. Thus, you should have declared what was inspired to you from the details related to you, Zayed and Zaynab, without any consideration of people&#8217;s attitudes.<br>
As to the Prophet&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) marriage from Zaynab, he conducted the marriage contract on her after she finished her waiting period following her divorce from Zayed. Allah gave her in marriage to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) without a guardian on her behalf or witnesses, for he (صلى الله عليه و سلم) is the guardian of all believers. Rather he is closer to them than their ownselves, as Allah described him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;The Prophet صلى الله عليه و سلم is closer to the believers than their ownselves, and his wives are their (believers&#8217;) mothers (as regards respect and marriage).</span></em> [Qur&#8217;aan 33:6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Though this marriage, Allah (Subhanahu wa ta&#8217;aala) nullified adoption as practiced in the pre-Islamic era, and made it lawful for Muslims to marry the wives of adopted sons after divorce or death of the husbands. This is from Allah&#8217;s Mercy and a removal of any unease regarding such relations. Allah clearly stated in the following decree:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">So when Zayed had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them). And Allah&#8217;s Command must be fulfilled.</span> </em>[Qur&#8217;aan 33: 37-40].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As to the story claiming that the Prophet&#8217;s (صلى الله عليه و سلم) heart became attached to Zaynab after he saw her from behind a veil, and he fell in love and desired her, and that when Zayed knew of this he disliked her and decided to divorce her, then this has not been verified in any authentic way. The Prophets are far removed from such base manners and are in high and noble rank in their characters and behaviors. Not to forget that it was the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) himself who wanted her to get married to Zayed in the first place. Had he been attached to her, and in love with her, he would have preferred her for himself, especially when she refused to marry Zayed in the beginning. The reality, therefore, is that it is the pre-decreed plan of Allah and His judgment in order to nullify the habits and traditions of the pre-Islamic days of ignorance, and to have Mercy and Clemency on mankind.</p>

		<h2 style="text-align:center;"><strong> بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم </strong></h2>
<p><em>The following are the excerpts from Fatwas of Ibn Baz &#8211; read the full article at <a href="http://www.alifta.net/Fatawa/FatawaChapters.aspx?languagename=en&View=Page&PageID=139&PageNo=1&BookID=14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://www.alifta.net</a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>This was published in the magazine of the Islamic University in Madinah, the fourth edition, the sixth year, Rabi` Al-Thany, 1394 A.H., pp. 175-182.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise is due to Allah. May peace be upon the Last Prophet, his family, and his Companions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam Muslim related in his Sahih (Book of sound Hadiths) from Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;If anyone invokes blessings on me once, Allah will bless him ten times&#8221; </strong></span></em>[1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is also narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Do not make your houses graves and do not make my grave a place of celebration but invoke blessings on me, for your blessings reach me wherever you may be&#8221; </span></strong></em>[2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (May peace and blessings be upon him) also said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;"><strong>&#8220;May his nose soil with dust in whose presence mention is made of me and he does not supplicate for me&#8221; </strong></span></em>[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Since invoking peace and blessings on the Prophet (peace be upon him) is permissible in Salah during Tashahhud (a recitation in the sitting position in the second/last unit of Prayer) and permissible in Khutbah (sermon), invocations, seeking forgiveness, after Adhan (Call to Prayer), upon entering, and leaving the Masjid (mosque), when uttering his name and in other positions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is confirmed to write the form of invoking peace and blessings when writing His name in a book, a message, or an article, because of the proofs mentioned above. It is permissible to write the full form in order to apply what Allah has commanded and the reader would remember it when passing by it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You should not reduce it to the acronym e.g. <span style="color:#ff0000;"><strong>(P)</strong></span> that stands for peace or <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(PBUH)</span></strong> that stands for (peace be upon him) or the like abbreviations that may be used by some writers.Such an act is against the ordinance of Allah (May He be Praised and Glorified) which are mentioned in His Book by His saying: <em><strong><span style="color:#008000;">Send your Salât on (ask Allâh to bless) him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islâmic way of greeting (salutation i.e. As-Salâmu ‘Alaikum)</span></strong></em>.[Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 56] It does not have the same privilege of writing (peace be upon him) in full form. The reader may not watch out or may not understand the meaning, bearing in mind that referring to it is disapproved by the religious scholars who even warned against it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Al-Salah said in his book: &#8220;`Ulum al-Hadith&#8221; i.e. The sciences of Hadith, known as &#8220;Muqadimat Ibn Al-Salah&#8221; in the twenty fifth type of his book: (Al-Hadith wa Kayfiyat Dabt-ul-kitab wa Taqyiduh). He said that which means:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ninth: A person must keep writing the form of sending Salat and taslim i.e. &#8220;peace and blessing be upon the Messenger of Allah&#8221; in full form upon mentioning him. <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>A person must not be weary of repeating it, because it is one of the greatest benefits which the Hadith students and writers may overlook</strong></span>. Whoever disregards this, he will be deprived of a great reward. We have seen good visions for the people who write the form in full, because it is a form that a person writes as a Du`a&#8217; (supplication), not a part of the narration to make it dependent on the source of narration.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Similarly, the same is true with regard to praising Allah (Glorified be He) upon mentioning His Name such as (Glorified and Exalted be He), (Blessed and Exalted be He), and the like&#8230;</strong></span> (Until he says): then a person should avoid two shortcomings:</p>
<ol>
<li style="text-align:justify;">First: Writing it in incomplete form by two letters or the like.</li>
<li style="text-align:justify;">Second: Writing it in short form by meaning such as (wa sallam i.e. blessings).</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is narrated from Hamzah Al-Kinany (may Allah be merciful to him) that he used to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I used to record the Hadith and I used to write down upon mentioning the name of the Prophet (salla-Allah-u-`alaihi i.e. May Allah&#8217;s peace be upon him) without writing (wa sallam). Thereupon, I saw the Prophet (peace be upon him) in a vision saying to me: Why do you not complete the form of invoking peace and blessingson me? He continued: Ever since, I did not write it in short form like this (salla-Allah-u-`alaihi) but in this form (salla-Allah-u-`alaihi-wa-sallam i.e. May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon him). Ibn Al-Salah added: I said: it is also reprehensible to write (`alaihi-s-salam i.e. peace upon him) and Allah knows best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of quote.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">His authority, the encyclopedic scholar Al-Sakhawy (May Allah be merciful with him) said in his book (Fath-ul-Mughith Sharh Alfiyat Al-Hadith by Al-`Iraqy) :</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O writer, avoid (referring to it) i.e. peace and blessings upon the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) by writing only two letters or the like as done by Al-Kattany and the ignorant of the non-Arabs and ignorant students. They write instead of (May Allah&#8217;s peace and blessings be upon him), <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(p) </span></strong>or <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(pb) </span></strong>or <strong><span style="color:#ff0000;">(pbuh)</span></strong> and that entails decrease in reward, because it is unlike the proper manner.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Suyuty (May Allah be merciful with him) said in his book (Tadrib Al-Rawy Fi Sharh Taqrib Al-Nawawy):</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is reprehensible to write the short form of peace and blessings here and in every position where invoking peace and blessings is required as mentioned in the commentary of Sahih Muslim and others because of Allah&#8217;s saying: <span style="color:#008000;"><em>Send your Salât on (ask Allâh to bless) him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islâmic way of greeting (salutation i.e. As-Salâmu ‘Alaikum)</em></span>.[Surah Al­Ahzab, 33: 56] Until he says: It is reprehensible to refer to it with one or two letters as those people who write (pbuh), he must write it in full form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">End of quote, adapted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">My advice for every Muslim; reader or writer, is to <strong><span style="color:#000000;">seek for the best reward</span></strong> and stay away from what <strong><span style="color:#000000;">may invalidate or reduce it</span></strong>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We ask Allah to grant us success to that which pleases Him, for He is the Most Generous. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question 62:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">As regard those who bequeath that the Faatihah be recited on behalf of the Prophet’s soul, or on his behalf by the Prophet’s grave?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer by Shaykh Uthaymeen (rahimahullaah):</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is not binding to execute this bequest, because it is a bequest of an unprescribed matter. For the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) does not prescribe for anyone to worship Allaah and then dedicate the reward of worship to the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam). Since, had this been prescribed, then the companions, may Allaah be pleased with them, would have been the most preceding people in attaining it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And also because the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is in no need for this. For indeed there is no person who does a righteous deed except that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) would have a similar reward. Because he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) is the one who has directed to this, and, [as the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) said]: <strong><span style="color:#008000;">“The one who guides to what is good is like the one who does it.”</span></strong> [92] So, this bequest is from the <strong>foolish</strong> and <strong>futile</strong> actions as well as a <strong>bid’ah</strong>, something which has not been reported from the righteous predecessors, may Allaah be pleased with them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And similarly if he said: “Recite the Faatihah on my behalf by the Prophet’s grave,” then it is not binding to fulfill this bequest. The reason for this is that <strong>specifying a particular place for a particular worship not prescribed by the sharia, is from the bida’</strong> as it is known in the aforementioned discussion pertaining to the issue of “Pursuance of the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam).” [93] And that the following of the Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa sallam) cannot be achieved until the act of worship agrees with the Sharee’ah in six matters: <strong>cause, type, extent, manner, time, and place</strong>.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Q : A brother from Dar&#8217;a, Syria asks: What is the correct opinion about the stories narrated from one of the famous leaders of Sufism, Al-Sayyid <strong>Ahmad Al-Rifa&#8217;y</strong> that he visited the Mosque of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in Al-Madinah and supplicated at the Prophet&#8217;s grave. The Messenger (peace be upon him) then stretched his hand out to him and he kissed it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">This is a widespread belief among the followers of his Tariqah (Sufi order). It is a belief they hold firmly, even though he lived in the 6th century A.H. How true is this story?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">A : This is false and baseless, because the Prophet (peace be upon him) died as decreed by Allah (Glorified be He) who says: <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B1.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"><a id="ContentAnchor" title="Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30" target="_blank" name="Verilyyou(OMuhammad%D8%B5%D9%84%D9%89%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%84%D9%87"></a><span style="color:#008000;">Verily you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will die, and verily they (too) will die.</span><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.alifta.net/_layouts/images/UserControl-Images/MEDIA-B2.GIF" alt="" align="middle" border="0"> [Surah Al-Zumar, 39: 30]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph">According to a Sahih Hadith, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">Allah has angels roaming around the land; if they find anyone greeting me, they carry back these greetings to me.</span></span><span style="color:#008000;">There is no one who sends greetings upon me but Allah will restore my soul to me so that I may return his greeting.</span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[1]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He (peace be upon him) said: <a name="Themostexcellentofyourdays"></a><span id="ContentParagraph"><span style="color:#008000;">The most excellent of your days is Friday; so invoke more blessings on me on that day, for your blessings will be submitted to me.</span> The people asked: O Messenger of Allah, how can it be that our blessings will be submitted to you while your body is decayed? He replied: <span style="color:#008000;">Allah, the Exalted, has prohibited the earth to consume the bodies of the prophets. </span></span><span id="ContentParagraph">[2]</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many Hadiths which say similar things but it is <span style="color:#000000;"><strong>not narrated that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said that he would shake hands with anybody</strong></span>. This indicates that this story is false. Even if we were to assume that it is true, then it could be that this was a <strong>shaytaan</strong> (devil) who shook hands with him in order to deceive him and lead him and others astray.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What all Muslims have to do is to fear Allah and adhere to His Shari`ah, which is indicated in His Noble Book and in the Sunnah of His trustworthy Messenger, and beware of anything that goes against that. May Allah reform the Muslims and grant them understanding of His religion and cause them to adhere to His Shari`ah, for He is the Most Generous, Most Kind.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center"><span style="color:#666699;">Compiled &amp; Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;" align="center">
<p style="text-align:justify;">1 – Imam Shaafi’ee (d.199 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The first of manners which should be followed is that which the Messenger of Allaah  <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> did.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘al-Adab’ by al-Bayhaqi (300) / ‘Tawjee al-Muqtasid’ p.5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2 – Abul Abbas bin ‘Atta said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever adheres to the manners of the Sunnah then Allaah enlightens his heart with the light of knowing his <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> Sunnah.  There is no station/status more noble than following the beloved <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> in his commands, actions, his manners and in following his manners in statements and actions and intentions.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: Zuhud al-Kabeer by al-Bayhaqi (287) / ‘Tawjee al-Muqtasid’ p.5-6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Know that it is obligatory upon every mature, intelligent person from mankind and the Jinn to testify that none has the right to be worshipped except Allaah, and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah sent him with the guidance and the religion of the truth to make it uppermost above all religions, and Allaah is sufficient as a witness. Allaah sent him to all of creation, mankind and Jinn, the Arabs and the non-Arabs, the Persians and the Indians, the Barbars and the Romans, and all the different types of non-Arabs, black and white.  What is meant by non-Arabs is those who do not have the Arab language, amongst all their different languages.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Muhammad <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> was sent for every single person from the humans and the Jinn, whether they are from those who follow a revealed Book or not. He was sent for every single person in relation to his Deen, from the inward matters and outward ones, regarding his beliefs, realities, methods and his legislations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So there is no ‘Aqeeda/belief except the Messenger’s <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i>‘Aqeeda, and there is no reality except his reality, and there is no method except his method, and there is no legislation/Sharia’ except his Sharia’/legislation.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No one from the creation can reach to Allaah, and to His pleasure, and His Paradise, and to His Generosity, and His Guardianship except by following the Messenger <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> inwardly and outwardly, and in sayings and actions inwardly and outwardly, in statements of the heart and its beliefs, and the conditions of the heart and its realities, and the statements of the tongue and the actions of the limbs.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 10/430-431]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4 – Imam Abu Muthaffar Samaani (d.489 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah-</i> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed we have been ordered with following and have been recommended to it, and prohibited from innovating and rebuked for it.  The sign of the Ahl-ul-Sunnah is that they follow the Salaf as-Salih, and that they leave everything that is innovated and a novelty.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘al-Inteesar li Ahl-ul-hadeeth’ p.69]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:<i></i></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘As for the beliefs (al-‘Iteeqad) then it is not taken from me nor from someone more senior than me, rather it is taken from Allaah and His Messenger <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> and that which the Salaf of the Ummah were gathered upon.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 3/161]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">6 – al-Hasan al-Basari (d.110 A.H.)  said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘A statement is not correct except with action, and a statement and action are not correct except with intention, and a statement and action and intention are not correct except with the Sunnah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Sharh Asool I’teeqad’ 1/57]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">7 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Following the Prophet <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> is a proof and evidence that the follower loves Allaah –Azza wa Jal – and what indicates to that is the saying of – Jala wa ‘Ulaa – : &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 1/334]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">8 – Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah (d.728 A.H.) <i>-Rahimullaah- </i>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘What is necessary to comprehend is that Allaah Subhanahu said in His Book: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">
<p style="text-align:justify;">A group from the Salaf said: there were a people at the time of the Messenger of Allaah<i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> who claimed that they love Allaah, so Allaah revealed this Ayaah: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah explained that His love obligates following the Messenger <i>–sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</i> which in turn obligates the love of Allaah for His slave.  Allaah tested those who claim to love Allaah by this specific love, and indeed this issue has many claimants and those who are dubious in their love for Allaah.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from: ‘Majmoo’ Fatawa’ 10/81]</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">Excerpts from Works by a Numerous People of Knowledge<br>
Translated &amp; Compiled by Abbas Abu Yahya</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Salaf as-Salih Did Not Celebrate It</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> said regarding the<em>Mawlid</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Salaf as-Salih did not do this even though they could have done it and there was no prevention in doing so.  If the <em>Mawlid</em> was good or seen as beneficial the Salaf <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhum</em><em>&#8211;</em> would have had more of a right to it than us because they were the greatest in love for the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and in respect for him, compared to us, and were more concerned for goodness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed loving him completely and respecting him is by following him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>, obeying him and following his commands, reviving his Sunnah outwardly and inwardly and conveying what he was sent with, striving upon that with the heart, hand and tongue, as this was the way of the foremost to embrace Islaam from the Muhajireen, the Ansar and those who followed them in goodness.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Iqtida’ as-Siraat al-Mustaqeem’ Vol.2 p.619</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Shaykh ul-Islaam Ibn Taymeeyah <em>-Rahimullaah-</em> was asked, as occurs in ‘Fatawa al-Misreeyah’, regarding completing the Qur’aan every year on the night of the <em>Mawlid</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is that a recommended action or not?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘All Praise belongs to Allaah, the gathering of people for food on the two Eids and the days of stoning in the Hajj is sunnah and is from the distinguishing features of Islaam which the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> established as a Sunnah for the Muslims.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Helping and feeding the poor in the month of Ramadan is also from the <em>Sunnan</em> of Islaam.  The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Whoever opens a fasting person’s fast then he has the reward similar to the fasting person.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Giving the poor recitors what aids them in reciting the Qur’aan is a good action at all times, and whoever helps them in this shares in the reward.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for taking a season other than the legislated seasons, like some of the nights of the month of Rabi al-Awwal- which it is said is the night of the <em>Mawlid</em>&#8211; or taking some of the nights of Rajab or the 18<sup>th</sup> of Dhul-Hijjah, the 1<sup>st</sup> Jumu’ah of Rajab or the 8<sup>th</sup> of Shawwal which the ignorant people call <em>Eid al-Abrar</em> then all of this is from Bida’ (innovations) which the Salaf neither recommended nor did.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.429</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Is it Obligatory or Recommended?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   The ‘Allaama Shaykh Taj-Uddeen Faakihanee[1] who died in the year (734 A.H.) said in his unique booklet about this subject entitled: ‘al-Mawrid fee Amal al-Mawlid’ and this is its wording and text:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘In The name of Allaah, The Most Kind and Most Merciful</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Praise be to Allaah who guided us to follow the leader of the Messengers and supported us with the guidance to aid the <em>Deen</em>, Who made it easy for us to follow the <em>Athaar</em> of the Salaf as-Saliheen until our hearts filled up with the light of the knowledge of the<em>Sharia’</em> and the definite clear truth and Who purified our hearts from introducing new innovations and innovating in the <em>Deen</em>.  I praise Allaah with what He has favoured us with of the light of certainty and I thank Him for what He has conferred on us holding on to the strong rope of the <em>Deen</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I testify that none is worthy of worship except Allaah – Alone who has no partner- and that Muhammad is His slave and Messenger, the leader of the earlier people and of those who came later.  May Allaah send His prayers upon His Messenger, his Family, his Companions and his pure wives, who are the Mothers of the Believers, continuously until the day of Judgement.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Amma Ba’d:</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed a question has been repeated from a group of blessed people about a gathering which some of the people organize in the month of Rabi al-Awwal and they call it ‘<em>al-Mawlid</em>’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Does it have an origin in the <em>Sharia’</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or is it a Bida’ and innovation in the <em>Deen</em>?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They wanted the answer to this to be clear and to clarify it specifically.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So I say – and success is with Allaah – :</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I do not know of an origin for this <em>Mawlid</em> neither in the Book of Allaah nor in the Sunnah, nor was it narrated that any of the scholars of the <em>Ummah</em> performed it; those scholars who are an example for the <em>Deen</em>, holding on to the <em>Athaar</em> of the predecessors.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather, <em>Mawlid</em> is a Bida’, it was innovated by magicians; those parasites who followed their desires and became rich by it.  The evidence for this is that if we applied the five types of <em>Sharee’ah</em>rulings to it we would say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is either obligatory (<em>Waajib</em>), recommended (<em>Mandoob</em>), permissible (<em>Mubaah</em>), disliked (<em>Makrooh</em>) or prohibited (<em>Muharam</em>)!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">By consensus it is neither obligatory nor recommended; because the reality of a recommended act is: an act which is sanctioned by the<em>Sharia’</em> without any disapproval for the one who leaves it.  The<em>Sharia’</em> did not give permission for the <em>Mawlid</em> and the Companions did not do it, neither the <em>Tabieen</em> nor the religious scholars – as far as I know.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is my response to this before Allaah –Ta’ala – if I am asked about it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Nor is it correct that it is permissible (<em>Mubaah</em>), because innovating in the <em>Deen</em> is not permissible – and all the Muslims are in agreement regarding this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So nothing remains except that it is disliked (<em>Makrooh</em>) or prohibited (<em>Muharam</em>).’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’  p.11</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Differing on the Date of Birth</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Ustadh Abu Abdullaah Muhammad al-Haffar[2]  – who died in the year (811 A.H.) as stated in the book ‘al-Ma’yeyar al-Ma’arab’ (7/99-101):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The Salaf as-Salih – and they are the Companions of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and those who followed them – never used to gather on the night of the <em>Mawlid</em> for worship, they would not do anything on that night which they would not do on any other night of the year because the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>is not revered except due to that which the <em>Sharia’</em> regards as reverential.  Revering the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is from the greatest of ways of drawing closer to Allaah but drawing closer to Allaah – the Magnificent – is only with what He has legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The evidence that the Salaf never used to do anything extra on that night – over what they did on any other night – is that they differed in the following:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It had been said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> was born in Ramadan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It had been said: in Rabia’ al-Awwal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They differed regarding the day on which he was born with four different sayings!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if there was worship that occurred due to the birth of the best of creation <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> on the night preceding the day on which he was born – then it would have been well-known and widespread and no difference would have occurred regarding it, but observing extra reverence was not legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you not see that Friday is the best day upon which the sun rose?! And the best thing to do on the best day is to fast.  Despite this, the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> prohibited fasting on Fridays – even though it is an excellent day.  So this indicates that no worship occurs for any time or place except that which is legislated and if it is not legislated, then it is not done, since the last of this <em>Ummah</em>cannot bring guidance better than what the first of this <em>Ummah</em>brought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this door to unlegislated worship were opened then people would come and say: the day the Messenger migrated to Madeenah was the day Allaah honoured Islaam, so there should be a gathering and worship should be performed!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Others will say: the night on which the Messenger was taken on the night journey he received honour that cannot be valued!  Then worship would be innovated on that night…..so, they would not stop at this.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And good – all of it – is in following the Salaf as-Salih; whom Allaah chose for Himself, so whatever they did we do and whatever they left we leave.[3]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So if this is understood, then gathering on that night is not required by the <em>Sharia’</em> rather it is commanded to leave it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’ p.14</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Following the Salaf</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   ‘Allaama Ibn al-Haaj who died in (737 A.H.) said in the book ‘al-Madkhal’ (2/11-12) – clarifying the ruling of performing al-Mawlid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘….that it is an addition to the <em>Deen</em> and is not from the actions of the Salaf of the past.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Following the Salaf takes precedence – rather it is more obligatory than intending increase to the <em>Deen</em> by opposing that what they were upon – because they were the greatest of the people in following the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and in proclaiming greatness for him and his Sunnah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</em>  The Salaf have the superiority and excellence of haste to the Sunnah and it is not narrated from anyone of them that the Messenger suggested observing the <em>Mawlid</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">We follow the Salaf; so what was permissible for them is what is permissible for us, and it is known that following them should be in following their sources and their pathways to watering holes.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’  p.16</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Hafidh Abu Fadl bin Hajr al-Asqalani who died in the year (852 A.H.) said in his <em>Fatawa</em> about celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘The origin of celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em> is a Bida’.  It has not been conveyed from anyone from the Salaf as-Salih of the first three generations.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Hasan al-maqasid fee Amal al-Mawlid’ by Suyootee. &amp; From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.444</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   As-Sakhawi said in his <em>Fatawa</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Celebrating the noble <em>Mawlid</em> has not been conveyed from anyone of the Salaf as-Salih from the first three excellent generations, rather it was invented after them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘Subal al-Huda wa Rashad Fee Seerat Khair al-Abaad’ by Muhammad bin Yusuf Salih p.439 &amp; From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.444</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Not From the Way of the Arabs</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   As-Sayyid ‘Alee Fikri who died in the year (1372 A.H.) in the sixteenth lecture of the book ‘al-Muhadaraat al-Fikreeyah’ (p.128):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘It was not from the ways of the Arabs that they would celebrate the date of birth of anyone from amongst them and it was not the way of the Muslims – in the times that have preceded.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is mentioned in the books of history – and in other books – that the practice of celebrating the <em>Mawlid</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is from the innovated ways.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’  p.17</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   The ‘Allaama ash-Shaykh Abdul Lateef bin Abdur Rahman bin Hasan bin Imaam Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab said explaining the <em>Da’wah</em> of Imaam Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Muhammad bin AbdulWahhab criticized what the people were doing in that and other countries, from proclaiming the greatness of the <em>Mawlid</em> and the Eid celebrations of <em>Jahileeyah</em> for which there was no revealed authority raising its status and for which there was no<em>Sharia’</em> evidence or proof; because in those celebrations and in their time and place is resemblance of the misguided Christians’ Eid celebrations and it is falsehood and rejected in the <em>Sharia’</em> of the leader of the Messengers.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Taken from ‘Majmoo’ ar-Risail wal-Masail an-Najdeeyah’ Vol.4 p.440 &amp; ‘Durrar as-Saneeyah’ Vol.4 p.409 &amp; From: ‘Rasil fee Hukm al-Ihteefal bil-Mawlid an-Nabawi’ Vol.2 p.438</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The best of generations and the best of the people of knowledge did not </strong>celebrate the<strong> <em>Mawlid</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   Shaykh Zuhair ad-Deen Jafar at-Tazmantee who died in the year (682 A.H.) said clarifying the ruling of Mawlid:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This action was not performed by the Salaf as-Salih in the early period, even though they revered the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>greatly, those whose love for him was so great that if you were togather our love for him, it would not reach the amount of love of even one of them for him, not even a fraction of it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In this is a principle which is free from a need for elaboration and it is not in need of any form of evidence, since the Salaf were more knowledgeable and more pious, nobler and more guided.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’ p.18</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">o   The Imam Ibn Katheer ad-Damishqi ash-Shaafia’e who died in the year (774A.H.) said in his ‘Tafseer’ (13/12)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Explaining the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And those who disbelieve (strong and wealthy) say of those who believe (weak and poor): ‘Had it been a good thing, they (weak and poor) would not have preceded us thereto!’ &gt;&gt; [al-Ahqaaf: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Which means that they – the unbelievers – said about those who believed in the Qur’aan, ‘that if the Qur’aan was good then they would not have preceded us to it;’ meaning by this Bilaal, ‘Ammar, Suhaib, Khabbab – and their likes, their peers from the weak, the male-slaves and female slaves.  That was only because they believed, with regard to themselves that they had a high rank with Allaah and that He had concern for them!!  But they were mistaken, horrendously mistaken!  They clearly erred!!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Just as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Thus We have tried some of them with others, that they might say: ‘Is it these (poor believers) that Allaah has favoured from amongst us?’ &gt;&gt; [An’aam: 53]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: they are amazed; ‘How were these people guided and not us?!’  That is why the disbelievers said: &lt;&lt; ‘Had it been a good thing, they (theweak and poor) would not have preceded us thereto!’&gt;&gt; [al-Ahqaaf: 11]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jamaah they say about every action and statement – which is not proven from the Companions – that it is a Bida’, since if it was good they would have preceded us to it, because they did not leave anything of the qualities of good except that they hastened to it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Principles of Loving according to the <em>Sharia’</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The claim of those who celebrate <em>Mawlid</em> is that they do it due to the love of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>-.  This is a false claim since the evidence for love is to follow and not to go beyond limits in matters just as Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me &gt;&gt; [Al-Imraan: 31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah – Subhanahu – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So stand (ask Allaah to make) firm and straight (on the religion of Islaamic Monotheism) as you are commanded and those who turn in repentance (unto Allaah) with you, and transgress not. Verily, He is All-Seer of what you do.  &gt;&gt; [Hud: 112]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imaam Ibn Katheer said in his ‘Tafseer’ (1/358) explaining the first<em>Ayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘This <em>Ayah</em> is a ruling upon everyone who claims the love of Allaah – while he is not upon the way of the Prophet –that he is a liar in his claim unless he follows the legislation of Muhammad and the Prophetic religion in all his sayings and actions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As is established in ‘the Saheeh’ on the authority of the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> that he said: ‘Whoever does an action which we have not commanded then it will be rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is why Allaah said &lt;&lt;Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me&gt;&gt; [Al-Imraan: 31] which means: you achieve more than what you request due to your love for Him, which is Him loving you, which is greater than the former.  Also, as some of the scholars and wise-people said: ‘The issue is not whether you love Him; rather the issue is whether you are loved.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan al-Basri and others from amongst the Salaf have said: ‘A people claimed that they loved Allaah; so Allaah tried them with this<em>Aayah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.  And Allaah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.’&gt;&gt;[Al-Imraan: 31]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Qadi ‘Ayyaad mentioned in ‘Shifaa bi Haqqooq al-Mustafaa’ (2/24): ‘Know that whoever loves something then he follows it and he follows that which it agrees upon otherwise he will not be truthful in his love and will be a mere claimant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the one who is truthful in his love for the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is the one who makes those signs outwardly manifest; the first of which is taking the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> as an example, implementing his Sunnah, following his sayings and actions, fulfilling his commands, keeping away from what he prohibited and to follow his character in ease and hardship and in times of strength and weakness.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The proof for this is Allaah’s -Ta’ala – saying: &lt;&lt;Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you&gt;&gt; i.e. following what Allaah legislated above his own desires making his desires in agreement with it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala- said: &lt;&lt; and they have no jealousy in their hearts for that which they have been given (from the booty of Banî An-Nadîr), and give them (the emigrants) preference over themselves, even though they were in need of that. &gt;&gt; [Hashr : 9]’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">From: ‘al-Hukm al-Haqq fee al-Hihteefal biMawlid sayyid al-Khalq’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All Praise belongs to Allaah, may His peace</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and blessings be upon our final</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Prophet Muhammad, his</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">family, his companions</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and all those who</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">follow his</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[1] Imaam Ibn Katheer mentioned his biography in ‘al-Bidaayah wan-Nihaayah’ (18/370): ‘Shaykh, al-Imaam, possessor of skills…..distinguished &amp; advanced in the knowledge of Arabic grammar –  &amp; other sciences – …’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Farhoon al-Malikee said in ‘ad-Deebaaj al-Madhab’ (2/80): ‘He was a scholar, respected, had many skills in hadeeth, Fiqh, al-Usool, Arabic, literature….’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[2] Ustadh Muhammad bin Muhammad Makhloof mentioned in his biography in the book ‘Shajaratul noor az-Zakeeyah’ : (1/247) saying: ‘He was the Imaam of Garnaatah (a city in Andalus) he was its Muhaddith, its Mufti… he was a Faqihi, scholar, a righteous exemplary…’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[3]Here we can say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every good is in the following of the Salaf * and every evil is in the innovations of the Khalaf</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The transliteration of which is: ‘Kullu khairin fee ittiba’ man Salaf * wa Kullu Sharrin fee Ibtida’ man Khallaf’ (T.N.)</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;">By Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah-<br>
</em>From his book  ‘Madarij as-Salikeen’</span><br>
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh ul –Islaam Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyyah as-Salafi <em>-Rahimullaah- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>‘</strong>Allaah’s slave cannot implement &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt; except with two great principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of which is following the Messenger &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second is <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) for the One worshipped.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is then implementing &lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The people are divided into four categories in relation to these two principles.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first of which is the people who have <em>Ikhlaas</em> for the One worshipped and for following the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>. They are, in reality, the people of &lt;&lt; You (Alone) we worship&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So all their actions are for Allaah, their sayings are for Allaah, their giving and their prohibiting are for Allaah, their loving is for Allaah and their hating is for Allaah.  Their apparent dealings and hidden dealings are for Allaah’s Face Alone.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They do not want reward from the people for this or thanks, nor do they desire position with them, nor do they request praise or status in their hearts or escape from their criticisms.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather they hold the people at the same status as those who are in graves. They do not possess any harm or benefit for them, neither life or death, nor the Day of Resurrection.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, action done for the sake of the people, desiring refuge and status among them and hoping for harm and benefit from them, never emanates from the one who knows the people, but rather itemanates from the one who is ignorant of their affairs and one who is ignorant of his Lord.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who knows the people places them according to their status.  So whoever knows Allaah, then he makes his actions and sayings sincerely for Allaah, he obeys Him and prohibits for Him,loves for Him and hates for Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A person does not deal with any thing from the creation, to the exclusion of Allaah, except due to his ignorance of Allaah and his ignorance of the creation.  Otherwise, if he knew Allaah and knew the people, he would prefer his dealing with Allaah to his dealing with the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Likewise, all his actions and worship should be in agreement with the command of Allaah and with what Allaah loves and is pleased with.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are the only actions which Allaah accepts from the one who performs them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Due to this, He tries His worshippers with life and death.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah –Ta’ala – said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Who has created death and life, that He may test you which of you is best in deed. &gt;&gt; [Mulk: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He made whatever is on the earth as beautification for it so He could test which of them is the best in action.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Fudayl bin ‘Aayaad said: ‘A good action is one that is sincere and correct.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘O Abu ‘Alee which one is sincere and correct?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He answered: ‘If the action is sincere but is not correct, then it will not be accepted and if it is correct but not sincere it will not be accepted, until it is sincere and correct.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Khaalis</em> (sincere) is that which is for Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em>Sawaab</em> (correct) is that which is according to the Sunnah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is what is mentioned in the saying of Allaah <em>–Ta’ala-</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; So whoever hopes for the Meeting with his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his Lord.’  &gt;&gt; [Khaf: 110]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And who can be better in religion than one who submits his face (himself) to Allaah (i.e. follows Allaah’s Religion of Islaamic Monotheism); and he is a good-doer. &gt;&gt; [Nisa: 125]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So Allaah does not accept actions except those that are sincerely for His Face, following His command. Anything other than these are rejected and returned to the one who performs them– even though he is in a great need of their being accepted – them being scattered in all directions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Saheeh, from the hadeeth of ‘Aeysha, on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘Every action which we have not commanded then it is rejected.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Every action without a precedent does not increase the one performing it except in distance from Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah <em>–Ta’ala –</em> is surely worshipped according to His commands and not by opinions and desires.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The second category is the one who neither has <em>Ikhlaas</em> nor does he follow.  His action is then not in accordance with the <em>Sharia’</em> nor is it sincerely for the one worshipped, such as actions which are beautified for the people, those who show off hypocritically by other than what Allaah and His Messenger legislated.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These people are the most evil of creation, they are the most hated to Allaah <em>–Azza wa Jal</em>.  They have a greater share in the saying of Allaah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Think not that those who rejoice in what they have done (or brought about), and love to be praised for what they have not done,- think not you that they are rescued from the torment, and for them is a painful torment.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[aal-Imraan:188]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They rejoice in what they have been given of <em>Bida’</em>, misguidance and<em>Shirk</em> and they love being praised for falsely following the Sunnah and <em>Ikhlaas</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are many of this type – from those who ascribe themselves to knowledge, poverty and worship – from those who deviated away from the <em>Sirat al-Mustaqeem</em> (straight way).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed they perform <em>Bida’</em> and misguidance, they show off – boasting about their actions, loving to be praised for that which they have not done of <em>Ittiba</em> (following the Messenger), <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) and<em> Ilm</em> (knowledge). They are the people who have Allaah’s Anger upon them and are the people of misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The third category is he who is sincere in his actions, however he is not upon path of following the command, just like the ignorant worshippers and those who ascribe themselves to paths of <em>Zuhud</em>and poverty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Everyone who worships Allaah without following Allaah’s command, believing that his act of worship is a form of drawing closer to Allaah, then his condition is like this.  Such as the one who thinks that listening to whistling and the clapping of hands is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or that being in isolation – which necessitates leaving the <em>Jummah</em> prayer and the congregational prayer – is a form of drawing closer to Allaah.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Or the one who thinks that continuous fasting, day and night, is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or fasting the day which all the people refrain from fasting is a form of drawing closer to Allaah or other similar examples.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth category is when his actions follow Allaah’s command, but they are for other than Allaah, such as obedience to those who hypocritically show off or like a man who fights to show off, or fanatically or for bravery or performs <em>Hajj</em> so it can be said that he performs <em>Hajj</em> or reads Qur’aan so it can be said that he recites Qur’aan.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Outwardly, the actions of these people are righteous actions which have been commanded, however they are not righteous and so they will not be accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allaah, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him), and perform prayer and give the <em>Zakaat</em>: and that is the right religion &gt;&gt;[al-Bayyinah: 5]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So everyone has been ordered not to worship other than Allaah except by what He has commanded, having <em>Ikhlaas</em> for Him in worship and these are the people of</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything) &gt;&gt;’</p>

		<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#666699;">Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’ </span><br>
<span style="color:#666699;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br>
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 1095 – From Abu Rashid al-Hubraani who said: Abu Umama al-Bahili took me by the hand and said: the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> took me by my hand and said to me: ‘O Abu Umama! Indeed from the believers are those who soften (with love) their hearts towards me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ahmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And the meaning of ‘soften their hearts towards me’ is that they are gentle and incline towards me with love and affection and Allaah knows best.  And this cannot be achieved except with <em>Ikhlaas</em> (sincerity) and following the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> more than any other human being, because Allaah Ta’ala singled that out as an evidence to prove that a person really loves Allaah –Azza wa Jal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said: &lt;&lt;Say (O Muhammad): ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you and forgive you of your sins.&gt;&gt; [Aal’Imraan:31]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Is it not about time that those who claim to love the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> in their speech and their <em>an-Nasheed</em> (songs), that they return to adhere to the true love which will lead to the love of Allaah Ta’ala, so that they will not be from those whom, the poet said:<br>
تعصي الإله َ وأنتَ تـُظهرُ حـُـبـَّه ُ *** هذا لـَعـَمْرُكَ في القياس ِ بديع ُ<br>
لو كانَ حـُبـُّكَ صادقا ً لأطعتـــَـــه ُ *** إنَّ المـُحـِبَّ لمنْ يُحـِبُّ مـُطيع ُ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You disobey your Lord and present your love *** I swear that this action is innovative</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If your love was truthful you would have obeyed Him *** Indeed the one who loves is obedient to the one whom he loves</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#666699;">By The Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’ Muhammad Nasiruddeen al-Albaani </span><br>
<span style="color:#666699;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The following is a summary of what the Shaykh al-Albaani (d. 1420 A.H.) said in the introduction to a book entitled ‘<em>Bidaytus – Sooli Fee Tafdeel Rasool </em><em>-salAllaahu ‘alaihi wassalam</em><em> as-Sharraffa w­­a Karrama</em>’:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I firmly believe that it is upon every Muslim who is sincere in his Islaam, to familiarize himself abundantly with a good amount of manners, which Allaah has honoured His Prophet with, in addition to the virtues that Allaah placed upon the Prophet in order for him to excel above all the worlds, from the Jinn and all of mankind altogether, rather even above those Angels who are close to Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This familiarization can be attained through the established evidences from the Book and the Sunnah, researching them and having the correct understanding of them, because indeed that is what will, – without any doubt – increase the Muslim in <em>Eemaan</em>, and sincere love for the Prophet  <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Love for the Prophet  <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em> which is a primary principle that becomes firm in the heart of the believer is also connected to the love of Allaah<em>Ta’ala</em>, Who out of His Excellence sent us His Messenger, and blessed us – and Allaah Posses all blessings – with the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Tabarak</em> <em>wa</em> <em>Ta’ala</em> said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and <em>Al-Hikmah</em> (<em>As-Sunnah</em>). And verily, they had been before in manifest error &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is why the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘There are three characteristics, whoever has them finds the sweetness of <em>Eemaan</em>: that Allaah and His Messenger are more beloved to him than other than them; that when he loves a person he loves him only for Allaah’s sake and that he hates to return to disbelief after Allaah has saved him from it just as he hates to be thrown into the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this love continues to rise in his heart until the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, becomes more beloved to him, more beloved than every respected person he knows.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘None of you truly believes until I am more beloved to him than his son, his father and all mankind.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Know O brother Muslim, that it is not possible for anyone to rise to this level of love for Allaah and His Messenger except with the <em>Tawheed</em> of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> in His worship Alone [rather than to any other than Him].  And singling out the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, by following him from amongst Allaah’s slaves, due to the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He who obeys the Messenger, has indeed obeyed Allaah &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Say: ‘If you (really) love Allaah then follow me, Allaah will love you&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘No, by Him in Whose Hand is my soul, even if Moosa was alive today he would have no recourse except to follow me.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Albaani) say:  so if it is not granted even for the likes of Moosa whom Allaah spoke to, to follow other than the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, then would it be granted for anyone other than Moosa?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is from the unequivocal/absolute proofs of the obligation of singularly following the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>.  It is from the necessities of the testimony of ‘Muhammad is the Messenger of Allaah.’ And this is why Allaah <em>Tabarak wa Ta’ala</em>stated it in the preceding Ayah, that following the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>alone is a proof of Allaah loving a person. And there is no doubt that whoever is loved by Allaah, then Allaah will be with him in all that he does, as is mentioned in the authentic <em>hadeeth</em> <em>al</em>&#8211;<em>Qudsi</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘And My slave does not come closer to Me except with that which is more beloved to Me than what I have made obligatory upon him, My slave continues to come closer to Me with the optional deeds until I love him, if I love him I will be his hearing with which he hears, and the sight with which he sees, and his hand with which he grips and the leg with which he walks, and if he asks Me I will definitely give it, and if he seeks refuge then I will definitely give him sanctuary . . ..  ’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If this is the divine concern that Allaah has for his beloved slave, then it is obligatory upon every Muslim to take those means which make him more beloved to Allaah. And this is done by no other way than singularly following the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; as opposed to anyone else. Only by doing this alone will one be granted the special concern from ones Master [Allaah] <em>– Tabaarak wa Ta’ala –</em>do you not see that there is no path to knowing that which is obligatory and distinguishing that from optional worship except by following the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>alone?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt, that when a Muslim becomes more knowledgeable about the biography of the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, and knows more of his beautiful qualities and his excellence, then his love for the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>&#8211; would be more, and thus his following of him <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>would be more extensive and more comprehensive.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What drove me to research and distribute this blessed booklet was for me to help my Muslim brothers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In reality my only goal in this life, after fulfilling the obligatory rights that Allaah has upon me, is to familiarize the Muslims through educating, lecturing and writing about the authentic <em>Seerah</em> of the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>, from all its different angles according to my capability. And to encourage them to take the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>as the only example to be followed, just as Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em>encouraged them in doing so, in His saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed in the Messenger of Allaah you have a good example to follow for him who hopes in (the Meeting with) Allaah and the Last Day and remembers Allaah much. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">and therein lies their happiness in the <em>Dunyaa</em> and the Hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last piece of work that I worked on was about a year ago (1401 A.H.) when I summarized the book ‘<em>Shammail al-Muhammadeeyah</em>’ by <em>Imam</em> Tirmidhi.  I distinguished between the hadeeth being <em>Saheeh</em> and <em>Da’eef</em> by commenting upon them, this was while I was staying in my new place of migration ‘Amman’ [capital of Jordan], during a time of afflictions that interrupted me, simultaneously I was preoccupied with buying land and building my home.  After staying there for a few months, an event caused disruption resulting in my leaving my home and my family and travelling to the first place I migrated to: ‘Damascus’ where I went back and stayed for two days, and then from there to Lebanon in spite of a lot of turmoil and chaos making it a difficult place to reach.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Shaykh continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed I then preceded to complete this book [<em>‘Bidaytus &#8211; Sooli Fee Tafdeel Rasool</em> <em>-salAllaahu ‘alaihi wassalam</em> <em>as-Sharraffa wa Karrama’</em>] despite great problems during this work, and with very upsetting news which caused me much pain, namely the death of my elder brother Muhammad Naajee Abu Ahmad during the season of Hajj, I continued completing this book whilst seeking mercy for my brother, being patient upon this affliction, due to his death. He was the best of my brothers and was the most sincere towards me, and the strongest from amongst them in response to my <em>Dawa</em>’ and he held a great concern for it. He was enthusiastic in calling to the <em>Dawa</em>’ may Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> bestow his abundant mercy upon him.  We were patient, my brothers and his children and his grandchildren and his in-laws with this affliction. May Allaah grant them someone good as he was a good predecessor for them, may Allaah gather us all with him under the banner of the master/leader of the son of Adam, Muhammad <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>&lt;&lt;The Day when there will not benefit [anyone] wealth or children But only one who comes to Allah with a sound heart.&gt;&gt; [26:88-89] and indeed we belong to Allaah and indeed to him is our return.  O Allaah reward me for my affliction and compensate it for me with better than that. O Allaah forgive Abu Ahmad and raise his rank amongst those who were guided to Islaam to the best of creation (the Prophet), and place someone to look after those still alive after him, and forgive us and him O Lord of all the worlds, and make his grave spacious for him, and make light in there for him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed I have digressed a lot from what we were dealing with. Everything that happens to humans is protection under the Will of Allaah and His Compassion, so we return to what we were discussing, so I say:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">If you can comprehend that which has preceded in that <strong>Allaah’s Love cannot be attained except by following His Prophet, you should therefore be concerned with following his Sunnah</strong>, and one should spend in that cause, strive with oneself completely. He should not be deceived by that which some of the deceived, misguided people are upon, from amongst the <em>Soofeeyah</em> and frivolous people, those who have taken their religion to be play and amusement, with <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> (songs) and tunes. <strong>By which they claim that they please Muhammad </strong><strong><em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em></strong>with that which they call ‘religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>’ and they play them constantly for their<em>Dhikr</em> (meetings for remembrance of Allaah) and in their gatherings, which they organize on innovated Eids like the <em>Eid</em> of <em>Mawlid</em> (celebrating the Prophet’s birth) etc.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed they are –and I swear by Allaah– clearly misguided, and are deviated from the truth.  How can they not be in clear misguidance since they have mixed up the <em>Deen</em>with false amusements, and they have blindly copied shameless singers, with their rhythmical musical tunes, <strong>and they adhere to this in their <em>Soofi</em> paths which kill the hearts</strong>, and divert them from the remembrance of Allaah and the recitation of the Qur’aan.  The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘He is not from us who does not recite the Qur’aan in a beautiful way.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this is especially because they add singing to musical instruments and clapping thus completing the resemblance between the two different groups. That is then broadcasted by some foreign radio stations, not only the Arab radio stations. Trying to please the people in the name of <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrance of Allaah) or religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>!  And regretfully some of the religious radio stations have began to follow their footsteps for which Allaah’s aid is sought.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has even reached me that some of the visual broadcasters (Television) have presented some of these <em>Dhikr</em> (remembrances of Allaah) or religious <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em>, as if it is from Islaam, and that it is from the characteristics of sincerity in which Muslims call to.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I will never forget, once a long time ago I visited a centre from some of the Islaamic organizations, and I was shocked to hear the sound of the <em>Adhaan</em> chanted with musical instruments!  So I questioned them regarding it?  It was said:  ‘It is some Muslim youth from some Arab countries who have come as guests to this organization, and one of them lets them hear the <em>Adhaan</em> with a musical chant,’ and now this is what we hear from many of the Islaamic radio stations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was finally brought to the attention of some Muslim youth, concerning that which those <em>an-Nasheed</em> contain of evil and deviancy opposing the Islaamic <em>Sharia’</em>, so they modified it to a different type of <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> which talked about enthusiasm, strength and reminders of Islaamic heroism, and they would also adhere to some musical chanting and some of them have even added some musical instruments like the <em>Duff</em>(Arabic drum) etc. to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed, I heard it, with my own ears in some music stores, something of the like, so I spoke with them, due to that which is obligatory in the <em>Deen</em> by way of advising them and reminding them that it is not allowed, especially since many of them have begun listening to <em>an</em>&#8211;<em>Nasheed</em> as a habit, and it has busied them from reciting Qur’aan or listening to it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All of this is from the evil of the deviancy of keeping away from the <em>Salaf</em>, indeed I am certain that this was not from their practice, even though they used to sometimes recite poetry in wars and battles. This practice is one thing and taking that and applying to it a musical chant and making it a habit and resembling the practice of the people of evil and mere amusements, then that is something else, and it is not hidden from the people of knowledge and insight.  May Allaah have mercy upon the one who said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Every good is in the following of the <em>Salaf</em> * and every evil is in the innovations of the <em>Khalaf</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In summary: Indeed I advise everyone who reads this book, that they do not suffice with the knowledge in it but follow that up with hopeful consequences which is to sincerely follow this great Messenger, which necessitates the love of Allaah, and His Forgiveness for ones sin, &lt;&lt;and this is the great success&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘We ask Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> that He makes us from them.’</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">The Consequence of the One who Does not Believe in the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;<br>
</em>Taken from ‘Silsilah Ahadeeth As-Saheehah’</span><br>
<span style="color:#008000;">By the <em>Muhaddith, Shaykh, Allamaa’  </em>Muhammad Nasir uddeen al-Albaani</span><br>
<span style="color:#008000;">Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 157 – From Abu Hurairah from the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘By Him in whose Hand is my soul; there is not a person who hears about me from this<em>Ummah</em>, not a Jew, nor a Christian, then does not believe in me, except that he will be from the people of the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Ibn Munda in ‘Tawheed’ and Muslim in his Saheeh, likewise Abu ‘Awaanah and Ahmad]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘The hadeeth is clear in that whoever hears about the Prophet  <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and what he was sent with, and then it reaches that person in the way that Allaah revealed it to the Messenger  <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, and does not believe in the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> then his path is to the Hell-Fire.  There is no difference in this between a Jew, or a Christian, or a fire-worshipper, and the atheist.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">My belief is that if many of the non-Muslims were granted the opportunity to become acquainted with the principles, beliefs and worship that Islaam came with, then they would hasten to enter into Islaam in crowds, as it occurred in the beginning of Islaam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">If only some of the Islaamic countries would send callers to the western countries, from those who have knowledge of Islaam and know its reality, and that they know what has attached itself to Islaam from superstitions, <em>Bida’</em> (innovations) and lies. So that the one who calls to Islaam will be able to present it in a good manner to those he is calling, and this requires the caller to have knowledge of the Book and the authentic Sunnah, and he knows some of the common foreign languages. This is a matter which is honourable and it is something nearly lost.  So this issue requires keen preparation, so perhaps they will begin this preparation.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Taken from Silsilah Ahadeeth as-Saheehah  by Shaykh al-Albaani (vol 1/157)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No. 3093 From Sa’eed bin Jubair <em>Mursal</em> that the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘There is no-one who hears about me from this <em>Ummah</em>, not a Jew, nor a Christian, then does not believe in me, except that he will be from the people of the Hell-Fire.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Sa’eed bin Jubair said: ‘I began to say: Where is the confirmation of that in the Book of Allaah?!’ Sa’eed continued: ‘It was very rare that I heard a hadeeth from the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> except that I found a confirmation for that in the Qur’aan; until I found this <em>Ayaah</em>: &lt;&lt; وَمَنْ يَكْفُرْ بِهِ مِنَ الْأَحْزَابِ فَالنَّارُ مَوْعِدُهُ &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;but those of the sects (Jews, Christians and all the other non-Muslim nations) that reject it (the Qur’aan), the Fire will be their promised meeting-place &gt;&gt; includes all the different nations.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[Collected by Tabari]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Shaykh Albaani said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">‘It is possible to include this hadeeth to be from what is a clarification and explanation of the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&lt; وَمَا كُنَّا مُعَذِّبِينَ حَتَّى نَبْعَثَ رَسُولًا &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger (to give warning).&gt;&gt; along with the point where the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>said: ‘hears of me’ i.e. that he hears about the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> upon reality as a human, a Messenger, a Prophet.  So whoever hears about the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>upon other than what he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>was upon, other than what he <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>was upon from guidance, light and excellent manners; due to some of the ignorant Muslims, or the misguided callers from the Christian evangelists and atheists, who present the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>to their people in other than his real way that he was well known for.  So the likes of these people have not heard of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>, and the<em>Dawa</em> has not reached them, so the warning mentioned in the hadeeth does not include them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">And this is like the saying of the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>: ‘Whoever sees me in his sleep then it is as if he sees me in his wakeful state, since indeed Shaytaan cannot resemble me.’ [Silsilah Saheeh No.1004]  i.e. sees him in this real form and his characteristics which he was upon in his lifetime.  So whoever really claims that he saw an old Shaykh with a white beard, then he has not seen the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em>; because this characteristic opposes that which the Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211; </em>was upon, from that which is known from his characteristics <em>SallAllaahu Ta’ala alayhi wa Alahi wa sallam</em>.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;">Compiled by   The Eminent Shaykh, the Muhaddith Rabee’ ibn Haadee al-Madkhalee</span><br>
<span style="color:#993300;"> Translated by Abbas Abu Yahya</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">All praise belongs to Allaah and peace and prayers be upon the Messenger of Allaah and upon his family and his companions and all those who follow his guidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To Proceed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a lecture explaining the status of the Messenger of Allaah and his rights upon this <em>Ummah</em>, which is the <em>Ummah</em> of those who have accepted Islaam and of those who are called to Islaam, from the <em>Jinn</em>and mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Indeed the noble Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – has a great status, and a very high position which none from the creation can reach, since he is the leader of the sons of Adam on the Day of Judgment.  Adam and whoever came after him is under the Messenger’s flag- sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was given the great intercession which the other great Messengers excused themselves from.  This great intercession that Allaah chose especially for him and preferred it for him above all the worlds.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Without doubt, his Lord <em>Azza wa Jaal</em> honored him and favoured him with abundant miracles which Allaah never gave to the other Prophets &#8211; Alayhim as-Sallam- and yet Allaah has given all of them high positions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: ” I was preferred over the other Prophets with six things: I was given eloquent speech, victory by frightening the enemy, the war-booty was made permissible for me, the earth was made as a means of purification and a place of worship, I was sent to all of creation and Prophet hood was completed with me.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh Muslim (523)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for the <em>hadeeth</em> of Jaabbir: ” … and I was given the right of intercession.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukharee (328) and Muslim (521)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said, in clarifying the status of the Messenger of Allaah and explaining his noble characteristics:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves. It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty, he is anxious over you.  For the believers he is full of pity, kind, and merciful. &gt;&gt; [at-Tauba: 128]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Indeed Allaah conferred a great favour on the believers when He sent among them a Messenger from among themselves, reciting unto them His Verses (the Qur’aan), and purifying them, and instructing them in the Book  and <em>Al­-Hikmah</em>, whilst before that they had been in manifest error.&gt;&gt; [Aal-Imraan: 164]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; He it is Who sent among the unlettered ones a Messenger from among themselves, reciting to them His Verses, purifying them, and teaching them the Book and <em>Al-Hikmah</em>.  And verily, they had been before in manifest error&gt;&gt; [Jummah: 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; O Prophet! Verily, We have sent you as a witness, a bearer of glad tidings and a warner.  As one who invites to Allaah, by His permission, and as a lamp spreading light.  Announce to the believers the glad tidings that they will have from Allaah, a Great Bounty.  And obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites and harm them not.  And put your trust in Allaah, Sufficient is Allaah as a<em>Wakeel</em> (Trustee, or Disposer of affairs). &gt;&gt; [Ahzaab: 45-48]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said, praising the Messenger and mentioning him and his status with Allaah and His blessings upon him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Have We not opened your chest (heart) for you? And removed from you your burden, which weighed down your back? And raised high your fame?&gt;&gt; [ash-Sharh: 1-4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Abbas said: ‘Exposed him to the light of Islaam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl said: ‘With the light of Islaam.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Al-Hasan said: ‘He filled him with wisdom and knowledge and He removed from you your burden which weighed down on your back.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Imam as-Sa’adee -May Allaah have mercy upon him – said: “We will enrich him due to the legislations of the <em>Deen</em> and the <em>Da’wah </em>to Allaah, characterize him with noble manners and made him concerned with the hereafter and the ease of doing good actions, so he was not constrained nor oppressed &lt;&lt; And removed from you your burden, Which weighed down your back? &gt;&gt;  And We removed from you your burden which weighed down heavy on your back is like the saying of Allaah Ta’ala: &lt;&lt; That Allaah may forgive you your sins of the past and the future, and complete His Favour on you, and guide you on the Straight Path &gt;&gt; [al-Fath : 2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And raised high your fame? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">That we have raised your rank and we have made for you good high praise which none from the creation can reach.  So, Allaah is not mentioned except that His Messenger Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – is mentioned along with Him, like when entering into Islaam, also in the call to the prayer, the <em>Iqama</em> (the call at the time of standing for the obligatory prayer), in sermons and many other places where Allaah raises the mention of His Messenger Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.  His <em>Ummah</em> has love in their hearts for him and a highly regarded place, with splendour which no one other than him can have, which comes second to loving Allaah Ta’ala.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, may Allaah reward him, on behalf of his <em>Ummah,</em> the best of what a Prophet can be rewarded with, on behalf of his <em>Ummah</em>.”  See ‘Tafseer as-Sa’adee’ for this <em>Soorah</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah swears with the Messenger’s great rank and He says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; Verily, by your life, in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly. &gt;&gt; [al-Hijr: 72]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer -May Allaah have mercy upon him – said: ‘Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> swears with the life of His Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam, and this is a great honour, a lofty station and befitting glory.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Umar bin Maalik an-Nakree said on the authority of Abu Jooza’ on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas that he said: Allaah did not create anything, nor exempted anyone, more noble to Him than Muhammad &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – and I have never heard that Allaah swears with the life of anyone other than the Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says: &lt;&lt;Verily, by your life, in their wild intoxication, they were wandering blindly.&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He says ‘by your life, by your life span, by your stay in the world, indeed in their wild intoxication they are blinded, i.e. that they play around.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration on the authority of Ibn Abbas: they are confused.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said, owing to His concern over His Messenger and His protecting him and honouring him:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; By the forenoon (after sun-rise); And by the night when it is still (or darkens); Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hated you.And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present (life of this world).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And verily, your Lord will give you (all i.e. good) so that you shall be well-pleased.  Did He not find you an orphan and give you refuge? And He found you unaware and guided you?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And He found you poor, and made you rich (self-sufficient with self-contentment, etc.)?  Therefore, treat not the orphan with oppression, repulse not the beggar and proclaim the Grace of your Lord (i.e. the Prophethood and all other Graces).  &gt; &gt; [Soorah Dhuh]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said: Imaam Ahmad said: Abu Na’eem narrated to us that Sufyaan narrated to us on the authority of al-Aswaad bin Qayees that, I heard Jundub saying: The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – fell ill, so due to this he did not stand for the prayer for one or two nights.  Then, a woman came and said: O Muhammad, I do not see you except that your shaytaan has left you. [She said this meaning that he was not on guidance] so Allaah revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; By the forenoon (after sun-rise); and by the night when it is still (or darkens); Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hated you&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer said: What was narrated by Bukharee and Muslim and Tirmidhee and Nisaa’ee from the way of al-Aswaad bin Qayees on the authority of Jundub bin Abdullaah al-Bajalee, then al’Alqee narrated with his narration, and also in the narration of Sufyaan bin ‘Uaynah on the authority of al-Aswaad bin Qayees, who heard Jundub say: Jibraeel delayed in coming to the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – so the <em>Mushrikoon</em> said Muhammad’s Lord has forsaken him, then Allaah Ta’ala revealed:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; By the forenoon (after sun-rise); and by the night when it is still (or darkens); Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hated you. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Katheer continues:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is an oath from Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> where He swears by the forenoon (after sunrise) and of what He made in it of light.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And by the night when it is still (or darkens)&gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means it has become peaceful and dark -this was stated by Mujhaid, Qatadah and ad-Dhihaak and by other than them.  This is proof of the capability of the Creator.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Regarding the saying of Allaah Ta’ala:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;Your Lord has neither forsaken you &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: Allaah did not leave the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And : &lt;&lt; nor hated you. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: Allaah does not hate the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present (life of this world). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: ‘the place in the hereafter is better for you than this place.’  This is why the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –was the one who abstained the most from this <em>duniya</em> from amongst the people and he was the one who rejected it the most out of the people, as is well-known [ by necessity ] from his biography.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So, when he was given the choice, at the end of his life, between staying in this <em>duniya</em> until its end and then entering into Paradise, or proceeding to Allaah <em>Azza wa Jal,</em> he chose what was with Allaah over this despicable, lowly <em>Duniya</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – said: ‘I have no want of this earth.  Indeed my example and the example of this world, is like a rider who takes a nap under a tree, then he leaves that place and moves on.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And verily, your Lord will give you (all good) so that you shall be well-pleased.  &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: (i.e. pleased) with what Allaah has prepared for him in the hereafter of the gardens of Paradise and great blessings, seeing his Lord and the lake, the intercession and the rest of what Allaah has honoured him with in the hereafter.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then, Allaah mentions what He granted him of blessings.  Allaah protected him when he was an orphan and sheltered him until He chose him for His message.  He revealed the Book and the Wisdom to Him and taught him that which he did not know and what Allaah bestowed upon him was great.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Qadi ‘Aayaad -may Allaah have mercy upon him &#8211; said in his book ‘ash-Shifaa bi-Taareef Haqooq al-Mustafa’:   ‘This <em>Soorah</em> contains what Allaah honoured the Messenger with, praising him and Allaah exalting him, in six ways:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">1- Allaah took an oath for him, regarding what Allaah had informed him about, in His Ta’ala saying:&lt;&lt; By the forenoon (after sun-rise); And by the night when it is still (or darkens);  &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: ‘I swear by the Lord of the forenoon (after sunrise)’, – this is from the greatest degrees of support.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">2- An illustration of the Messenger’s status with Allaah and Allaah’s favour upon him, where Allaah says: &lt;&lt; Your Lord has neither forsaken you nor hated you. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Which means: He did not leave you and did not hate you.  It has been said that it means, He did not neglect you after choosing you.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">3- Regarding the saying of Allaah Ta’ala : &lt;&lt; And indeed the Hereafter is better for you than the present (life of this world).  &gt;&gt; Ibn Ishaaq said: What you have in recourse to Allaah is greater than what Allaah has given you, of honour, in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sahl said: what has been stored for you, of the intercession, and the place of noble standing (<em>maqaama Mahmooda</em>) is better for you than what you have been given in this world.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">4- Allaah Ta’ala’s saying &lt;&lt; And verily, your Lord will give you (all good) so that you shall be well-pleased.   &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This <em>Ayaah</em> is comprehensive: it contains all the different points of honour, types of happiness and the various blessings in the two worlds and more.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Ishaaq said: Allaah will make the Messenger pleased with success in the <em>Duniya</em>, and reward in the Hereafter.  It has been said that is the lake in Paradise and the intercession of the Messenger.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">5- What Allaah has prepared for him from His blessings.  Allaah assigned bounties from Himself and blessings in the rest of the<em>Soorah</em>; from the guidance of Allaah where He guided the Messenger or guiding the people by the Messenger – this difference in meaning is due to the different <em>Tafseer</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger had no wealth and Allaah made him wealthy by what He had given him, or by what Allaah had placed in his heart due to contentment and wealth.  The Messenger was an orphan and his uncle became affectionate to him and sheltered him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It has been said: Allaah sheltered him – Allaah reminds him with this great favour and what is known, from <em>Tafseer, </em>is that Allaah did not neglect the Messenger when he was young, in a poor state and an orphan before he was well known as a Prophet.  Allaah did not forsake him, nor did He hate him, so what about after Allaah appointed and chose him for Prophet Hood.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah commanded His Messenger to manifest His blessings upon him and to be thankful for what He had honoured him with, by announcing it and to commend it by mentioning this blessing, due to the saying of Allaah <em>Ta’ala </em>&lt;&lt; And proclaim the Grace of your Lord (i.e. the Prophet hood and all other Graces) &gt;&gt; since, indeed, being thankful of blessings is talking about them.  This was specific for the Messenger and general for his <em>Ummah</em>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 2 – The Excellence of the lineage of the Messenger</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Waatheelah bin al-Asqa <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: I heard the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> say: ‘Certainly Allaah chose a branch from the son of Isma’eel and chose the Quraish from this branch. He chose Bani Hashim from the Quraish, and He chose me from Bani Hashim.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam –</em> said: ‘I was sent from the best of all the generations of the children of Adam, generation after generation until I was in the generation in which I was sent.’<br>
Bukharee – Characteristics (3557)</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He was Abul-Qaasim Muhammad bin Abdullaah bin Abdul Muttalib bin Hashim bin Abd Munaf bin Qoose bin Keelab bin Marra bin Ka’ab bin Luu’ee bin Ghalib bin Fahr bin Malik bin an-Nadhr bin Kananah bin Khuzaimah bin Mudrikah bin Ilyaas bin Madhar bin Nazzar bin Ma’d bin Adnaan. Up to here there is an agreement about its authenticity, as for after Adnaan then there is a difference of opinion.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no difference that Adnaan was from the sons of Isma’eel bin Ibraheem. What is correct is that Isma’eel was the one to be slaughtered, and that it was Ishaaq is incorrect.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 3 – The Messenger’s beautiful physical characteristics</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Ishaq who said I heard al-Bara say: that the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – was the handsomest of all the people and had the best appearance. He was neither very tall nor was he short.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also on the authority of al-Bara who said: The Prophet &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – was of a moderate height having broad shoulders, his hair reached his ear-lobes. I saw him in a red cloak and I had never seen anyone more handsome than him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Ishaq who said that al-Bara was asked: ‘Was the face of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – as bright as a sword?’ He said: ‘No, as bright as the moon.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Abdullah bin Ka’b who said: I heard Ka’b bin Malik talking when he stayed behind from the battle of Tabuk, saying: ‘When I greeted the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – his face was glittering with happiness. Whenever Allaah’s Messenger was happy his face used to light up, as though it were a piece of the moon, and we used to know it (his happiness) from his face.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas &#8211; radiAllaah anhu &#8211; who said: I never touched silk or <em>Dibaj</em> (i.e. thick silk) softer than the palm of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – nor did I smell a fragrance or perspiration better than the fragrance or perspiration of the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Juhaifa who said: the Messenger of Allaah &#8211; sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam – went to a place called al-Batha’ at noon, performed <em>wudu</em> and prayed two <em>Rakat</em> <em>Zuhr </em>prayer and a two <em>Rakat</em>for the <em>‘Asr</em> prayer. A spear was planted before him and passersby were passing in front of it. (After the prayer), the people got up and held the hands of the Prophet and passed them on their faces. I also took his hand and kept it on my face and noticed that it was colder than ice and its fragrance was nicer than musk.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Reported by Bukharee in ‘The Book of the Excellence of the Prophet and His Companions’</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 4- His Noble Manners</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; <em>Noon</em>. By the Pen and what the (angels) write (in the Records of men). You are not, by the Grace of your Lord, a madman. And verily, for you will be an endless reward. And verily, you are on an exalted standard of character. &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Aeysha &#8211;<em>radiAllaah anha</em> &#8211; said: ‘That his manners were that of the Qur’aan.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah Ta’ala said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;And by the Mercy of Allaah, you dealt with them gently. And had you been severe and harsh­ hearted, they would have broken away from about you; so pass over (their faults), and ask (Allaah’s) Forgiveness for them; and consult them in the affairs. Then when you have taken a decision, put your trust in Allaah, certainly, Allaah loves those who put their trust (in Him). &gt;&gt;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Imran:159]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abdullah bin ‘Amr bin al-Aaas <em>-radiAllaah anhumma &#8211;</em>who said: ‘The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> never used bad language neither did he say or do evil acts. He used to say ‘The best amongst you are those who have the best manners.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Aeysha <em>-radiAllaah anha &#8211;</em> who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was never given the choice between two matters, except that he would choose the easier of the two, as long as it was not sinful to do so, but if it was sinful to do so, he would be the farthest away from it from amongst the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> never took revenge for his own sake but when what Allaah had prohibited was transgressed,then he would take revenge for Allaah’s Sake.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Sa’eed al-Khudri <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: ‘that the Prophet was shyer than a virgin in her private living quarters.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: ‘The Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> never criticized any food, if he liked it he would eat it otherwise, he would leave it.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas bin Malik <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: ‘I served the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> for ten years. I swear by Allaah, he never said a harsh word to me nor did he question me as to why I had done such-and-such or why I had not done such-and-such in a particular way.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In another wording: ‘I served him on journeys and while resident. I swear by Allaah he never said to me about what I did ‘Why did you do this like this?’ or about something that I had not done, ‘Why did you not do this in this way?’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also on the authority of Anas <em>-radiAllaah anhu-</em> who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam &#8211;</em> was the best of the people in his manners.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Jabir bin Abdullah <em>-radiAllaah anhu &#8211;</em> who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>never said no to anything that he was asked for.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas &#8211;<em>radiAllaah anhu</em>&#8211; who said Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was never asked for anything for the sake of Islaam except that he would give it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Anas mentions that a man came to him and so he gave him some sheep<strong><em>.</em></strong>  The man then went back to his people and said: ‘O people accept Islaam, for Muhammad gives so much charity he has no fear of want.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Ibn Abbas <em>-radiAllaah anhuma-</em> that Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was the most prolific of people in doing good. He was generous to the utmost in the month of Ramadan. Indeed Jibreel <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> would meet him every year during the month of Ramadan up until its end.  Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> would recite the Qur’aan to him and when Jibreel would meet him, Allaah’s Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> would be the most generous in goodness; more so than the blowing wind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The intent of the meaning ‘more so than the blowing wind’ is that he was swift and comprehensive in doing good deeds.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 5 – The Prophet’s <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> Courage</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas bin Malik <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said that Allaah’s Messenger <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was the best of the people, the most generous amongst them and he was the bravest of men.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One night the people of Madina felt frightened and they set forth in the direction of a noise when the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> met them on his way back, as he had gone towards that noise ahead of them.  He was on Abu Talha’s horse, which had no saddle over it, with a sword slung around his neck while he was saying: ‘There was nothing to be afraid of, nothing to be afraid of.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He also said: ‘We found this horse like a torrent of water (very fast),’ whereas the horse had been slow before that time.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">i.e. That this horse was slow but when the Messenger of Allaah<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> rode it, it was the fastest racing horse.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas ibn AbdulMuttalib, the uncle of the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: I witnessed the Day of Hunain with the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>.  Abu Sufyan bin al-Harith bin Abdul-Muttalib and I stuck close to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and we did not separate from him. The Messenger of Allaah<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was on a white pony of his which was given to him as a gift by Farwatu bin Nufatha al-Juthaami.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Muslims fought the Kuffar, the Muslims retreated, but the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> began to gallop on his pony towards them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas said: I was holding onto the reins of the Messenger of Allaah’s &#8211;<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> pony trying to hold it back from speeding up and Abu Sufyan was holding the stirrup of Allaah’sMessenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em><em>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘O Abbas, call the people of al-Samura.’ (Those who took the oath of allegiance of Ridwaan on the Day of Hudaybeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas mentions he was a man with a loud voice: So I said at the top of my voice: ‘Where are the people of al-Samura.’ (Those who took the oath of allegiance of Ridwaan on the Day of Hudaybeeyah).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas mentions: I swear by Allaah, they came back when they heard my voice just as the cows return for their calves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They said: We are here, we are here!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘Fight the kuffar.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then the narrator continues:  ………then the Messenger of Allaah<em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘Now the battle has become inflamed.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas said: Then the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> took some stones and threw them in the face of the kuffar and said: ‘They are defeated, I swear by the Lord of Muhammad.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Abbas said: ‘I went to watch and the battle took place as I was watching. I swear by Allaah, just as he threw his stones towards them I saw their strength decline and saw them retreat.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then Imaam Muslim cites a summary of the hadeeth which mentions: ‘He said: ‘They are defeated, I swear by the Lord of Ka’bah. They are defeated, I swear by the Lord of Ka’bah.’ With theadditional wording: ‘Until Allaah defeated them and it was as if I was watching the Prophet of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> chasing them on his pony.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Imaam Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Also, from al-Bara’s hadeeth of the story of Hunain: The people turned to the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and Abu Sufyan bin al-Harith was leading his pony.  So he got down, prayed and supplicated for Allaah’s help by saying:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘I am the Prophet, this is the truth *** I am the son of Abd al-Muttalib</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O Allaah, send down your help.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bara’ mentioned: I swear by Allaah when the battle grew fierce, we would seek protection by being close to the Messenger due to his bravery and even the bravest among us was would stand near the Prophet <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>.</em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Narrated by Imaam Muslim</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Muslim narrates the story of Hunain from the hadeeth of Salama bin al-Akwaa’ within which occurs: ‘So we gathered around the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>-, he got down from his pony and grabbed a handful of dust from the ground, then he turned towards the faces of the enemy and said: ‘May these faces be disfigured.’ There was no-one from amongst them that Allaah created except that Allaah filled their eyes with dust from that handful of dust.  They turned back in flight.  Allaah the Exalted and Glorious defeated them and the Messenger of Allaah <em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em>distributed their booty.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Saheeh Muslim</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 6- The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was the most knowledgeable about Allaah and had the most fear of Allaah</h2>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas bin Malik <em>–RadhiAllaahu anhu-</em> who said: ‘A group of three people came to the houses of the Prophet’s wives asking about the Prophet’s worship.  When they were informed about it, they regarded their own as insignificant and said: ‘Where are we compared to the Prophet <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>? Indeed Allaah has forgiven him his past and future sins.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One of them said: As for me then I will pray all night.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other one said: I will fast continuously and not open my fast<strong><em>.</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The last one said: I will keep away from women and never marry.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> came he said: Are you those who said such-and-such. Then I swear by Allaah that indeed I am the most fearful of Allaah from amongst you and the one who has the most <em>Taqwa</em> of Him.  However, I fast and open my fast, I pray and I sleep and I marry women.  So whosoever does not desire my Sunnah is not of me.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Aeysha <em>-RadiAllaah anha-</em> who said: ‘The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> did an action and made a concessionfor it. When this reached some of the people from his Companions it was as though they disliked it and regarded it as insignificant.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When this reached the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> he stood, gave a sermon and said: ‘What is wrong with the people?  It reaches them that I have made a concession in a matter yet they dislike it and regard it as insignificant.<strong><em>  </em></strong>I swear by Allaah, indeed I am the most knowledgeable of them about Allaah and have the most fear of Allaah from amongst them.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari narrated it in ‘al-‘I’tisaam’ &amp; Muslim in ‘Fadail’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the narration of Muslim: ‘When that reached the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> he became angry until the anger became apparent on his face.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was narrated by Bukhari in the chapter: ‘That which is dislikedregarding delving too deeply, disagreement and extremism in the<em>Deen</em> and <em>Bida</em>’.’  Then he mentioned the <em>Ayaah</em>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">? ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  ?   ?  ?  ?  ??    ? ??????: ???</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt;O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say of Allaah anything but the truth. &gt;&gt; [Nisa’:171]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">An-Nawawi said: ‘In this hadeeth there is an encouragement to follow the Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> a prohibition against delving too deeply into worship and a rebuke of abstaining from the permissible acts, doubting their permissibility.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It also shows the allowance of showing anger when there is a violation of the <em>Sharia’</em> even if the one violating it brings an interpretation for it.  It also indicates to the maintenance of good relations by rebuking and showing dislike for an action via general statements and not by specifying the one who did it such that it is said: ‘What is wrong with the people’ or other similar statements.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The hadeeth also mentions that being close to Allaah is a reason for knowledge increasing.’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">I (Shaykh Rabee’) say: the intent here is the clarification that the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> is the most knowledgeable about Allaah and the strongest of them in having fear of Allaah.  In this is a refutation of the ideology of the extreme Soofis who say: ‘Indeed I worship Allaah, neither fearing His Fire nor desiring His Paradise!’</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There are also other texts which refute this falsehood.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;">Part 7 – Regarding the Messenger’s <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> reliance upon his Lord <em>–Azza wa Jal</em></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says :</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">&lt;&lt; And obey not the disbelievers and the hypocrites, and harm them not (till you are ordered). And put your trust in Allaah, and Sufficient is Allaah as a <em>Wakeel</em> (Trustee, or Disposer of affairs)&gt;&gt;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">[ al-Ahzab:48 ]</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was the best of those who adhered to Allaah and the best in reliance upon his Lord, the Lord of all the worlds.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Indeed Allaah saved and protected him from the plots of those who opposed him and from his enemies whether it was in the <em>Makkan</em> period or the <em>Madini</em> period, whether it was in the field of giving <em>Dawa’ </em>and conveying the <em>Deen</em> or in the field of battles and Jihad.  He used to have bodyguards in Madina but when Allaah’s statement was revealed : &lt;&lt; Allaah will protect you from the people&gt;&gt; he pardoned his guards from their duty, relying upon Allaah <em>– Azza wa Jal –</em> trusting in the promise of his Lord.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Jaabir bin Abdullaah that he was on the way to a battle along with the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> towards Najd.  The Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> was on his way back I was with him.   When I reached the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> and his Companions, I found them taking a siesta in a valley with many trees with thorns, the Messenger of Allaah <em>-sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> stopped there and the people dispersed among the trees with thorns, shading themselves with the trees, the Messenger of Allaah stopped under a tree with a lot of leaves and hung his sword on it.</p>
<p dir="rtl" style="text-align:justify;" align="right">Jaabir said: We fell into a deep sleep. All of a sudden the Messenger began calling us so we came to him and found a Bedouin sitting near him.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger of Allaah said: ‘Indeed this person took my sword out of its scabbard while I was sleeping when I awoke he had taken it out of its scabbard and it was in his hand and he said to me: who will prevent me from killing you? I said: Allaah and here he is sitting.’  The Messenger of Allaah did not punish him.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Bukhari – in the ‘Book of battles’ &amp; Muslim in the ‘Book of Excellence’.</p>
<h2 style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Part 8 : </strong><strong>The </strong><strong>Prophet’s </strong><strong><em>&#8211;</em></strong><strong><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em></strong> <strong>Compassion for his <em>Ummah</em></strong></h2>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Allaah <em>Ta’ala</em> said: &lt;&lt; Verily, there has come unto you a Messenger from amongst yourselves (i.e. whom you know well). It grieves him that you should receive any injury or difficulty. He (Muhammad) is anxious over you, for the believers (he is) full of pity, kind, and merciful. But if they turn away, say: ‘Allaah is sufficient for me. <em>Lâ ilâha illa Huwa </em>(none has the right to be worshipped but He), in Him I put my trust and He is the Lord of the Mighty Throne.’&gt;&gt;</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Musa al-Ashaari on the authority of the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam- </em>who said: ‘My example and the example of what I have been sent with is that of a man who came to some people and said, ‘O people! I have seen the army with my own eyes, and I am the clear Warner; so protect yourselves!’ Then a group of his people obeyed him and fled proceeding slowly, so they were saved. Another group of them disbelieved him and stayed at their place until the morning when the army came upon them, and destroyed them and ruined them. So this is the example of the one who obeys me and follows what I have brought (the <em>Qur’aan</em> and the <em>Sunnah</em>), and the example of the one who disobeys me and disbelieves in the truth I have brought.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Collected by Bukhari and Muslim</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>who said: that the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">‘Indeed my example and the example of my <em>Ummah</em> is like a man who lit a fire, and moths and insects began to fall into it.  So I am holding on to the waist of your waist wrapper while you are rushing into it.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">[in another narration: so that is my example and your example while I take hold onto the waist of your waist wrapper from the fire, saying keep away from the fire, keep away from the fire you are overcoming me and rushing into it.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Agreed upon by Bukhari &amp; Muslim</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Anas <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anhu</em><em>&#8211;</em>said:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">‘I never saw any one more merciful with his family members than the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em>’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Muslim ‘Book of Excellence’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of ‘Aeysha <em>&#8211;</em><em>Radi Allaahu anha</em><em>&#8211;</em> who said: that some Bedouins came to the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> and said to the people: ‘Do you kiss your children?’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">They said: ‘Yes.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon the Bedouins said: ‘We swear by Allaah that we do not kiss our children.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Allaah’s Messenger <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said: ‘Then what can I do if Allaah has deprived you of mercy?’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Abu Huraira who reported that al-Aqra’ bin Habis saw the Prophet <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> kissing Hasan.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">He said: ‘I have ten children, but I have never kissed any one of them.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">So the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam</em><em>&#8211;</em> said:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">‘He who does not show mercy, no mercy will be shown to him.’</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">Muslim</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">On the authority of Jareer bin Abdullah who said: ‘That the Messenger of Allaah <em>&#8211;</em><em>sallAllaahu alayhi wa sallam-</em> said:</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align:justify;">‘He who shows no mercy to the people, Allaah does not show mercy to him.’</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">قُل لَّا يَعۡلَمُ مَن فِى ٱلسَّمَـٰوَٲتِ وَٱلۡأَرۡضِ ٱلۡغَيۡبَ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ‌ۚ وَمَا يَشۡعُرُونَ أَيَّانَ يُبۡعَثُونَ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>Say: &#8220;None in the heavens and the earth knows the Ghaib (unseen) except Allâh, nor can they perceive when they shall be resurrected.&#8221;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-Naml 27:65]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">وَعِندَهُ ۥ مَفَاتِحُ ٱلۡغَيۡبِ لَا يَعۡلَمُهَآ إِلَّا هُوَ‌ۚ وَيَعۡلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلۡبَرِّ وَٱلۡبَحۡرِ‌ۚ وَمَا تَسۡقُطُ مِن وَرَقَةٍ إِلَّا</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">&#8220;And with Him are the keys of the Ghaib (all that is hidden), none knows them but He. And He knows whatever there is in the land and in the sea; not a leaf falls, but he knows it. There is not a grain in the darkness of the earth nor anything fresh or dry, but is written in a Clear Record.&#8221;</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">[al-An’aam 6:59]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عِندَهُ ۥ عِلۡمُ ٱلسَّاعَةِ وَيُنَزِّلُ ٱلۡغَيۡثَ وَيَعۡلَمُ مَا فِى ٱلۡأَرۡحَامِ‌ۖ وَمَا تَدۡرِى نَفۡسٌ۬ مَّاذَا تَڪۡسِبُ غَدً۬ا‌ۖ وَمَا تَدۡرِى نَفۡسُۢ بِأَىِّ أَرۡضٍ۬ تَمُوتُ‌ۚ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ خَبِيرُۢ</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;"><strong>&#8220;Verily, Allâh! With Him (Alone) is the knowledge of the Hour, He sends down the rain, and knows that which is in the wombs. No person knows what he will earn tomorrow, and no person knows in what land he will die. Verily, Allâh is All¬Knower, All¬Aware (of things).&#8221;</strong></span></p>

Chapter 243<br>
The Obligation of Supplicating Allah to Exalt His Mention and its Excellence,<br>
and its Manner</h5>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah, the Exalted, says:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>&#8220;Allah exalts the mention of His Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) and His angels supplicate Him to do so. O you who believe! supplicate Allah to exalt his mention and to grant him safety and security</b></span><b>.</b></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1397.</b> `Abdullah bin `Amr bin Al-`As (May Allah be pleased with them) reported: I heard the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) saying: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whoever supplicates Allah to exalt my mention, Allah will exalt his mention ten times.</span>&#8221;<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1398.</b> Ibn Mas`ud (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The people who will be nearest to me on the Day of Resurrection will be those who supplicate Allah more often for me</span>.&#8221;<br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1399.</b> Aus bin Aus (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Among the best of your days is Friday; so supplicate Allah more often for me in it , for your supplications will be displayed to me</span>.&#8221; He was asked: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! How will our blessings be displayed to you when your decayed body will have mixed with the earth?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Allah has prohibited the earth from consuming the bodies of the Prophets</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1400.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">May his nose soil with dust in whose presence mention is made of me and he does not supplicate for me</span>.&#8221;<br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1401.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Do not make my grave a place of festivity, and supplicate Allah for me, for your supplication reaches me wherever you are</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1402.</b> Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Whenever someone greets  me, Allah returns the soul to my body (in the grave) and I return his greeting</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Abu Dawud].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1403.</b> `Ali (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">The miser is the one in whose presence I am mentioned but he does not supplicate for me</span>.&#8221;<br>
[At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1404.</b> Fadalah bin `Ubaid (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) heard some one supplicating after his prayer without praising Allah and without supplicating Allah for the Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). With regard to him, the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">This man rushed.</span>&#8221; Then he called him and said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">When any one of you have performed Salat (prayer) and wants to supplicate, let him praise Allah first then glorify Him in the beginning and then he should supplicate Allah for me. Then he may supplicate for whatever he likes</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Abu Dawud and At-Tirmidhi].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1405.</b> Abu<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">  </span>Muhammad  Ka`b  bin `Ujrah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Prophet (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came to us and we asked him, &#8220;O Messenger of Allah, we already know how to greet you (i.e., say As-salamu `alaikum), but how should we supplicate for you?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Say: `Allahumma salli `ala Muhammadin, wa `ala `ali Muhammadin, kama sallaita `ala `ali Ibrahima, innaka Hamidum Majid. Allahumma barik `ala Muhammadin, wa `ala `ali Muhammadin, kama barakta `ala `ali Ibrahima, innaka Hamidum Majid [O Allah, exalt the mention of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you exalted the family of Ibrahim. You are Praised and Glorious. O Allah, bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You blessed the family of Ibrahim. You are Praised and Glorious</span>.&#8221;&#8217;<br>
[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1406.</b> Abu Mas`ud Al-Badri (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: We were sitting in the company of Sa`d bin `Ubadah (May Allah be pleased with him)<span style="font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span> when the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) came to us. Bashir bin Sa`d said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! Allah has commanded us to supplicate for you, but how should we do that?&#8221; The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) kept silent. We were much perturbed over his silence and we wished he did not asked him this question. The Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Say: `O Allah, exalt the mention of Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you exalted the family of Ibrahim. And bless Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as You blessed the family of Ibrahim. You are the Praised, the Glorified,&#8217; and the method of greeting (i.e., Salam) is as you know</span>.&#8221;<br>
[Muslim].</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>1407.</b> Abu Humaid As-Sa`idi (May Allah be pleased with him) reported: The Companions of the Messenger of Allah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: &#8220;O Messenger of Allah! How should we supplicate for you?&#8221; He (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) replied, &#8220;<span style="color:#0000ff;">Say: `Allahumma salli `ala Muhammadin wa `ala azwajihi wa dhurriyyatihi</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> kama sallaita `ala Ibrahima; wa barik `ala Muhammadin wa `ala azwajihi wa dhurriyyatihi</span><span style="color:#0000ff;font-family:'Traditional Arabic';">,</span><span style="color:#0000ff;"> kama barakta `ala Ibrahima, innaka Hamidum-Majid (O Allah sent Your Salat (O Allah, exalt the mention of Muhammad and his wives and offspring as You exalted the mention of the family of Ibrahim, and bless Muhammad and the wives and  the offspring of Muhammad as you blessed the family of Ibrahim.

Malik reported that Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him stood when the sun had passed the meridian and he led them noon prayer and after observing salutations (completing the prayer) he stood upon the pulpit and talked about the Last Hour and made a mention of the important facts prior to it and then said: He who desires to ask anything from me let him ask me about it. By Allah, I shall not move from this place so long as I do not inform you about that which you ask. Anas b. Malik said: People began to shed tears profusely when they heard this from Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said it repeatedly: You ask me. Thereupon &#8216;Abdullah b. Hudhafa stood up and said: Allah&#8217;s Messenger, who is my father? He said: Your father is Hudhafa, and Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said repeatedly: Ask me, and (it was at this juncture that &#8216;Umar knelt down and said): We are well pleased with Allah as our Lord, with Islam as our code of life and with Muhammad as the Messenger (of Allah). Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) kept quiet so long as &#8216;Umar spoke. Then Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: (The Doom) is near; by Him, in Whose Hand is the life of Muhammad, there was presented to me the Paradise and Hell in the nook of this enclosure, and I did not see good and evil like that of the present day. Ibn Shihab reported: Ubaidullah b. &#8216;Abdullah b. &#8216;Utba told me that the mother of &#8216;Abdullah b. Hudhafa told &#8216;Abdullah b. Hudhafa: I have never heard of a son more disobedient than you. Do you feel yourself immune from the fact that your mother committed a sin which the women in the pre-Islamic period committed and then you disgrace her in the eyes of the people? &#8216;Abdullah b. Hudhafa said: If my fatherhood were to be attributed to a black slave I would have connected myself with him.</p>

She was very good-looking amongst the people, so he said to her: If these were to know that you are my wife they would snatch you away from me, so if they ask you tell that you are my sister and in fact you are my sister in Islam, and I do not know of any other Muslim in this land besides I and you. And when they entered that land the tyrants came to see her and said to him (the king): &#8216;there comes to your land a woman, whom you alone deserve to possess, so he (the kings sent someone (towards her) and she was brought and Ibrahim (peace be upon him) stood in preyer, and when she visited him (the tyrant king came) he could help but stretch his hand towards her and his hand was tied up. He said: Supplicate Allah so that He may release my hand and I will do no harm to you. She did that and the man repeated (the same highhandedness) and his hand was again tied up more tightly than on the first occasion and he said to her like that and she again did that (supplicated), but he repeated (the same highhandedness and his hands were tied up more tightly than on the previous occasion). He then again said: Supplicate your Lord so that He may set my hand free; by. @ llah I shall do no harm to you. She did and his hand was freed. Then he called the person who had brought her and said to him: You have brought to me the satan and you have not brought to me a human being, so turn them out from my land, and he gave Hajira as a gift to her. She returned (along with Hajira) and when Ibrahim (peace be upon him) saw her, he said: How have you returned? She said: With full safety (have I returned).

He was never seen naked and Banu Isra&#8217;iI said: (He was afraid to expose his private part) because he had been suffering from scrotal hernia. He (one day) took bath in water and placed his garments upon a stone. The stone began to move on quickly. He followed that and struck it with the help of a stone (saying): O stone, my garment; O stone, my garments, O stone; until it stopped near the big gathering of Isrii&#8217;ll, and this verse was revealed (pertaining to the incident):&#8221; O you who believe, be not Iike those who maligned Moses, but Allah cleared him of what they said, and he was worthy of regard with Allah&#8221; (xxxiii. 69).</p>

When he came, he (Moses) boxed him and his eye was knocked out. He (the Angel of Death) came back to the Lord and said: You sent me to a servant. who did not want to die. Allah restored his eye to its proper place (and revived his eyesight), and then said: Go back to him and tell him that if he wants life he must place his hand on the back of an ox, and he would be granted as many years of life as the number of hair covered by his hand. He (Moses) said: My Lord what would happen then He said: Then you must court death. He said: Let it be now. And he supplicated Allah to bring him close to the sacred land. Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: If I were there, I would have shown you his grave beside the road at the red mound.</p>

He (the Jew) said: By Allah, Who chose Moses (peace be upon him) among mankind.

<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa&#8217;id b. jubair reported: I said to Ibn Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses (peace be upon him), the Apostle of Bani Isra&#8217;il, was not the same who accompanied Khadir, whereupon he said: The enemy of Allah tells a lie. I heard Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b say: Moses (peace be upon him) stood up to give sermon to the people of Isra&#8217;il. He was asked as to who amongst the people has the best knowledge, whereupon he said: I have the best knowledge. Thereupon Allah was annoyed with him that he did not attribute (the best knowledge) to Him. He revealed to him: A servant amongst My servants is at the junction of two rivers who has more knowledge than yours. Moses said: How can I meet him? It was said to him: Carry a fish in the large basket and the place where you find it missing there you will find him. Thereupon Moses proceeded forth along with a young man (Yusha&#8217;). Joshua b. Nan and Moses (peace be upon him) put the fish in the basket and there went along with him the young man (Yusha&#8217;) until they came to a certain rock and Moses and his companion went to sleep and the fish stirred in that basket and fell into the ocean and Allah stopped the current of water like a vault until the way was made for the fish. Moses and his youn. companion were astonished and they walked for the rest of the day and the night and the friend of Moses forgot to inform him of this incident. When it was morning, Moses (peace be upon him) said to the young man: Bring for us the breakfast for we are dead tired because of this journey, and they did not feel exhausted until they had passed that place where they had been commanded (to stay). He said: Don&#8217;t you know that when we reached the Sakhra (rock) I forgot the fisii and noth ng made me forget it but the satan that I. could nit remember it? How strange is it that the fish found a way in the river? Moses said: That was what we had been aiming at. Then both of them retraced their steps until they reached Sakhra; there they saw a man covered with a cloth. Moses greeted him. Khadir said to him: Where is as-Salam in our country.? He said: I am Moses, whereupon he (Khadir) said: You mean the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il? He said: Yes. He (Khadir) said: You have a knowledge out of the knowledge of Allah which in fact Allah imparted to you and about that I know nothing and I have knowledge out of Allah&#8217;s knowledge which He imparted to me and about that you do not know. Moses (peace be upon him) said to him: May I follow you so that you may teach me that with which you have been taught righteousness. He said: You will not be able to bear with me; how you will be able to bear that about which you do not know? Moses said: Thou wilt find me patient, nor shalt I disobey you in aught. Khadir said to him: If you were to follow me, then do not ask me about anything until I myself speak to you about it. He said: Yes. So Khadir and Moses set forth on the bank of the river that there came before them a boat. Both of theni talked to them (the owners of the boat) so that they might carry both of them.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They had recognised Khadir and they carried them free. Khadir thereupon took hold of a plank in the boat and broke it away. Moses said: These people have carried us without any charge and you attempt to break their boat so that the people sailing in the boat may drown. This is (something) grievous that you have done. He said: Did I not say that you would not bear with me? He said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon what I did. Then both of them got down from the boat and began to walk along the coastline that they saw a boy who had been playing with other boys. Khadir pulled up his head and killed him. Moses said: Have you killed an innocent person who is in no way guilty of slaying another? You have done something horrible. Thereupon he said: Did I not say to you that you will not be able to bear with me? He (Moses) said: This (act) is more grievous than the first one. He (Moses) further said. If I ask you about anything after this, keep not company with me, then you would no doubt find (a plausible) excuse for this. Then they both walked on until they reached the inhabitants of a village. They asked its inhabitants for food but they refused to entertain them as their guests. They found in it a wall which had been bent on one side and was about to fall. Khadir set it right with his own hand. Moses, said to him: It is the people to whom we came but they showed us no hospitality and they did not serve us food. If you wish you can get wages for it. He (Khadir) said: This is the parting of ways between mt and you. Now I wish to reveal to you the significance of that for which you could not bear with me. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said. May Allah have mercy upon Moses! I wish if Moses could show patience and a (fuller) story of both of them could have been told. Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said that the first thing which Moses said was out of forgetfulness. Then there came a sparrow until it perched on the wall of the boat and took water from the ocean. Thereupon, Khadir said: My knowledge and your knowledge in comparison with the knowledge of Allah is even less than the water taken by the sparrow in its beak in comparison to the water of the ocean, and Sa&#8217;id b. jubair used to recite (verses 79 and 80 of Sura Kahf) in this way: There was before them a king who used to seize every boat by force which was in order, the boy was an unbeliever.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="030.5865"></a></em></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sa, id b. jubair reported that it was said to Ibn &#8216;Abbas that Nauf al-Bikali was of the opinion that Moses who went in search of knowledge was not the Moses of Bani Isra&#8217;il. He said: Sa&#8217;id, did you hear it from him? I said: Yes. Thereupon he said that Nauf had not stated the fact. Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b narrated to us that he had heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) as saying: Moses had been delivering sermons to his people. And he made this remark: No person upon the earth has better knowledge than I or nothing better than mine. Thereupon Allah revealed to him: I know one who is better than you (in knowledge) or there is a person on the earth having more knowledge than you. Thereupon he said: My Lord, direct me to him. It was said to him: Keep a salted fish as a provision for journey. The place where that fish would be lost (there you will find that man). So he set forth and a young slave along with him until they came to a place Sakhra. but he did not find any clue. So he proceeded on and left that young man there. The fish began to stir in water and the water assumed the form of an ark over the fish. The young man said: I should meet Allah&#8217;s Apostle (peace be upon him) and inform him, but he was made to forget and when they had gone beyond that place, he (Moses) said to the young man: Bring breakfast. We have been exhausted because of the journey, and he (Moses) was not exhausted until he had crossed that (particular) place (where he had) to meet Khadir, and the youth was reminded and said: Did you not see that as we reached Sakhra I forgot the fish and it is satan alone who has made me forgetful of it&#8217;? It is strange that he has been able to find way in the ocean too. He said: This is what we sought for us.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">They returned retracing their steps, and he (his companion) pointed to him the location (where) the fish (had been lost). Moses began to search him there. He suddenly saw Khadir wrapped in a cloth and lying on his back. He said to him: As-Salamu-&#8216;Alaikum. He removed the cloth from his face and said: Wa &#8216;Alaikum-us-Salam! Who are you? He said: I am Moses. He said: Who Moses? He said: Moses Of Bani Isra&#8217;il. He said: What brought you here? He said: I have come so that you may teach me what you have been taught of righteousness. He said: You shall have to bear with me, and how can you have patience about a thing of which you have no comprehensive knowledge? You will not have patience when you see me doing a thing I have been ordered to do. He said: If Allah pleases, you will find me patient, nor shall I disobey you in aught. Khadir said: If you follow me, don&#8217;t ask me about anything until I explain it to you. So they went on until they embarked upon a boat. He (Khadir) made a hole in that. Thereupon he (Moses) said: You have done this so that you may drown the persons sitting in the boat. You have done something grievous. Thereupon he said: Did I not tell you that you will not be able to bear with me? Thereupon he (Moses) said: Blame me not for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for what I did. (Khadir gave him another chance.) So they went on until they reached a place where boys were playing. He went to one of them and caught hold&#8217;of one (apparently) at random and killed him. Moses (peace be upon him) felt agitated and said: You have killed an innocent person not guilty of slaying another. You have done something aboininable.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Thereupon Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may peace be upon him) said: May Allah have mercy upon us and Moses. Had he shown patience he would have seen wonderful things, but fear of blame, with respect to his companion, seized him and he said: If I ask anything after this, keep not company with me. You will then have a valid excuse in my case, and had he (Moses) shown patience he would have seen many wonderful things. He (the narrator) said: Whenever he (the Holy Prophet) made mention of any Prophet, he always said: May there be mercy of Allah upon us and upon my brother so and so. They, however, proceeded on until they came to the inhabitants of a village who were very miserly. They went to the meeting places and asked for hospitality but they refused to show any hospitality to them. They both found in that village a wall which was about to fall. He (Khadir) set it right. Thereupon he (Moses) said: If you so liked. you could get wages for it. Thereupon he said: This is the partince, of ways between me and you, and, taking hold of his cloth, he said: Now I will explain to you the real significance (of all these acts) for which you could not show patience. As for the boat, it belonged to the poor people working on the river and I intended to damage it for there was ahead of them (a king) who seized boats by force. (When he came) to catch hold of it he found it a damaged boat, so he spared it (and later on) it was set right with wood. So far as the boy is concerned, he has been, by very nature, an unbeliever, whereas his parents loved him very much. Had he grown up he would have involved them in wrongdoing and unbelief, so we wished that their Lord should give them in its place one better in purity and close to mercy. And as for the wall it belonged to two orphan boys in the city and there was beneath it a (treasure) belongin to them,&#8230; up to the last verse. This hadith has been transmitted on the authority of Abu Ishaq.</p>

Ibn &#8216;Abbas said that he was Khadir. There happened to pass Ubayy b. Ka&#8217;b Ansari. Ibn Abbas called him and said: Abu Tufail, come to us. There has been a difference of opinion between me and my friend about the companion of Moses whom he wanted to meet on the way. Did hear anything from Allah&#8217;s meesenger (may peace be upon him) making a mention of anything? Ubayy said: I heard Allah&#8217;s Messenger (may Peace be upon him) as saying: As Moses was amongst the group of Bani Isra&#8217;il, there came to him a person and he said to him: Do you know anyone having better knowledge than you? Moses said: No. Thereupon Allah revealed to Moses: Of course, there is amongst Our servants Khadir (who has better knowledge) than you. Moses asked the way of meeting him. Allah made the fish a sign and it was said to him: Where you miss the fish return to that (place) and you will soon find him. So Moses moved on as Allah wished him to move on. He then said to his young companion: Bring for us the breakfast. Thereupop that young man said to Moses. when he asked him for the breakfast: Don&#8217;t you see that as we had reached the Sakhra I forgot the fish and nobody made it forget (in our mind) but the satan that I should remind you of it? Mosed said to that young man: This was what we wanted. So they retraced their steps and met Khadir and the events which followed have been described in His Book except that Yunus (the narrator) said that he followed the traces of fish in the ocean.</p>

<h3 align="center"><font>Virtues and Merits of the Prophet(Sallallaahu &#8216;alaihi wa sallam) and his Companions </font></h3>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.659">Volume 4, Book 56, Number 659: </a></font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Rabi bin Hirash: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amr said to Hudhaifa, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you relate to  us of what you have heard from Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; He said, &#8220;I heard him saying,  &#8220;When Al-Dajjal appears, he will have fire and water along with him. What the people  will consider as cold water, will be fire that will burn (things). So, if anyone of you  comes across this, he should fall in the thing which will appear to him as fire, for in  reality, it will be fresh cold water.&#8221; Hudhaifa added, &#8220;I also heard him saying,  &#8216;From among the people preceding your generation, there was a man whom the angel of death  visited to capture his soul. (So his soul was captured) and he was asked if he had done  any good deed.&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I don&#8217;t remember any good deed.&#8217; He was asked to think it  over. He said, &#8216;I do not remember, except that I used to trade with the people in the  world and I used to give a respite to the rich and forgive the poor (among my debtors). So  Allah made him enter Paradise.&#8221; Hudhaifa further said, &#8220;I also heard him saying,  &#8216;Once there was a man on his death-bed, who, losing every hope of surviving said to his  family: When I die, gather for me a large heap of wood and make a fire (to burn me). When  the fire eats my meat and reaches my bones, and when the bones burn, take and crush them  into powder and wait for a windy day to throw it (i.e. the powder) over the sea. They did  so, but Allah collected his particles and asked him: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Why did you do so? He replied: For fear of You. So Allah  forgave him.&#8221; &#8216;Uqba bin &#8216;Amr said, &#8220;I heard him saying that the Israeli used to  dig the grave of the dead (to steal their shrouds).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 660: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha and Ibn &#8216;Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>On his death-bed Allah&#8217;s Apostle put a sheet over his-face  and when he felt hot, he would remove it from his face. When in that state (of putting and  removing the sheet) he said, &#8220;May Allah&#8217;s Curse be on the Jews and the Christians for  they build places of worship at the graves of their prophets.&#8221; (By that) he intended  to warn (the Muslim) from what they (i.e. Jews and Christians) had done. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 661: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;The Israelis used to be ruled and  guided by prophets: Whenever a prophet died, another would take over his place. There will  be no prophet after me, but there will be Caliphs who will increase in number.&#8221; The  people asked, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! What do you order us (to do)?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Obey the one who will be given the pledge of allegiance first. Fulfil their (i.e.  the Caliphs) rights, for Allah will ask them about (any shortcoming) in ruling those Allah  has put under their guardianship.&#8221; </font></p>

<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.662"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 662: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Said: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;You will follow the wrong ways, of  your predecessors so completely and literally that if they should go into the hole of a  mastigure, you too will go there.&#8221; We said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! Do you mean the  Jews and the Christians?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;Whom else?&#8221; (Meaning, of course, the  Jews and the Christians.) </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.663"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 663: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The people mentioned the fire and the bell (as means  proposed for announcing the time of prayer) and by such a suggestion they referred to the  Jews and the Christians. But Bilal was ordered, &#8220;Pronounce the words of the Adhan  (i.e. call for the prayer) twice and the Iqama once only.&#8221; </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.664"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 664: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Aisha: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That she used to hate that one should keep his hands on his  flanks while praying. She said that the Jew used to do so. </font></p>
<hr>
<p><a style="text-decoration:none;" name="004.056.665"></a></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 665: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Your period (i.e. the Muslims&#8217;  period) in comparison to the periods of the previous nations, is like the period between  the &#8216;Asr prayer and sunset. And your example in comparison to the Jews and the Christians  is like the example of a person who employed some laborers and asked them, &#8216;Who will work  for me till midday for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Jews worked for half a day for one Qirat each.  The person asked, &#8216;Who will do the work for me from midday to the time of the &#8216;Asr  (prayer) for one Qirat each?&#8217; The Christians worked from midday till the &#8216;Asr prayer for  one Qirat. Then the person asked, &#8216;Who will do the work for me from the &#8216;Asr till sunset  for two Qirats each?&#8217; &#8221; The Prophet added, &#8220;It is you (i.e. Muslims) who are  doing the work from the Asr till sunset, so you will have a double reward. The Jews and  the Christians got angry and said, &#8216;We have done more work but got less wages.&#8217; Allah  said, &#8216;Have I been unjust to you as regards your rights?&#8217; They said, &#8216;No.&#8217; So Allah said,  &#8216;Then it is My Blessing which I bestow on whomever I like. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I heard &#8216;Umar saying, &#8220;May Allah Curse so-and-so!  Doesn&#8217;t he know that the Prophet said, &#8216;May Allah curse the Jews for, though they were  forbidden (to eat) fat, they liquefied it and sold it. &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated &#8216;Abdullah bin &#8216;Amr: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Convey (my teachings) to the people  even if it were a single sentence, and tell others the stories of Bani Israel (which have  been taught to you), for it is not sinful to do so. And whoever tells a lie on me  intentionally, will surely take his place in the (Hell) Fire.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Amongst the nations before you  there was a man who got a wound, and growing impatient (with its pain), he took a knife  and cut his hand with it and the blood did not stop till he died.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>that he heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8220;Allah willed to  test three Israelis who were a Leper, a blind man and a bald-headed man. So, he sent them  an angel who came to the leper and said, &#8216;What thing do you like most?&#8217; He replied,  &#8220;Good color and good skin, for the people have a strong aversion to me.&#8217; The angel  touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given a good color and beautiful skin.  The angel asked him, &#8216;What kind of property do you like best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Camels (or  cows).&#8217; (The narrator is in doubt, for either the leper or the bald-headed man demanded  camels and the other demanded cows.) So he (i.e. the leper) was given a pregnant  she-camei, and the angel said (to him), &#8216;May Allah bless you in it.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, &#8216;What  thing do you like most?&#8217; He said, &#8216;I like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease,  for the people feel repulsion for me.&#8217; The angel touched him and his illness was cured,  and he was given good hair. The angel asked (him), &#8216;What kind of property do you like  bests&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Cows,&#8217; The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, &#8216;May Allah bless  you in it.&#8217; The angel went to the blind man and asked, &#8216;What thing do you like best?&#8217; He  said, &#8216;(I like) that Allah may restore my eye-sight to me so that I may see the people.&#8217;  The angel touched his eyes and Allah gave him back his eye-sight. The angel asked him,  &#8220;What kind of property do you like best?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;Sheep.&#8217; The angel gave him a  pregnant sheep. Afterwards, all the three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and  multiplied and brought forth so much that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels  filling a valley, and one had a herd of cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of  sheep filling a valley. Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a leper,  went to the leper and said, I am a poor man, who has lost all means of livelihood while on  a journey. So none will satisfy my need except Allah and then you. In the Name of Him Who  has given you such nice color and beautiful skin, and so much property, I ask you to give  me a camel so that I may reach my destination. The man replied, &#8216;I have many obligations  (so I cannot give you).&#8217; The angel said, &#8216;I think I know you; were you not a leper to whom  the people had a strong aversion? Weren&#8217;t you a poor man, and then Allah gave you (all  this property).&#8217; He replied, &#8216;(This is all wrong), I got this property through inheritance  from my fore-fathers&#8217; The angel said, &#8216;If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you  as you were before. &#8216; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Then the angel, disguised in the shape and appearance of a  bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same as he told the first one, and he  too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said, &#8216;If you are telling a lie,  then let Allah make you as you were before.&#8217; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The angel, disguised in the shape of a blind man, went to  the blind man and said, &#8216;I am a poor man and a traveler, whose means of livelihood have  been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help me except Allah, and after Him,  you yourself. I ask you in the Name of Him Who has given you back your eye-sight to give  me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my journey&#8217; The man said, &#8216;No doubt, I  was blind and Allah gave me back my eye-sight; I was poor and Allah made me rich; so take  anything you wish from my property. By Allah, I will not stop you for taking anything (you  need) of my property which you may take for Allah&#8217;s sake.&#8217; The angel replied, &#8216;Keep your  property with you. You (i.e 3 men) have been tested and Allah is pleased with you and is  angry with your two companions.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 671: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Umar: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;Once three persons (from the  previous nations) were traveling, and suddenly it started raining and they took shelter in  a cave. The entrance of the cave got closed while they were inside. They said to each  other, &#8216;O you! Nothing can save you except the truth, so each of you should ask Allah&#8217;s  Help by referring to such a deed as he thinks he did sincerely (i.e. just for gaining  Allah&#8217;s Pleasure).&#8217; So one of them said, &#8216;O Allah! You know that I had a laborer who  worked for me for one Faraq (i.e. three Sas) of rice, but he departed, leaving it (i.e.  his wages). I sowed that Faraq of rice and with its yield I bought cows (for him). Later  on when he came to me asking for his wages, I said (to him), &#8216;Go to those cows and drive  them away.&#8217; He said to me, &#8216;But you have to pay me only a Faraq of rice,&#8217; I said to him,  &#8216;Go to those cows and take them, for they are the product of that Faraq (of rice).&#8217; So he  drove them. O Allah! If you consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove  the rock.&#8217; The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. The second one said, &#8216;O  Allah, You know that I had old parents whom I used to provide with the milk of my sheep  every night. One night I was delayed and when I came, they had slept, while my wife and  children were crying with hunger. I used not to let them (i.e. my family) drink unless my  parents had drunk first. So I disliked to wake them up and also disliked that they should  sleep without drinking it, I kept on waiting (for them to wake) till it dawned. O Allah!  If You consider that I did that for fear of you, then please remove the rock.&#8217; So the rock  shifted and they could see the sky through it. The (third) one said, &#8216;O Allah! You know  that I had a cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle&#8217;s daughter) who was most beloved to me and I  sought to seduce her, but she refused, unless I paid her one-hundred Dinars (i.e. gold  pieces). So I collected the amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to sleep with  her. But when I sat between her legs, she said, &#8216;Be afraid of Allah, and do not deflower  me but legally. &#8216;I got up and left the hundred Dinars (for her). O Allah! If You consider  that I did that for fear of you than please remove the rock. So Allah saved them and they  came out (of the cave).&#8221; (This Hadith indicates that one can only ask Allah for help  directly or through his performed good deeds. But to ask Allah through dead or absent  prophets, saints, spirits, holy men, angels etc. is absolutely forbidden in Islam and it  is a kind of disbelief.) </font></p>

(After a while) they passed by a lady who was  being pulled and teased (by the people). The child&#8217;s mother said, &#8216;O Allah! Do not make my  child like her.&#8217; The child said, &#8216;O Allah! Make me like her.&#8217; Then he said, &#8216;As for the  rider, he is an infidel, while the lady is accused of illegal sexual intercourse (falsely)  and she says: Allah is sufficient for me (He knows the truth).&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;Amongst the men of Bani Israel  there was a man who had murdered ninety-nine persons. Then he set out asking (whether his  repentance could be accepted or not). He came upon a monk and asked him if his repentance  could be accepted. The monk replied in the negative and so the man killed him. He kept on  asking till a man advised to go to such and such village. (So he left for it) but death  overtook him on the way. While dying, he turned his chest towards that village (where he  had hoped his repentance would be accepted), and so the angels of mercy and the angels of  punishment quarrelled amongst themselves regarding him. Allah ordered the village (towards  which he was going) to come closer to him, and ordered the village (whence he had come),  to go far away, and then He ordered the angels to measure the distances between his body  and the two villages. So he was found to be one span closer to the village (he was going  to). So he was forgiven.&#8221; </font></p>

A cow speaks!&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;I believe this, and Abu Bakr and &#8216;Umar  too, believe it, although neither of them was present there. While a person was amongst  his sheep, a wolf attacked and took one of the sheep. The man chased the wolf till he  saved it from the wolf, where upon the wolf said, &#8216;You have saved it from me; but who will  guard it on the day of the wild beasts when there will be no shepherd to guard them except  me (because of riots and afflictions)? &#8216; &#8221; The people said surprisingly,  &#8220;Glorified be Allah!

By Allah, if Fatima, the daughter of Muhammad stole, I  would cut off her hand.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;We are the last (to come) but we  will be the foremost on the Day of Resurrection, nations were given the Book (i.e.  Scripture) before us, and we were given the Holy Book after them. This (i.e. Friday) is  the day about which they differed. So the next day (i.e. Saturday) was prescribed for the  Jews and the day after it (i.e. Sunday) for the Christians. It is incumbent on every  Muslim to wash his head and body on a Day (i.e. Friday) (at least) in every seven  days.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When Muawiya bin Abu Sufyan came to Medina for the last  time, he delivered a sermon before us. He took out a tuft of hair and said, &#8220;I never  thought that someone other than the Jews would do such a thing (i.e. use false hair). The  Prophet named such a practice, &#8216;Az-Zur&#8217; (i.e. falsehood),&#8221; meaning the use of false  hair. </font></p>

Those men are the ignorant amongst you. Beware of such hopes as make the people  go astray, for I heard Allah&#8217;s Apostle saying, &#8216;Authority of ruling will remain with  Quraish, and whoever bears hostility to them, Allah will destroy him as long as they abide  by the laws of the religion.&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

(&#8216;Abdullah) bin AzZubair said, &#8221; &#8216;Aisha should be stopped from doing  so.&#8221; (When &#8216;Aisha heard this), she said protestingly, &#8220;Shall I be stopped from  doing so? I vow that I will never talk to &#8216;Abdullah bin Az-Zubair.&#8221; On that, Ibn  Az-Zubair asked some people from Quraish and particularly the two uncles of Allah&#8217;s  Apostle to intercede with her, but she refused (to talk to him). Az-Zuhriyun, the uncles  of the Prophet, including &#8216;Abdur-Rahman bin Al-Aswad bin &#8216;Abd Yaghuth and Al-Miswar bin  Makhrama said to him, &#8220;When we ask for the permission to visit her, enter her house  along with us (without taking her leave).&#8221; He did accordingly (and she accepted their  intercession). He sent her ten slaves whom she manumitted as an expiation for (not  keeping) her vow. &#8216;Aisha manumitted more slaves for the same purpose till she manumitted  forty slaves. She said, &#8220;I wish I had specified what I would have done in case of not  fulfilling my vow when I made the vow, so that I might have done it easily.&#8221; </font></p>

Abu Huraira said, &#8220;The Prophet said, &#8216;I saw Amr bin &#8216;Amir bin  Luhai Al-Khuzai dragging his intestines in the (Hell) Fire, for he was the first man who  started the custom of releasing animals (for the sake of false gods).&#8217; &#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Ibn Abbas: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>When the news of the advent of the Prophet reached Abu  Dhar, he said to his brother, &#8220;Ride to this valley and bring me the news of this man  (i.e. the Prophet ) who claims to be a Prophet receiving information from the Heaven.  Listen to him and then come to me.&#8221; His brother set out till he met the Prophet and  listened to his speech and returned to Abu Dhar and said to him, &#8220;I have seen him  exhorting people to virtues and his speech was not like poetry.&#8221; Abu Dhar said,  &#8220;You have not satisfied me as to what I wanted.&#8221; So, he took his journey-food  and a water-skin full of water and set out till he reached Mecca, where he went to the  Mosque looking for the Prophet , whom he did not know, and he would not like to ask  someone about him. So, a portion of the night had passed when &#8216;Ali saw him and realized  that he was a stranger. Abu Dhar followed him (to his house), but neither of them asked  the other about anything till it was morning, when he carried his water-skin and food and  went to the Mosque. He spent that day without being observed by the Prophet till it was  night, when he returned to his sleeping place. &#8216;Ali again passed by him and said,  &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t the man (i.e. Abu Dhar) recognized his dwelling place yet?&#8221; So, &#8216;Ali let  him get up and took him (to his house), but neither of them asked the other about  anything, till it was the third day when &#8216;Ali had the same experience with him and Abu  Dhar again stayed with him. &#8216;Ali then asked, &#8220;Won&#8217;t you tell me what has brought you  here?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you give me a promise and a convention that you will  guide me, then I will tell you.&#8221; When &#8216;Ali did, Abu Dhar informed him (of his  purpose). &#8216;Ali said, &#8220;It is the Truth, and he (i.e. Muhammad) is the Apostle of  Allah. So when the morning comes, follow me, and if I should perceive any danger  threatening you, I will give you a hint by pretending to go to the watercloset. But if I  carried on walking, follow me till you enter the place that I will enter.&#8221; Abu Dhur  agreed and followed &#8216;Ali till he entered the place of the Prophet and Abu Dhur entered  with him. He then listened to the speech of the Prophet and embraced Islam on that very  spot. The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go back to your people and inform them (of this  religion) till you receive my (further) orders.&#8221; Abu Dhur said, &#8220;By Him in Whose  Hands my life is! I will proclaim my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e.  infidels).&#8221; He went out till he reached the Mosque and announced as loudly as  possible, &#8220;I testify that None has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that  Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah.&#8221; The people then got up and beat him till they  knocked him down. Al-Abbas came and threw himself over him (to protect him) saying, Woe to  you! Don&#8217;t you know that he is from Ghifar and there is the route (road) to your merchants  towards Sham (i.e. through the place where this tribe dwells)?&#8221; Thus he saved him  from them. Abu Dhar did the same on the next day and the people beat him again and  Al-&#8216;Abbas drew himself over him (to save him as before). </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Jamra: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Ibn &#8216;Abbas said to us, &#8220;Shall I tell you the story of  Abu Dhar&#8217;s conversion to Islam?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Abu Dhar  said: I was a man from the tribe of Ghifar. We heard that a man had appeared in Mecca,  claiming to be a Prophet. ! said to my brother, &#8216;Go to that man and talk to him and bring  me his news.&#8217; He set out, met him and returned. I asked him, &#8216;What is the news with you?&#8217;  He said, &#8216;By Allah, I saw a man enjoining what is good and forbidding what is evil.&#8217; I  said to him, &#8216;You have not satisfied me with this little information.&#8217; So, I took a  waterskin and a stick and proceeded towards Mecca. Neither did I know him (i.e. the  Prophet ), nor did I like to ask anyone about him. I Kept on drinking Zam zam water and  staying in the Mosque. Then &#8216;Ali passed by me and said, &#8216;It seems you are a stranger?&#8217; I  said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He proceeded to his house and I accompanied him. Neither did he ask me  anything, nor did I tell him anything. Next morning I went to the Mosque to ask about the  Prophet but no-one told me anything about him. Ali passed by me again and asked, &#8216;Hasn&#8217;t  the man recognized his dwelling place yet&#8217; I said, &#8216;No.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Come along with me.&#8217; He  asked me, &#8216;What is your business? What has brought you to this town?&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;If  you keep my secret, I will tell you.&#8217; He said, &#8216;I will do,&#8217; I said to him, &#8216;We have heard  that a person has appeared here, claiming to be a Prophet. I sent my brother to speak to  him and when he returned, he did not bring a satisfactory report; so I thought of meeting  him personally.&#8217; &#8216;Ali said (to Abu Dhar), &#8216;You have reached your goal; I am going to him  just now, so follow me, and wherever I enter, enter after me. If I should see someone who  may cause you trouble, I will stand near a wall pretending to mend my shoes (as a  warning), and you should go away then.&#8217; &#8216;Ali proceeded and I accompanied him till he  entered a place, and I entered with him to the Prophet to whom I said, &#8216;Present (the  principles of) Islam to me.&#8217; When he did, I embraced Islam &#8216;immediately. He said to me, &#8216;O  Abu Dhar! Keep your conversion as a secret and return to your town; and when you hear of  our victory, return to us. &#8216; I said, &#8216;By H him Who has sent you with the Truth, I will  announce my conversion to Islam publicly amongst them (i.e. the infidels),&#8217; Abu Dhar went  to the Mosque, where some people from Quraish were present, and said, &#8216;O folk of Quraish !  I testify that None has the right to be worshipped except Allah, and I (also) testify that  Muhammad is Allah&#8217;s Slave and His Apostle.&#8217; (Hearing that) the Quraishi men said, &#8216;Get at  this Sabi (i.e. Muslim) !&#8217; They got up and beat me nearly to death. Al &#8216;Abbas saw me and  threw himself over me to protect me. He then faced them and said, &#8216;Woe to you! You want to  kill a man from the tribe of Ghifar, although your trade and your communications are  through the territory of Ghifar?&#8217; They therefore left me. The next morning I returned (to  the Mosque) and said the same as I have said on the previous day. They again said, &#8216;Get at  this Sabi!&#8217; I was treated in the same way as on the previous day, and again Al-Abbas found  me and threw himself over me to protect me and told them the same as he had said the day  before.&#8217; So, that was the conversion of Abu Dhar (may Allah be Merciful to him) to  Islam.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once Allah&#8217;s Apostle went to Al-Batha&#8217; at noon, performed  the ablution and offered&#8217; a two Rakat Zuhr prayer and a two-Rak&#8217;at &#8216;Asr prayer while a  spearheaded stick was planted before him and the passersby were passing in front of it.  (After the prayer), the people got up and held the hands of the Prophet and passed them on  their faces. I also took his hand and kept it on my face and noticed that it was colder  than ice, and its smell was nicer than musk. </font></p>

He used to offer four Rakat, let  alone their beauty and length, and then four Rakat, let alone their beauty and length.  Afterwards he would offer three Rakat.

The first (of the three angels) said, &#8220;Which of them is he?&#8221;  The second said, &#8220;He is the best of them.&#8221; That was all that happened then, and  he did not see them till they came at another night and he perceived their presence with  his heart, for the eyes of the Prophet were closed when he was asleep, but his heart was  not asleep (not unconscious). This is characteristic of all the prophets: Their eyes sleep  but their hearts do not sleep. Then Gabriel took charge of the Prophet and ascended along  with him to the Heaven. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>That they were with the Prophet on a journey. They  travelled the whole night, and when dawn approached, they took a rest and sleep  overwhelmed them till the sun rose high in the sky. The first to get up was Abu Bakr.  Allah&#8217;s Apostles used not to be awakened from his sleep, but he would wake up by himself.  &#8216;Umar woke up and then Abu Bakr sat by the side of the Prophet&#8217;s head and started saying:  Allahu-Akbar raising his voice till the Prophet woke up, (and after traveling for a while)  he dismounted and led us in the morning prayer. A man amongst the people failed to join us  in the prayer. When the Prophet had finished the prayer, he asked (the man), &#8220;O  so-and-so! What prevented you from offering the prayer with us?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;I  am Junub,&#8221; Alllah&#8217;s Apostle ordered him to perform Tayammam with clean earth. The man  then offered the prayer. Allah&#8217;s Apostle ordered me and a few others to go ahead of him.  We had become very thirsty. While we were on our way (looking for water), we came across a  lady (riding an animal), hanging her legs between two water-skins. We asked her,  &#8220;Where can we get water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;Oh ! There is no water.&#8221; We  asked, &#8220;how far is your house from the water?&#8221; She replied, &#8220;A distance of  a day and a night travel.&#8221; We said, &#8220;Come on to Allah&#8217;s Apostle, &#8220;She  asked, &#8220;What is Allah&#8217;s Apostle ?&#8221; So we brought her to Allah&#8217;s Apostle against  her will, and she told him what she had told us before and added that she was the mother  of orphans. So the Prophet ordered that her two water-skins be brought and he rubbed the  mouths of the water-skins. As we were thirsty, we drank till we quenched our thirst and we  were forty men. We also filled all our waterskins and other utensils with water, but we  did not water the camels. The waterskin was so full that it was almost about to burst. The  Prophet then said, &#8220;Bring what (foodstuff) you have.&#8221; So some dates and pieces  of bread were collected for the lady, and when she went to her people, she said, &#8220;I  have met either the greatest magician or a prophet as the people claim.&#8221; So Allah  guided the people of that village through that lady. She embraced Islam and they all  embraced Islam. </font></p>

He asked, &#8216;What is wrong with you?&#8217; They replied, &#8216;We have no water either for performing  ablution or for drinking except what is present in front of you.&#8217; So he placed his hand in  that pot and the water started flowing among his fingers like springs. We all drank and  performed ablution (from it).&#8221; I asked Jabir, &#8220;How many were you?&#8221; he  replied, &#8220;Even if we had been one-hundred-thousand, it would have been sufficient for  us, but we were fifteen-hundred.&#8221; </font></p>

Have you  got any food?&#8221; She said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She brought out some loaves of barley and  took out a veil belonging to her, and wrapped the bread in part of it and put it under my  arm and wrapped part of the veil round me and sent me to Allah&#8217;s Apostle. I went carrying  it and found Allah&#8217;s Apostle in the Mosque sitting with some people. When I stood there,  Allah&#8217;s Apostle asked, &#8220;Has Abu Talha sent you?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221;. He  asked, &#8220;With some food? I said, &#8220;Yes&#8221; Allah&#8217;s Apostle then said to the men  around him, &#8220;Get up!&#8221; He set out (accompanied by them) and I went ahead of them  till I reached Abu Talha and told him (of the Prophet&#8217;s visit). Abu Talha said, &#8220;O Um  Sulaim! Allah&#8217;s Apostle is coming with the people and we have no food to feed them.&#8221;  She said, &#8220;Allah and His Apostle know better.&#8221; So Abu Talha went out to receive  Allah&#8217;s Apostle. Allah&#8217;s Apostle came along with Abu Talha. Allah&#8217;s Apostle said, &#8220;O  Um Sulaim! Bring whatever you have.&#8221; She brought the bread which Allah&#8217;s Apostle  ordered to be broken into pieces. Um Sulaim poured on them some butter from an oilskin.  Then Allah&#8217;s Apostle recited what Allah wished him to recite, and then said, &#8220;Let ten  persons come (to share the meal).&#8221; Ten persons were admitted, ate their fill and went  out. Then he again said, &#8220;Let another ten do the same.&#8221; They were admitted, ate  their fill and went out.

His wife said to him, &#8220;What has detained you from your guests?&#8221; He said,  &#8220;Have you served supper to them?&#8221; She said, &#8220;They refused to take supper)  until you come. They (i.e. some members of the household) presented the meal to them but  they refused (to eat)&#8221; I went to hide myself and he said, &#8220;O Ghunthar!&#8221; He  invoked Allah to cause my ears to be cut and he rebuked me. He then said (to them): Please  eat!&#8221; and added, I will never eat the meal.&#8221; By Allah, whenever we took a  handful of the meal, the meal grew from underneath more than that handful till everybody  ate to his satisfaction; yet the remaining food was more than the original meal. Abu Bakr  saw that the food was as much or more than the original amount. He called his wife,  &#8220;O sister of Bani Firas!&#8221; She said, &#8220;O pleasure of my eyes. The food has  been tripled in quantity.&#8221; Abu Bakr then started eating thereof and said, &#8220;It  (i.e. my oath not to eat) was because of Sa all.&#8221; He took a handful from it, and  carried the rest to the Prophet. SO that food was with the Prophet . There was a treaty  between us and some people, and when the period of that treaty had elapsed, he divided US  into twelve groups, each being headed by a man. Allah knows how many men were under the  command of each leader. Anyhow, the Prophet surely sent a leader with each group. Then all  of them ate of that meal. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Once during the lifetime of Allah&#8217;s Apostle, the people of  Medina suffered from drought. So while the Prophet was delivering a sermon on a Friday a  man got up saying, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! The horses and sheep have perished. Will you  invoke Allah to bless us with rain?&#8221; The Prophet lifted both his hands and invoked.  The sky at that time was as clear as glass. Suddenly a wind blew, raising clouds that  gathered together, and it started raining heavily. We came out (of the Mosque) wading  through the flowing water till we reached our homes. It went on raining till the next  Friday, when the same man or some other man stood up and said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!  The houses have collapsed; please invoke Allah to withhold the rain.&#8221; On that the  Prophet smiled and said, &#8220;O Allah, (let it rain) around us and not on us.&#8221; I  then looked at the clouds to see them separating forming a sort of a crown round Medina. </font></p>

Shall we make a pulpit  for you?&#8221; He replied, &#8220;If you wish.&#8221; So they made a pulpit for him and when  it was Friday, he proceeded towards the pulpit (for delivering the sermon). The date-palm  cried like a child! The Prophet descended (the pulpit) and embraced it while it continued  moaning like a child being quietened. The Prophet said, &#8220;It was crying for (missing)  what it used to hear of religious knowledge given near to it.&#8221; </font></p>

You need not fear those (afflictions) as there is a closed door  between you and them.&#8221; &#8216;Umar asked, &#8220;Will that door be opened or broken?&#8221;  Hudhaifa replied, &#8220;No, it will be broken.&#8221; &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;Then it is very  likely that the door will not be closed again.&#8221; Later on the people asked Hudhaifa,  &#8220;Did &#8216;Umar know what that door meant?&#8221; He said. &#8220;Yes, &#8216;Umar knew it as  everyone knows that there will be night before the tomorrow morning. I narrated to &#8216;Umar  an authentic narration, not lies.&#8221; We dared not ask Hudhaifa; therefore we requested  Masruq who asked him, &#8220;What does the door stand for?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Umar.&#8221;  </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>While I was in the city of the Prophet, a man came and  complained to him (the Prophet, ) of destitution and poverty. Then another man came and  complained of robbery (by highwaymen). The Prophet said, &#8220;Adi! Have you been to  Al-Hira?&#8221; I said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been to it, but I was informed about it.&#8221; He  said, &#8220;If you should live for a long time, you will certainly see that a lady in a  Howdah traveling from Al-Hira will (safely reach Mecca and) perform the Tawaf of the  Ka&#8217;ba, fearing none but Allah.&#8221; I said to myself, &#8220;What will happen to the  robbers of the tribe of Tai who have spread evil through out the country?&#8221; The  Prophet further said. &#8220;If you should live long, the treasures of Khosrau will be  opened (and taken as spoils).&#8221; I asked, &#8220;You mean Khosrau, son of Hurmuz?&#8221;  He said, &#8220;Khosrau, son of Hurmuz; and if you should live long, you will see that one  will carry a handful of gold or silver and go out looking for a person to accept it from  him, but will find none to accept it from him. And any of you, when meeting Allah, will  meet Him without needing an interpreter between him and Allah to interpret for him, and  Allah will say to him: &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I send a messenger to teach you?&#8217; He will say: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Allah  will say: &#8216;Didn&#8217;t I give you wealth and do you favors?&#8217; He will say: &#8216;Yes.&#8217; Then he will  look to his right and see nothing but Hell, and look to his left and see nothing but  Hell.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>&#8216;Adi further said: I heard the Prophet saying, &#8220;Save  yourself from the (Hell) Fire even with half a date (to be given in charity) and if you do  not find a half date, then with a good pleasant word.&#8221; &#8216;Adi added: (later on) I saw a  lady in a Howdah traveling from Al-Hira till she performed the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, fearing  none but Allah. And I was one of those who opened (conquered) the treasures of Khosrau,  son of Hurmuz. If you should live long, you will see what the Prophet Abu-l-Qasim had  said: &#8216;A person will come out with a handful. of gold&#8230;etc. </font></p>

You will see their actions and disapprove of them.&#8221; I said,  &#8220;Will there by any evil after that good?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, there will be some  people who will invite others to the doors of Hell, and whoever accepts their invitation  to it will be thrown in it (by them).&#8221; I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!

They recite Qur&#8217;an but it does  not go beyond their throats (i.e. they do not act on it) and they will desert Islam as an  arrow goes through a victim&#8217;s body, so that the hunter, on looking at the arrow&#8217;s blade,  would see nothing on it; he would look at its Risaf and see nothing: he would look at its  Na,di and see nothing, and he would look at its Qudhadh ( 1 ) and see nothing (neither  meat nor blood), for the arrow has been too fast even for the blood and excretions to  smear. The sign by which they will be recognized is that among them there will be a black  man, one of whose arms will resemble a woman&#8217;s breast or a lump of meat moving loosely.  Those people will appear when there will be differences amongst the people.&#8221; I  testify that I heard this narration from Allah&#8217;s Apostle and I testify that &#8216;Ali bin Abi  Talib fought with such people, and I was in his company. He ordered that the man  (described by the Prophet ) should be looked for. The man was brought and I looked at him  and noticed that he looked exactly as the Prophet had described him. </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I relate the traditions of Allah&#8217;s Apostle to you for I  would rather fall from the sky than attribute something to him falsely. But when I tell  you a thing which is between you and me, then no doubt, war is guile. I heard Allah&#8217;s  Apostle saying, &#8220;In the last days of this world there will appear some young foolish  people who will use (in their claim) the best speech of all people (i.e. the Qur&#8217;an) and  they will abandon Islam as an arrow going through the game. Their belief will not go  beyond their throats (i.e. they will have practically no belief), so wherever you meet  them, kill them, for he who kills them shall get a reward on the Day of  Resurrection.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>We complained to Allah&#8217;s Apostle (of the persecution  inflicted on us by the infidels) while he was sitting in the shade of the Ka&#8217;ba, leaning  over his Burd (i.e. covering sheet). We said to him, &#8220;Would you seek help for us?  Would you pray to Allah for us?&#8221; He said, &#8220;Among the nations before you a  (believing) man would be put in a ditch that was dug for him, and a saw would be put over  his head and he would be cut into two pieces; yet that (torture) would not make him give  up his religion. His body would be combed with iron combs that would remove his flesh from  the bones and nerves, yet that would not make him abandon his religion. By Allah, this  religion (i.e. Islam) will prevail till a traveler from Sana (in Yemen) to Hadrarmaut will  fear none but Allah, or a wolf as regards his sheep, but you (people) are hasty. </font></p>

He asked Thabit, &#8220;What&#8217;s the  matter?&#8221; Thabit replied, &#8220;An evil situation: A man used to raise his voice over  the voice of the Prophet and so all his good deeds have been annulled and he is from the  people of Hell.&#8221; The man went back and told the Prophet that Thabit had said  so-and-so. (The sub-narrator, Musa bin Anas said, &#8220;The man went to Thabit again with  glad tidings).&#8221; The Prophet said to him, &#8220;Go and say to Thabit: &#8216;You are not  from the people of Fire, but from the people of Paradise.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Al-Bara&#8217; bin &#8216;Azib: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Abu Bakr came to my father who was at home and purchased a  saddle from him. He said to &#8216;Azib. &#8220;Tell your son to carry it with me.&#8221; So I  carried it with him and my father followed us so as to take the price (of the saddle). My  father said, &#8220;O Abu Bakr! Tell me what happened to you on your night journey with  Allah&#8217;s Apostle (during Migration).&#8221; He said, &#8220;Yes, we travelled the whole night  and also the next day till midday. when nobody could be seen on the way ( because of the  severe heat) . Then there appeared a long rock having shade beneath it, and the sunshine  had not come to it yet. So we dismounted there and I levelled a place and covered it with  an animal hide or dry grass for the Prophet to sleep on (for a while). I then said,  &#8216;Sleep, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle, and I will guard you.&#8217; So he slept and I went out to guard him.  Suddenly I saw a shepherd coming with his sheep to that rock with the same intention we  had when we came to it. I asked (him). &#8216;To whom do you belong, O boy?&#8217; He replied, &#8216;I  belong to a man from Medina or Mecca.&#8217; I said, &#8216;Do your sheep have milk?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217;  I said, &#8216;Will you milk for us?&#8217; He said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; He caught hold of a sheep and I asked him  to clean its teat from dust, hairs and dirt. (The sub-narrator said that he saw Al-Bara&#8217;  striking one of his hands with the other, demonstrating how the shepherd removed the  dust.) The shepherd milked a little milk in a wooden container and I had a leather  container which I carried for the Prophet to drink and perform the ablution from. I went  to the Prophet, hating to wake him up, but when I reached there, the Prophet had already  awakened; so I poured water over the middle part of the milk container, till the milk was  cold. Then I said, &#8216;Drink, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He drank till I was pleased. Then he asked,  &#8216;Has the time for our departure come?&#8217; I said, &#8216;Yes.&#8217; So we departed after midday. Suraqa  bin Malik followed us and I said, &#8216;We have been discovered, O Allah&#8217;s Apostle!&#8217; He said,  Don&#8217;t grieve for Allah is with us.&#8217; The Prophet invoked evil on him (i.e. Suraqa) and so  the legs of his horse sank into the earth up to its belly. (The subnarrator, Zuhair is not  sure whether Abu Bakr said, &#8220;(It sank) into solid earth.&#8221;) Suraqa said, &#8216;I see  that you have invoked evil on me. Please invoke good on me, and by Allah, I will cause  those who are seeking after you to return.&#8217; The Prophet invoked good on him and he was  saved. Then, whenever he met somebody on the way, he would say, &#8216;I have looked for him  here in vain.&#8217; So he caused whomever he met to return. Thus Suraqa fulfilled his  promise.&#8221; </font></p>

No, for  it is a fever which boils in (the body of) an old man, and will lead him to the  grave.&#8221; The Prophet said, &#8220;Yes, then may it be as you say.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>There was a Christian who embraced Islam and read  Surat-al-Baqara and Al-Imran, and he used to write (the revelations) for the Prophet.  Later on he returned to Christianity again and he used to say: &#8220;Muhammad knows  nothing but what I have written for him.&#8221; Then Allah caused him to die, and the  people buried him, but in the morning they saw that the earth had thrown his body out.  They said, &#8220;This is the act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the grave of our  companion and took his body out of it because he had run away from them.&#8221; They again  dug the grave deeply for him, but in the morning they again saw that the earth had thrown  his body out. They said, &#8220;This is an act of Muhammad and his companions. They dug the  grave of our companion and threw his body outside it, for he had run away from them.&#8221;  They dug the grave for him as deep as they could, but in the morning they again saw that  the earth had thrown his body out. So they believed that what had befallen him was not  done by human beings and had to leave him thrown (on the ground). </font></p>

He stood before Musailama (and his companions) and said, &#8220;If you asked me even this  piece (of a leaf), I would not give it to you. You cannot avoid the fate you are destined  to, by Allah. If you reject Islam, Allah will destroy you. I think that you are most  probably the same person whom I have seen in the dream.&#8221; Abu Huraira told me that  Allah&#8217;s Apostle; said, &#8220;While I was sleeping, I saw (in a dream) two gold bracelets  round my arm, and that worried me too much. Then I was instructed divinely in my dream, to  blow them off and so I blew them off, and they flew away. I interpreted the two bracelets  as symbols of two liars who would appear after me. And so one of them was Al-Ansi and the  other was Musailama Al-Kadhdhab from Al-Yamama.&#8221; </font></p>

I thought that it was Al-Yamama or  Hajar, but it came to be Medina i.e. Yathrib. In the same dream I saw myself moving a  sword and its blade got broken. It came to symbolize the defeat which the Muslims suffered  from, on the Day of Uhud. I moved the sword again, and it became normal as before, and  that was the symbol of the victory Allah bestowed upon Muslims and their gathering  together. I saw cows in my dream, and by Allah, that was a blessing, and they symbolized  the believers on the Day of Uhud. And the blessing was the good Allah bestowed upon us and  the reward of true belief which Allah gave us after the day of Badr. </font></p>

Umaiya  said to Sad, &#8220;Will you wait till midday when the people are (at their homes), then  you may go and perform the Tawaf round the Ka&#8217;ba?&#8221; So, while Sad was going around the  Ka&#8217;ba, Abu Jahl came and asked, &#8220;Who is that who is performing Tawaf?&#8221; Sad  replied, &#8220;I am Sad.&#8221; Abu Jahl said, &#8220;Are you circumambulating the Ka&#8217;ba  safely although you have given refuge to Muhammad and his companions?&#8221; Sad said,  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; and they started quarreling. Umaiya said to Sad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t shout at  Abi-l-Hakam (i.e. Abu Jahl), for he is chief of the valley (of Mecca).&#8221; Sad then said  (to Abu Jahl). &#8216;By Allah, if you prevent me from performing the Tawaf of the Ka&#8217;ba, I will  spoil your trade with Sham.&#8221; Umaiya kept on saying to Sad, &#8220;Don&#8217;t raise your  voice.&#8221; and kept on taking hold of him. Sad became furious and said, (to Umaiya),  &#8220;Be away from me, for I have heard Muhammad saying that he will kill you.&#8221;  Umaiiya said, &#8220;Will he kill me?&#8221; Sad said, &#8220;Yes,.&#8221; Umaiya said,  &#8220;By Allah! When Muhammad says a thing, he never tells a lie.&#8221; Umaiya went to his  wife and said to her, &#8220;Do you know what my brother from Yathrib (i.e. Medina) has  said to me?&#8221; She said, &#8220;What has he said?&#8221; He said, &#8220;He claims that he  has heard Muhammad claiming that he will kill me.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>She said, By Allah!

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Jews came to Allah&#8217;s Apostle and told him that a man  and a woman from amongst them had committed illegal sexual intercourse. Allah&#8217;s Apostle  said to them, &#8220;What do you find in the Torah (old Testament) about the legal  punishment of Ar-Rajm (stoning)?&#8221; They replied, (But) we announce their crime and  lash them.&#8221; Abdullah bin Salam said, &#8220;You are telling a lie; Torah contains the  order of Rajm.&#8221; They brought and opened the Torah and one of them solaced his hand on  the Verse of Rajm and read the verses preceding and following it. Abdullah bin Salam said  to him, &#8220;Lift your hand.&#8221; When he lifted his hand, the Verse of Rajm was written  there. They said, &#8220;Muhammad has told the truth; the Torah has the Verse of Rajm. The  Prophet then gave the order that both of them should be stoned to death. (&#8216;Abdullah bin  &#8216;Umar said, &#8220;I saw the man leaning over the woman to shelter her from the  stones.&#8221; </font></p>

Then he sold one of the sheep for  one Dinar, and brought one Dinar and a sheep to the Prophet. On that, the Prophet invoked  Allah to bless him in his deals. So &#8216;Urwa used to gain (from any deal) even if he bought  dust.

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Volume 4, Book 56, Number 839: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Abu Huraira: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet said, &#8220;A horse may be kept for one of  three purposes: for a man it may be a source of reward; for another it may be a means of  living; and for a third it may be a burden (a source of committing sins). As for the one  for whom it is a source of reward, he is the one who keeps his horse for the sake of Jihad  in Allah&#8217;s Cause; he ties it with a long rope on a pasture or in a garden. So whatever its  rope allows it to eat, will be regarded as good rewardable deeds (for its owner). And if  it breaks off its rope and jumps over one or two hillocks, even its dung will be  considered amongst his good deeds. And if it passes by a river and drinks water from it,  that will be considered as good deeds for his benefit) even if he has had no intention of  watering it. A horse is a shelter for the one who keeps it so that he may earn his living  honestly and takes it as a refuge to keep him from following illegal ways (of gaining  money), and does not forget the rights of Allah (i.e. paying the Zakat and allowing others  to use it for Allah&#8217;s Sake). But a horse is a burden (and a source of committing sins for  him who keeps it out of pride and pretense and with the intention of harming the  Muslims.&#8221; </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>The Prophet was asked about donkeys. He replied,  &#8220;Nothing has been revealed to be concerning them except this comprehensive Verse  (which covers everything) :&#8211;&#8216;Then whosoever has done good equal to the weight of an atom  (or a small ant), Shall see it (its reward) And whosoever has done evil equal to the  weight of an atom (or a small ) ant), Shall see it (Its punishment).&#8221; (99.7-8) </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Narrated Anas bin Malik: </font></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>Allah&#8217;s Apostle reached Khaibar in the early morning and  the people of Khaibar came out with their spades, and when they saw the Prophet they said,  &#8220;Muhammad and his army!&#8221; and returned hurriedly to take refuge in the fort. The  Prophet raised his hands and said, &#8220;Allah is Greater! Khaibar is ruined ! If we  approach a nation, then miserable is the morning of those who are warned.&#8221; </font></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><font>I said, &#8220;O Allah&#8217;s Apostle! I hear many narrations  from you but I forget them.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Spread your covering sheet.&#8221; I  spread my sheet and he moved both his hands as if scooping something and emptied them in  the sheet and said, &#8220;Wrap it.&#8221; I wrapped it round my body, and since then I have  never forgotten a single Hadith. </font></p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">In the Book of Medicine of his Sahih, <strong>Al-Bukhari</strong> recorded that `A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;The Messenger of Allah was bewitched until he thought that he had relations with his wives, but he had not had relations with them.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Sufyan said, &#8220;This is the worst form of magic when it reaches this stage.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So the Prophet said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">O `A&#8217;ishah! Do you know that Allah has answered me concerning that which I asked Him.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Two men came to me and one of them sat by my head while the other sat by my feet.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The one who was sitting by my head said to the other one, `What is wrong with this man&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other replied, `He is bewitched.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one said, `Who bewitched him&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other replied, `Labid bin A`sam. He is a man from the tribe of Banu Zurayq who is an ally of the Jews, and a hypocrite.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one asked, `With what (did he bewitch him)&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other replied, `With a comb and hair from the comb.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The first one asked, `Where (is the comb)&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The other answered, `In the dried bark of a male date palm under a rock in a well called Dharwan.&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">`A&#8217;ishah said, &#8220;So he went to the well to remove it (the comb with the hair).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then he said,</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is the well that I saw. It was as if its water had henna soaked in it and its palm trees were like the heads of devils.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So he removed it (of the well). Then I (`A&#8217;ishah) said, `Will you not make this public&#8217;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">He replied, (Allah has cured me and I hate to spread (the news of) wickedness to any of the people.)&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>How come that the Messenger of Allah was bewitched? </strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Q 6: <span style="color:#993300;">How come that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was bewitched when Allah addresses him saying: <span style="color:#008000;">Allâh will protect you from mankind</span>. How could he suffer the influence of magic at the time when he was responsible for conveying the Divine Revelation to the Muslims? Kindly explain the statement of the Mushriks (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) in the Qur&#8217;an: <span style="color:#008000;">You follow none but a bewitched man</span>. Please, clarify and answer the misconceptions! </span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">A 6: According to an authentic Hadith, this incident of bewitching took place in Al-Madinah. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) started to receive Divine Revelation regularly, proofs of the truthfulness of his prophethood were established and Allah&#8217;s victory was granted to him over the disbelievers who felt disgraced. At that time, a man from the Jews called Labid ibn Al-A`sam bewitched him by sticking one of the Prophet&#8217;s hairs to a comb. The Prophet (peace be upon him) started imagining that he had done a thing, which in fact he had not done. Despite being affected by magic, the Prophet (peace be upon him) was conscious of every single word he spoke to people. He would speak the words inspired to him by Allah (Exalted be He). However, the spell that was cast on him affected his intimate relation with his wives. `Aishah (may Allah be please with her) said: <span style="color:#008000;">Once the Prophet was bewitched so that he began to imagine that he had done a thing which in fact he had not done</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It was only when Jibril (Gabriel) (peace be upon him) told him about what had happened to him that the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent someone to bring the spell out from a well belonging to one of the Al-Ansar (the Helpers, inhabitants of Madinah who supported the Prophet). When he was rid of it, the spell was broken by Allah&#8217;s grace. <strong>It was then that Allah (Exalted be He) revealed the two Surahs, which came to be known as Al-Mu`awwidhatayn (Surahs Al-Falaq and Al-Nas)</strong>. When the Prophet (peace be upon him) recited them, he was cured. Praising these two Surahs, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said:<strong> <span style="color:#008000;">No one can use anything that is equal to these two Surahs in seeking refuge in Allah</span></strong>. The fact that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was bewitched did not affect his conveying of the Islamic Message nor were the people around him affected by that. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) protected him from failing to convey the Message of Islam to people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Like all other prophets, Muhammad (peace be upon him) suffered several types of physical pain. For example, in the battle of Uhud, his face was wounded by the rings of his helmet that pierced his temples, his lower lip bled, and one of his teeth was broken. He also fell into a pit. The disbelievers also tightened a net around him in Makkah. He suffered pain like all the prophets who preceded him. Allah (Exalted be He) raised him to greater ranks and doubled his reward for his patient endurance of suffering and oppression at the hands of the disbelievers. Regarding the Ayah which reads: (<strong>Allâh will protect you from mankind&#8230;</strong>), it means that Allah (Exalted be He) will protect the Prophet (peace be upon him) from the disbelievers&#8217; conspiracy to kill him and from their attempt to prevent him from conveying the Message of Islam.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Pillar:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Muhammadin kamaa Salayta &#8216;alaa ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali ibraaheema Innaka Hameedun Majeed&#8221;</span> [O Allaah, send your praises upon Muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you sent praises upon Ibraaheem and the family of Ibraaheem. Verily, You are Most-Praiseworthy, Most Glorified]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This version of the tashahhud is well known. There are other forms of it as well.You may memorize whichever wording of the tashahhud that you like. However, choose one that is agreed upon. And if you hear someone using a tashahhud that varies from this one, do not condemn him.Tha same could be said about sending Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) if you have memorized the version mentioned here by the author. There are other ways of saying it as well. And we have stated many times that there exists many ways of doing it. Perhaps all of these ways (of sending salaat on the Prophet) have been gathered together by the great Scholar Ibn Al-Qavvim in his book which is unique in its subject: Jalaa-ul-Afhaam fis-Salaati &#8216;alaa Khair-il-Anaam.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Salaat mentioned here (i.e. above) is known as the Abrahamic Salaat. The most comprehensive form of it is the one that has been agreed upon, which is:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Aali Muhammad kamaa salaita &#8216;alaa Ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali Ibraaheem. Innaka Hameedun Majeed. Wa Baarik Muhammadin wa &#8216;alaa Aali Muhammad kamaa baarakta &#8216;alaa Ibraaheema wa &#8216;alaa Aali Ibraaheem. Innaka Hameedun Majeed.&#8221;</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This manner of saying it is agreed upon. And there are many other ways. However you should take note that none of the versions of the Abrahamic Salaat that have been recorded by Ibn Al-Qayyim in his afore-mentioned book contain an mention of the word &#8220;Sayyidinaa&#8221; our master) such as: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">Many of our sensitive Muslim brothers, if you don&#8217;t say &#8220;<strong>Sayyidinaa</strong>&#8221; when sending Salaat and just say &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8221; , will perhaps think bad thoughts about you and say: &#8220;This person doesn&#8217;t have any respect for Allaah&#8217;s Messenger!&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">In fact, this very thing actually did happen, for one time a Moroccan man on Hajj told me: &#8220;0 Shaikh! I have attended your lessons from the first class till now while traveling. But I notice about you that when you send Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), you say &#8216; Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8217; and I never heard you once say: &#8216; Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8217; Why is this O Shaikh?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">He asked a good question and I clarified the matter to him, thus reducing the irritation found in him since he would become very annoyed whenever he would hear someone send Salaat on the Prophet and not say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli Sayyidinaa Muhammad.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;">The Muslim common-folk do not make any distinction in matters. Perhaps they think that someone who leaves out the word &#8220;Sayyidinaa&#8221; does not respect the Prophet and does not love him in the manner that he deserves.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;padding-left:30px;"><span style="color:#993300;">The reply: This is ignorance. It may even be called compound ignorance. Compound ignorance is when someone is ignorant and he doesn&#8217;t know that he is ignorant. If you don&#8217;t know that you don&#8217;t know something then this is ignorance on top of ignorance. So what is it that someone with ignorance attached to him knows? Nothing!</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point is that Muhammad, the Messenger of Allaah (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is our leader (Sayyid). He is the leader of all of mankind &#8211; all of the descendants of Aadam. This is what I worship Allaah with. We must believe this, in accordance with what he has informed us: &#8220;I am the Sayyid (leader) of mankind on the Day of Judgement. I am the Sayyid (leader) of the children of Aadam, and I do not say this to boast&#8221; We are obligated to believe that he is the Sayyid (leader) of all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">But in spite of this, when he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) taught the Companions how to send Salaat on him and when he dictated the Abrahamic Salaat to them during the revelation of the ayah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;">&#8220;Verily Allaah and His Angels send Salaat (praises) on the Prophet. O you who believe, send your praises (Salaat) and greetings (Salaam) on him&#8221;</span> [Surah Al-Ahzaab: 56]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When this ayah was revealed, the Companions asked: &#8220;0 Messenger of Allaah(Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), you have already taught us how to send greetings (of Salaam) upon you, but we have been ordered to (also) send praises (Salaat) upon you, so how do we send Salaat on you?&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">It is possible that this sort of questioning occurred in several different gatherings based on the fact that there are numerous manners of sending Salaat on the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam). The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) taught his Companions to say it like this: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad.&#8221; This does not mean that he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) revoked his status of leadership and that he was no longer a Sayyid.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">You have noted that at times the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) would condemn people in certain circumstances who would make statements that were understood to contain exaggeration and extremism with regard to himself. He (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) would condemn the one who said: &#8220;You are our Sayyid (leader), son of our Sayyid. And you are the best among us, son of the best among us&#8221; even though he really is the Sayyid (leader) of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">However, he did this because he feared that this man was being afflicted with extremism. Going to extremes with regard to the righteous people is one of the main causes of others being worshipped besides Allaah. So in order to protect the sanctuary of Tawheed, he told him no. He forbade him from (saying) that, saying: &#8220;I am only a slave, so say: &#8216;The slave and messenger of Alhall.'&#8221; This was even in spite of his prior statement in which he announced that he was the Sayyid (leader) of the children of Aadam. However, there is no contradiction between this statement and that statement since each situation warrants its own statement depending on its circumstances.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The situation in which the Prophet condemned the man was a situation that warranted such a condemnation and warning, whereas the situation in which he (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) announced he was the Sayyid (of mankind) was due to the fact that he was talking about his (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) intercession. So he was clarifying its reality the reality that he is the Sayyid (leader) of all of mankind.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The point we are trying to make here is: Sending Salaat on the Prophet should be done by using one of the versions that have been reported in the texts. You should not add the phrase Sayyidina (our leader) to it even though the Prophet is our Sayyid. I hope that this point is understood. Furthermore, after making this point clear, I would like to reiterate that we must believe and affirm, in accordance with his report, that the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) is our Sayyid (leader). However, when sending Salaat upon him, we should not say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Sayyidinaa.&#8221; Rather we should just say: &#8220;Allaahumma Salli &#8216;alaa Muhammad&#8221; since this would be following his example, implementing his teachings, and carrying out his instructions.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This statement stuns some people, which is why I must say again that the scholars have unanimously agreed that it is not permissible for a Muslim who wants to worship Allaah through words of supplication that have been reported in the texts to add, subtract, change or replace any of those words.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The scholars of Hadeeth, with their intricate memory and understanding of the texts, use as evidence one single report, which others perhaps are not aware of the basis of proof found in it. This report is about the time when the Prophet taught one of his Companions the supplication one should make when going to bed. The supplication contains the following words:</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">&#8220;Aamantu bi-Kitaabik aladhee anzalta wa Nabee&#8217;ik aladhee arsalta.&#8221;<br>
I believe in Your Book that You revealed and in Your Prophet that You sent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This Companion began to repeat this supplication in order to memorize it, but then on one occasion, said: &#8220;&#8230;wa Rasoolik aladhee arsalta&#8221; , i.e. &#8220;&#8230;in Your Messenger that You sent.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What did he do? He replaced the word &#8220;Nabee&#8221; (Prophet) with the word &#8220;Rasool&#8221; (Messenger). This Companion then narrated that: &#8220;The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam), tapped my chest and said: &#8220;No, say: Wa Nabee&#8217;ik aladhee arsalta.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This is clear proof that it is not proper for a person who wishes to follow Allaah&#8217;s Messenger (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and abide by his teachings to add, subtract, change or replace (these supplications) based on his own accord. The &#8220;Messenger&#8221; and &#8220;Prophet&#8221; are two valid titles for Prophet Muhammad. However, we cannot change the supplication from the manner in which it was reported since that is the way the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) stated it.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) does not speak from his own desire. So these were revealed to the Prophet (Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) through revelation from Allaah. Meaning: The legislation of these words of remembrance that are to be said at the time of sleeping came down from the heavrns. So if something was revealed to the Prophet(Sallallaahu alaihi wa Sallam) and he conveyed it to his, Companions in the same manner in which it was sent down, it would not be proper for the Companions to change that. And we should follow their example, and Allaah knows best.</p>

		<p style="text-align:justify;">The Dream of the Prophet Sallalahu Alaihi wa Sallam</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Sahih Bukhari</strong> Volume 9, Book 87, Number 171: [<small>Interpretation of Dreams ]</small> : <span style="line-height:1.5em;">Narrated Samura bin Jundub</span><strong style="line-height:1.5em;">:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allah’s Apostle very often used to ask his companions, “Did anyone of you see a dream?” So dreams would be narrated to him by those whom Allah wished to tell.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">One morning the Prophet said,</p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<p>“Last night two persons came to me (in a dream) and woke me up and said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>I set out with them and we came across a man Lying down, and behold, another man was standing over his head, holding a big rock. Behold, he was throwing the rock at the man’s head, injuring it. The rock rolled away and the thrower followed it and took it back. By the time he reached the man, his head returned to the normal state. The thrower then did the same as he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded and came to a man Lying flat on his back and another man standing over his head with an iron hook, and behold, he would put the hook in one side of the man’s mouth and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck) and similarly tear his nose from front to back and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other side of the man’s face and did just as he had done with the other side. He hardly completed this side when the other side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to it to repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, ‘Subhan Allah! Who are these two persons?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded and came across something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread).” I think the Prophet said, “In that oven there was much noise and voices.” The Prophet added, “We looked into it and found naked men and women, and behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them, they cried loudly. I asked them, ‘Who are these?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed!’</p>
<p>And so we proceeded and came across a river.” I think he said, “…. red like blood.” The Prophet added, “And behold, in the river there was a man swimming, and on the bank there was a man who had collected many stones. Behold. while the other man was swimming, he went near him. The former opened his mouth and the latter (on the bank) threw a stone into his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. He returned and every time the performance was repeated, I asked my two companions, ‘Who are these (two) persons?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>And we proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive appearance, you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire and he was kindling it and running around it. I asked my companions, ‘Who is this (man)?’ They said to me, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense vegetation, having all sorts of spring colors. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall man and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, ‘Who is this?’ They replied, ‘Proceed! Proceed!’</p>
<p>So we proceeded till we came to a majestic huge garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, ‘Go up and I went up’ The Prophet added, “So we ascended till we reached a city built of gold and silver bricks and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it, men with one side of their bodies as handsome as the handsomest person you have ever seen, and the other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared and they became in the best shape.” The Prophet further added, “My two companions (angels) said to me, ‘This place is the Eden Paradise, and that is your place.’ I raised up my sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me, ‘That (palace) is your place.’ I said to them, ‘May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.’ They replied, ‘As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day)</p>
<p>I said to them, ‘I have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?’<br>
They replied, ‘We will inform you:</p>
<p>As for the first man you came upon whose head was being injured with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Quran and then neither recites it nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers.</p>
<p>As for the man you came upon whose sides of mouth, nostrils and eyes were torn off from front to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells so many lies that it spreads all over the world. And</p>
<p>those naked men and women whom you saw in a construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers and the adulteresses;,</p>
<p>and the man whom you saw swimming in the river and given a stone to swallow, is the eater of usury (Riba) and</p>
<p>the bad looking man whom you saw near the fire kindling it and going round it, is Malik, the gatekeeper of Hell and</p>
<p>the tall man whom you saw in the garden, is Abraham and the children around him are those children who die with Al-Fitra (the Islamic Faith).”</p>
<p>The narrator added: Some Muslims asked the Prophet, “O Allah’s Apostle! What about the children of pagans?” The Prophet replied, “And also the children of pagans.”</p>
<p>The Prophet added, “My two companions added,</p>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div>
<p>‘The men you saw half handsome and half ugly were those persons who had mixed an act that was good with another that was bad, but Allah forgave them.’”</p>
