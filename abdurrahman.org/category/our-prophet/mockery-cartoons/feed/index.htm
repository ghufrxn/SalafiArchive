										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Question</strong>: <span style="color:#993300;">Some haters of Islam often say that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) married a &#8220;six-years old child,&#8221; referring to &#8216;Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her. What is the response?</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The Answer:</strong> &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s covenant of marriage was conducted when she was six years old, but the actual commencement of the marriage took place when she was nine-years of age. She was the only virgin he married. Marrying at such young age was not the exception in Arabia at that time. In fact many were married in the young age period of 9-12 when they were physically mature. Furthermore, had this been something degrading and immoral, the enemies of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) from the Pagans would have loved to use this against the character of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and &#8216;Aisha&#8217;s father (Abu Bakr, may Allah be please with him), the first one to believe the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) and support his propagation of Islam. Not to mention this would have been a major block against the spread of Islam amongst the Arabs if the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) would appear as a man of &#8220;uncontrolled sexual drive.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This would have been obvious to resort to, especially when it is known that they accused the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) of many other things like being a magician, a poet, etc. The fact that they did not attempt even to consider this marriage as a tool against the integrity of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) stands as a strong irrefutable evidence that such marriages were of the norm, not the exception. In so many societies, it was even considered that the girl who does not get married before she reaches fifteen years of age as someone being &#8220;late&#8221; on the scale of marriage timing! In fact such marriages were common in Asia, East Europe, Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On the other hand, it was known that one of the Pagans (Jubair bin Mut&#8217;im bin &#8216;Adiye) was interested to marry &#8216;Aaisha before her engagement to the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), but her mother (Umm Romaan, may Allah be please with her), rejected him. This proves that she was physically mature for marriage. Her family sought the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) because of his noble character as her mother asserted when she told her husband (Abu Bakr صلى الله عليه و سلم) of her intent.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There was a great wisdom in her marriage whereby &#8216;Aaisha witnessed the revelation and the rulings of Islam pertaining to the most particular and private matters of women, transmitting that to the men and women of the world. She reported about 2100 narrations from the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) covering rulings, worships, and transactions . She was the greatest woman scholar in Islam and she had many students of knowledge from the companions of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>As to the often-raised question:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Why did Allah permit the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم) more than four wives while limiting the number to four for the rest of the Muslim men (Qur&#8217;aan 4: 3)?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>The answer:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This matter is from the particularities that Allah gave him. In contrast, there are certain rulings that are allowed for the general Muslims but not permitted for the Prophet (صلى الله عليه و سلم), like taking charity.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Furthermore, many things pertaining to rulings and/or miracles were made particular to Prophets and Messengers before. Of all the Prophets and Messengers, five were distinguished the most (Noah, Abraham. Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad, peace be upon them all), and Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم) was further distinguished as the leader of all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that there are great and noble wisdoms for such particularizations. We are not commanded, however, to search and find them, especially if such search arises from objection to the decree of Allah or due to certain doubts concerning it. This often comes from deviants and/or enemies of Islam. Nothing of this of course occurs from the believers.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#000000;">The position of the Muslims regarding the wisdoms behind matters of Islam should be as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">If they see any clear wisdom(s) relevant to these matters, then they take by it and thank Allah for that, and if not</span></strong></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">then they ask the people of knowledge, and</span></strong></li>
<li style="text-align:justify;"><strong><span style="color:#000000;">in case there is no apparent wisdom reached at by the people of knowledge, then they say: &#8220;Allah Knows Best,&#8221; and they should not resort to any speculation lest they end up forging lies against Allah.</span></strong></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><span style="color:#008000;">The Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) cannot by defended by oppression and misguidance</span><br />
</strong>Compiled by <strong>Aboo Sufyaan &#8216;Uthmaan Beecher<br />
<a href="http://salafiyyah-kuwait.blogspot.in/2012/09/the-prophet-cannot-by-defended-by.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">http://salafiyyah-kuwait.blogspot.in/</a></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Verily all praise is due to Allaah, and may peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and his Companions, one and all.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">To proceed&#8230;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">No Muslim would ever agree with the mocking, ridicule, and blasphemous lies directed at our Deen and at our beloved Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  Rather the Imaams of Ahlus-Sunnah, the likes of Maalik, al-Layth, Ahmad, Ishaaq, and ash-Shaafi’ee, have agreed unanimously that the one who mocks, ridicules, and defames the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) has disbelieved, and that the prescribed punishment for the one who lives in the lands of the Muslims and does that is death, a punishment that falls under the authority of the Muslim ruler.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">There is no doubt that these types of attacks on our Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) will cause anger and make the stomach of every Muslim turn due to his love for Allaah, His Messenger, and His Deen.  But the Muslim who is truthful, sincere, and just, he doesn’t allow himself to be overcome by emotion and respond to these attacks with a knee-jerk reaction that entails actions which Allaah and His Messenger have prohibited.  Rather, like in all matters, he is first and foremost patient, and then he takes those matters back to the Qur’aan and Sunnah and the understanding of the Companions, and those ‘Ulamaa’ who are firmly-grounded in knowledge.  So he is patient and he plants his feet squarely upon knowledge, and he submits to what Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) have decreed.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger, and those of you who have been placed in authority (over you). (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it back to Allaah and His Messenger, if you truly believe in Allaah and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.”</em></span> [1]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And al-Haafith Ibn Katheer mentions that “those of you who have been placed in authority (over you)”, according to Ibn ‘Abbaas, Mujaahid,  ‘Ataa’ and others from the Salaf refers to the ‘Ulamaa’. And Ibn Katheer mentions that it is general to both the rulers and the ‘Ulamaa’.  And of course this means the ‘Ulamaa’ of Ahlus-Sunnah, not those who ahlul-bid’ah call scholars, the likes of al-Qaradaawee, al-‘Awdah, ‘Abdur-Rahmaan ‘Abdul-Khaaliq, and other than them from the callers to misguidance.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">What has transpired over the past few days in the lands of the Muslims and other than them as a reaction to the film attacking Islaam and insulting our beloved Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) &#8211; contradicts the guidance and Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  One should remember that these types of attacks are not something new.  Indeed Allaah mentions throughout the Qur’aan that His messengers (عليهم الصلاة و السلام) were constantly mocked and defamed, that their people called them crazy, mad, and even labeled them as sorcerers, etc.  Allaah تعالى said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Likewise, no Messenger came to those before them except that they said: &#8220;A sorcerer or a madman!&#8221;</span></em> [2]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And this happened with the Prophets and Messengers from Nooh (عليه السلام) up to His final Messenger, Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">In the lifetime of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) there were those who cursed and insulted him openly.  Ka’b bin al-Ashraf al-Yahoodee, in al-Madeenah, used to recite defamatory poetry about him and made explicit poetry about the women of the Muslims.  And there was ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal in Makkah, who had two female singers who he had sing songs making fun of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">As for Ka’b bin al-Ashraf, when he returned from Makkah to al-Madeenah and began reciting his poetry insulting him, the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) asked his Companions, “<em><strong>Who will deal with Ka’b bin al-Ashraf? For indeed he has harmed Allaah and His Messenger</strong></em>.”  And this was when the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was in his dawlah in al-Madeenah and he was the ruler, and Ka’b bin al-Ashraf was living under his authority in al-Madeenah.  But the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) didn’t ask his Companions to punish his neighbors, companions, or even his family members for what Ka’b bin al-Ashraf did.  Nor did he punish the representatives of his tribe, Banu an-Nadeer, or randomly target the Jews of al-Madeenah nor did he boycott their businesses.   Any person of sound intellect would agree that this would be unjust and defies logic, not to mention the texts of the Book and the Sunnah.  Instead he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) -as the ruler &#8211; dealt with Ka’b bin al-Ashraf, the one who caused that harm specifically.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8212;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"> ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal was in Makkah, and he had two female singers who he taught to sing songs making fun of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  And at that time, the Prophet was in al-Madeenah, and was the ruler (صلى الله عليه وسلم), and never did he attack anyone from the kuffaar in al-Madeenah or any other town or village as retribution for the defamation and insults of ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal towards him.  Nor did he command his Companions to attack Makkah or its people because of him. Rather he was patient (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and did not oppress, and did not transgress.  He was patient and he was just (صلى الله عليه وسلم). So when the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) conquered Makkah, and he entered Makkah with his armies, he ordered them not to harm anyone who did not fight them, except for a small group of people who he named by name (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  From them – and here the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) had conquered Makkah, and had might and capability (qudrah) – from them was ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal and his two songstresses.  He didn’t tell them to kill Ibn Khatal’s neighbors or his family members. He didn’t  destroy the property of the members of his tribe.  Rather he ordered them to kill ‘Abdullaah bin Khatal and his two songstresses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">These are just two examples of how the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) dealt with those who abused him in his lifetime.   He was aadil (just), and was saabir (patient) &#8211; (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  He did not oppress and was not unjust, and these people cursed him, abused him, mocked him, and insulted him <strong>during his lifetime</strong> &#8211; (صلى الله عليه وسلم)!!   So where are the actions of the jamaa’aat (political groups and parties) and the ignorant folk who’ve been affected by them from the actions and example of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم)?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Where do you find that the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his Companions went to another town and protested, or that they murdered the innocent, or destroyed or burnt their property to the ground because of what the likes of Ibn al-Ashraf and Ibn Khatal did in Makkah and al-Madeenah?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Rather he was patient and just (صلى الله عليه وسلم)!!  And ‘adl (justice) is to put everything in it’s proper place.  And what we see from these people in Egypt, Yemen, Libya, and other places in the Middle East, is oppression, injustice, and deviation from his Sunnah.  And Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“So warn those who oppose his command, lest some fitnah befall him or they afflicted with a painful punishment.”</span> </em>[3]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what further elucidates the distinction between the guidance of Muhammad (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and those Muslims who have been overtaken by emotion and misguidance, is the narration of ‘Aa’ishah (رضى الله عنها), collected by al-Bukhaaree, Muslim, Ahmad and others, when a group of Jews entered upon the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and said “as-saamu ‘alaykum” (death be upon you).  So ‘Aa’ishah (رضى الله عنها) understood what they said, so she responded:  “wa ‘alaykum as-saam wal-la’nah” (and death and curses be upon you).  So the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said:  “<em><strong>Take it easy, O ‘Aa’ishah!  Verily Allaah loves rifq (gentleness and leniency) in all matters</strong></em>.”  So ‘Aa’ishah said: “O Messenger of Allaah! Didn’t you hear what they said?” So he (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: “<em><strong>I already responded to them (by saying) ‘wa ‘alaykum’ (and upon you, too)</strong></em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Our Deen is not based on emotion.  Rather the Muslim who truly and sincerely loves Allaah and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) will stick to his guidance and his Sunnah:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#008000;"><em>“Say:  if you truly love Allaah, then follow me. (If you do) Allaah will love you and forgive you for your sins.  And Allaah is all-forgiving, most merciful.”</em></span> [4]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#993300;"><strong>Here are some points to consider and reflect upon</strong></span>:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; These protests which have spread throughout the Muslim lands, even to our beloved Kuwait, are a bid’ah, as the ‘Ulamaa’ of Ahlus-Sunnah like Shaykh Ibn Baaz, Shaykh al-Albaanee, and Shaykh Ibn ‘Uthaymeen have clarified. [5] They are an act of opposing and contending with the Muslim ruler and are from the way of the Khawaarij.  Of course the <strong>jamaa’aat as-siyaasiyyah</strong> allow them and promote them as they are means for them to contend with the Muslim rulers and reach rulership itself.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; We’ve seen how the emotionally charged youth have taken to the streets in these protests and clashed with the police, and caused damage to property &#8211; not just the property of the American Embassies &#8211; which is in itself an act of oppression &#8211; but the property of the Muslims as well!  And this is supposed to be defense of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم)??!    It cannot be that the Muslims defend the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) with oppression when Allaah has commanded us with justice (‘adl):</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“O you who believe! Stand out firmly for Allaah and be just witnesses and don’t let the enmity and hatred of a people keep you from being just. Be just! That is closer to Taqwaa.”</span></em> [6]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>al-Haafith Ibn Katheer</strong> said:  “Don’t let hatred for a people cause you to abandon justice towards them.  Rather exercise justice with everyone, whether it be a close friend or an enemy.”</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykhul-Islaam Ibn Taymiyyah</strong>:  “for indeed the people did not dispute in the fact that the end result of thulm (oppression and injustice) is evil and harmful, and the end result of ‘adl (justice) is good and noble.  And for this it has been said:  Allaah will aid the nation that is just, even if it is a disbelieving nation, and He will not aid the nation that is unjust and oppressive, even if it is a believing nation.”  [Majmoo’ al-Fataawaa (28/63)]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Then know that punishing others for the crimes and offenses of another is not justice!  Allaah says:<br />
<span style="color:#008000;"><em>“No person earns any (sin) except against himself (only), and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.”</em> </span>[7]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; The jamaa’aat as-siyaasiyyah use these protests and these types of events as a forum and a podium to spread their doubts and their conspiracy theories amongst the people and to turn them against their rulers.  They spout out anti-American, anti-western, and anti-Israeli rhetoric and place the blame for the destruction we’ve seen over the past few days on everyone but themselves.  ‘Ali al-Deqbas,  head of the Arab Parliament, actually blamed “international Zionism of being behind the unrest and inciting sedition and hatred of Islam and Muslims in the Middle East in favor of the Zionist entity”.  And the misguided statements like this are many.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; These protests – which as the ‘Ulamaa’ have said is a bid’ah – were used as a cover for those upon the manhaj of the Khawaarij to murder a U.S. ambassador and three other members of his staff, the murder of non-Muslims who were given amn (an assurance of safety and protection) and were from a country that has treaties and agreements with the government of Libya.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) said: “Whoever – from the Muslims &#8211; kills a person who is under an agreement or treaty (with the Muslims), he will not smell the Fragrance of Jannah, even though it’s fragrance can be smelled from the distance of 40 years away.” [al-Bukhaaree]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And in another narration he said:  &#8220;The assurance of protection of the Muslims is one, so whoever betrays the assurance of protection and safety of another Muslim, then upon him is the curse of Allaah, and (the curse) of the Angels, and (the curse) of all the people.&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">al-Haafidh Ibn Hajr (رحمه الله) explained:  &#8220;His saying &#8216;The assurance of protection of the Muslims is one&#8217;, means that their giving an assurance of safety and security is correct (and binding).  So if one of them gives amn to a kaafir, then it is haraam upon anyone else to harm him…&#8221;</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Those non-Muslims who live and work in the Muslim countries have been given <span style="color:#808000;"><a href="http://wp.me/p1VJ3-1tC" target="_blank"><span style="color:#808000;">amn (an assurance of safety and protection)</span></a></span>, so by attacking them is contending with and opposing the Muslim ruler, and is an act of treachery and oppression.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shaykh Taariq as-Subay’ee</strong> explained that if even one of the Muslims gives amn to a non-Muslim, even if that Muslim is a man or a woman, a free man or a slave, and even if that is by a gesture, or if a person is given amn by the authorities of a Muslim land through diplomatic agreements or by giving him a visa to enter that land – that person has an assurance of safety and protection from every Muslim.  It is totally haraam for any Muslim to harm him. And the person, &#8211; the Muslim -, who does, falls under the curse of Allaah, the Angels, and all of the people.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211; Look to those at the head of these protests and you’ll see that all of them are from the heads and supporters of the jamaa’aat as-siyaasiyyah.  And the fact that none of the ‘Ulamaa’ of Ahlus-Sunnah have anything to do with this should be another sign for the person of intellect, just as Ibn ‘Abbaas (رضى الله تعالى عنهما) brought as a proof against the Khawaarij the fact that none of the Companions were with them, when he said (رضى الله عنهما): Indeed I’ve come to you from the Companions of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and there is not a single one of them with you!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">&#8211;  We see the Muslims protesting, fighting with the police, destroying property and other than that, all in the name of defending the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) from this film produced by a man living in America.  <span style="color:#ff9900;">What is amazing is that no one is upset over the masaajid that have graves in them where other than Allaah are worshipped besides Allaah, like the masjid of al-Badawee, Zaynab, or al-Hussayn?!</span>  The greatest sin that one can commit is committed in the lands of the Muslims, and the people are tearing down the American embassy over something they don’t have the authority or ability to do anything about?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Allaah said:</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><em><span style="color:#008000;">“Verily, Allaah does not forgive that partners should be set up with him in worship (shirk), but He forgives what is less than that (from sins) for whomever He wills, and whoever sets up partners with Allaah in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin.” </span></em> [8]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So these Muslims and these jamaa’aat want to defend Prophet Muhammad(صلى الله عليه وسلم) – by committing oppression and injustice – but where is the defense of Allaah and His Tawheed from the shirk committed by muslims in the lands of the muslims themselves?!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">So know that Allaah (تبارك و تعالى) has commanded us with patience and justice, and forbidden us from injustice and oppression.  And there is no justice in the actions we see from our brothers and sisters in Egypt, Yemen, Tunisia, Morocco, Sudan, and the other countries that this is happening in.  Rather what we see is ignorance, oppression, misguidance, and deviation from the Sunnah of Allaah’s Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم).</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">And what benefit have they brought about?</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">The producer of this shoddy film lives in America, and America is a country that has it’s own laws that it governs it’s citizens by.  And America also has treaties and agreements with almost all of these lands that their embassies are being attacked in, proven by the fact that they have embassies there to begin with.  So then this affair is not in the hands of us common folk, and we don’t have the capability to do anything about it.  What is upon us then is to be patient and cling to the Sunnah of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  And this is a better defense of the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) than what we see from the jamaa’aat and those infected by them!</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#ff9900;">And it is important to note that our patience and our clinging to the Sunnah during situations like this, when we don’t have the ability to change them, is not a sign of weakness or deficiency.  Rather it is the people of misguidance from the jamaa’aat as-siyaasiyyah that have duped our youth into thinking that not having the ability to act is the same as not acting, and this is misguidance and deception.</span></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">Ibn Mas’ood narrated that the Prophet (صلى الله عليه وسلم) was praying by the Ka’bah, and when he went into sajdah, one of the companions of Aboo Jahl put the entrails of a camel on the Prophet’s back (صلى الله عليه وسلم) while Ibn Mas’ood looked on.  And Ibn Mas’ood said:  “I was watching but couldn’t do anything about it. If only I had the strength and ability (to stop them).” [al-Bukhaaree]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">This shows us that in situations when we don’t have the capability to act, due to physical weakness, lack of strength or capability, or there being something else that prevents us from doing that, there is no shame or deficiency in that, just as the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) himself could not aid Yaasir, ‘Ammaar, and Umm ‘Ammaar (رضى الله تعالى عنهم) when he saw them being tortured for their Eemaan in Allaah.  So he said to them (صلى الله عليه وسلم):  “Patience, O Aal-Yaasir (O family of Yaasir)! For indeed you’ve been promised Jannah.”  [9]</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>What we’ve written here is not a defense of this film</strong>.  We find it just as offensive, appalling, and insulting as everyone else.  Nor is it a defense of America, Israel, or any other country.  Rather it is meant to be a defense of the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) and our Deen from those who go beyond the bounds, and those who play on the emotions of the Muslims and the emotional, disenfranchised youth, and call them to deviation and misguidance.  It is a call to patience, justice, and sticking to the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم).  And this what was needed to be said and clarified.  And Allaah knows best.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align:justify;">‘Ubaadah bin as-Saamit narrated:  “The Messenger of Allaah (صلى الله عليه وسلم) took an oath of allegiance from us to listen and obey (the ruler) in adversity and prosperity, in pleasure and displeasure (and even) when somebody is given preference over us, and to not dispute or contend the authority of those it belongs to, and that we speak the truth wherever we may be without fearing in the matter of Allaah the blame of the blamer.” [10]</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, and upon his family and his Companions, one and all.  And All praise and thanks are due to Allaah, Lord of al-&#8216;Aalameen.</p>
